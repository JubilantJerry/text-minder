Great scam.

Delicious lunch, Mr. and Mrs. Z.
Can I help with the dishes?
You relax.
I'll just put them in the machine.
I don't get it.
Why would she put dirty plates in the drying rack?
That's just it, Eddie.
It's not a drying rack.
It's a dishwasher.
You mean the thing we put our dishes in after we wash them in the sink?
The drying rack.
Darn it, Edwyn!
That's what I'm telling you!
It's a machine that washes the dishes for you.
With jets of water that shoot on the plates.
I'm sorry.
I get emotional just thinking about it.
The one at Zack's house looks just like it.
Only it had buttons.
Is that tape?

What are you boys doing?
We've had a dishwasher this whole time?
Why haven't we been using it?
Because this family doesn't believe in dishwashers.
It was there when we moved in.
We'll never use it.
Why not?
Because it's wasteful.
It makes you soft, and it's hard on the dishware.
Chinese people respect their nice plates.

It's so glamorous.
What do you call these things?
Uh, lights.
Lights.
Okay, settle down.
Oh. "The On-Gun"?
It's "The Un-Gun." It's a Salad Shooter for onions.
Oh.
Well, why not call it "The Gunion"?
Hey, mister, wh-where were you during our three-day creative retreat, huh?
It took you three days to come up with On-Gun?
A lot of it was, uh, you know, like, volleyball.
Oh.

Eddie, I specifically told you not to use the dishwasher.

- Then why are the plates warm?
It's Florida.
Everything's warm.
Okay.
Maybe someone used the dishwasher, but it wasn't me.
I wash dishes by hand, the stupid way.
Let me see your hands.
If your fingers look like raisins,
I'll know you're telling the truth.
They were wrinkly before, but they plumped already.
I know what's going on here...
I'm being profiled!
Profiled?
Every time something bad happens, you assume I'm the one who did it.
I'm a victim of institutional bias.
What?
How do you know these words?
Oh, I can't know things?
!
Another assumption.
No allowance, three weeks.
I'm not paying you to do chores that a machine is doing for you.
But I was saving up to buy an N64 and play "GoldenEye" the day it comes out.
Oddjob's gonna bust a cap in some fools.
Hearing what you want to do with that money only makes me know I'm doing the right thing.
You're stressing me out.
I need to eat.
Okay, Louis, are you ready to eat some salad?
Call me the Titanic, 'cause I'm about to tear into some iceberg.
Great.
So, for this first shot, Tony's gonna demonstrate the Un-Gun.
And then he'll ask, "And how does it work on those salads?"
At which point, we will pan over to you, and you're gonna say your line, which is,
"Onions, shallots, scallions...
It does it all!"
And then you eat some salad.
Got it.
Hey, um, that thing I said about the Titanic earlier,
I didn't mean to offend anyone.
That was a huge tragedy.
All right.
Places everyone!
Here we go.
Hi, Dad.
I just wanted to wish you good luck.
Uhp.
In showbiz, we say "break a leg."
Wishing someone good luck is actually bad luck.
- Good to know.
- Hmm.
I'm surprised how calm you are.
If I were in your shoes, I'd be so nervous.
Nervous?
Why?
This infomercial is gonna be seen by hundreds of people, every one of them dissecting your performance, wondering, "Why this guy?
Why does he get to be the Salad Eater?"
It's like they're setting you up for failure.
Okay.
Break all your legs!
And let's roll cameras.
Rolling.
And... action!
The Un-Gun.
It's so easy, the only thing you'll be crying about is not getting one sooner.
And how does it work on that salad?
Onions, shallions, scallots...
It does all of them!
Okay, cut.
How was that?
Uh, you just mixed up some of the words.
The line is, "Onions, shallots, scallions...
It does it all."
What did I say?
You said something different, but it doesn't matter.
Let's do it again.
Let's, uh, roll camera.
Rolling.
And... action!
And how does it work on that salad?
Onions, shillions, skillets...
It does them all!
Cut.
Onions, shallots, sicillians...
It does them all!
Okay, cut.
Onions, garlic, galleons...
It does them all!
Onions, onions, onions...
And cut.
Cut, cut, cut.
Onions, onions.
Louis.
What?
Onions, scallions, shallots.
It do...
"It do."
Onions, scallions, shallots...
It does them all!
Oh!
I'm supposed to eat after the line.
Sorry.
Onions, shallions...
Kyle, you're in the sho...
Onions, shal...
Oop!
Oh, I got dressing on my sleeve.
Onions, shallots, scallions.
Line?
Cut.
Forget it.
Louis, I'm so tired.
Good tea.
Why are you whispering?
I'm saving my voice for the infomercial tomorrow.
You're not done yet?
You were there till midnight.
I had a little trouble getting the line.
But they said it was no big deal.
We just have to shoot again tomorrow.
Which means an extra day of location fees.
You okay?
I thought you would be excited about that.
I'm just worried about Eddie.
What's wrong?
Today I told him not to use the dishwasher, and he did it anyway.
We have a dishwasher?
Then he has the nerve to look me in the eye and lie about it.
Hmm.
Eddie has always been... colorful, but I'm just starting to worry.
Are we raising a bad kid?
No way.
Eddie's got a good heart.
He's probably just excited to try out the machine, which apparently we have.
You're probably right.
Don't worry.
He'll be fine.
Could you yell at my mom to turn on her side?
I'd do it, but... my instrument.
That dishwasher should never have been connected in the first place.
Who knows how much water has been wasted dripping into those hoses?
It must have cost us a fortune in drips.
You know who's a drip?
Ziggy.
It's like, "Put on some pants."
There.
You now have a nonfunctioning dishwasher.
Thank you.
Now this machine won't make us soft.
_
Hello?
What?
!
Where's the manager?
Where is he?
!
Who?
My son!
You called and said you caught him shoplifting.
Uh, that... that wasn't me.
Isn't this Razorshank Records?
It is.
We have another location in the mall.
You need to be clearer on the phone.
And you are in big trouble.
Razorshank Records...
Mall location.
And that's when I found this CD tucked into his waistband.
Eddie, what were you thinking?
I know what he wasn't thinking...
All stolen merchandise comes out of Howie's paycheck.
But you know who does think about that?
Howie.
Howie thinks about it all the time.
I'm Howie, if that wasn't clear.
I swear, I didn't steal that CD!
I brought it from home.
This place buys used CDs, and since you took away my allowance,
I was gonna sell my old "Street Fighter" soundtrack
- for some extra skrill.
- Oh, really?
If you weren't stealing, then why was this tucked into your waistband?
Because my pockets were full of Runts candy.
Okay.
Let's see this candy.
I ate it on the way over here.
That's what they're for.
They're my traveling Runts.
You even ate the bananas?
Yeah, right.
Howie, I am so sorry about all of this.
He's gonna be in big trouble when he gets home.
Oh, he's going to jail.
What?
It's corporate policy to prosecute shoplifters to the fullest extent of the law.
Corporate policy?
Your logo is a man slapping a cop!
Maybe there's a bee on his face.
We see what we want to see.
Red leather, yellow leather.
La, la, la, la, la, la.
Hey.
Hey, Dad.
Emery, I've been practicing all morning and I think I finally got it.
Onions, shallots, scallions...
It does them...
Yeah, about that.
I've got bad news.
They want someone else to play the Salad Eater.
What?
Who?
Emery, we're ready for you.
You're the new Salad Eater?
I happened to be walking by and heard them saying they were gonna recast you.
Then the director looked at me through his fingers, and next thing I knew, I had the part.
That doesn't even make sense.
Kids hate salad.
Not Danny Winterbottom.
Who's Danny Winterbottom?
My character.
He loves salad because he was raised on a lettuce farm.
Growing up, his mom would give him salad as a treat.
Oh, I see what's going on here.
Making me nervous about being on TV, wishing me luck.
You were sabotaging me from the start.
I don't feel bad.
When I found out what the lights were,
I knew I wanted to be in front of them.
Sorry, Dad.
It's "infomercial," not "friend-mercial."
Sorry how this all went down.
Please accept this consolation bobblehead.
We're both sorry.
Aren't we, little Tony?
Yeah.
Do you really think if I were to steal a CD, it would be the "Street Fighter" soundtrack?
"Makaveli" just came out.
"Life After Death" just came out.
Why would I shoplift a two-year-old soundtrack from a movie about a video game?
You'd be amazed at what people try to steal.
Last week, my mom made us snickerdoodles to celebrate the end of Lent.
Gone.
Boss, the new Spice Girls CD isn't ringing up.
The line out front has gone from Baby to Scary.
Excuse me.
I have to deal with this.
Don't go anywhere.
I can't believe you stole.
- I told you, I'm not a thief.
- That's what you say.
But after what happened with the dishwasher, how can I believe you?
All right.
I admit it.
I used the dishwasher.
Aha!
And I did lie about it, but I didn't steal the CD.
That's the truth.
I knew it.
I knew you were lying all along, about the dishwasher, eating my papaya.
Oh, I didn't eat your papaya.
Papayas are gross.
Those slimy black seeds?
Ugh!
Hard pass.
Well, if you didn't eat my papaya, who did?
I don't want to say.
Eddie, tell me!
I can't.
I live by a code.
Howie, put him in jail!
Fine.
It was Evan.
Evan?
Really?
It wasn't his fault.
He didn't mean to eat your breakfast.
He just has a weakness for tropical fruit.
He also has a clean record, so I took the fall for him.
I mean, what's another papaya on my rap sheet?
You mean you sat and watched me eat your Irish elf cereal just so your little brother wouldn't get into trouble?
Yeah.
Of course.
Uh, Mom, are you okay?
I'm proud of you, Eddie.
Really?
So you're not mad that I lied?
No, I'm not mad.
So, you're saying sometimes it's good to lie?
No.
Don't make me mad again.
You lied about us having a dishwasher.
Isn't that hypocritical?
Eddie, there is something called a "white lie."
And that is a lie that protects you from all the things that make white people soft.
Emery, you were here yesterday, so you know what we're going for.
Yep.
I got it.
Okay.
Let's roll!
An Asian boy named Winterbottom.
Okay, sure, all right.
And... action!
The Un-Gun is so easy to use, the only thing you'll be crying about is not getting one sooner.
And how does it work on that salad?
Onions, shallots, scallions...
It does them all!
Yeah, great, but can you do it without all the blinking?
What blinking?
Cut.
Dustin, could you get me a hot tea and six cyanide capsules?
Uh, let me talk to him.
Dad, did you see the blinking they were talking about?
Do you think the camera's picking it up?
Yeah, I do.
I guess I'm more nervous than I thought I'd be.
It's okay.
You can do this.
Yes, I was a little upset when I heard about the recast, but if it can't be me, I'm happy it's you.
Salad Eater is the second role you were born to play.
What was the first?
Fantastic son.
Thanks, Dad.
I understand now.
You're trying to throw me off my game, make me think my mediocre performance is fine so I don't strive to be the best.
Well, it's not going to work.
What?
No...
Get out of my eyeline.
Let's shoot this thing!
Well, that Spice Girls line was a total nightmare.
A lot more middle-aged men than I thought.
Where were we?
Oh, right.
I was just about to press charges against your boy.
You will do no such thing.
I believe my son.
He didn't steal that CD.
Well, that's nice you believe him, but there's still no way of knowing whether the CD is really his or if he stole it.
I'm gonna call the police.
16 seconds!
What?
That's the exact moment it skips on track 8.
I know that because it's my CD.
What have we here?
A boom-boom box.
Play it.
I have to fast-forward a bit.
Hold down the right arrow button.
Hold it down.
I'm doing it.
There!

You need to make this right.
How would I do that?
You're gonna buy back his music disc at full price.
Or else I will tell everyone that your store profiles Asians.
Institutional bias.
But it's a "Street Fighter" soundtrack from two years ago, a-and it skips.
No one's gonna buy it.
Eddie, what's that sound like to you?
Not our problem.
Fine.
Who pays for it?
Howie does.
Always Howie.
They said the infomercial will air sometime between 3:00 and 6:00 a.m.
Mom, will you pass the popcorn?
You're hungry?
I'm surprised you're not full of papaya.
I said I was sorry.
Can't a boy have a hankering?
I can't believe you're gonna be on TV, Emery.

I'm glad somebody's happy about it.
I told you, I wasn't trying to sabotage you.
Hmm.

At which point, we will pan over to you, and you're gonna say your line, which is,
"Onions, shallots, scallions...
It does it all!"
And then you eat some salad.
Got it. [Chuckles]
Hey, um, that thing I said about the Titanic earlier,
I didn't mean to offend anyone.
That was a huge tragedy.
All right.
Places everyone!
Here we go.
Hi, Dad.
I just wanted to wish you good luck.
Uhp.
In showbiz, we say "break a leg."
Wishing someone good luck is actually bad luck.
- Good to know.
- Hmm.
I'm surprised how calm you are.
If I were in your shoes, I'd be so nervous.
Nervous?
Why?
This infomercial is gonna be seen by hundreds of people, every one of them dissecting your performance, wondering, "Why this guy?
Why does he get to be the Salad Eater?"
It's like they're setting you up for failure.
Okay.
Break all your legs!
Reggie:
And let's roll cameras.
Man:
Rolling.
Reggie:
And... action!
The Un-Gun.
It's so easy, the only thing you'll be crying about is not getting one sooner.
[Laughs] [Motor whirs]
And how does it work on that salad?
Onions, shallions, scallots...
It does all of them!
Okay, cut. [Bell rings]
[Chuckles] How was that?
Uh, you just mixed up some of the words.
The line is, "Onions, shallots, scallions...
It does it all."
What did I say?
You said something different, but it doesn't matter.
Let's do it again.
Let's, uh, roll camera.
Man:
Rolling.
And... action!
And how does it work on that salad?
Onions, shillions, skillets...
It does them all!
Cut.
Onions, shallots, sicillians...
It does them all!
Okay, cut.
Onions, garlic, galleons...
It does them all!
Onions, onions, onions...
And cut.
Cut, cut, cut.
Onions, onions.
Louis.
What?
Onions, scallions, shallots.
It do...
[Laughs] "It do."
[Muffled] Onions, scallions, shallots...
It does them all!
Oh!
I'm supposed to eat after the line.
Sorry.
Onions, shallions...
Kyle, you're in the sho...
Onions, shal...
Oop!
Oh, I got dressing on my sleeve.
Onions, shallots, scallions.
Line?
Cut.
Forget it.
Louis, I'm so tired.
[Sighs]
[Whispers] Good tea.
Why are you whispering?
I'm saving my voice for the infomercial tomorrow.
You're not done yet?
You were there till midnight.
[Normal voice] I had a little trouble getting the line.
But they said it was no big deal.
We just have to shoot again tomorrow.
Which means an extra day of location fees.
You okay?
I thought you would be excited about that.
I'm just worried about Eddie.
What's wrong?
Today I told him not to use the dishwasher, and he did it anyway.
We have a dishwasher?
Then he has the nerve to look me in the eye and lie about it.
Hmm.
Eddie has always been... colorful, but I'm just starting to worry.
Are we raising a bad kid?
[Sighs] No way.
Eddie's got a good heart.
He's probably just excited to try out the machine, which apparently we have.
You're probably right.
Don't worry.
He'll be fine.
[Grandma Huang snoring]
[Whispering] Could you yell at my mom to turn on her side?
I'd do it, but... my instrument.
That dishwasher should never have been connected in the first place.
Who knows how much water has been wasted dripping into those hoses?
It must have cost us a fortune in drips.
You know who's a drip?
Ziggy.
It's like, "Put on some pants."
There.
You now have a nonfunctioning dishwasher.
Thank you.
Now this machine won't make us soft.
_
[Telephone rings]
Hello?
What?
!
Where's the manager?
[Door opens]
Where is he?
!
Who?
My son!
You called and said you caught him shoplifting.
Uh, that... that wasn't me.
Isn't this Razorshank Records?
It is.
We have another location in the mall.
[Sighs]
You need to be clearer on the phone.
And you are in big trouble.
[Telephone rings]
Razorshank Records...
Mall location.
And that's when I found this CD tucked into his waistband.
Eddie, what were you thinking?
I know what he wasn't thinking...
All stolen merchandise comes out of Howie's paycheck.
But you know who does think about that?
Howie.
Howie thinks about it all the time.
I'm Howie, if that wasn't clear.
I swear, I didn't steal that CD!
I brought it from home.
This place buys used CDs, and since you took away my allowance,
I was gonna sell my old "Street Fighter" soundtrack
- for some extra skrill.
- Oh, really?
If you weren't stealing, then why was this tucked into your waistband?
Because my pockets were full of Runts candy.
Okay.
Let's see this candy.
I ate it on the way over here.
That's what they're for.
They're my traveling Runts.
You even ate the bananas?
Yeah, right.
Howie, I am so sorry about all of this.
He's gonna be in big trouble when he gets home.
Oh, he's going to jail.
What?
It's corporate policy to prosecute shoplifters to the fullest extent of the law.
Corporate policy?
Your logo is a man slapping a cop!
Maybe there's a bee on his face.
We see what we want to see.
Red leather, yellow leather.
La, la, la, la, la, la.
Hey.
Hey, Dad.
Emery, I've been practicing all morning and I think I finally got it.
Onions, shallots, scallions...
It does them...
Yeah, about that.
I've got bad news.
They want someone else to play the Salad Eater.
What?
Who?
Emery, we're ready for you.
You're the new Salad Eater?
I happened to be walking by and heard them saying they were gonna recast you.
Then the director looked at me through his fingers, and next thing I knew, I had the part.
That doesn't even make sense.
Kids hate salad.
Not Danny Winterbottom.
Who's Danny Winterbottom?
My character.
He loves salad because he was raised on a lettuce farm.
Growing up, his mom would give him salad as a treat.
Oh, I see what's going on here.
Making me nervous about being on TV, wishing me luck.
You were sabotaging me from the start.
I don't feel bad.
When I found out what the lights were,
I knew I wanted to be in front of them.
Sorry, Dad.
It's "infomercial," not "friend-mercial."
Sorry how this all went down.
Please accept this consolation bobblehead.
We're both sorry.
Aren't we, little Tony?
Yeah.
Do you really think if I were to steal a CD, it would be the "Street Fighter" soundtrack?
"Makaveli" just came out.
"Life After Death" just came out.
Why would I shoplift a two-year-old soundtrack from a movie about a video game?
You'd be amazed at what people try to steal.
Last week, my mom made us snickerdoodles to celebrate the end of Lent.
Gone.
Boss, the new Spice Girls CD isn't ringing up.
The line out front has gone from Baby to Scary.
Excuse me.
I have to deal with this.
Don't go anywhere.
I can't believe you stole.
- I told you, I'm not a thief.
- That's what you say.
But after what happened with the dishwasher, how can I believe you?
[Sighs]
All right.
I admit it.
I used the dishwasher.
Aha!
And I did lie about it, but I didn't steal the CD.
That's the truth.
I knew it.
I knew you were lying all along, about the dishwasher, eating my papaya.
Oh, I didn't eat your papaya.
Papayas are gross.
Those slimy black seeds?
Ugh!
Hard pass.
Well, if you didn't eat my papaya, who did?
I don't want to say.
Eddie, tell me!
I can't.
I live by a code.
Howie, put him in jail!
Fine.
It was Evan.
Evan?
Really?
It wasn't his fault.
He didn't mean to eat your breakfast.
He just has a weakness for tropical fruit.
He also has a clean record, so I took the fall for him.
I mean, what's another papaya on my rap sheet?
You mean you sat and watched me eat your Irish elf cereal just so your little brother wouldn't get into trouble?
Yeah.
Of course.
Uh, Mom, are you okay?
[Chuckles]
I'm proud of you, Eddie.
Really?
So you're not mad that I lied?
No, I'm not mad.
So, you're saying sometimes it's good to lie?
No.
Don't make me mad again.
You lied about us having a dishwasher.
Isn't that hypocritical?
Eddie, there is something called a "white lie."
And that is a lie that protects you from all the things that make white people soft.
Emery, you were here yesterday, so you know what we're going for.
Yep.
I got it.
Okay.
Let's roll!
An Asian boy named Winterbottom.
Okay, sure, all right.
And... action!
The Un-Gun is so easy to use, the only thing you'll be crying about is not getting one sooner.
[Motor whirs]
And how does it work on that salad?
Onions, shallots, scallions...
It does them all!
Yeah, great, but can you do it without all the blinking?
What blinking?
Cut. [Bell rings]
Dustin, could you get me a hot tea and six cyanide capsules?
Uh, let me talk to him.
Dad, did you see the blinking they were talking about?
Do you think the camera's picking it up?
Yeah, I do.
I guess I'm more nervous than I thought I'd be.
It's okay.
You can do this.
Yes, I was a little upset when I heard about the recast, but if it can't be me, I'm happy it's you.
Salad Eater is the second role you were born to play.
What was the first?
Fantastic son.
Thanks, Dad.
I understand now.
You're trying to throw me off my game, make me think my mediocre performance is fine so I don't strive to be the best.
Well, it's not going to work.
What?
No...
Get out of my eyeline.
Let's shoot this thing!
[Sighs]
Well, that Spice Girls line was a total nightmare.
A lot more middle-aged men than I thought. [Chuckles]
Where were we?
Oh, right.
I was just about to press charges against your boy.
You will do no such thing.
I believe my son.
He didn't steal that CD.
Well, that's nice you believe him, but there's still no way of knowing whether the CD is really his or if he stole it.
I'm gonna call the police.
16 seconds!
What?
That's the exact moment it skips on track 8.
I know that because it's my CD.
What have we here?
A boom-boom box.
Play it.
I have to fast-forward a bit.
Hold down the right arrow button.
Hold it down.
I'm doing it.
There!
There.
♪ Mechanical mix flows ♪
♪ Competition in my dojo ♪
♪ In my dojo ♪
♪ In my dojo ♪
If the CD skips, you must acquit.
I guess it is yours.
My mistake.
"My mistake"?
That's it?
You falsely accused my son of being a thief!
You need to make this right.
How would I do that?
You're gonna buy back his music disc at full price.
Or else I will tell everyone that your store profiles Asians.
Institutional bias.
But it's a "Street Fighter" soundtrack from two years ago, a-and it skips.
No one's gonna buy it.
Eddie, what's that sound like to you?
Not our problem.
Fine.
Who pays for it?
Howie does.
Always Howie.
♪ Yeah ♪
They said the infomercial will air sometime between 3:00 and 6:00 a.m.
Mom, will you pass the popcorn?
You're hungry?
I'm surprised you're not full of papaya.
I said I was sorry.
Can't a boy have a hankering?
I can't believe you're gonna be on TV, Emery.
Thanks, Eddie.
I'm glad somebody's happy about it.
[Sighs] I told you, I wasn't trying to sabotage you.
Hmm.
Finally, some good acting.
_
Announcer:
Tired of chopped onions turning you into a whiny crybaby?
[ Baby cries]
Are you a dumb idiot, wasting everyone's time and money, cutting onions the old-fashioned way?
Uh, duh.
Presenting a better way.
Hi.
Tony Wonder here with a miracle machine that makes chopping onions as easy as pulling the trigger.
It's called...
"The Gunion."
They stole my name!
_
[Laughs]
Look at these.
You know these people.
We're being hunted by police.
That boy you found me was a good one.
Keep it up.
They'll give us money if we take direct action in support of their movement.
Man, you all getting too damn hot!
If someone doesn't fill this void quick, your ex is gonna get us all dragged along.
My daughter knows she has a right to be British.
- They'll kill her, Savi.
- We have friends.
We can't go to our friends, they're being watched.
You shouldn't push him.
You shouldn't have killed my boyfriend.
- Who was that?
- No one.
It's not no one.
He's going to get fixed, with or without your help.
What happened?
You wanted me to do something.
I did.
- No!
- (Gunshot)
(Siren)
_
_
(Birdsong)
(FREIDRICH) This is what we're offering.
And this is what you will accept.
You're to receive a stipend of £20 a month, every month.
You will also be paid an operation fee of £10...
- Ten?
- ..for every successful action
- you undertake.
- No.
£25 if it is a mutually agreed upon target.
No.
- It's a generous subsidy.
- It's shit.
- (MARCUS) Let him finish.
- £50 a month.
Minimum.
We need materials, guns.
We need a safe house.
We can't stay where we are.
You don't have a designation yet.
You don't even have a manifesto.
As a movement, you have no profile in revolutionary circles.
She has no perspective of your own worth.
You don't understand our value.
We liberated a political prisoner, we executed an action against the Rhodesian Mission.
For your own gain, not for the furtherance of Marxist objectives.
- (Speaks German)
- What did he say?
- What the fuck did he say?
- Look, stick to our original agreement.
ZANLA fights Rhodesia.
ZANLA is Communist.
ZANLA is Maoist, not Marxist.
Don't lump us together.
If you can't distinguish our philosophies, then you're no good to us.
Man, this is bullshit.
You all keep talking but you ain't saying nothing.
We're talking about the origins of the struggle.
It should be of interest to you.
You literally wrote the book.
We've done more in our first month than you've done in the last six.
We're an asset.
£50 a month and a safe house and as far as I care, that's still cheap.
I need certain approvals.
Talk to who you need to - the Stasi, Central Committee, whoever runs you.
We'll wait.
(Door opens)
(Door closes)
(LEROY) So what's the buzz?
(DHARI) Nothing.
What's that mean?
It means we're not getting anything from them.
(Sucks teeth)
Wasting our time, man.
These motherfuckers talking their Commie bullshit.
What the fuck did Commies ever do for us, huh?
These punks wouldn't last a hot second in Newark.
Not a hot, motherfucking second.
Rich, white kids.
Only thing they know about Huey or Eldridge is from wearing them on a T-shirt.
Are you listening?
'Should have taken what was offered.
I had an understanding with them.
20?
£20?
They showed you the short end of the stick and you took it.
It's not just the money.
We need allies.
Whatever you thought you had worked out, that's what they pay the hired help.
The action against the Rhodesians was serious.
We need to be taken seriously.
What happened with the Rhodesians?
Target of opportunity.
How did you get an opportunity?
You left Leroy's.
Where were you going?
I was weeks in that flat.
- I needed to get out.
- Where were you?
Is this an interrogation?
You came back to me that night a wreck.
You didn't tell me what happened.
You didn't say a word.
Right, fine, you needed me there and I was there.
I needed some space for me too.
I wasn't gonna go out without protection so I took the gun and I went and...
I wasn't going anywhere.
I just needed to be somewhere else.
- That was a long way...
- Then things happened.
...from Leroy's flat.
They happened how they did.
And I took advantage of the situation.
Let me see.
I'm fine.
I got lucky.
I almost killed someone when we broke Dhari out of prison.
We can't devolve into violence.
- Nobody died when I went...
- That's not the point.
The point is, we're soldiers and soldiers fight.
Symbolic action, not murder.
You understand?
(Door opens)
Let's talk.
Not you, him.
Whatever you need to discuss, you can...
Let us talk.
- They got anything to say?
- I wouldn't know.
Man, I don't know why we're going through all this shit.
You had the right idea, just get some guns, put some motherfuckers against the wall.
Have a good chat?
When you rub them wrong, when someone's trying to help...
- What's the offer?
- £25 a month.
And £50 for any mutually agreed upon action.
- Materials?
- But no weapons.
No guns?
They'll give us a tape recorder.
A tape recorder?
What about some motherfucking guns?
We need to record a communique.
We build support through awareness.
- Ah, shit.
- What else?
They'll put us in a safe house.
You, me and Dhari.
- What about me?
- You've got a place.
Hold up.
I'm part of this.
I ain't getting pushed off now just 'cause you say.
Look, we need someone who can hide in plain sight, who can move, who can communicate.
You're our connection to the above ground.
You come under with us, we lose that.
You okay with all this?
Does it matter?
You took the deal.
Where's Dhari?
(Birdsong)
(Dog barks in distance)
(Dhari grunts)
(Rustling)
(Footsteps ascending)
And that was drawn from a description a witness gave of the shooter at the Rhodesian Mission.
It's your daughter, isn't it?
She's gonna kill or be killed.
That's all that's waiting for her.
Now, your girl, she's young.
She got caught up with the wrong bunch.
Young kids.
Wrong influences.
They end up doing wrong things.
She just needs to have some sense talked into her.
You can do that.
And we can get you on television, on radio.
Have you talk sense.
We're doing the same with Marcus's parents.
Asking them to appeal to their boy to do right.
What is right?
Giving herself up while she can.
(Clock ticking)
Your daughter's an enemy of the state and if you're helping her that makes you an enemy non-patrial.
I can have you sent right back where you came from.
Now, they'll toss you in a hole next to the bastard what fathered your bitch.
Where is that accent from?
You're not English.
Afrikaner?
Are you a Rhodey yourself?
Sad.
People always did look at you Boers as being the hayseeds up the Empire's back end.
Fighting a war you know you can't win.
And all this talk about the Immigration Act.
The unclean and the unworthy.
Must hurt, knowing they're not just talking about us.
They're talking about you.
(Clock ticking)
We come round, we try and be reasonable with you.
Try to get you to be correct.
For your daughter's sake, we do that.
But I'm not obligated to give a shit if your girl gets hauled in.
Or shot up.
(Door opens)
(Door closes)
Put an extra couple of men on this place.
I want it watched day and night.
And I want her to know it.
It's not working.
Their friends, their family, the harder you push them, the harder they push back.
If you don't have the guts for this...
Threats and violence don't work in Rhodesia.
What makes you think it's gonna work here?
A month and nothing to show.
They're getting ready to take this away from us.
Who?
C-13.
These are black radicals, they're for the Black Desk to deal with.
They're not muggers and thugs, they're terrorists.
They're lucky and stupid.
Yeah, and we can't catch 'em.
That makes us look stupid too.
So we either need to get clever or let 'em be 13's problem.
Hey, whose is this?
You're not the only ones looking for safe-keeping.
They are around.
So this is the reel-to-reel.
And this will get you started.
Now what?
Well, we need to put out a communique, state our goals.
- Identify an action...
- What action?
We'll find one.
- When?
- We'll find one.
Well, this is getting nothing done.
What do you wanna do, just go and shoot some people?
Do you just wanna go back to shagging Eva Braun against a tree?
Been in jail eight years.
You're lucky I don't take you out back.
- You're not funny.
- I ain't playing.
A cool breeze gets my dick hard.
I don't care where I put it so long as it's warm and wet.
We've got work to get done.
Your son is not only a user of narcotics, he's an addict as well.
As with any disease, addiction can be treated.
What we give the patient is an aversion to his addiction by associating it not with pleasure, but with disgust.
The patient is allowed a small sample of the source of his addiction whilst simultaneously being administered a negative stimulant,
- generally an electrical charge.
- You electrocute them?
I prefer to give the patient an emetic.
A medication which induces digestive sickness... vomiting.
Typically the associated sensations, coupled with the patient having to sit with the after-effects
- of his own actions...
- How long?
The length of the treatment process depends...
No, no.
How long does he sit in his vomit?
There's no real time limit.
As long as necessary.
When can he start?
- We should talk about this.
- We could begin procedures around your schedule.
Ronnie sitting in his own vomit?
Ronnie is diseased.
You understand that?
You heard that?
If someone has cancer...
He doesn't have cancer.
He's dying.
He's killing himself.
If you care about somebody, you do something.
Can we talk about this at home?
When are you ever at home?
You...
You don't have to deal with it.
I'm left alone with his pass-outs and his episodes and...
I don't...
I don't know know what to call them.
His periods where, quite frankly, he might kill me.
Welcome to my world where I live every single day.
And I don't want to be there anymore.
Forgive me.
Forgive me if I didn't hear your answer.
We could begin treatments within the next few weeks.
Nicholas, you can discuss payments with the doctor, can't you?
(Tires screech in distance)
(Whistling)
(YOUTH) Watch out, Micky.
(Clamoring)
Micky, watch out!
(Clatter of typewriter keys)
Hey, what did you do to Connor?
- What?
- You had my brother arrested.
We didn't arrest him.
It's not enough to get me fired, you drag him off?
We didn't touch your brother.
People saw it happen.
If he got arrested, it's got nothing to do with us.
Oh, shit.
(She sighs)
Write his name.
Wait here.
I'll see what I can find out.
No, just wait.
Alright?
Your son Marcus, who's now been on the run for a week...
Hey, Marcus, come see this.
(FATHER) If that was you, that's not our son.
(INTERVIEWER) But the evidence is overwhelming.
That your son broke a convict from prison, that he shot an ambulance driver.
Our son was raised to respect people, to respect the law to be a credit to his race.
Then how do you explain what's happened?
Marcus is naive.
He got himself under the spell of this other man, this convict.
Marcus was taken advantage of.
- Just turn it off.
- Leave it on.
(MOTHER) Is it something we did?
If he were listening, what would you say to your son?
I'd tell him to stop it.
I'd tell him to grow up.
Everything good he has in life is because of what this country has given us.
- What he's doing now is...
- It's shameful.
- (Cries)
- It's shameful.
While the parents of Marcus Hill showed remorse for their son's actions, the same doesn't seem to be true of Marcus himself.
More than a month after a prison break that left two men wounded and a gun attack on the Rhodesian Mission... (TV off)
Marcus.
This is Jas and that's Dhari.
Eliette.
Take your hand out your pocket.
Take your hand out your pocket!
Connor!
Connor!
- It's alright.
- What happened?
- Just calm down.
- What happened?
Sit down.
One of your brother's friends was identified as a provisional volunteer.
He's not a volunteer!
There was a round-up, your brother got pulled in.
He doesn't have anything to do with the IRA.
- His friends do.
- Why, because you said so?
You fit up anyone you like.
Look, between his friends and yours, your brother's getting caught up.
Now, you might not give a shit, but getting Connor out just cost me favors I can't spare.
So you need to stop thinking about yourself and start thinking about what you're doing to your brother.
- You're so stupid.
- The filth did it.
They wouldn't have touched you if it hadn't been for your friends.
My friends aren't the ones.
They're doing this to me because of you and your dead black.
Stop.
Stop it!
Stop.
I need help.
- How am I...
- I've got no job.
I'm trying to do everything for the both of us.
- And you getting hauled in...
- And what do you care?
Our parents... my friends... my man...
All gone.
You're all I've got.
And it's taking everything I've got left to keep us together.
So stop pretending to be a soldier and just be my brother.
Alright?
Come on.
(Siren blares in distance)
You were staring at me.
You attacked the Rhodesian Mission.
There was a picture of you in the paper.
That was you, right?
- I'm not an informant.
- Then what?
Front De Liberation Du Quebec.
FLQ.
The FLQ disbanded.
Not the movement.
The Sixth Wave fell apart.
I didn't want to stay.
A bunch of mannish boys holed up in a basement that smelled like a shit house.
No target, no direction.
Every day they were writing up self-indulgent letters to send to the PM.
Sometimes the quality of leadership is measured by the size of cocks and if you don't have one, you're not needed in the room.
You did a job on the Rhodesian bastards.
Who's your sponsor?
The Germans, just now.
What's your cause?
Unification of people of color.
Ecumenical revolution.
I saw a friend murdered by the police.
The establishment, they...
They hang the Immigration Act over our heads and sneer at us like...
like we're lucky to be here.
Holding the filth accountable, power to the people, that's what we fight for.
So you attacked the Rhodesians?
The truth... the truth is, I...
I got lucky.
Nobody's that lucky.
- Marcus says that...
- Who's Marcus?
- I'm his girl.
Marcus...
- You're not anybody's girl.
...says that we have to...
stop just doing things.
We have to communicate our goals.
We have to plan our actions better.
A predictable attack has a predictable outcome.
With the Rhodesians, you just weren't predictable.
I don't think your man has a problem with your tactics,
I think the problem was you succeeding without him.
You hurt that in the attack?
Mm.
There are better ways.
(Knocking)
I wasn't expecting you.
These three, the convict and the two that got him out, what are you hearing?
- Nothing.
- That's not like you.
You could tease the Devil out of a pastor.
No one's loosening their lips for you?
Nobody knows where they are.
Nobody I know.
The two who got Dhari out, they aren't...
This isn't their circle.
It's all the same cloth, isn't it?
I need help on this.
Talk to whoever you need to talk to.
- I've tried.
- Go into the neighborhood.
The tea houses, the community center.
- I've tried.
- Then try again!
Soften some people up.
Trick 'em with liquor.
Climb on your back if you need to, but goddammit, I need some information.
(Sighs)
I'm getting hit from all sides here.
They want these three caught and I can't find hide or hair.
I need your ears out there.
I need...
It's turning into an embarrassment.
They wanna take me off of this.
They wanna make me look like a...
I've got my Mick of a partner running his mouth like he's so goddamn clever.
(Liquid pouring)
Had to get Ronnie to a doctor.
Drinking, drugs.
It's all getting to be too much.
Emily, she blames me for his troubles.
I'm out there pounding the street, trying to keep the order.
She blames me.
She's around the boy all day, every day, she can't take some responsibility?
No one can take any responsibility.
It's always Pence who's gotta fix what's broke.
Kaffirs running wild or my kid killing himself with a needle.
Let old Pence fix it.
You look good.
Got a caller?
A guest.
Guest?
How's the boy?
He's fine.
I don't spend enough time around him.
- Let me go say hello.
- I told you, he's sleeping.
- I won't wake him.
- No.
- Just a kiss to the cheek.
- Just leave him alone.
This guest, what's his name?
Gonna put me to the trouble of finding out?
What's his name?
Robert.
Robert?
- Smith.
- (Scoffs)
Bob Smith?
Tell you what, why don't you ring up Bob Smith?
And say what?
I don't know.
Let's see what comes to mind.
(Dialing)
Robert.
It's Kenya.
Er...
I've got something I need to tell you.
(PENCE) About a change of plans.
Something's come up.
No.
No.
I can't.
(PENCE) I've got other things to do.
I can't see you this evening, I'm...
I'm sorry.
(Robert responds)
It's none of his business.
Just... just something.
(Robert responds)
You don't know.
I don't know when, er...
I don't know when we can rearrange.
Maybe, erm...
Maybe in...
Tell him he's a bore.
Tell him he's a bore and you'll dump him.
Tell him.
(She exhales heavily)
Tell him.
Robert, we can't.
(ROBERT) Can't what?
We can't.
How's that boy of yours gonna like growing up without a mum?
You say it.
You tell this cunt... (Slams receiver down)
You don't get to own me.
(Exhales)
(Birdsong)
There's some tea in the kitchen.
I know.
Really nice.
God, they're just gonna sit there all day.
We'll go upstairs.
There are some things I can show you.
(DHARI) That one, she ain't nothing but trouble.
You hear me?
You better mind your girl.
She's getting an attitude and hanging out with this other one ain't gonna do a thing for her.
Nothing will fuck you up like a hot-headed bitch.
You need to mind how you talk about Jas.
I don't like it when you imply you'd have relations with her.
How's that wrong that Jas is worth having?
- Or that I say it to your face?
- Don't talk about her.
You and me are like brothers.
Haven't we always got on like brothers?
So what's your problem, acting all...?
Mom and Dad talked you down on the telly, saying you're under the spell of some Uga Buga Man?
I'm wise to you, boy.
You're not as sharp as you'd like to believe.
It doesn't matter what I think.
It's what other people think.
That the problem, hm?
Not so much that I could take your woman, that I took your words.
You didn't take anything.
I gave my words.
I'm the one who gave you your voice.
I wrote your book.
I wrote that.
Those are my stories.
I took your incoherent ramblings,
- your wasted days in prison.
- You better watch yourself.
I bent them into something.
All those people out there who think you're the symbol of black resistance,
I did that.
Your life, my words.
Your words don't mean shit without my life.
Nothing but an English teacher living on the dole.
Nobody paid you any mind.
Nobody cared nothing for what you had to say before I come along.
You talk on blackness, you talk on the struggle, that's all it is, man, talk.
You haven't struggled a day in your life.
You're fucking middle class and middle brow, mediocre, prosaic.
How am I doing, teacher, hm?
How are my words?
Fixed teeth and plum talk.
And you thought that you could use me to fuel your revolution?
I don't know what you thought was gonna happen when you busted me out but I'm not your mascot.
And you're not the dragon.
(Jas and Eliette laughing)
Don't talk about Jas.
You're anxious, man.
Don't be so anxious.
It's not good for you.
(TV in background)
(Door opens and closes)
(Dog barks in distance)
You did these?
I'm a wanted woman.
- There's a price on my head.
- How much?
$10,000.
Ten?
Canadian, but...
What you did against the Rhodesians, that was good.
But anybody can shoot a gun.
If you want people to take you seriously, you have to show them that you're more than just a thug.
You don't think you could make one?
It's easy.
Mm.
This is more destruction than I...
It's not about destruction.
It's about disruption.
Infiltrate.
Plant the bomb.
Call in a warning to the police before it's set to detonate.
Demonstrate weakness of the system.
Limit collateral damage and keep yourself and your cell at a distance.
Attack by remote control.
That is fear.
That is power.
I'll take that fear back to Canada in the name of Quebecois.
- You're going back?
- Eventually.
Trying to get to Algeria, Lebanon or Vietnam.
- Why would you go to Vietnam?
- To train.
The Seventh Wave can't be like the Sixth Wave.
The age of idealists and...
amateurs is over.
Quebecois, we...
We are the descendants of a conquered people.
We've got a right to national sovereignty.
It doesn't happen without a fight.
To fight, you have to be a soldier.
To be a soldier, you have to live like one.
What?
You.
You remind me of... people.
Keep it.
Learn it.
Pass it on.
That's how the revolution sustains itself.
Sis?
He's asking for you.
Are you Fallon?
- Yeah, why?
- Come.
♪ Meet you by the river some day ♪
♪ Meet you by the river, far, far away ♪
♪ Oh, when my Lord has called me home ♪
♪ Happy, happy home on the other side ♪
♪ Meet you by the river someday ♪
♪ Meet you by the river someday ♪
♪ Meet you by the river, far, far away ♪
♪ Oh, when my Lord has called me home ♪
♪ Happy, happy home on the other side ♪
♪ Meet you by the river someday... ♪
Sit down.
Who are you?
Jas told me to come find you.
- Where is she?
- Sit your pale ass down!
Where's Jas?
- Is she alright?
- Yeah.
Her, Marcus, Dhari.
She wanted me to tell you, you know, it's all cool.
And that, uh... what was your guy's name?
- Julian.
- Yeah.
They gonna make things right about him with the pigs.
They're doing all this because of Julian?
Look, I need you to tell them...
I don't know when I'm gonna see her again.
This can't be because of Julian.
Look...
I'm not your messenger boy.
They're underground.
They do what they do.
Tell her... please.
(Sighs) Alright.
When I see 'em.
(Gospel singing)
(Percussion and singing)
(Thunder rumbles)
Hey.
You alright?
Yeah, I'm okay.
This is the first time we've been alone together and outdoors in nearly a month.
(Jas sighs)
This girl, are you getting on okay with her?
Mm.
I like her.
She's...
She's smart.
The way she talks, she sounds like my father.
- (Marcus scoffs)
- Is that funny?
Your father gave up a civil servant job to help liberate the poor.
She's fighting to speak French instead of English.
That isn't much of an objective.
The Naxal Movement is about equality and self-preservation.
That's what my father fought for, it's what Eliette is fighting for.
- You just don't get it.
- I don't get what?
I don't get the fight?
The police brutality, racism?
It's not the same for you.
You're not an immigrant.
This is all the police see.
When they start dividing us up, you'll be a patrial, I won't.
There is blame, there is bitterness, there is anger and hate towards us, which you won't understand.
I have my own experiences, you understand that?
There are times when I tell you how I feel.
I just need you to listen, not tell me what to think or judge what I do.
So you going off on your own shooting at the Rhodesians, that's some sort of personal liberation?
It was an unpredictable attack that had an unpredictable outcome.
What does that...
Is that girl filling your head with that shit?
- I trust her.
- You don't know her.
We don't know Dhari.
Not the way we thought.
We don't know Leroy, we don't know these Germans.
This has all turned into a big fucking circus.
We need a real soldier!
What we need is people who believe in what we believe.
This is our thing.
You and I have got to stay partners in our mission.
Partners?
Being partners doesn't mean disappearing in you.
I'm not here to be the girlfriend or the sidekick.
I am my own agent.
Write your communique, get your words together, announce yourself to the world.
First night we're alone together and this is the best we can do?
(Wind howls)
(Tape recorder whirs)
This is Marcus Hill.
I'm going to read a declaration of a state of war.
This is the way we celebrate...
You read it.
You be the voice of us.
(ELIETTE) Read it, Jas.
This is Jas Mitra.
I'm going to read a declaration of a state of war.
This is the way we celebrate the example of Fanon, L'Ouverture, of Che and Hampton, who first inspired us by their fight behind enemy lines for the liberation of their people.
To the oppressed, we say, don't despair.
Hopelessness will fall away in the face of the victories we achieve for all of Britain's people.
To those who struggle, know that you don't struggle alone.
We fight with you.
We fight for you.
To those who condemn us, know that in the end it is you who will be judged, not just by those you stand against, but by history as well.
To the establishment, to the filth, to the oppressors, if you want to find us, this is where we are - on every street, in every house, in every shop in this country.
Where people yearn for decent wages, fair housing and equal protection under the law.
It is this for which we live and for which we fight - to the death if necessary.
We are not afraid.
The scared coloreds are already dead.
This is the age... of the United Federated Forces of the Black Army Faction.
Power to the people.
(Tape recorder beeps)
Look at these.
You know these people.
We're being hunted by police.
That boy you found me was a good one.
Keep it up.
They'll give us money if we take direct action in support of their movement.
Man, you all getting too damn hot!
If someone doesn't fill this void quick, your ex is gonna get us all dragged along.
My daughter knows she has a right to be British.
- They'll kill her, Savi.
- We have friends.
We can't go to our friends, they're being watched.
You shouldn't push him.
You shouldn't have killed my boyfriend.
- Who was that?
- No one.
It's not no one.
He's going to get fixed, with or without your help.
What happened?
You wanted me to do something.
I did.
No!
_
_
This is what we're offering.
And this is what you will accept.
You're to receive a stipend of £20 a month, every month.
You will also be paid an operation fee of £10...
- Ten?
- ..for every successful action
- you undertake.
- No.
£25 if it is a mutually agreed upon target.
No.
- It's a generous subsidy.
- It's shit.
- Let him finish.
- £50 a month.
Minimum.
We need materials, guns.
We need a safe house.
We can't stay where we are.
You don't have a designation yet.
You don't even have a manifesto.
As a movement, you have no profile in revolutionary circles.
She has no perspective of your own worth.
You don't understand our value.
We liberated a political prisoner, we executed an action against the Rhodesian Mission.
For your own gain, not for the furtherance of Marxist objectives.
What did he say?
- What the fuck did he say?
- Look, stick to our original agreement.
ZANLA fights Rhodesia.
ZANLA is Communist.
ZANLA is Maoist, not Marxist.
Don't lump us together.
If you can't distinguish our philosophies, then you're no good to us.
Man, this is bullshit.
You all keep talking but you ain't saying nothing.
We're talking about the origins of the struggle.
It should be of interest to you.
You literally wrote the book.
We've done more in our first month than you've done in the last six.
We're an asset.
£50 a month and a safe house and as far as I care, that's still cheap.
I need certain approvals.
Talk to who you need to - the Stasi, Central Committee, whoever runs you.
We'll wait.
So what's the buzz?
Nothing.
What's that mean?
It means we're not getting anything from them.
Wasting our time, man.
These motherfuckers talking their Commie bullshit.
What the fuck did Commies ever do for us, huh?
These punks wouldn't last a hot second in Newark.
Not a hot, motherfucking second.
Rich, white kids.
Only thing they know about Huey or Eldridge is from wearing them on a T-shirt.
Are you listening?
'Should have taken what was offered.
I had an understanding with them.
20?
£20?
They showed you the short end of the stick and you took it.
It's not just the money.
We need allies.
Whatever you thought you had worked out, that's what they pay the hired help.
The action against the Rhodesians was serious.
We need to be taken seriously.
What happened with the Rhodesians?
Target of opportunity.
How did you get an opportunity?
You left Leroy's.
Where were you going?
I was weeks in that flat.
- I needed to get out.
- Where were you?
Is this an interrogation?
You came back to me that night a wreck.
You didn't tell me what happened.
You didn't say a word.
Right, fine, you needed me there and I was there.
I needed some space for me too.
I wasn't gonna go out without protection so I took the gun and I went and...
I wasn't going anywhere.
I just needed to be somewhere else.
- That was a long way...
- Then things happened.
...from Leroy's flat.
They happened how they did.
And I took advantage of the situation.
Let me see.
I'm fine.
I got lucky.
I almost killed someone when we broke Dhari out of prison.
We can't devolve into violence.
- Nobody died when I went...
- That's not the point.
The point is, we're soldiers and soldiers fight.
Symbolic action, not murder.
You understand?
Let's talk.
Not you, him.
Whatever you need to discuss, you can...
Let us talk.
- They got anything to say?
- I wouldn't know.
Man, I don't know why we're going through all this shit.
You had the right idea, just get some guns, put some motherfuckers against the wall.
Have a good chat?
When you rub them wrong, when someone's trying to help...
- What's the offer?
- £25 a month.
And £50 for any mutually agreed upon action.
- Materials?
- But no weapons.
No guns?
They'll give us a tape recorder.
A tape recorder?
What about some motherfucking guns?
We need to record a communique.
We build support through awareness.
- Ah, shit.
- What else?
They'll put us in a safe house.
You, me and Dhari.
- What about me?
- You've got a place.
Hold up.
I'm part of this.
I ain't getting pushed off now just 'cause you say.
Look, we need someone who can hide in plain sight, who can move, who can communicate.
You're our connection to the above ground.
You come under with us, we lose that.
You okay with all this?
Does it matter?
You took the deal.
Where's Dhari?
And that was drawn from a description a witness gave of the shooter at the Rhodesian Mission.
It's your daughter, isn't it?
She's gonna kill or be killed.
That's all that's waiting for her.
Now, your girl, she's young.
She got caught up with the wrong bunch.
Young kids.
Wrong influences.
They end up doing wrong things.
She just needs to have some sense talked into her.
You can do that.
And we can get you on television, on radio.
Have you talk sense.
We're doing the same with Marcus's parents.
Asking them to appeal to their boy to do right.
What is right?
Giving herself up while she can.
Your daughter's an enemy of the state and if you're helping her that makes you an enemy non-patrial.
I can have you sent right back where you came from.
Now, they'll toss you in a hole next to the bastard what fathered your bitch.
Where is that accent from?
You're not English.
Afrikaner?
Are you a Rhodey yourself?
Sad.
People always did look at you Boers as being the hayseeds up the Empire's back end.
Fighting a war you know you can't win.
And all this talk about the Immigration Act.
The unclean and the unworthy.
Must hurt, knowing they're not just talking about us.
They're talking about you.
We come round, we try and be reasonable with you.
Try to get you to be correct.
For your daughter's sake, we do that.
But I'm not obligated to give a shit if your girl gets hauled in.
Or shot up.
Put an extra couple of men on this place.
I want it watched day and night.
And I want her to know it.
It's not working.
Their friends, their family, the harder you push them, the harder they push back.
If you don't have the guts for this...
Threats and violence don't work in Rhodesia.
What makes you think it's gonna work here?
A month and nothing to show.
They're getting ready to take this away from us.
Who?
C-13.
These are black radicals, they're for the Black Desk to deal with.
They're not muggers and thugs, they're terrorists.
They're lucky and stupid.
Yeah, and we can't catch 'em.
That makes us look stupid too.
So we either need to get clever or let 'em be 13's problem.
Hey, whose is this?
You're not the only ones looking for safe-keeping.
They are around.
So this is the reel-to-reel.
And this will get you started.
Now what?
Well, we need to put out a communique, state our goals.
- Identify an action...
- What action?
We'll find one.
- When?
- We'll find one.
Well, this is getting nothing done.
What do you wanna do, just go and shoot some people?
Do you just wanna go back to shagging Eva Braun against a tree?
Been in jail eight years.
You're lucky I don't take you out back.
- You're not funny.
- I ain't playing.
A cool breeze gets my dick hard.
I don't care where I put it so long as it's warm and wet.
We've got work to get done.
Your son is not only a user of narcotics, he's an addict as well.
As with any disease, addiction can be treated.
What we give the patient is an aversion to his addiction by associating it not with pleasure, but with disgust.
The patient is allowed a small sample of the source of his addiction whilst simultaneously being administered a negative stimulant,
- generally an electrical charge.
- You electrocute them?
I prefer to give the patient an emetic.
A medication which induces digestive sickness... vomiting.
Typically the associated sensations, coupled with the patient having to sit with the after-effects
- of his own actions...
- How long?
The length of the treatment process depends...
No, no.
How long does he sit in his vomit?
There's no real time limit.
As long as necessary.
When can he start?
- We should talk about this.
- We could begin procedures around your schedule.
Ronnie sitting in his own vomit?
Ronnie is diseased.
You understand that?
You heard that?
If someone has cancer...
He doesn't have cancer.
He's dying.
He's killing himself.
If you care about somebody, you do something.
Can we talk about this at home?
When are you ever at home?
You...
You don't have to deal with it.
I'm left alone with his pass-outs and his episodes and...
I don't...
I don't know know what to call them.
His periods where, quite frankly, he might kill me.
Welcome to my world where I live every single day.
And I don't want to be there anymore.
Forgive me.
Forgive me if I didn't hear your answer.
We could begin treatments within the next few weeks.
Nicholas, you can discuss payments with the doctor, can't you?
Watch out, Micky.
Micky, watch out!
Hey, what did you do to Connor?
- What?
- You had my brother arrested.
We didn't arrest him.
It's not enough to get me fired, you drag him off?
We didn't touch your brother.
People saw it happen.
If he got arrested, it's got nothing to do with us.
Oh, shit.
Write his name.
Wait here.
I'll see what I can find out.
No, just wait.
Alright?
Your son Marcus, who's now been on the run for a week...
Hey, Marcus, come see this.
If that was you, that's not our son.
But the evidence is overwhelming.
That your son broke a convict from prison, that he shot an ambulance driver.
Our son was raised to respect people, to respect the law to be a credit to his race.
Then how do you explain what's happened?
Marcus is naive.
He got himself under the spell of this other man, this convict.
Marcus was taken advantage of.
- Just turn it off.
- Leave it on.
Is it something we did?
If he were listening, what would you say to your son?
I'd tell him to stop it.
I'd tell him to grow up.
Everything good he has in life is because of what this country has given us.
- What he's doing now is...
- It's shameful.
It's shameful.
While the parents of Marcus Hill showed remorse for their son's actions, the same doesn't seem to be true of Marcus himself.
More than a month after a prison break that left two men wounded and a gun attack on the Rhodesian Mission...
Marcus.
This is Jas and that's Dhari.
Eliette.
Take your hand out your pocket.
Take your hand out your pocket!
Connor!
Connor!
- It's alright.
- What happened?
- Just calm down.
- What happened?
Sit down.
One of your brother's friends was identified as a provisional volunteer.
He's not a volunteer!
There was a round-up, your brother got pulled in.
He doesn't have anything to do with the IRA.
- His friends do.
- Why, because you said so?
You fit up anyone you like.
Look, between his friends and yours, your brother's getting caught up.
Now, you might not give a shit, but getting Connor out just cost me favors I can't spare.
So you need to stop thinking about yourself and start thinking about what you're doing to your brother.
- You're so stupid.
- The filth did it.
They wouldn't have touched you if it hadn't been for your friends.
My friends aren't the ones.
They're doing this to me because of you and your dead black.
Stop.
Stop it!
Stop.
I need help.
- How am I...
- I've got no job.
I'm trying to do everything for the both of us.
- And you getting hauled in...
- And what do you care?
Our parents... my friends... my man...
All gone.
You're all I've got.
And it's taking everything I've got left to keep us together.
So stop pretending to be a soldier and just be my brother.
Alright?
Come on.
You were staring at me.
You attacked the Rhodesian Mission.
There was a picture of you in the paper.
That was you, right?
- I'm not an informant.
- Then what?
Front De Liberation Du Quebec.
FLQ.
The FLQ disbanded.
Not the movement.
The Sixth Wave fell apart.
I didn't want to stay.
A bunch of mannish boys holed up in a basement that smelled like a shit house.
No target, no direction.
Every day they were writing up self-indulgent letters to send to the PM.
Sometimes the quality of leadership is measured by the size of cocks and if you don't have one, you're not needed in the room.
You did a job on the Rhodesian bastards.
Who's your sponsor?
The Germans, just now.
What's your cause?
Unification of people of color.
Ecumenical revolution.
I saw a friend murdered by the police.
The establishment, they...
They hang the Immigration Act over our heads and sneer at us like...
like we're lucky to be here.
Holding the filth accountable, power to the people, that's what we fight for.
So you attacked the Rhodesians?
The truth... the truth is, I...
I got lucky.
Nobody's that lucky.
- Marcus says that...
- Who's Marcus?
- I'm his girl.
Marcus...
- You're not anybody's girl.
...says that we have to...
stop just doing things.
We have to communicate our goals.
We have to plan our actions better.
A predictable attack has a predictable outcome.
With the Rhodesians, you just weren't predictable.
I don't think your man has a problem with your tactics,
I think the problem was you succeeding without him.
You hurt that in the attack?
Mm.
There are better ways.
I wasn't expecting you.
These three, the convict and the two that got him out, what are you hearing?
- Nothing.
- That's not like you.
You could tease the Devil out of a pastor.
No one's loosening their lips for you?
Nobody knows where they are.
Nobody I know.
The two who got Dhari out, they aren't...
This isn't their circle.
It's all the same cloth, isn't it?
I need help on this.
Talk to whoever you need to talk to.
- I've tried.
- Go into the neighborhood.
The tea houses, the community center.
- I've tried.
- Then try again!
Soften some people up.
Trick 'em with liquor.
Climb on your back if you need to, but goddammit, I need some information.
I'm getting hit from all sides here.
They want these three caught and I can't find hide or hair.
I need your ears out there.
I need...
It's turning into an embarrassment.
They wanna take me off of this.
They wanna make me look like a...
I've got my Mick of a partner running his mouth like he's so goddamn clever.
Had to get Ronnie to a doctor.
Drinking, drugs.
It's all getting to be too much.
Emily, she blames me for his troubles.
I'm out there pounding the street, trying to keep the order.
She blames me.
She's around the boy all day, every day, she can't take some responsibility?
No one can take any responsibility.
It's always Pence who's gotta fix what's broke.
Kaffirs running wild or my kid killing himself with a needle.
Let old Pence fix it.
You look good.
Got a caller?
A guest.
Guest?
How's the boy?
He's fine.
I don't spend enough time around him.
- Let me go say hello.
- I told you, he's sleeping.
- I won't wake him.
- No.
- Just a kiss to the cheek.
- Just leave him alone.
This guest, what's his name?
Gonna put me to the trouble of finding out?
What's his name?
Robert.
Robert?
Smith.
Bob Smith?
Tell you what, why don't you ring up Bob Smith?
And say what?
I don't know.
Let's see what comes to mind.
Robert.
It's Kenya.
Er...
I've got something I need to tell you.
About a change of plans.
Something's come up.
No.
No.
I can't.
I've got other things to do.
I can't see you this evening, I'm...
I'm sorry.
It's none of his business.
Just... just something.
You don't know.
I don't know when, er...
I don't know when we can rearrange.
Maybe, erm...
Maybe in...
Tell him he's a bore.
Tell him he's a bore and you'll dump him.
Tell him.
Tell him.
Robert, we can't.
Can't what?
We can't.
How's that boy of yours gonna like growing up without a mum?
You say it.
You tell this cunt...
You don't get to own me.
There's some tea in the kitchen.
I know.
Really nice.
God, they're just gonna sit there all day.
We'll go upstairs.
There are some things I can show you.
That one, she ain't nothing but trouble.
You hear me?
You better mind your girl.
She's getting an attitude and hanging out with this other one ain't gonna do a thing for her.
Nothing will fuck you up like a hot-headed bitch.
You need to mind how you talk about Jas.
I don't like it when you imply you'd have relations with her.
How's that wrong that Jas is worth having?
- Or that I say it to your face?
- Don't talk about her.
You and me are like brothers.
Haven't we always got on like brothers?
So what's your problem, acting all...?
Mom and Dad talked you down on the telly, saying you're under the spell of some Uga Buga Man?
I'm wise to you, boy.
You're not as sharp as you'd like to believe.
It doesn't matter what I think.
It's what other people think.
That the problem, hm?
Not so much that I could take your woman, that I took your words.
You didn't take anything.
I gave my words.
I'm the one who gave you your voice.
I wrote your book.
I wrote that.
Those are my stories.
I took your incoherent ramblings,
- your wasted days in prison.
- You better watch yourself.
I bent them into something.
All those people out there who think you're the symbol of black resistance,
I did that.
Your life, my words.
Your words don't mean shit without my life.
Nothing but an English teacher living on the dole.
Nobody paid you any mind.
Nobody cared nothing for what you had to say before I come along.
You talk on blackness, you talk on the struggle, that's all it is, man, talk.
You haven't struggled a day in your life.
You're fucking middle class and middle brow, mediocre, prosaic.
How am I doing, teacher, hm?
How are my words?
Fixed teeth and plum talk.
And you thought that you could use me to fuel your revolution?
I don't know what you thought was gonna happen when you busted me out but I'm not your mascot.
And you're not the dragon.
Don't talk about Jas.
You're anxious, man.
Don't be so anxious.
It's not good for you.
You did these?
I'm a wanted woman.
- There's a price on my head.
- How much?
$10,000.
Ten?
Canadian, but...
What you did against the Rhodesians, that was good.
But anybody can shoot a gun.
If you want people to take you seriously, you have to show them that you're more than just a thug.
You don't think you could make one?
It's easy.
Mm.
This is more destruction than I...
It's not about destruction.
It's about disruption.
Infiltrate.
Plant the bomb.
Call in a warning to the police before it's set to detonate.
Demonstrate weakness of the system.
Limit collateral damage and keep yourself and your cell at a distance.
Attack by remote control.
That is fear.
That is power.
I'll take that fear back to Canada in the name of Quebecois.
- You're going back?
- Eventually.
Trying to get to Algeria, Lebanon or Vietnam.
- Why would you go to Vietnam?
- To train.
The Seventh Wave can't be like the Sixth Wave.
The age of idealists and...
amateurs is over.
Quebecois, we...
We are the descendants of a conquered people.
We've got a right to national sovereignty.
It doesn't happen without a fight.
To fight, you have to be a soldier.
To be a soldier, you have to live like one.
What?
You.
You remind me of... people.
Keep it.
Learn it.
Pass it on.
That's how the revolution sustains itself.
Sis?
He's asking for you.
Are you Fallon?
- Yeah, why?
- Come.
♪ Meet you by the river some day ♪
♪ Meet you by the river, far, far away ♪
♪ Oh, when my Lord has called me home ♪
♪ Happy, happy home on the other side ♪
♪ Meet you by the river someday ♪
♪ Meet you by the river someday ♪
♪ Meet you by the river, far, far away ♪
♪ Oh, when my Lord has called me home ♪
♪ Happy, happy home on the other side ♪
♪ Meet you by the river someday... ♪
Sit down.
Who are you?
Jas told me to come find you.
- Where is she?
- Sit your pale ass down!
Where's Jas?
- Is she alright?
- Yeah.
Her, Marcus, Dhari.
She wanted me to tell you, you know, it's all cool.
And that, uh... what was your guy's name?
- Julian.
- Yeah.
They gonna make things right about him with the pigs.
They're doing all this because of Julian?
Look, I need you to tell them...
I don't know when I'm gonna see her again.
This can't be because of Julian.
Look...
I'm not your messenger boy.
They're underground.
They do what they do.
Tell her... please.
Alright.
When I see 'em.
Hey.
You alright?
Yeah, I'm okay.
This is the first time we've been alone together and outdoors in nearly a month.
This girl, are you getting on okay with her?
Mm.
I like her.
She's...
She's smart.
The way she talks, she sounds like my father.
Is that funny?
Your father gave up a civil servant job to help liberate the poor.
She's fighting to speak French instead of English.
That isn't much of an objective.
The Naxal Movement is about equality and self-preservation.
That's what my father fought for, it's what Eliette is fighting for.
- You just don't get it.
- I don't get what?
I don't get the fight?
The police brutality, racism?
It's not the same for you.
You're not an immigrant.
This is all the police see.
When they start dividing us up, you'll be a patrial, I won't.
There is blame, there is bitterness, there is anger and hate towards us, which you won't understand.
I have my own experiences, you understand that?
There are times when I tell you how I feel.
I just need you to listen, not tell me what to think or judge what I do.
So you going off on your own shooting at the Rhodesians, that's some sort of personal liberation?
It was an unpredictable attack that had an unpredictable outcome.
What does that...
Is that girl filling your head with that shit?
- I trust her.
- You don't know her.
We don't know Dhari.
Not the way we thought.
We don't know Leroy, we don't know these Germans.
This has all turned into a big fucking circus.
We need a real soldier!
What we need is people who believe in what we believe.
This is our thing.
You and I have got to stay partners in our mission.
Partners?
Being partners doesn't mean disappearing in you.
I'm not here to be the girlfriend or the sidekick.
I am my own agent.
Write your communique, get your words together, announce yourself to the world.
First night we're alone together and this is the best we can do?
This is Marcus Hill.
I'm going to read a declaration of a state of war.
This is the way we celebrate...
You read it.
You be the voice of us.
Read it, Jas.
This is Jas Mitra.
I'm going to read a declaration of a state of war.
This is the way we celebrate the example of Fanon, L'Ouverture, of Che and Hampton, who first inspired us by their fight behind enemy lines for the liberation of their people.
To the oppressed, we say, don't despair.
Hopelessness will fall away in the face of the victories we achieve for all of Britain's people.
To those who struggle, know that you don't struggle alone.
We fight with you.
We fight for you.
To those who condemn us, know that in the end it is you who will be judged, not just by those you stand against, but by history as well.
To the establishment, to the filth, to the oppressors, if you want to find us, this is where we are - on every street, in every house, in every shop in this country.
Where people yearn for decent wages, fair housing and equal protection under the law.
It is this for which we live and for which we fight - to the death if necessary.
We are not afraid.
The scared coloreds are already dead.
This is the age... of the United Federated Forces of the Black Army Faction.
Power to the people.
Look at these.
You know these people.
We're being hunted by police.
That boy you found me was a good one.
Keep it up.
They'll give us money if we take direct action in support of their movement.
Man, you all getting too damn hot!
If someone doesn't fill this void quick, your ex is gonna get us all dragged along.
My daughter knows she has a right to be British.
- They'll kill her, Savi.
- We have friends.
We can't go to our friends, they're being watched.
You shouldn't push him.
You shouldn't have killed my boyfriend.
- Who was that?
- No one.
It's not no one.
He's going to get fixed, with or without your help.
What happened?
You wanted me to do something.
I did.
No!
This is what we're offering.
And this is what you will accept.
You're to receive a stipend of £20 a month, every month.
You will also be paid an operation fee of £10...
- Ten?
- ..for every successful action
- you undertake.
- No.
£25 if it is a mutually agreed upon target.
No.
- It's a generous subsidy.
- It's shit.
- Let him finish.
- £50 a month.
Minimum.
We need materials, guns.
We need a safe house.
We can't stay where we are.
You don't have a designation yet.
You don't even have a manifesto.
As a movement, you have no profile in revolutionary circles.
She has no perspective of your own worth.
You don't understand our value.
We liberated a political prisoner, we executed an action against the Rhodesian Mission.
For your own gain, not for the furtherance of Marxist objectives.
What did he say?
- What the fuck did he say?
- Look, stick to our original agreement.
ZANLA fights Rhodesia.
ZANLA is Communist.
ZANLA is Maoist, not Marxist.
Don't lump us together.
If you can't distinguish our philosophies, then you're no good to us.
Man, this is bullshit.
You all keep talking but you ain't saying nothing.
We're talking about the origins of the struggle.
It should be of interest to you.
You literally wrote the book.
We've done more in our first month than you've done in the last six.
We're an asset.
Â£50 a month and a safe house and as far as I care, that's still cheap.
I need certain approvals.
Talk to who you need to - the Stasi, Central Committee, whoever runs you.
We'll wait.
So what's the buzz?
Nothing.
What's that mean?
It means we're not getting anything from them.
Wasting our time, man.
These motherfuckers talking their Commie bullshit.
What the fuck did Commies ever do for us?
These punks wouldn't last a hot second in Newark.
Not a hot, motherfucking second.
Rich, white kids.
Only thing they know about Huey or Eldridge is from wearing them on a T-shirt.
Are you listening?
'Should have taken what was offered.
I had an understanding with them.
20?
£20?
They showed you the short end of the stick and you took it.
It's not just the money.
We need allies.
Whatever you thought you had worked out, that's what they pay the hired help.
The action against the Rhodesians was serious.
We need to be taken seriously.
What happened with the Rhodesians?
Target of opportunity.
How did you get an opportunity?
You left Leroy's.
Where were you going?
I was weeks in that flat.
- I needed to get out.
- Where were you?
Is this an interrogation?
You came back to me that night a wreck.
You didn't tell me what happened.
You didn't say a word.
Right, fine, you needed me there and I was there.
I needed some space for me too.
I wasn't gonna go out without protection so I took the gun and I went and...
I wasn't going anywhere.
I just needed to be somewhere else.
- That was a long way...
- Then things happened.
From Leroy's flat.
They happened how they did.
And I took advantage of the situation.
Let me see.
I'm fine.
I got lucky.
I almost killed someone when we broke Dhari out of prison.
We can't devolve into violence.
- Nobody died when I went...
- That's not the point.
The point is, we're soldiers and soldiers fight.
Symbolic action, not murder.
You understand?
Let's talk.
Not you, him.
Whatever you need to discuss, you can...
Let us talk.
- They got anything to say?
- I wouldn't know.
Man, I don't know why we're going through all this shit.
You had the right idea, just get some guns, put some motherfuckers against the wall.
Have a good chat?
When you rub them wrong, when someone's trying to help...
- What's the offer?
- £25 a month.
And £50 for any mutually agreed upon action.
- Materials?
- But no weapons.
No guns?
They'll give us a tape recorder.
A tape recorder?
What about some motherfucking guns?
We need to record a communique.
We build support through awareness.
- Shit.
- What else?
They'll put us in a safe house.
You, me and Dhari.
- What about me?
- You've got a place.
Hold up.
I'm part of this.
I ain't getting pushed off now just 'cause you say.
Look, we need someone who can hide in plain sight, who can move, who can communicate.
You're our connection to the above ground.
You come under with us, we lose that.
You okay with all this?
Does it matter?
You took the deal.
Where's Dhari?
And that was drawn from a description a witness gave of the shooter at the Rhodesian Mission.
It's your daughter, isn't it?
She's gonna kill or be killed.
That's all that's waiting for her.
Now, your girl, she's young.
She got caught up with the wrong bunch.
Young kids.
Wrong influences.
They end up doing wrong things.
She just needs to have some sense talked into her.
You can do that.
And we can get you on television, on radio.
Have you talk sense.
We're doing the same with Marcus's parents.
Asking them to appeal to their boy to do right.
What is right?
Giving herself up while she can.
Your daughter's an enemy of the state and if you're helping her that makes you an enemy non-patrial.
I can have you sent right back where you came from.
Now, they'll toss you in a hole next to the bastard what fathered your bitch.
Where is that accent from?
You're not English.
Afrikaner?
Are you a Rhodey yourself?
Sad.
People always did look at you Boers as being the hayseeds up the Empire's back end.
Fighting a war you know you can't win.
And all this talk about the Immigration Act.
The unclean and the unworthy.
Must hurt, knowing they're not just talking about us.
They're talking about you.
We come round, we try and be reasonable with you.
Try to get you to be correct.
For your daughter's sake, we do that.
But I'm not obligated to give a shit if your girl gets hauled in.
Or shot up.
Put an extra couple of men on this place.
I want it watched day and night.
And I want her to know it.
It's not working.
Their friends, their family, the harder you push them, the harder they push back.
If you don't have the guts for this...
Threats and violence don't work in Rhodesia.
What makes you think it's gonna work here?
A month and nothing to show.
They're getting ready to take this away from us.
Who?
These are black radicals, they're for the Black Desk to deal with.
They're not muggers and thugs, they're terrorists.
They're lucky and stupid.
Yeah, and we can't catch 'em.
That makes us look stupid too.
So we either need to get clever or let 'em be 13's problem.
Hey, whose is this?
You're not the only ones looking for safe-keeping.
They are around.
So this is the reel-to-reel.
And this will get you started.
Now what?
Well, we need to put out a communique, state our goals.
- Identify an action...
- What action?
We'll find one.
- When?
- We'll find one.
Well, this is getting nothing done.
What do you wanna do, just go and shoot some people?
Do you just wanna go back to shagging Eva Braun against a tree?
Been in jail eight years.
You're lucky I don't take you out back.
- You're not funny.
- I ain't playing.
A cool breeze gets my dick hard.
I don't care where I put it so long as it's warm and wet.
We've got work to get done.
Your son is not only a user of narcotics, he's an addict as well.
As with any disease, addiction can be treated.
What we give the patient is an aversion to his addiction by associating it not with pleasure, but with disgust.
The patient is allowed a small sample of the source of his addiction whilst simultaneously being administered a negative stimulant,
- generally an electrical charge.
- You electrocute them?
I prefer to give the patient an emetic.
A medication which induces digestive sickness... vomiting.
Typically the associated sensations, coupled with the patient having to sit with the after-effects
- of his own actions...
- How long?
The length of the treatment process depends...
No, no.
How long does he sit in his vomit?
There's no real time limit.
As long as necessary.
When can he start?
- We should talk about this.
- We could begin procedures around your schedule.
Ronnie sitting in his own vomit?
Ronnie is diseased.
You understand that?
You heard that?
If someone has cancer...
He doesn't have cancer.
He's dying.
He's killing himself.
If you care about somebody, you do something.
Can we talk about this at home?
When are you ever at home?
You...
You don't have to deal with it.
I'm left alone with his pass-outs and his episodes and...
I don't...
I don't know know what to call them.
His periods where, quite frankly, he might kill me.
Welcome to my world where I live every single day.
And I don't want to be there anymore.
Forgive me.
Forgive me if I didn't hear your answer.
We could begin treatments within the next few weeks.
Nicholas, you can discuss payments with the doctor, can't you?
Watch out, Micky.
Micky, watch out!
Hey, what did you do to Connor?
- What?
- You had my brother arrested.
We didn't arrest him.
It's not enough to get me fired, you drag him off?
We didn't touch your brother.
People saw it happen.
If he got arrested, it's got nothing to do with us.
Shit.
Write his name.
Wait here.
I'll see what I can find out.
No, just wait.
Alright?
Your son Marcus, who's now been on the run for a week...
Hey, Marcus, come see this.
If that was you, that's not our son.
But the evidence is overwhelming.
That your son broke a convict from prison, that he shot an ambulance driver.
Our son was raised to respect people, to respect the law... to be a credit to his race.
Then how do you explain what's happened?
Marcus is naive.
He got himself under the spell of this other man, this convict.
Marcus was taken advantage of.
- Just turn it off.
- Leave it on.
Is it something we did?
If he were listening, what would you say to your son?
I'd tell him to stop it.
I'd tell him to grow up.
Everything good he has in life is because of what this country has given us.
- What he's doing now is...
- It's shameful.
It's shameful.
While the parents of Marcus Hill showed remorse for their son's actions, the same doesn't seem to be true of Marcus himself.
More than a month after a prison break that left two men wounded and a gun attack on the Rhodesian Mission...
Marcus.
This is Jas and that's Dhari.
Eliette.
Take your hand out your pocket.
Take your hand out your pocket!
Connor!
Connor!
- It's alright.
- What happened?
- Just calm down.
- What happened?
Sit down.
One of your brother's friends was identified as a provisional volunteer.
He's not a volunteer!
There was a round-up, your brother got pulled in.
He doesn't have anything to do with the IRA.
- His friends do.
- Why, because you said so?
You fit up anyone you like.
Look, between his friends and yours, your brother's getting caught up.
Now, you might not give a shit, but getting Connor out just cost me favors I can't spare.
So you need to stop thinking about yourself... and start thinking about what you're doing to your brother.
- You're so stupid.
- The filth did it.
They wouldn't have touched you if it hadn't been for your friends.
My friends aren't the ones.
They're doing this to me because of you and your dead black.
Stop.
Stop it!
Stop.
I need help.
- How am I...
- I've got no job.
I'm trying to do everything for the both of us.
- And you getting hauled in...
- And what do you care?
Our parents... my friends... my man...
All gone.
You're all I've got.
And it's taking everything I've got left to keep us together.
So stop pretending to be a soldier and just be my brother.
Alright?
Come on.
You were staring at me.
You attacked the Rhodesian Mission.
There was a picture of you in the paper.
That was you, right?
- I'm not an informant.
- Then what?
Front De Liberation Du Quebec.
FLQ.
The FLQ disbanded.
Not the movement.
The Sixth Wave fell apart.
I didn't want to stay.
A bunch of mannish boys holed up in a basement that smelled like a shit house.
No target, no direction.
Every day they were writing up self-indulgent letters to send to the PM.
Sometimes the quality of leadership is measured by the size of cocks and if you don't have one, you're not needed in the room.
You did a job on the Rhodesian bastards.
Who's your sponsor?
The Germans, just now.
What's your cause?
Unification of people of color.
Ecumenical revolution.
I saw a friend murdered by the police.
The establishment, they...
They hang the Immigration Act over our heads and sneer at us like...
like we're lucky to be here.
Holding the filth accountable, power to the people, that's what we fight for.
So you attacked the Rhodesians?
The truth... the truth is, I...
I got lucky.
Nobody's that lucky.
- Marcus says that...
- Who's Marcus?
- I'm his girl.
Marcus...
- You're not anybody's girl.
Says that we have to...
stop just doing things.
We have to communicate our goals.
We have to plan our actions better.
A predictable attack has a predictable outcome.
With the Rhodesians, you just weren't predictable.
I don't think your man has a problem with your tactics,
I think the problem was you succeeding without him.
You hurt that in the attack?
There are better ways.
I wasn't expecting you.
These three, the convict and the two that got him out, what are you hearing?
- Nothing.
- That's not like you.
You could tease the Devil out of a pastor.
No one's loosening their lips for you?
Nobody knows where they are.
Nobody I know.
The two who got Dhari out, they aren't...
This isn't their circle.
It's all the same cloth, isn't it?
I need help on this.
Talk to whoever you need to talk to.
- I've tried.
- Go into the neighborhood.
The tea houses, the community center.
- I've tried.
- Then try again!
Soften some people up.
Trick 'em with liquor.
Climb on your back if you need to, but goddammit, I need some information.
I'm getting hit from all sides here.
They want these three caught and I can't find hide or hair.
I need your ears out there.
I need...
It's turning into an embarrassment.
They wanna take me off of this.
They wanna make me look like a...
I've got my Mick of a partner running his mouth like he's so goddamn clever.
Had to get Ronnie to a doctor.
Drinking, drugs.
It's all getting to be too much.
Emily, she blames me for his troubles.
I'm out there pounding the street, trying to keep the order.
She blames me.
She's around the boy all day, every day, she can't take some responsibility?
No one can take any responsibility.
It's always Pence who's gotta fix what's broke.
Kaffirs running wild or my... kid killing himself with a needle.
Let old Pence fix it.
You look good.
Got a caller?
A guest.
Guest?
How's the boy?
He's fine.
I don't spend enough time around him.
- Let me go say hello.
- I told you, he's sleeping.
- I won't wake him.
- No.
- Just a kiss to the cheek.
- Just leave him alone.
This guest, what's his name?
Gonna put me to the trouble of finding out?
What's his name?
Robert.
Robert?
Smith.
Bob Smith?
Tell you what, why don't you ring up Bob Smith?
And say what?
I don't know.
Let's see what comes to mind.
Robert.
It's Kenya.
Er...
I've got something I need to tell you.
About a change of plans.
Something's come up.
No.
No.
I can't.
I've got other things to do.
I can't see you this evening, I'm...
I'm sorry.
It's none of his business.
Just... just something.
You don't know.
I don't know when, er...
I don't know when we can rearrange.
Maybe, erm...
Maybe in...
Tell him he's a bore.
Tell him he's a bore and you'll dump him.
Tell him.
Tell him.
Robert, we can't.
Can't what?
We can't.
How's that boy of yours gonna like growing up without a mum?
You say it.
You tell this cunt...
You don't get to own me.
There's some tea in the kitchen.
I know.
Really nice.
God, they're just gonna sit there all day.
We'll go upstairs.
There are some things I can show you.
That one, she ain't nothing but trouble.
You hear me?
You better mind your girl.
She's getting an attitude and hanging out with this other one ain't gonna do a thing for her.
Nothing will fuck you up like a hot-headed bitch.
You need to mind how you talk about Jas.
I don't like it when you imply you'd have relations with her.
How's that wrong that Jas is worth having?
- Or that I say it to your face?
- Don't talk about her.
You and me are like brothers.
Haven't we always got on like brothers?
So what's your problem, acting all...?
Mom and Dad talked you down on the telly, saying you're under the spell of some Uga Buga Man?
I'm wise to you, boy.
You're not as sharp as you'd like to believe.
It doesn't matter what I think.
It's what other people think.
That the problem?
Not so much that I could take your woman, that I took your words.
You didn't take anything.
I gave my words.
I'm the one who gave you your voice.
I wrote your book.
I wrote that.
Those are my stories.
I took your incoherent ramblings,
- your wasted days in prison.
- You better watch yourself.
I bent them into something.
All those people out there who think you're the symbol of black resistance,
I did that.
Your life, my words.
Your words don't mean shit without my life.
Nothing but an English teacher living on the dole.
Nobody paid you any mind.
Nobody cared nothing for what you had to say before I come along.
You talk on blackness, you talk on the struggle, that's all it is, man, talk.
You haven't struggled a day in your life.
You're fucking middle class and middle brow, mediocre, prosaic.
How am I doing, teacher?
How are my words?
Fixed teeth and plum talk.
And you thought that you could use me to fuel your revolution?
I don't know what you thought was gonna happen when you busted me out but I'm not your mascot.
And you're not the dragon.
Don't talk about Jas.
You're anxious, man.
Don't be so anxious.
It's not good for you.
You did these?
I'm a wanted woman.
- There's a price on my head.
- How much?
$10,000.
Ten?
Canadian, but...
What you did against the Rhodesians, that was good.
But anybody can shoot a gun.
If you want people to take you seriously, you have to show them that you're more than just a thug.
You don't think you could make one?
It's easy.
This is more destruction than I...
It's not about destruction.
It's about disruption.
Infiltrate.
Plant the bomb.
Call in a warning to the police before it's set to detonate.
Demonstrate weakness of the system.
Limit collateral damage and keep yourself and your cell at a distance.
Attack by remote control.
That is fear.
That is power.
I'll take that fear back to Canada in the name of Quebecois.
- You're going back?
- Eventually.
Trying to get to Algeria, Lebanon or Vietnam.
- Why would you go to Vietnam?
- To train.
The Seventh Wave can't be like the Sixth Wave.
The age of idealists and...
amateurs is over.
Quebecois, we...
We are the descendants of a conquered people.
We've got a right to national sovereignty.
It doesn't happen without a fight.
To fight, you have to be a soldier.
To be a soldier, you have to live like one.
What?
You.
You remind me of... people.
Keep it.
Learn it.
Pass it on.
That's how the revolution sustains itself.
Sis?
He's asking for you.
Are you Fallon?
- Yeah, why?
- Come.
Sit down.
Who are you?
Jas told me to come find you.
- Where is she?
- Sit your pale ass down!
Where's Jas?
- Is she alright?
- Yeah.
Her, Marcus, Dhari.
She wanted me to tell you, you know, it's all cool.
And that... what was your guy's name?
- Julian.
- Yeah.
They gonna make things right about him with the pigs.
They're doing all this because of Julian?
Look, I need you to tell them...
I don't know when I'm gonna see her again.
This can't be because of Julian.
Look...
I'm not your messenger boy.
They're underground.
They do what they do.
Tell her... please.
Alright.
When I see 'em.
Hey.
You alright?
Yeah, I'm okay.
This is the first time we've been alone together and outdoors in nearly a month.
This girl, are you getting on okay with her?
I like her.
She's...
She's smart.
The way she talks, she sounds like my father.
Is that funny?
Your father gave up a civil servant job to help liberate the poor.
She's fighting to speak French instead of English.
That isn't much of an objective.
The Naxal Movement is about equality and self-preservation.
That's what my father fought for, it's what Eliette is fighting for.
- You just don't get it.
- I don't get what?
I don't get the fight?
The police brutality, racism?
It's not the same for you.
You're not an immigrant.
This is all the police see.
When they start dividing us up, you'll be a patrial, I won't.
There is blame, there is bitterness, there is anger and hate towards us, which you won't understand.
I have my own experiences, you understand that?
There are times when I tell you how I feel.
I just need you to listen, not tell me what to think or judge what I do.
So you going off on your own shooting at the Rhodesians, that's some sort of personal liberation?
It was an unpredictable attack that had an unpredictable outcome.
What does that...
Is that girl filling your head with that shit?
- I trust her.
- You don't know her.
We don't know Dhari.
Not the way we thought.
We don't know Leroy, we don't know these Germans.
This has all turned into a big fucking circus.
We need a real soldier!
What we need is people who believe in what we believe.
This is our thing.
You and I have got to stay partners in our mission.
Partners?
Being partners doesn't mean disappearing in you.
I'm not here to be the girlfriend or the sidekick.
I am my own agent.
Write your communique, get your words together, announce yourself to the world.
First night we're alone together and this is the best we can do?
This is Marcus Hill.
I'm going to read a declaration of a state of war.
This is the way we celebrate...
You read it.
You be the voice of us.
Read it, Jas.
This is Jas Mitra.
I'm going to read a declaration of a state of war.
This is the way we celebrate the example of Fanon, L'Ouverture, of Che and Hampton, who first inspired us by their fight behind enemy lines for the liberation of their people.
To the oppressed, we say, don't despair.
Hopelessness will fall away in the face of the victories we achieve for all of Britain's people.
To those who struggle, know that you don't struggle alone.
We fight with you.
We fight for you.
To those who condemn us, know that in the end it is you who will be judged, not just by those you stand against, but by history as well.
To the establishment, to the filth, to the oppressors, if you want to find us, this is where we are - on every street, in every house, in every shop in this country.
Where people yearn for decent wages, fair housing and equal protection under the law.
It is this for which we live and for which we fight - to the death if necessary.
We are not afraid.
The scared coloreds are already dead.
This is the age... of the United Federated Forces of the Black Army Faction.
Power to the people.
Can I see my surprise now?
Not unless you promise you won't sell it.
[ Scoffs ] I just hope you didn't use your whole paycheck from the store on me.
Okay, that didn't sound like a promise, but go ahead and open your eyes.
Hamilton Beach.
All right, Mom.
No, push-button controls, automatic timer.
I can set it and forget it.
I --
Oh, look.
Look.
Thumb-activated lid makes pouring easy.
Coned filter for excellent flavor and extraction.
Rollie's gonna die.
Oh.
Rollie!
Rollie, it's a Hamilton Beach!
Rollie!
Rollie?
!
It's a Hamilton Beach!
What?
What?
She knows Hamilton Beach is basic, David.
It's a good coffee maker.
Let me guess -- you got this on Craigslist, huh, when you were casting your little net for all those perverts you catfish in the garage?
First off, they're not perverts.
Second, you're definitely using "catfish" incorrectly.
I know what it means, David.
I've been catfished nine times.
Oh, that's too bad.
You want to go in the garage and talk about it sometime?
Oh, you'd love that, wouldn't you?
[ Chuckles ]
Nobody pays full price at Bed Bath Beyond.
The Beyond stands for 20% off coupon.
All right.
Go back into your troll hole.
Oh, my God!
Hey, Brit!
David didn't use a coupon at the BBB.
What a fucking tool!
"Pursuant to the requirements set out by Illinois Statute 225 ILCS-107,
I am required to inform you that I am not a licensed psychologist, psychiatrist, or registered therapist." You forgot doctor.
You're not a doctor, either, remember?
Look, Kendra, this is weird enough.
I mean, you're Doug's sister.
We grew up together.
Yeah, well, I think you caused a lot of damage in me, so...
[ Sighs ]
"But that these therapy sessions are being tape-recorded to provide a record of the 1,920 supervised clinical hours needed to acquire such a license." Great.
That way, your boss can hear how you wrecked my childhood.
[ Tape recorder clicks ] Kendra, I told you,
I shouldn't even be seeing you as a therapist.
It's unethical.
Okay, that is a lie.
I looked it up, and the Internet says it is a gray area.
[ Sighs ]
[ Tape recorder clicks ]
So, Miss Harnz, you seem to have some pretty profound anger issues.
Would you care to discuss?
Um, well, I think that you are a source of my rage.
Okay.
That adds another layer to what we're doing here.
Where do you want to start?
Okay.
Is that your diary?
"May 10, 1996.
My first holy communion.
The wafers were crunchier than I thought, and the wine made me feel funny.
We had a big party afterwards.
Everything was going great until David and Doug came in with Super Soakers and super-soaked me."
[ Chuckles ] That is still funny to you?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You know what I did after that?
I ate a whole bowl of potato salad alone in a closet in a wet gown.
You didn't change clothes?
No.
It was your house.
That closet was probably full of dry clothes.
Okay, well, I'm just saying it because I -- it was the first time of a lot of times that I was really sad in a closet.
Oh, for God's sake.
Oh, for God's sake, listen up.
I don't know why they think they can talk to me like that.
Are you referring to your patients or your family?
My family.
Well, really just my stepbrother, Barry.
Have you considered there may be some truth behind what he's saying?
No.
I don't think so.
Have you tried looking at the relationship from his perspective?
He's not a good person.
Perhaps this is an opportunity for you to examine how Barry perceives you.
I mean, maybe there's something you can learn from his critiques.
He's a public toilet at a Metallica concert.
Do you know what I'm saying?
I understand "public toilet."
Yeah.
It really could be anywhere.
He's a public toilet.
Imagine... that Barry is injured.
Good.
That -- Was that the point of it?
No.
Mnh-mnh.
Oh, okay.
Oh, I thought it was just to make me feel good.
That was just the --
Okay.
I'm sorry.
The lead in.
So, I'm just curious.
Uh, how did you find my ad?
Were you referred by a friend or...?
Actually, I Googled "Chicago free therapy,"
and your Craigslist ad was on the first page.
Wow.
First page.
Do you remember how far down it was on the first page?
It doesn't matter.
It was on the bottom.
I had to scroll down quite a bit.
Maybe could have been the second page.
We don't -
- We don't need to get into all that.
But that's great.
Um, so what's going on with you?
I play basketball at my college.
I'm a starter.
Nice!
It is.
But I'm having trouble getting my teammates to back me up on the court.
I played in high school.
I'm pretty good at sports.
I was a point guard, obviously, 'cause of my body type.
But I had a lot of post moves, even against taller guys.
You get the back in there...
which was tough, 'cause my center of gravity is, like, here.
I don't have the thickest legs, but, uh... the ball handling was elite.
And my shot was...
hmm, better than streaky.
What I'm trying to say is if I caught fire, I was money.
Cool.
My problem is I'm not really able to trash-talk to the other teams.
Trash talk?
Oh, come on.
That's like half the fun of basketball.
I saw your mom last night.
Mmm.
She looked good.
That's not possible.
My mom's in Florida right now.
Oh, no, you're not supposed to take the trash talking literally.
That's not the point.
[ Chuckles ]
Also, I wasn't done yet.
I was gonna say,
"I had sex with your mom last night in a very graphic way."
My mom's a good Christian woman.
Of course.
Of course she is.
I'm sorry.
I was trash talking.
"December 23, 2000.
Looks like Santa brought me my present early.
My last baby tooth finally fell out."
[ Chuckles ] I'm sorry.
There is nothing funny about a 15-year-old with baby teeth.
Um, objectively speaking, I have to disagree.
Okay, you know what?
I will see you next week.
Oh, Kendra, no, come on!
Maybe you will have it together by then.
I'm sorry.
Baby teeth kill me!
Kendra!
I was brought up not to insult people or curse or any of that stuff.
So it's just unnatural for me to talk like that.
I have an idea.
I've always found the best thing to do is to attack a person's physical attributes, even if it's not true.
Watch.
I'll have you say this as if I'm your opponent.
[ Chuckles ]
I'm not saying that.
Oh.
Uh... the vulgarity's kind of the point.
Would you feel comfortable saying "titty baby"?
It means, uh, someone who is still acting like a child so much that they're still sucking on their mom's tits...for milk.
I just don't know where it all came from.
Kendra was so mad.
You know my sister.
She just gets mad sometimes.
Well, this was very targeted and specific hatred.
She holds on to things.
I forget, but I think she has a photographic memory.
[ Soft jazz playing ]
Doug, did you just see what Julia did to you?
Yeah, it's kind of her thing.
She can't do that.
Sure she can.
She's the boss.
Doug, seriously, that's our superior.
How does it make you feel when she's that inappropriate to you?
I feel flattered.
I feel desired.
I feel masculine.
Hey, Dougie.
Is that a phone in your back pocket?
Yeah, why?
'Cause that ass is calling me.
And masculine.
Did I say masculine?
Remember that guy I was telling you about -
- Luther?
Yeah, yeah.
That's not really a name you forget about easily.
So, um, that's still an ongoing thing?
No, not as of last week.
Oh, that's awes...ful.
What?
That's awsful.
That's awful.
It's, uh...
That is too bad.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What the fuck?
Doug!
Doug, it's Horse.
You got to let me get a shot off for the game to start.
Sorry.
I'm a natural defender.
Hey, why don't we play with those guys over there?
Ah, we can't.
You see the guy in blue?
He's one of my patients.
Are you allowed to tell me that?
Probably not.
I fouled.
My bad.
It's on me, yeah.
Why are you spying on him?
I'm observing.
When you're a therapist, it's called observing, Doug.
Oh.
Travel -- your ball.
What are you doing?
Dude, what the fuck?
!
[ Net swishes ] Horse!
I have, um...
a lot of dark thoughts in my waking state and in my sleep.
Mm-hmm.
Um, I have trouble leaving the house.
I have a...
fear of rejection.
Mm-hmm.
And heights.
Mm-hmm.
And I think everybody hates me.
And I'm afraid of death and birds.
Okay, so you're starting with just a bullet-point list of all the stuff.
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
That's fine.
Um, are you sure we don't know each other?
I didn't go to high school around here, so...
Okay, sorry.
Never mind.
Keep going.
Um, I have this stepbrother.
Mm-hmm.
He's a real piece of shit.
[ Laughs ] I can relate to this.
Really?
Oh.
More than you know.
Oh, really?
I'd get into it, but...
Sure.
But, yeah.
What is it about him that bothers you?
He's an idiot, you know?
He's stupid.
Oh, yeah, I can relate.
He likes stupid stuff.
We're on the same page.
Yeah.
He thinks he's better than everybody else.
Yeah, but probably has no reason to think that.
Yep.
Yep.
Yeah, we're definitely tracking.
This is, uh...
He's got a dumb face, like a face that you just want to punch but you can't.
Sure.
You know?
Have you tried looking at the relationship through his perspective?
[ Scoffs ] I can't even, because he's such a loser.
You know?
In fact, one time, I caught him masturbating to a skateboarding magazine.
[ Laughs ]
What?
Yeah.
Yeah, he was drooling looking at the half pipes.
He's a real sicko.
[ Laughs ]
[ Barry laughing ]
All right.
[ Screams ]
Oh, yeah!
You think it's real funny, wasting my time with your stupid jokes?
It was pretty funny, man.
Relax.
Dude, he got you pretty good.
Oh, he got me good?
Yeah, I got you, man.
You got me good, huh?
Take a joke, bro.
I'm trying to help people in there, all right, and you're wasting my time, and for the record, it wasn't a skateboarding magazine.
It was a Playboy wrapped inside of a skateboarding magazine.
What in the world is going on out here?
!
The neighbors can hear this.
Yeah, and I just fixed this railing, by the way.
Your idiot son thinks he's being funny, but he's wasting my time.
Renetta?
David, Barry is not an idiot.
Okay, fine, he's an asshole, then.
Yeah, this asshole just took a deuce on your fake therapy sessions.
A what?
You're ruining our lives.
Renetta:
Barry.
Barry, I want you to come inside with me right now.
Kyle, go home.
You got it, Mrs. T.
Everybody knows this moron?
Hey, man, just think of it as fake practice for your fake practice.
Shut up.
Get inside.
Inside right now.
Rollie:
What the hell did he say anyway?
He got one of his friends to pretend to be a patient, tried to embarrass me with stuff he knows about me.
The skateboarding magazine stuff?
No, it was a Playboy wrapped inside --
Look, David, we all know you're going through a tough time, okay?
And your mom told me she cosigned those loans.
[ Sighs ]
Rollie...
It's all right.
I mean, if we're gonna go down, we're all gonna go down together.
We're not going down.
I don't know.
That's a lot of ones and zeros, I tell you.
But, look, I know you're all about this being a doctor thing, but things change.
You know, there's a lot of ups and downs in life.
Look at me.
Before I met your mom, I was a single dad in the '90s living with a kid who was a complete...
Well, you know Barry.
Yeah.
[ Refrigerator door slams ] Barry...
I know you think you have to act like a tough guy, but I can see underneath all that, and I know that somewhere in there, you are nothing but a sweetheart.
What are you talking about?
I'm not sweet.
What is wrong with this orange?
Is it real?
Just...
I was so angry all the time.
My mind was just a polluted ocean full of crap with fish swimming around in nets.
And, you know, you'd cut them open, they'd be full of bottle caps and six-pack rings.
I mean, the madness just wouldn't stop.
Thanks, Rollie.
This is helping.
But, hey, instead of just teeing off on people and wanting to jack somebody all the time, now I count to 200.
What?
I'm serious.
This works.
Try it with me.
One... two... three, four...
Three, four...
Well, you know I went down to the Y to cancel my dance class because things are pretty tight around here.
And what do you know.
Someone had prepaid my dance class through the end of the year.
Do you know who that someone was?
No.
It was you, Barry.
You can't prove it.
That guy paid cash.
Shit.
[ Chuckles ] ...63, 64, 65...
...63, 64, 65...
Well, it's not the worst thing in the world to let people know you're a good person.
Please don't tell Brittany.
If she finds out I do nice shit for people...
Oh, no.
It's too soon in your relationship for that, no.
The expectations are just -- they're so low right now.
Keep them low.
It's the right move for the moment.
It's a sweet spot.
That's right.
...143, 144, 145...
...143, 144, 145...
Thanks, Rollie.
This is really helping.
Hey, hey, just let the exercise do its job.
...147, 148, 149, 150...
...147, 148, 149, 150...
What are you doing?
Um, waiting for my appointment.
And what else are you doing?
Flipping though this People magazine.
The reading material is for paying customers.
This is from 2007.
Are you saying there was no money in 2007?
Pay up or put it down.
I'm not paying for a magazine from 2007.
Then put it down.
I see you reading.
Come on.
Kid Rock got in a fight at a Waffle House.
I just want to know what happened.
The charges were dropped.
Give me the magazine.
[ Chuckles ]
This thing is so old.
[ Magazine thuds ]
So, confronting him is good sometimes?
Absolutely.
Focus on the conflict at hand.
Advocate for yourself, and then let go.
Stop reliving that injury.
David, I understand it's very difficult to change our own thought patterns.
But the beauty is that we actually can.
Okay.
Meditating 12 minutes in the morning has been proven to change our most deeply ingrained thought patterns.
What's your understanding of meditation?
Uh, if you're able to focus on the cycle of the breath going in and out, particularly the nostrils...
Mm-hmm.
...then you can kind of slow down your thoughts so that as they appear, you kind of register them and see, like, "Okay, that's that thought,"
and then it kind of moves on.
And you see the next thought come up.
And you're like, "Okay, that's that thought."
And then that moves on.
And then, soon, you can kind of pick and choose which thoughts to focus on, but your ultimate goal is for all of them to fall.
That's a very good description.
I'd be mindful that you don't give yourself a headache.
How come?
Um... something was happening with your eyes while you were watching your thoughts.
Oh, well, no.
Your eyes are closed when you're meditating.
Great.
Yeah.
Just making sure.
[ Sighs ] All right, boys.
What do you want?
I don't have all night.
Doug, do you have something to say?
No, not really.
Okay, well, I... we are a little tired of all the sexual harassment.
You tell me who's doing this to you, and they are out of here tonight.
It's you.
[ Scoffs ] Are you serious?
You mean to tell me you're getting your little panties all in a wad over a few compliments.
See, that right there, we don't wear panties.
You would look good in them, especially Dougie.
You seen those new jeans he's got?
He practically paints them on.
Come on, Doug.
You heard what she just said.
Back me up here.
I mean, I did get a size too small on purpose.
I knew it.
Somebody leaving the candy out, trying to tempt me.
Okay, you can't say stuff like that.
David...
can we have the room... for professional reasons?
Get out now.
You've got to be kidding me.
David, your co-worker has asked you to leave the room.
I would like you to show him a little respect by honoring his request.
[ Door opens ]
Just...
[ Sighs ]
So, what happened with, uh, you and this Luther guy?
Um... well, uh, he said that I was -- I was too closed off.
That I wasn't 100% in or that I had too many walls up.
The usual.
The usual?
Is this something that you hear a lot?
Yeah.
Only in every relationship I've ever been in.
[ Chuckles ]
I mean, I know what it is.
It's a -
- It's a trust thing.
Okay.
Do you have a difficult time trusting people?
[ Chuckles ]
I guess my parents' horrible divorce gave me some trust issues.
Look, I -
- I know where it comes from.
I get it.
And it's not even --
I'm not even, like, sad about Luther.
I think I'm sad... about what that says about me.
Like, am I never gonna be able to trust anyone?
Or be in a real relationship?
Like, am I... am I gonna be alone forever because of this?
[ Chuckles ]
I just -
- I really -- I don't want my parents' shit to ruin my chance at being happy.
I'm really sorry that happened to you.
Me too.
It sounds like you dodged a bullet with this Luther guy.
So I think you should feel good about that.
Thanks.
Where did you meet this guy anyway?
Oh, I was walking a dog.
Oh, you have a dog?
No, no, no.
I -
- I love dogs, but, no, I-I just walk them.
Oh, okay.
But he has a dog.
Oh.
Who's gorgeous.
Dogs love me.
They come up to me.
Well, that's great.
Yeah.
Dogs have a good sense of people.
Well...
Personalities.
I like to -- Like, when I see a dog,
I like to try to communicate telepathically with it and let it know that I'm okay.
How do you do that?
Well, in my head, I just say, like, you know, you're a good boy and I'm a good boy.
[ Laughs ] What?
You say, "I'm a good boy"?
Yeah, well, I am.
I'm a good boy.
Yeah, but why do you need to tell a dog that?
'Cause I want the dog to believe that I'm a good boy, too.
We're both good boys.
We're gonna get along.
You know?
I don't even understand why I have to trash-talk.
It's all about distracting your opponent.
The more offensive the trash talking is, the more distracted the other player will be.
So just pretend that we're playing one-on-one.
I got the ball, you're guarding me.
I'm gonna hand you a card, and you're saying that to me like it's trash talk.
I tweaked it a little bit and took out the swearing for you.
Cool?
All right.
Okay, let's start.
You shoot so bad, they should charge you for free throws.
Okay, good, good.
All right, but this time, really mean it, all right?
I haven't seen a rebound that ugly since your father remarried.
Good, but still a little hesitant.
Be aggressive with it.
I haven't seen a rebound that ugly since your father remarried!
Good.
All right, I see the confidence in your shoulders.
Okay, you got some swagger.
Throw it at me.
You're insulting me.
I haven't stuffed anybody that hard since I deleted Grindr.
Yeah.
What's Grindr?
Doesn't matter.
Now you're on a roll, okay?
You're really meaning it.
Point it at me.
This is aggressive.
You hate my guts.
Say it.
I'm gonna cut off your face, wear it on my ass, and shit out your mouth!
Yeah, I went too far with that one.
I-I'm sorry.
But you're getting the hang of it.
"September 11, 2001.
David and Doug said they were going to give me a ride home from school, but they left without me."
That's your only takeaway from that day?
There's nothing in there about 9/11?
That's not the point.
Kendra, I'm happy that you're venting, but I don't see how this is helping you.
I do.
Let's see...
"November 26, 2001.
David promised to take me to the Fall Social, but stupid me.
He lied, and I fell for it."
Okay, all right, stop right there.
I-I-I never agreed to that.
Yes, you did!
No, I never said that -- Yes, you did!
You said you would go with me!
You've been blaming this on me for years.
I wouldn't make that up!
You said you'd go to the dance, and you didn't show up.
I remember never saying yes.
Okay, listen, you were watching the WWE Survivor Series with Doug and a bunch of his friends.
And I came in with pizza, and I was like... ♪ Ba da ba ba ba, I'm lovin' it ♪
And you said, "Shut up."
And then after the Rock won, I said,
"Do you want to go to the dance?"
And you said, "Sure, only if you can smell what the Rock is cooking."
And I said, "I can.
See you at 7:00."
And you said, "Yeah, sure, whatever."
Then there I was at 7:00... standing alone in the corner in a T.J. Maxx dress, 'cause that's all my mom could afford.
And I felt fucking stupid!
It was like, for once, I hoped things were gonna be different, and...they weren't.
Next stop, potato salad, alone in the closet.
[ Sighs ]
Kendra, I'm sorry.
Doug and I didn't even go to the dance.
We spent the whole night throwing two liters of soda off the overpass and watching them explode.
I know, 'cause I went to the fridge, and all the Mountain Dew was gone.
Double whammy.
Look...
I can't go into the past and fix any of that.
But if coming in here and telling me about all the ways that I hurt you makes you feel better, then I will listen for as long as it takes.
Good.
"November 27, 2001.
David told me that he got some fake throw-up, and I touched it, and it was real throw-up."
I think your mother's very attractive.
What?
That's game.
Okay, I got next.
I got next.
Dr. Tracy, what are you doing here?
I got a plan, okay?
I've been watching.
Look, you need to use profanity, okay?
I can't.
Yes, you can.
Follow my lead, all right?
All right, let's do this, okay?
Come on, let's roll.

Hey, call me a skinny-ass punk.
No, man.

Yeah!

Oh.
Oh, I'm a nasty man.
You need to start paying rent in my bathroom for how much you eat my shit.
Dude.

You're all looking at your future stepdads.

It's gonna be like "Full House," but with banging.
Okay.
You guys look upset, and I understand that.
What I want us all to do now is close our eyes and, um, count to 200.

I think I'm getting really good at this.
I'm having a lot of fun.

When Cookie Met Lucious is gonna be a game changer for us.
All I got to do is set up a meeting with Steve Cho...
LUCIOUS:
No, Steve Cho is no longer with our company.
COOKIE:
Uh, since when?
Since I hired somebody else.
I want you to meet
Byron Moore.
He's the best PR cat in the business.
And he has some interesting insights that he shared with me
- about the releasing of our...
- You know what?
- Just-just hit them, man.
- I think we should hold off releasing When Cookie Met Lucious for a few months.
- Are you joking?
- Wait a minute, what?
- Why the hell, why would we do that?
- Are you stupid?
- What the hell would...
- Inferno's...
Inferno's market awareness is through the roof.
Two Empire releases at the same time
- will cannibalize attention from both.
- Man.
- Excuse me, Byron.
- No, man.
Shut your dumb ass up.
Dad, I agreed to do a song with you, now you're pulling my album?
I'm not pulling your album;
your album's incredible.
But you only get one chance to release it out into the world.
Why do it under all this competition?
You need your own space.
My own space.
Damn, Dad.
- (stammers) Jamal!
- I'm-I'm serious, man.
He can't, he can't pull your album without my...
- Jamal!
- Byron, please go.
Explain it to him the way you explained it to me, please.
Look, I'm not trying to hurt him.
I'm actually trying to help him right now.
And I got a bridge in Brooklyn.
Back off, Lucious.
Look, Mr. Moore is the best PR cat in this business.
- He's worked with Giuliana on...
- Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!
She recommended him?
(chuckles) Hell no.
Lucious, this company belongs to me and...
No, it's our company.
It belongs to me and my family.
You keep that bitch out of my company.
See, it's reasons like that that you're kicked out of the damn casino.
Are you telling me I can't come to our casino in Vegas?
It's Giuliana's casino and mine.
And you've been black-booked, meaning you're prohibited.
You can't enter the premises of Laviticus Las Vegas.
(elevator bell dings)
Hey, where you going?
Wh-What happened?
Seems like my work here is done.
What, you want to take a free shot?
Giuliana?
I didn't imagine his head was that far up her ass.
But, look, I'm-I'm in shock.
I didn't see this coming.
Look, for the record, I respect your gangsta.
You're a good mother.
I'll keep my eyes and ears open for your granddaughter.
Uh, Thirsty.
(elevator bell dings)
Come to my house tonight.
- Huh?
- Yeah.
Having a little get-together.
Think you might like it.
(doorbell rings)
Welcome to the resistance.
You are officially Team Cookie now.
- THIRSTY:
And this is the team?
- COOKIE:
Mm-hmm.
Giuliana has Lucious pinky-tied.
We all know it.
He's cut off family members, friends, people who've had his back, all for Vegas, all for her.
And that's why this team is going to end her.
Yeah, you mean "end" her, right?
'Cause that bitch is cold.
I seen her pull a trig...
Shut your mouth.
No, no, no.
You seen her what?
You shut your mouth!
- Hey!

Hey, hey, everybody...
- Hey!

Thank you, Porsha.
Thank you.
Somebody with some sense.
Keep it together.
Now, listen, let me get one thing clear.
I don't want to do this.
I wish I didn't have to.
Giuliana is a cancer.
Not just to Lucious, but to the entire Empire.
To the family!
And if we don't root that bitch out,
- we all die.
- SHINE:
I'm sorry, Cookie.
I can't do it.
I can't work with this fool.
- I'm out.
- Are you serious?
Oh, Drop, you, too?
Oh, so y'all just gonna bitch up like that?
Say what you want.
COOKIE:
Oh, you just gonna snatch up gifts?
Wow.
Okay.
All right, all right, all right.
So we got eight.
There's eight of us if, Chicken and Marcel, y'all still coming to Vegas with Hakeem?
I'm in.
You?
COOKIE:
Yeah, soldiers.
We still got soldiers.
- Now we just got to get...
- No, Mom.
I'm just gonna stay here and wait for Bella.
No, Hakeem, listen.
There is nothing more important than getting Bella back.
- Nothing.
Right, Jamal?
- JAMAL:
Of course not.
But, I mean, I got an album coming out in ten days.
I will be back in time for the album release.
Look, this is not a side-hustle here!
If we don't end this bitch, there will be nothing left for you, for the album, for Bella, none of us.
Can't you see that?
Oh, okay.
This is great.
- You know I love you, Ma.
- Yeah.
Hmm.
Great plan, Mom.
Well, that obviously wasn't the right team.
Obviously not, Thirsty!
Hey, Cookie,
I can get the means to do whatever.
Who else can you trust?
BECKY:
I have some bad news.
I brought you in to explain that your recording budget has been cut.
The recording budget?
- It's just that...
- Becky, why in the hell has my hair and makeup budget been cut?
Take a number, sweetheart.
My budget got cut, too.
Um, your budget got cut because Andre curved your ass.
Do I need to toss you off another stage?
- Oh, my God.
- TIANA:
Oh.
- You want to try again?
- I didn't come here to fight.
Can we please not do this?
I just don't...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, ladies, ladies!
Please do not go all "Ten Duel Commandments" in here.
Okay, everybody got their budget cut.
It's got nothing to do with Hakeem, and it's got nothing to do with Andre, all right?
Everything outside of Lucious' Vegas show has been cut, including me and my check, okay?
We're all cut.
Grasshopper.
What do you say we take care of some business?
It's personal.
Why are you doing that?
No reason.
Did you put glass in here?
For Fatima's bastard.
Did you put glass...
He's not welcome in this house.
(doorbell rings)
(door opens)
Mr. Cousins is here for lunch with Mr. Lyon.
Miss Leah.
Look, um, lunch is gonna be a little bit delayed.
We had a little trouble with the kitchen.
Why am I here, and how the hell did you find me?
I mean, typically, a man in my position can find just about anybody that they're looking for, if they're important enough to 'em.
I mean, that's always been my experience.
But I've searched high and low to find this one person, and I keep coming up empty.
As you may or may not know...
Child Protective Services illegally entered my home and took my grandchild on trumped-up allegations of child endangerment.
Now, apparently she's been lost in this matrix of paperwork that they call a system.
And I'm asking you to use all of your expertise as an FBI agent... to find my grandchild.
I will give you whatever you want.
All right, the key to taking Giuliana down is her ledgers, which she keeps in a wall safe inside her office.
There's only one way in and one way out.
And me and Cookie are both banned.
CANDACE:
So we're going to sneak inside a casino and crack a safe?
THIRSTY:
Look, I know it sounds a little Hollywood, but, uh, Cookie has faith in you, and I believe in being prepared.
Now, we're not talking about the whole casino;
we're just talking about the VIP room,
- where high rollers do their thing.
- Oh.
Now, there's a security guard blocking that door.
Carol, you're gonna distract him by using whatever means necessary.
You cool with that?
Oh, baby, I'm cool with that.
Me and my means... are good to go.
BECKY: (chuckles) Yes, honey.
Okay, now, Candace, you and hubby will get Giuliana out that door by Kevin here posing as a high roller.
Blackjack is my middle name.
Right, babe?
That's right, baby.
THIRSTY:
Okey-dokey.
Now, behind this door, there's a hallway that leads to the vault in one direction and Giuliana's office in the other.
Now, the door can only be opened by using a four-digit security code that gets changed daily.
We get the number, and that gets us to the safecracking.
(whistles)
Marvin, roll it in.
Wow.
THIRSTY:
Yeah.
You got to think of this safe as a piggy bank on steroids.
It's not that deep.
So who's gonna crack that?
Uh, I'm not a safecra...
Look, I'm not gonna crack a safe.
I'll do it.
I used to boost department stores a lot.
No, ma'am.
Can you back your ass up?
You have the chill disposition we need, so you will crack the safe, Becky.
(knuckles crack)
(door opens)
(man grunts)
(grunts)
Only reason I'm doing this is because of a helpless, blameless little girl who happens to be my blood.
Didn't do anything to deserve getting caught up in this ugliness you perpetuate.
This is Sam.
Sam, this is Lucious.
He needs your help with something.
Hello, Sam.
It's nice to meet you.
I'm told that, um... you might have been contacted by somebody to forge some documents.
Documents for my granddaughter?
I've never seen that kid in my life.
And even if I had, I don't dime on paying clients.
He don't dime on paying clients.
(groaning)
Okay, just take your time, all right?
Relax your shoulders, breathe through it.
- CAROL:
So, these are cameras?
- CANDACE:
Yeah, just try one.
- Okay.
- Look there.
She'll show you.
THIRSTY:
Don't listen for the click.
Feel the click.
Oh, shut up, shut up.
I almost got it.
I got it.
Damn!
I just...
I don't know about this, Cookie.
Maybe we should just call this off.
No, no, we are not calling this off.
I haven't seen my Kevin this excited since...
Uh, I don't need to know what gets Kevin excited, okay?
KEVIN:
Blackjack!
Honey, I got a blackjack.
Okay, Kevin, we get it that you like black.
THIRSTY:
Becky, look at this.
It's just me and you, okay?
Focus.
Be confident.
Put your hands on the dial... and breathe.
(Becky and Thirsty breathing deeply)
(grunts)
TARIQ:
Who hired you?
Look, I'm not a bad guy.
You know, some poor orphan kid needs a shot at a decent life,
I get 'em out of the system, so maybe they won't become bottom-feeders.
Bottom-feeders?
Are you referring to these innocent children that's got no choice of where they are, thrown in a system...
you calling them bottom-feeders?
People like me and my brother?
How do you feel about that, brother?
I don't like it one bit, brother.
How you feel about it?
It hurts my feelings.
(Sam groaning)
That felt good.
Sorry it took so long for us to come together.
(panting)
I'm-a... go and get to a meeting.
Maybe you can get some more out of him.
Okay?
(softly):
Yeah.
I'm sorry it took us this long to get here.
(Sam groans)
This is called "open monitoring meditation."
So don't focus on the safe.
You focus on everything that exists.
Be aware of every sound.
Every sound.
Every thought.
Every thought.
Every memory...
let it flow through you.
Every memory's flowing through me.

KEVIN:
Lady luck is with me tonight!
- Bring it on.
- Honey, are you still going at it?
- We got to go.
- Oh, my dear, I'm ahead.
If you want some of this behind, you better scale up.
♪ Any of the above, now you harder to find. ♪
A first-class casino would've comped us a room and had these winnings secure in a safe by now.
- KEVIN:
Mm-hmm.
- You know, just saying.
Sir, madam.
If you would like, we could put your winnings
- in one of our vaults.
- Oh.
(crowd cheering)
Get off of me!
I will shut this place down!
Get your hands off of me!
My name is...!
Seems a little hectic here tonight.
If you don't mind,
I'd like to take a tour of the vault first.
One moment, sir.
COOKIE:
You are canceled!
Get off of me!
Get off of me!
Get off of me.
Okay, all right, okay!
Keep your hands to yourself!
High-roller on table four would like a tour of the vaults.
Meet me at the east security door, and make sure Cookie is out of this building.
Yes, ma'am.
COOKIE:
I will end your career, bitch!
Get off of me.
I can walk.
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh
♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey... ♪
Lucious.
Is everything okay?
Everything's absolutely fine.
Look, I know you've got concerns about Inferno's crowd, but I assure you, you'll be able to bring your husband and your kids to this place.
ANDRE:
My father is a man of his word, Ms. Frost.
I can assure you.
It's Mrs. Frost.
ANDRE:
Oh.
I'm Andre Lyon.
We haven't properly met, but I've heard wonderful things about you.
LUCIOUS:
I'm quite surprised that you're here.
You know I just had your mother thrown out.
Are you next?
Actually, I came by to warn you.
Unfortunately, I was too late.
So, I'm Empire's CFO.
If I can be of service to you in any way, please do not hesitate, let me know.
Thank you.
Andre?
- That's right.
- Andre.
Very kind of you.
(chuckles)
Did you see that bitch smirking down at me?
I should've threw my heel right at her neck.
- I did good, though, didn't I?
- Yeah.
Gave a little, little Kill Bill meets Casino, with the ass of Foxy Brown left up on there.
Uh, don't be looking at my ass.
No, I'm just...
Okay, look, they're headed to the security door.
GIULIANA:
Your winnings are totally secure, Mr. Mason.
All of our security are ex-military.
Oh.
That's nice to know.
Oh.
How grotesque.
Just sit your little debutante ass down right here, please.
Thank you.
Whatever.
Which screen is which?
All right, this is Carol, that's Becky, and there goes your little hubby right there.
GIULIANA:
We like to take extra special care of our high-rollers, like yourself.
How can I speak to him?
Grab the mic.
KEVIN:
Ooh, I can see that.
Eyes up, Kevin.
Mama's watching.
She too old to be showing that much cleavage.
(chuckles) THIRSTY:
I got to beg to differ.
- Those are nice.
- COOKIE:
Yeah, you would.
You like them big and fake, don't you?
GIULIANA:
The vault itself is state-of-the-art.
Well, as long as it's secure.
Do I look like the type of girl you can't trust?
(chuckles)
THIRSTY:
All right, listen up, y'all.
Code is: six, six, four, nine.
Becky, you got that?
Six, six, four, nine.
(sighs) I'm on it.
Right this way.
THIRSTY:
Give them time to get to the vault.
All right, Carol, it's your turn.
Strangé time.
That's the guy.
He's your target.
Go do your thing.
(sighs)
CAROL:
Hey, baby.
You know, a girl really feels safe with a big strapping brother like yourself keeping an eye on things.
Damn, my sister is a ho.
- Mm.
Thank God.
- GUARD:
If you're soliciting,
I will call the police.
Move along.
CAROL: (chuckles) Honey, I'm not a working girl.
But you know I can work it, right?
You don't want to come get a drink with me?
Ma'am, move away from the door.
Uh... (laughs) wait a minute.
You ain't got to call me "ma'am."
I'm probably younger than your big ass.
- He's not going for it.
- I know.
GUARD:
This is your final warning.
Step aside.
(quietly):
Ain't that a bitch.
All right, you know what, y'all?
I'm about to go to the bar while y'all figure this out, okay?
Hell no!
Okay, let me think, let me think for a minute.
Hurry up.
My man can't be entertaining Giuliana all night.
BECKY:
Oh, we're screwed.
How am I supposed to get past him?
He's not gonna budge.
Hold on, I think this freak is into Becky.
- What?
- Oh.
Hey, Becky, I think this dude is into you.
G-Go get your flirt on.
I am not trained for that.
Look, I can tell by the way he stands, he's in the military.
All right?
So just talk to him about military stuff.
And shake your ass, see if we can get him to "Oohrah."
All right, so, while she's shaking her ass and getting him to "Oohrah,"
who's gonna crack the safe, stupid?
- Carol.
- COOKIE and CANDACE:
Carol?
!
What?
!
Me?
- What we got.
It's what we got!
- Her?
!
Ooh, Negro, I know that's not your plan.
My...
To get the flightiest, flakiest one on the yard
- to crack the damn safe?
- CANDACE:
Really?
Look, I could've got my team together, but you're the one that wanted to have this little sisterhood of the traveling attitude on the road, so let's just deal with what we got!
You know, cut it out with the $10 jokes, looking like a sherbet pop.
Sit down!
Can we just deal with what we got?
- You know, Sit.
Sit!
- Could you just speak English?
This is exactly why I went Asian.
Let me guess.
Navy?
Nope.
BECKY:
Hmm.
Coast Guard?
Nope.
Army.
That's right.
Army Ranger.
BECKY:
Oh, you're a paratrooper.
Hi.
All right, go, go, go, now.
Six, six, four, nine.
- BECKY:
Nice to meet you.
- GUARD:
Pleasure.
BECKY:
Oh, my God, you're so much taller when you get close to me like that.
(Becky giggles)
- GUARD:
How have you been all night?
- BECKY:
I'm good.
Oh, you guys, I cannot do this.
Carol, you can and you will.
Just get in there and do it!
GUARD:
I'll be out of here soon.
BECKY:
Oh, soon?
How soon?
I'm almost done, too.
- (keypad beeping)
- GUARD:
Yeah?
- BECKY:
Yeah.
- GUARD:
What time?
THIRSTY:
All right, you're in.
BECKY:
Whenever you're off, I'm off.
(giggles):
Oh, my God.
I'm so bad.
(giggles)
THIRSTY:
Okay, walk into the room on your left.
That should be Giuliana's office.
Look for the painting behind the desk.
Good.
There you go.
The safe should be behind the painting.
Come on, Carol honey, we don't have a lot of time.
You can do it.
Bingo.
CAROL:
All right, you guys, listen, I can't do this;
my hands are shaking too much.
- Oh.
- Okay, all right.
Carol, yes you can and yes you will.
- I will come in and beat...
- (Candace whispers angrily)
Carol?
Carol, you got this.
Trying to act like you a damsel in distress when I know you got nerves of steel.
I'm telling you, I don't trust me.
COOKIE:
Oh, my God.
Okay.
All right.
(exhales)
Okay, okay, okay. (sniffles)
All right.
I got it.
Carol?
You got this, girl.
Look, I know I give you flak a lot.
But you made of steel, girl.
You got this.
Okay, Thirsty, but you gonna have to Mr. Miyagi my ass through this.
THIRSTY:
Okay, okay, we got you now.
Okay?
All you got to do is breathe.
(breathes deeply)
THIRSTY:
Carol?
Carol, are you there?
- Still nothing?
- Nothing.
(sighs)
And nobody saw her.
(door opens)
- COOKIE:
Carol.
- CANDACE:
Oh, my God.
COOKIE:
We lost video feed.
I thought something happened to you.
What happened?
We were scared you got caught.
What?
Bam!
(whooping, laughter)
Is that what we need?
Yeah, the gaming commissioner gets one look at these, it's multiple indictments for sure.
Yes, ding dong, the bitch is dead!
- Yes, baby!
- I knew you could do it.
CAROL:
Told you, I did it!
Yeah, y'all.
You know I'm a safecracker, right?
I'm a safecracker, right?
We know you like crack, but we ain't gonna get into it.
- CAROL:
Hey, Cookie!
- (laughs)
Fraudulent reporting, money laundering, consorting with criminals?
This is really bad.
You have seven kids?
Damn.
I mean... (chuckles)
They must be proud of their mother.
Well, I hope they're proud of me someday.
Right now, they hate how hard I work and wonder why I can't be with them at home.
Yeah, I understand that.
Mine are grown, but they will always need their mama.
Especially...
LUCIOUS:
Hakeem?
Frankly, I'm a bit disturbed to see that you've left him at a time of need.
You see, our youngest is going through a bit of a rough time right now.
Fortunately, I've been able to handle a few things while his mother has been here in Vegas, running around like a banshee.
Your last little stunt cost us a half a million dollars.
But it's worth it if it means I can get my gaming license.
So what are we calling this one?
"Charitable donation"?
I don't care what you call it.
But after reading these, the price might go up.
I didn't know Mormons took payoffs.
Wow.
You people really are prone to stereotypes.
- Come on.
- Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a lot of work to do.
"You people."
It's okay, come on.
Please.
Cookie, let's go.
Come on, you're gonna cost us some more money.
(mutters)
(sighs)
(sighs)
Wow.
You have an interesting family.
"Interesting" isn't the word I would've chosen.
Well, then.
I guess you're gonna have to help me find better words.
I'll get to work on that.
(chuckles)
(laughs softly)
COOKIE:
You talked to your father, right?
He said he expecting to know where she is today or tomorrow.
Yeah, I trust him on that.
It's the one thing I do trust him on.
You can trust him, too.
Who I shouldn't have trusted is that... shady-ass Mormon.
It's my own damn fault.
So, what, she a Mormon, you expect her not to be shady?
Ma, you just gonna have to dust yourself off and get back to work.
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
Now, sit down, so you can listen to my plan.
- Wait.
- No, no, no.
I got to tell you...
Sit down, boy, listen.
Now, y'all remember old Byron What's-His-Ass said we would never be able to go head-to-head with Inferno.
Well, I want to take them all by surprise and get out there tonight.
Tonight.
Mom...
Look, Coocious, the promo, still getting, like, 10,000 new streams a day.
Hmm.
When Lucious wakes up tomorrow morning,
I want the press to be all about how Inferno can't top When Cookie Met Lucious.
(chuckles)
And I want y'all to get out on that stage, together, and do a-a APB shout-out.
So people can look for Bella.
In front of all those millions of people.
That's a great idea, right?
Come on.
It's a beautiful idea,
- Ma, it really is.
But listen.
- I know it is.
I made a decision, okay?
(footsteps approaching)
Uh, what is he doing here?
Am I interrupting something?
You're always interrupting something.
And what you make a decision about?
I decided to hold off on the release of When Cookie Met Lucious until after Inferno.
Why?
'Cause I'm gonna join Dad's show in Vegas.
Ma, come on, it's a good thing.
It's good for all of us.
You know what I'm saying?
It'll get everybody really hype.
Is that what your father's telling you?
LUCIOUS:
What, you think I'm lying to him?
He doesn't care about you, boy, he just wants to win.
No, I want us all to win.
That's the whole point of this.
The stuff that he's saying on this album,
I mean, the things that he's saying to me,
I'm finally hearing him, and it's something that I think the critics and that his fans, if they got a chance to hear it...
- Oh, shut up.
- But they won't get a chance to listen to what I've heard if all they're hearing is noise from Inferno.
Mom, come on.
This is what I've been waiting... this is what both of us have been waiting for.
You know, he's actually hearing us.
You know you can't trust him.
You know you can't trust him.
Ma, how you gonna say don't trust him?
When you just told me to trust him about Bella.
- Boy...
- JAMAL:
Yeah.
HAKEEM:
How can I trust him about my own daughter?
JAMAL:
And that's a baby.
Like, that's ten times more important than our stupid record.
LUCIOUS:
Wait, wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Y'all just ganging up on her right now.
She's having a hard time; maybe she just needs a few minutes to think things through.
Give her some space.
Mom, please.
Come on, don't be like that.
- Mom.
- LUCIOUS:
Just let her go.
She came for me hard, had her feelings hurt.
Maybe she just needs to lick her wounds.
(elevator bell dings)
♪
(humming tune)
Okay, here we go.
Come on, my little Bella.
(fusses)
All right.
- (line rings)
- WOMAN:
Hello, Mrs. DuBois?
We just finished our walk.
We're at the gate.
(line ringing)
LUCIOUS (over phone):
Lucious here.
Leave a message. (beep)
Yo, it's Tariq.
I found her.
I'm on my way.
(engine starts)
Your father...
ANDRE:
I heard.
Vegas was a bust.
I was just trying to get Giuliana arrested.
Don't give up just yet.
No.
Dre, I-I'm done.
That's a shame.
'Cause I'm just getting started.
Boy, it's over.
Okay?
And I'm...
I know you heard that frosty bitch is all in your daddy's pocket.
Charlotte may have taken Pop's money, but she has no loyalty to him.
How do you know who she's loyal to?
We've had our own private conversations.
Dre.
I'm your mama.
Boy, give me the 411.
All right.
(inhales)
(clears throat)
Charlotte doesn't have a problem taking payoffs as long as she tithes to her church.
But she is deadly serious about keeping the thug element out of Vegas.
Now, anything jumps off, anything at all, she will snuff out Inferno before Pop can even strike a match.
Hmm.
So she doesn't like thugs running amok in her town.
Well, we'll just have to give her Biggie and Pac times ten.
(glasses clink)
LUCIOUS:
I owe you everything.
You found my grandbaby.
Please, don't keep me in suspense.
Oh, never that, my brother.
(chuckles)
"Brother." Yo.
A lot's gone down between us, man.
I never thought we'd get here.
Neither did I.
Yeah.
You know, once Bella comes back home,
I think you and me, we should really sit down and talk about how we can look after each other, the way brothers are supposed to, you know, as a family.
Yeah.
We should drink to that.
You're not a Mormon, are you?
(laughs):
No, brother.
Yo, you gonna need all the family you got.
Wait till you find out where I found Bella.
(gagging)
What in the hell is wrong with you?
!
(gasping)
Tariq.

Previously on Empire...
I took the liberty of calling the FBI ahead of time, and I packed you something, just to give you a fighting chance.
Casinos, you know.
They have live shows, but our show itself... is the show.
You betrayed me one time too many.
Boy, you must be off your meds, thinking you're gonna come at your daddy like this.
I told you, I'm not doing that deal with Lucious.
Lucious is not our biggest problem.
It's that bitch, Giuliana.
I thought I'd fly into town and make sure Lucious and I were still on the same page.
Inferno is the Vegas deal, Cookie.
We can't seem to find your daughter.
- What?
!
- I want my daughter, man!
All right, let them have it.
Welcome to Laviticus, Las Vegas.
I would love to make a toast to you guys.
To Charlotte.
Without you, none of this would've been possible.
Giuliana and I are forever grateful.
- Ma'am.
- No, thank you.
No, it's okay.
It's a non-alcoholic cider.
That's perfect.
Well, I think it's time you people...
I mean, you hip-hop people have a proper seat at the table here in Vegas.
I just hope it continues to go smoothly.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Have a look, sir.
Handle it.
Done.
Excuse me, everyone.
I have to attend to something downstairs for a minute.
Are we done?
Okay, okay, okay.
That's it?
Okay.
Let's see.
Come on, give me some.
Lucky night.
Yes.
I'm betting it all on black, baby.
- Don't matter what number.
- You always bet on black.
I told you not to do this.
What am I doing?
The gaming commissioner is right upstairs, and you're not gonna cost us our license.
Our license?
As in yours and mines?
Or are you talking about that bitch who's dragging you around by your salty gonads?
Okay, get her out of here.
Don't touch me.
I can walk.
Wait, I'm not going nowhere without my money.
Hey, free chips!
Hey!
Get your hands off of me!
Get off of me!
I will shut this place down!
That goes for you, too, you irrelevant bitch!
You are canceled!
Get off of me!
Get off of me!
It's times like this that the family needs to stay together.
And trust me, we are united on this one.
Yes, Hakeem, and you know it's our top priority that we find and bring Bella home.
That's the only thing that matters.
Yeah, stay strong, little brother.
That's Bella.
No, no, no, Hakeem.
She got my daughter.
- Hakeem.
Get him.
- Keem.
- You took my daughter?
!
- Hakeem, stop that.
- Hakeem, wait.
- Excuse me.
Stop, stop, stop!
- It's not her.
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry.
- Man, it's a little boy.
It's not Bella.
Come on.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I thought it was her, Ma.
I know, baby.
Come here.
Look, take him upstairs to my office, okay?
Yeah.
That's the third time he's done that.
Every time he sees a baby, he thinks it's Bella.
Yeah, well, I know the right person
- that could help find Bella.
- Okay.
I'm-a track him down, and then I'm-a let you know when I find out.
I got to hit a meeting.
Wait a minute.
Hakeem needs us right now.
Giuliana's waiting for me.
Inferno is gonna be the biggest live show Las Vegas has ever seen.
We're gonna do for the Strip what Hamilton did for Broadway.
It's gonna be hot.
You got to trust me on this, Charlotte.
Everybody thinks they're gonna be the next Hamilton, Giuliana.
Look, I've heard this pitch a million times.
Yeah, but what you haven't heard is my new music.
No, thank you.
I don't drink.
I respect that.
Can I get you some coffee?
No, I don't drink alcohol or coffee.
I'm Mormon.
Silly me.
All this time, I thought you was Mexican.
And I thought you were black, but I have no idea whether you're Muslim or Christian or anything else, because I don't make assumptions on your religion
- based on race or ethnicity.
- Wait a minute.
I was just making a joke.
- I wasn't trying to...
- Sorry.
I have to have lunch with my old pal Rudy.
Lucious, listen to me.
Make sure this Inferno doesn't open up the gates of my town to a bunch of hip-hop hooligans from hell.
Giuliana.
Thank you, Charlotte.
Thank you for coming.
A Mormon?
Yeah, I should've known that.
Okay?
My bad.
I'm sorry.
It's a little too late for "I'm sorry."
You could've cost us our gaming license.
Mormons run the gaming commission.
We can't afford to offend anyone.
Those the same ledgers from your office safe in Vegas?
Why are you in my business?
Yes, they are.
I take them with me everywhere.
- They never leave my side.
- Because Mr. Lyon's business is my business, that's why;
And it's just a question,
- so don't get your panties in a bunch.
- Thirsty.
So, this is what we're spending to keep the thugs off the premises.
I'm sure that Charlotte is expecting some sort of melee.
Lucious, he's just so sloppy.
That's just how he dresses, sweetie.
No.
I don't trust him.
Thirst, you like that champagne?
Yeah.
Take it with you.
You're fired.
We need something more, honey.
These lights are boring me.
Especially coming up right here.
Yes!
You got to keep your job.
Baby, that's right.
Porsha.
Yes, get me the VIP list for Jamal's album release party.
I need to add a few names.
Add a few names, dummy.
Yes, Jamal!
That was amazing.
Y'all can chill for just a second, y'all.
- Thanks, Danny.
- Yeah.
Thanks.
- Ma.
- Yes.
So, I tried to throw in there the whole thing about Keem and the baby;
It just, it didn't fit.
Baby, it was beautiful.
Okay?
When Cookie Met Lucious is gonna be a game changer for us.
All I got to do is set up a meeting with Steve Cho...
No, Steve Cho is no longer with our company.
Since when?
Since I hired somebody else.
I want you to meet
Byron Moore.
He's the best PR cat in the business.
And he has some interesting insights that he shared with me
- about the releasing of our...
- You know what?
- Just-just hit them, man.
- I think we should hold off releasing When Cookie Met Lucious for a few months.
- Are you joking?
- Wait a minute, what?
- Why the hell, why would we do that?
- Are you stupid?
- What the hell would...
- Inferno's...
Inferno's market awareness is through the roof.
Two Empire releases at the same time
- will cannibalize attention from both.
- Man.
- Excuse me, Byron.
- No, man.
Shut your dumb ass up.
Dad, I agreed to do a song with you, now you're pulling my album?
I'm not pulling your album;
Your album's incredible.
But you only get one chance to release it out into the world.
Why do it under all this competition?
You need your own space.
My own space.
Damn, Dad.
- Jamal!
- I'm-I'm serious, man.
He can't, he can't pull your album without my...
- Jamal!
- Byron, please go.
Explain it to him the way you explained it to me, please.
Look, I'm not trying to hurt him.
I'm actually trying to help him right now.
And I got a bridge in Brooklyn.
Back off, Lucious.
Look, Mr. Moore is the best PR cat in this business.
He's worked with Giuliana on...
She recommended him?
Hell no.
Lucious, this company belongs to me and...
No, it's our company.
It belongs to me and my family.
You keep that bitch out of my company.
See, it's reasons like that that you're kicked out of the damn casino.
Are you telling me I can't come to our casino in Vegas?
It's Giuliana's casino and mine.
And you've been black-booked, meaning you're prohibited.
You can't enter the premises of Laviticus Las Vegas.
Hey, where you going?
Wh-What happened?
Seems like my work here is done.
What, you want to take a free shot?
Giuliana?
I didn't imagine his head was that far up her ass.
But, look, I'm-I'm in shock.
I didn't see this coming.
Look, for the record, I respect your gangsta.
You're a good mother.
I'll keep my eyes and ears open for your granddaughter.
Thirsty.
Come to my house tonight.
Yeah.
Having a little get-together.
Think you might like it.
Welcome to the resistance.
You are officially Team Cookie now.
And this is the team?
Giuliana has Lucious pinky-tied.
We all know it.
He's cut off family members, friends, people who've had his back, all for Vegas, all for her.
And that's why this team is going to end her.
Yeah, you mean "end" her, right?
'Cause that bitch is cold.
I seen her pull a trig...
Shut your mouth.
No, no, no.
You seen her what?
You shut your mouth!
- Hey!
- Hey, hey, everybody...
- Hey!
- Come on!
Get your hands off me!
Everybody, be quiet!
Shut up!
Quit acting like a bunch of bitches!
Thank you, Porsha.
Thank you.
Somebody with some sense.
Keep it together.
Now, listen, let me get one thing clear.
I don't want to do this.
I wish I didn't have to.
Giuliana is a cancer.
Not just to Lucious, but to the entire Empire.
To the family!
And if we don't root that bitch out,
- we all die.
- I'm sorry, Cookie.
I can't do it.
I can't work with this fool.
- I'm out.
- Are you serious?
Drop, you, too?
So y'all just gonna bitch up like that?
Say what you want.
You just gonna snatch up gifts?
Wow.
Okay.
All right, all right, all right.
So we got eight.
There's eight of us if, Chicken and Marcel, y'all still coming to Vegas with Hakeem?
I'm in.
You?
Yeah, soldiers.
We still got soldiers.
- Now we just got to get...
- No, Mom.
I'm just gonna stay here and wait for Bella.
No, Hakeem, listen.
There is nothing more important than getting Bella back.
- Nothing.
Right, Jamal?
- Of course not.
But, I mean, I got an album coming out in ten days.
I will be back in time for the album release.
Look, this is not a side-hustle here!
If we don't end this bitch, there will be nothing left for you, for the album, for Bella, none of us.
Can't you see that?
Okay.
This is great.
- You know I love you, Ma.
- Yeah.
Great plan, Mom.
Well, that obviously wasn't the right team.
Obviously not, Thirsty!
Hey, Cookie,
I can get the means to do whatever.
Who else can you trust?
I have some bad news.
I brought you in to explain that your recording budget has been cut.
The recording budget?
- It's just that...
- Becky, why in the hell has my hair and makeup budget been cut?
Take a number, sweetheart.
My budget got cut, too.
Um, your budget got cut because Andre curved your ass.
Do I need to toss you off another stage?
My God.
- You want to try again?
- I didn't come here to fight.
Can we please not do this?
I just don't...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, ladies, ladies!
Please do not go all "Ten Duel Commandments" in here.
Okay, everybody got their budget cut.
It's got nothing to do with Hakeem, and it's got nothing to do with Andre, all right?
Everything outside of Lucious' Vegas show has been cut, including me and my check, okay?
We're all cut.
Grasshopper.
What do you say we take care of some business?
It's personal.
Why are you doing that?
No reason.
Did you put glass in here?
For Fatima's bastard.
Did you put glass...
He's not welcome in this house.
Mr. Cousins is here for lunch with Mr. Lyon.
Miss Leah.
Look, um, lunch is gonna be a little bit delayed.
We had a little trouble with the kitchen.
Why am I here, and how the hell did you find me?
I mean, typically, a man in my position can find just about anybody that they're looking for, if they're important enough to 'em.
I mean, that's always been my experience.
But I've searched high and low to find this one person, and I keep coming up empty.
As you may or may not know...
Child Protective Services illegally entered my home and took my grandchild on trumped-up allegations of child endangerment.
Now, apparently she's been lost in this matrix of paperwork that they call a system.
And I'm asking you to use all of your expertise as an FBI agent... to find my grandchild.
I will give you whatever you want.
All right, the key to taking Giuliana down is her ledgers, which she keeps in a wall safe inside her office.
There's only one way in and one way out.
And me and Cookie are both banned.
So we're going to sneak inside a casino and crack a safe?
Look, I know it sounds a little Hollywood, but, Cookie has faith in you, and I believe in being prepared.
Now, we're not talking about the whole casino;
We're just talking about the VIP room, where high rollers do their thing.
Now, there's a security guard blocking that door.
Carol, you're gonna distract him by using whatever means necessary.
You cool with that?
Baby, I'm cool with that.
Me and my means... are good to go.
Yes, honey.
Okay, now, Candace, you and hubby will get Giuliana out that door by Kevin here posing as a high roller.
Blackjack is my middle name.
Right, babe?
That's right, baby.
Okey-dokey.
Now, behind this door, there's a hallway that leads to the vault in one direction and Giuliana's office in the other.
Now, the door can only be opened by using a four-digit security code that gets changed daily.
We get the number, and that gets us to the safecracking.
Marvin, roll it in.
Wow.
Yeah.
You got to think of this safe as a piggy bank on steroids.
It's not that deep.
So who's gonna crack that?
I'm not a safecra...
Look, I'm not gonna crack a safe.
I'll do it.
I used to boost department stores a lot.
No, ma'am.
Can you back your ass up?
You have the chill disposition we need, so you will crack the safe, Becky.
Only reason I'm doing this is because of a helpless, blameless little girl who happens to be my blood.
Didn't do anything to deserve getting caught up in this ugliness you perpetuate.
This is Sam.
Sam, this is Lucious.
He needs your help with something.
Hello, Sam.
It's nice to meet you.
I'm told that, um... you might have been contacted by somebody to forge some documents.
Documents for... my granddaughter?
I've never seen that kid in my life.
And even if I had, I don't dime on paying clients.
He don't dime on paying clients.
Okay, just take your time, all right?
Relax your shoulders, breathe through it.
- So, these are cameras?
- Yeah, just try one.
- Okay.
- Look there.
She'll show you.
Don't listen for the click.
Feel the click.
Shut up, shut up.
I almost got it.
I got it.
Damn!
I just...
I don't know about this, Cookie.
Maybe we should just call this off.
No, no, we are not calling this off.
I haven't seen my Kevin this excited since...
I don't need to know what gets Kevin excited, okay?
Blackjack!
Honey, I got a blackjack.
Okay, Kevin, we get it that you like black.
Becky, look at this.
It's just me and you, okay?
Focus.
Be confident.
Put your hands on the dial... and breathe.
Who hired you?
Look, I'm not a bad guy.
You know, some poor orphan kid needs a shot at a decent life,
I get 'em out of the system, so maybe they won't become bottom-feeders.
Bottom-feeders?
Are you referring to these innocent children that's got no choice of where they are, thrown in a system... you calling them bottom-feeders?
People like me and my brother?
How do you feel about that, brother?
I don't like it one bit, brother.
How you feel about it?
It hurts my feelings.
That felt good.
Sorry it took so long for us to come together.
I'm-a... go and get to a meeting.
Maybe you can get some more out of him.
Okay?
Yeah.
I'm sorry it took us this long to get here.
This is called "open monitoring meditation."
So don't focus on the safe.
You focus on everything that exists.
Be aware of every sound.
Every sound.
Every thought.
Every thought.
Every memory...
let it flow through you.
Every memory's flowing through me.
You're not touching the lock, you are the lock.
The lock is you.
You and the lock are one.
I am the lock.
I am the lock.
- I...
- Feel the click!
Am the lock.
I am the lock.
I am the...
All right, get up, bitches!
- Yes!
- We are going to Vegas!
Get up, bitches.
- Pack up your clothes.
- I am the lock!
I am the lock!
Whoo!
Vegas, baby, yes!
This is my kind of town, guys.
Hey, listen, when we get done this little gig we got to do,
I need for y'all to take me out on the town.
Carol, shut your mouth.
We just met these fools in the lobby.
Hey, wait a minute.
Why y'all turning the music down?
It's me.
You can do it from back here.
I'm kind of nervous.
Keep your faith in our plan.
Get it together before we get with Cookie.
Okay.
Welcome to Laviticus, Las Vegas.
Yeah, they paralegals.
Welcome to Laviticus Las Vegas.
Damn, you look hot, Chicken.
Lucious and Giuliana?
Upstairs in the club having dinner with the Mormon boss lady.
You know you can still let me open the safe, right?
Shut your stupid ass up before you blow your cover.
Lady luck is with me tonight!
- Bring it on.
- Honey, are you still going at it?
- We got to go.
- My dear, I'm ahead.
If you want some of this behind, you better scale up.
A first-class casino would've comped us a room and had these winnings secure in a safe by now.
You know, just saying.
Sir, madam.
If you would like, we could put your winnings in one of our vaults.
Get off of me!
I will shut this place down!
Get your hands off of me!
My name is...!
Seems a little hectic here tonight.
If you don't mind,
I'd like to take a tour of the vault first.
One moment, sir.
You are canceled!
Get off of me!
Get off of me!
Get off of me.
Okay, all right, okay!
Keep your hands to yourself!
High-roller on table four would like a tour of the vaults.
Meet me at the east security door, and make sure Cookie is out of this building.
Yes, ma'am.
I will end your career, bitch!
Get off of me.
I can walk.
Lucious.
Is everything okay?
Everything's absolutely fine.
Look, I know you've got concerns about Inferno's crowd, but I assure you, you'll be able to bring your husband and your kids to this place.
My father is a man of his word, Ms. Frost.
I can assure you.
It's Mrs. Frost.
I'm Andre Lyon.
We haven't properly met, but I've heard wonderful things about you.
I'm quite surprised that you're here.
You know I just had your mother thrown out.
Are you next?
Actually, I came by to warn you.
Unfortunately, I was too late.
So, I'm Empire's CFO.
If I can be of service to you in any way, please do not hesitate, let me know.
Thank you.
Andre?
- That's right.
- Andre.
Very kind of you.
Did you see that bitch smirking down at me?
I should've threw my heel right at her neck.
- I did good, though, didn't I?
- Yeah.
Gave a little, little Kill Bill meets Casino, with the ass of Foxy Brown left up on there.
Don't be looking at my ass.
No, I'm just...
Okay, look, they're headed to the security door.
Your winnings are totally secure, Mr. Mason.
All of our security are ex-military.
That's nice to know.
How grotesque.
Just sit your little debutante ass down right here, please.
Thank you.
Whatever.
Which screen is which?
All right, this is Carol, that's Becky, and there goes your little hubby right there.
We like to take extra special care of our high-rollers, like yourself.
How can I speak to him?
Grab the mic.
Ooh, I can see that.
Eyes up, Kevin.
Mama's watching.
She too old to be showing that much cleavage.
I - got to beg to differ.
- Those are nice.
- Yeah, you would.
You like them big and fake, don't you?
The vault itself is state-of-the-art.
Well, as long as it's secure.
Do I look like the type of girl you can't trust?
All right, listen up, y'all.
Six, six, four, nine.
Becky, you got that?
Six, six, four, nine.
I'm on it.
Right this way.
Give them time to get to the vault.
All right, Carol, it's your turn.
Strangé time.
That's the guy.
He's your target.
Go do your thing.
Hey, baby.
You know, a girl really feels safe with a big strapping brother like yourself keeping an eye on things.
Damn, my sister is a ho.
- Thank God.
- If you're soliciting,
I will call the police.
Move along.
Honey, I'm not a working girl.
But you know I can work it, right?
You don't want to come get a drink with me?
Ma'am, move away from the door.
Wait a minute.
You ain't got to call me "ma'am."
I'm probably younger than your big ass.
- He's not going for it.
- I know.
This is your final warning.
Step aside.
Ain't that a bitch.
All right, you know what, y'all?
I'm about to go to the bar while y'all figure this out, okay?
Hell no!
Okay, let me think, let me think for a minute.
Hurry up.
My man can't be entertaining Giuliana all night.
We're screwed.
How am I supposed to get past him?
He's not gonna budge.
Hold on, I think this freak is into Becky.
What?
Hey, Becky, I think this dude is into you.
G-Go get your flirt on.
I am not trained for that.
Look, I can tell by the way he stands, he's in the military.
All right?
So just talk to him about military stuff.
And shake your ass, see if we can get him to "Oohrah."
All right, so, while she's shaking her ass and getting him to "Oohrah,"
who's gonna crack the safe, stupid?
- Carol.
- Carol?
!
What?
!
Me?
- What we got.
It's what we got!
- Her?
!
Ooh, Negro, I know that's not your plan.
My...
To get the flightiest, flakiest one on the yard
- to crack the damn safe?
- Really?
Look, I could've got my team together, but you're the one that wanted to have this little sisterhood of the traveling attitude on the road, so let's just deal with what we got!
You know, cut it out with the $10 jokes, looking like a sherbet pop.
Sit down!
Can we just deal with what we got?
- You know, Sit.
Sit!
- Could you just speak English?
This is exactly why I went Asian.
Let me guess.
Navy?
Nope.
Coast Guard?
Nope.
Army.
That's right.
Army Ranger.
You're a paratrooper.
Hi.
All right, go, go, go, now.
Six, six, four, nine.
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.
My God, you're so much taller when you get close to me like that.
- How have you been all night?
- I'm good.
You guys, I cannot do this.
Carol, you can and you will.
Just get in there and do it!
I'll be out of here soon.
Soon?
How soon?
I'm almost done, too.
Yeah?
- Yeah.
- What time?
All right, you're in.
Whenever you're off, I'm off.
My God.
I'm so bad.
Okay, walk into the room on your left.
That should be Giuliana's office.
Look for the painting behind the desk.
Good.
There you go.
The safe should be behind the painting.
Come on, Carol honey, we don't have a lot of time.
You can do it.
Bingo.
All right, you guys, listen, I can't do this;
My hands are shaking too much.
Okay, all right.
Carol, yes you can and yes you will.
I will come in and beat...
Carol?
Carol, you got this.
Trying to act like you a damsel in distress when I know you got nerves of steel.
I'm telling you, I don't trust me.
My God.
Okay.
All right.
Okay, okay, okay.
All right.
I got it.
Carol?
You got this, girl.
Look, I know I give you flak a lot.
But you made of steel, girl.
You got this.
Okay, Thirsty, but you gonna have to Mr. Miyagi my ass through this.
Okay, okay, we got you now.
Okay?
All you got to do is breathe.
Carol?
Carol, are you there?
- Still nothing?
- Nothing.
And nobody saw her.
- Carol.
- My God.
We lost video feed.
I thought something happened to you.
What happened?
We were scared you got caught.
What?
Bam!
Is that what we need?
Yeah, the gaming commissioner gets one look at these, it's multiple indictments for sure.
Yes, ding dong, the bitch is dead!
- Yes, baby!
- I knew you could do it.
Told you, I did it!
Yeah, y'all.
You know I'm a safecracker, right?
I'm a safecracker, right?
We know you like crack, but we ain't gonna get into it.
Hey, Cookie!
Fraudulent reporting, money laundering, consorting with criminals?
This is really bad.
You have seven kids?
Damn.
I mean...
They must be proud of their mother.
Well, I hope they're proud of me someday.
Right now, they hate how hard I work and wonder why I can't be with them at home.
Yeah, I understand that.
Mine are grown, but they will always need their mama.
Especially...
Hakeem?
Frankly, I'm a bit disturbed to see that you've left him at a time of need.
You see, our youngest is going through a bit of a rough time right now.
Fortunately, I've been able to handle a few things while his mother has been here in Vegas, running around like a banshee.
Your last little stunt cost us a half a million dollars.
But it's worth it if it means I can get my gaming license.
So what are we calling this one?
"Charitable donation"?
I don't care what you call it.
But after reading these, the price might go up.
I didn't know Mormons took payoffs.
Wow.
You people really are prone to stereotypes.
- Come on.
- Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a lot of work to do.
"You people."
It's okay, come on.
Please.
Cookie, let's go.
Come on, you're gonna cost us some more money.
Wow.
You have an interesting family.
"Interesting" isn't the word I would've chosen.
Well, then.
I guess you're gonna have to help me find better words.
I'll get to work on that.
You talked to your father, right?
He said he expecting to know where she is today or tomorrow.
Yeah, I trust him on that.
It's the one thing I do trust him on.
You can trust him, too.
Who I shouldn't have trusted is that... shady-ass Mormon.
It's my own damn fault.
So, what, she a Mormon, you expect her not to be shady?
Ma, you just gonna have to dust yourself off and get back to work.
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
Now, sit down, so you can listen to my plan.
- Wait.
- No, no, no.
I got to tell you...
Sit down, boy, listen.
Now, y'all remember old Byron What's-His-Ass said we would never be able to go head-to-head with Inferno.
Well, I want to take them all by surprise and get out there tonight.
Tonight.
Mom...
Look, Coocious, the promo, still getting, like, 10,000 new streams a day.
When Lucious wakes up tomorrow morning,
I want the press to be all about how Inferno can't top When Cookie Met Lucious.
And I want y'all to get out on that stage, together, and do a-a APB shout-out.
So people can look for Bella.
In front of all those millions of people.
That's a great idea, right?
Come on.
It's a beautiful idea,
- Ma, it really is.
But listen.
- I know it is.
I made a decision, okay?
What is he doing here?
Am I interrupting something?
You're always interrupting something.
And what you make a decision about?
I decided to hold off on the release of When Cookie Met Lucious until after Inferno.
Why?
'Cause I'm gonna join Dad's show in Vegas.
Ma, come on, it's a good thing.
It's good for all of us.
You know what I'm saying?
It'll get everybody really hype.
Is that what your father's telling you?
What, you think I'm lying to him?
He doesn't care about you, boy, he just wants to win.
No, I want us all to win.
That's the whole point of this.
The stuff that he's saying on this album,
I mean, the things that he's saying to me,
I'm finally hearing him, and it's something that I think the critics and that his fans, if they got a chance to hear it...
- Shut up.
- But they won't get a chance to listen to what I've heard if all they're hearing is noise from Inferno.
Mom, come on.
This is what I've been waiting... this is what both of us have been waiting for.
You know, he's actually hearing us.
You know you can't trust him.
You know you can't trust him.
Ma, how you gonna say don't trust him?
When you just told me to trust him about Bella.
- Boy...
- Yeah.
How can I trust him about my own daughter?
And that's a baby.
Like, that's ten times more important than our stupid record.
Wait, wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Y'all just ganging up on her right now.
She's having a hard time;
Maybe she just needs a few minutes to think things through.
Give her some space.
Mom, please.
Come on, don't be like that.
- Mom.
- Just let her go.
She came for me hard, had her feelings hurt.
Maybe she just needs to lick her wounds.
Okay, here we go.
Come on, my little Bella.
All right.
Hello, Mrs. DuBois?
We just finished our walk.
We're at the gate.
Lucious here.
Leave a message.
Yo, it's Tariq.
I found her.
I'm on my way.
Your father...
I heard.
Vegas was a bust.
I was just trying to get Giuliana arrested.
Don't give up just yet.
No.
Dre, I-I'm done.
That's a shame.
'Cause I'm just getting started.
Boy, it's over.
Okay?
And I'm...
I know you heard that frosty bitch is all in your daddy's pocket.
Charlotte may have taken Pop's money, but she has no loyalty to him.
How do you know who she's loyal to?
We've had our own private conversations.
Dre.
I'm your mama.
Boy, give me the 411.
All right.
Charlotte doesn't have a problem taking payoffs as long as she tithes to her church.
But she is deadly serious about keeping the thug element out of Vegas.
Now, anything jumps off, anything at all, she will snuff out Inferno before Pop can even strike a match.
So she doesn't like thugs running amok in her town.
Well, we'll just have to give her Biggie and Pac times ten.
I owe you everything.
You found my grandbaby.
Please, don't keep me in suspense.
Never that, my brother.
"Brother." Yo.
A lot's gone down between us, man.
I never thought we'd get here.
Neither did I.
Yeah.
You know, once Bella comes back home,
I think you and me, we should really sit down and talk about how we can look after each other, the way brothers are supposed to, you know, as a family.
Yeah.
We should drink to that.
You're not a Mormon, are you?
No, brother.
Yo, you gonna need all the family you got.
Wait till you find out where I found Bella.
What in the hell is wrong with you?
!
Tariq.

I took the liberty of calling the FBI ahead of time, and I packed you something, just to give you a fighting chance.
Casinos, you know.
They have live shows, but our show itself... is the show.
You betrayed me one time too many.
Boy, you must be off your meds, thinking you're gonna come at your daddy like this.
I told you, I'm not doing that deal with Lucious.
Lucious is not our biggest problem.
It's that bitch, Giuliana.
I thought I'd fly into town and make sure Lucious and I were still on the same page.
Inferno is the Vegas deal, Cookie.
We can't seem to find your daughter.

- Oh, no, thank you.
No, it's okay.
It's a non-alcoholic cider.
Oh.
That's perfect.
Well, I think it's time you people...
I mean, you hip-hop people have a proper seat at the table here in Vegas.
I just hope it continues to go smoothly.

Excuse me, everyone.
I have to attend to something downstairs for a minute.
Are we done?
Okay, okay, okay.
That's it?
Okay.
Let's see.
Come on, give me some.
Lucky night.
Yes.
I'm betting it all on black, baby.
- Don't matter what number.
- You always bet on black.
I told you not to do this.
What am I doing?
The gaming commissioner is right upstairs, and you're not gonna cost us our license.
Mm, our license?
As in yours and mines?
Or are you talking about that bitch who's dragging you around by your salty gonads?
Okay, get her out of here.
Don't touch me.
I can walk.
Oh, wait, I'm not going nowhere without my money.
Hey, free chips!
Hey!
Get your hands off of me!
Get off of me!
I will shut this place down!
That goes for you, too, you irrelevant bitch!
You are canceled!
Get off of me!
Get off of me!
It's times like this that the family needs to stay together.
_
And trust me, we are united on this one.
Yes, Hakeem, and you know it's our top priority that we find and bring Bella home.
That's the only thing that matters.
Yeah, stay strong, little brother.
That's Bella.
No, no, no, Hakeem.
She got my daughter.
- Hakeem.
Get him.
- Keem.
- You took my daughter?
!
- Hakeem, stop that.
- Hakeem, wait.
- Excuse me.
Stop, stop, stop!
- It's not her.
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry.
- Man, it's a little boy.
It's not Bella.
Come on.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I thought it was her, Ma.
I know, baby.
Come here.
Look, take him upstairs to my office, okay?
Yeah.
That's the third time he's done that.
Every time he sees a baby, he thinks it's Bella.
Yeah, well, I know the right person
- that could help find Bella.
- Okay.
I'm-a track him down, and then I'm-a let you know when I find out.
I got to hit a meeting.
Uh, wait a minute.
Hakeem needs us right now.
Giuliana's waiting for me.

Inferno is gonna be the biggest live show Las Vegas has ever seen.
We're gonna do for the Strip what Hamilton did for Broadway.
It's gonna be hot.
You got to trust me on this, Charlotte.
Everybody thinks they're gonna be the next Hamilton, Giuliana.
Look, I've heard this pitch a million times.
Yeah, but what you haven't heard is my new music.
No, thank you.
I don't drink.
I respect that.
Can I get you some coffee?
No, I don't drink alcohol or coffee.
I'm Mormon.
Oh.
Silly me.
All this time, I thought you was Mexican.
And I thought you were black, but I have no idea whether you're Muslim or Christian or anything else, because I don't make assumptions on your religion
- based on race or ethnicity.
- Wait a minute.
I was just making a joke.
- I wasn't trying to...
- Oh.
Sorry.
I have to have lunch with my old pal Rudy.
Lucious, listen to me.
Make sure this Inferno doesn't open up the gates of my town to a bunch of hip-hop hooligans from hell.
Giuliana.
Thank you, Charlotte.
Thank you for coming.
A Mormon?
Yeah, I should've known that.
Okay?
My bad.
I'm sorry.
It's a little too late for "I'm sorry."
You could've cost us our gaming license.
Mormons run the gaming commission.
We can't afford to offend anyone.
Those the same ledgers from your office safe in Vegas?
Why are you in my business?
Yes, they are.
I take them with me everywhere.
- They never leave my side.
- Because Mr. Lyon's business is my business, that's why;
and it's just a question,
- so don't get your panties in a bunch.
- Thirsty.
So, this is what we're spending to keep the thugs off the premises.
I'm sure that Charlotte is expecting some sort of melee.
Lucious, he's just so sloppy.
That's just how he dresses, sweetie.
No.
I don't trust him.
Thirst, you like that champagne?
Yeah.
Take it with you.
You're fired.

Okay?
When Cookie Met Lucious is gonna be a game changer for us.
All I got to do is set up a meeting with Steve Cho...
No, Steve Cho is no longer with our company.
Uh, since when?
Since I hired somebody else.
I want you to meet
Byron Moore.
He's the best PR cat in the business.
And he has some interesting insights that he shared with me
- about the releasing of our...
- You know what?
- Just-just hit them, man.
- I think we should hold off releasing When Cookie Met Lucious for a few months.
- Are you joking?
- Wait a minute, what?
- Why the hell, why would we do that?
- Are you stupid?
- What the hell would...
- Inferno's...
Inferno's market awareness is through the roof.
Two Empire releases at the same time
- will cannibalize attention from both.
- Man.
- Excuse me, Byron.
- No, man.
Shut your dumb ass up.
Dad, I agreed to do a song with you, now you're pulling my album?
I'm not pulling your album;
your album's incredible.
But you only get one chance to release it out into the world.
Why do it under all this competition?
You need your own space.
My own space.
Damn, Dad.
- Jamal!
- I'm-I'm serious, man.
He can't, he can't pull your album without my...
- Jamal!
- Byron, please go.
Explain it to him the way you explained it to me, please.
Look, I'm not trying to hurt him.
I'm actually trying to help him right now.
And I got a bridge in Brooklyn.
Back off, Lucious.
Look, Mr. Moore is the best PR cat in this business.
- He's worked with Giuliana on...
- Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!
She recommended him?
Hell no.
Lucious, this company belongs to me and...
No, it's our company.
It belongs to me and my family.
You keep that bitch out of my company.
See, it's reasons like that that you're kicked out of the damn casino.
Are you telling me I can't come to our casino in Vegas?
It's Giuliana's casino and mine.
And you've been black-booked, meaning you're prohibited.
You can't enter the premises of Laviticus Las Vegas.
Hey, where you going?
Wh-What happened?
Seems like my work here is done.
What, you want to take a free shot?
Giuliana?
I didn't imagine his head was that far up her ass.
But, look, I'm-I'm in shock.
I didn't see this coming.
Look, for the record, I respect your gangsta.
You're a good mother.
I'll keep my eyes and ears open for your granddaughter.
Uh, Thirsty.
Come to my house tonight.
- Huh?
- Yeah.
Having a little get-together.
Think you might like it.
Welcome to the resistance.
You are officially Team Cookie now.
- And this is the team?
- Mm-hmm.
Giuliana has Lucious pinky-tied.
We all know it.
He's cut off family members, friends, people who've had his back, all for Vegas, all for her.
And that's why this team is going to end her.
Yeah, you mean "end" her, right?
'Cause that bitch is cold.
I seen her pull a trig...
Shut your mouth.
No, no, no.
You seen her what?
You shut your mouth!
- Hey!
- Hey, hey, everybody...
- Hey!
- Come on!
Get your hands off me!
Everybody, be quiet!
Shut up!
Quit acting like a bunch of bitches!
Thank you, Porsha.
Thank you.
Somebody with some sense.
Keep it together.
Now, listen, let me get one thing clear.
I don't want to do this.
I wish I didn't have to.
Giuliana is a cancer.
Not just to Lucious, but to the entire Empire.
To the family!
And if we don't root that bitch out,
- we all die.
- I'm sorry, Cookie.
I can't do it.
I can't work with this fool.
- I'm out.
- Are you serious?
Oh, Drop, you, too?
Oh, so y'all just gonna bitch up like that?
Say what you want.
Oh, you just gonna snatch up gifts?
Wow.
Okay.
All right, all right, all right.
So we got eight.
There's eight of us if, Chicken and Marcel, y'all still coming to Vegas with Hakeem?
I'm in.
You?
Yeah, soldiers.
We still got soldiers.
- Now we just got to get...
- No, Mom.
I'm just gonna stay here and wait for Bella.
No, Hakeem, listen.
There is nothing more important than getting Bella back.
- Nothing.
Right, Jamal?
- Of course not.
But, I mean, I got an album coming out in ten days.
I will be back in time for the album release.
Look, this is not a side-hustle here!
If we don't end this bitch, there will be nothing left for you, for the album, for Bella, none of us.
Can't you see that?
Oh, okay.
This is great.
- You know I love you, Ma.
- Yeah.
Hmm.
Great plan, Mom.
Well, that obviously wasn't the right team.
Obviously not, Thirsty!
Hey, Cookie,
I can get the means to do whatever.
Who else can you trust?
I have some bad news.
I brought you in to explain that your recording budget has been cut.
The recording budget?
- It's just that...
- Becky, why in the hell has my hair and makeup budget been cut?
Take a number, sweetheart.
My budget got cut, too.
Um, your budget got cut because Andre curved your ass.
Do I need to toss you off another stage?
- Oh, my God.
- Oh.
- You want to try again?
- I didn't come here to fight.
Can we please not do this?
I just don't...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, ladies, ladies!
Please do not go all "Ten Duel Commandments" in here.
Okay, everybody got their budget cut.
It's got nothing to do with Hakeem, and it's got nothing to do with Andre, all right?
Everything outside of Lucious' Vegas show has been cut, including me and my check, okay?
We're all cut.
Grasshopper.
What do you say we take care of some business?
It's personal.
Why are you doing that?
No reason.
Did you put glass in here?
For Fatima's bastard.
Did you put glass...
He's not welcome in this house.
Mr. Cousins is here for lunch with Mr. Lyon.
Miss Leah.
Look, um, lunch is gonna be a little bit delayed.
We had a little trouble with the kitchen.
Why am I here, and how the hell did you find me?
I mean, typically, a man in my position can find just about anybody that they're looking for, if they're important enough to 'em.
I mean, that's always been my experience.
But I've searched high and low to find this one person, and I keep coming up empty.
As you may or may not know...
Child Protective Services illegally entered my home and took my grandchild on trumped-up allegations of child endangerment.
Now, apparently she's been lost in this matrix of paperwork that they call a system.
And I'm asking you to use all of your expertise as an FBI agent... to find my grandchild.
I will give you whatever you want.
All right, the key to taking Giuliana down is her ledgers, which she keeps in a wall safe inside her office.
There's only one way in and one way out.
And me and Cookie are both banned.
So we're going to sneak inside a casino and crack a safe?
Look, I know it sounds a little Hollywood, but, uh, Cookie has faith in you, and I believe in being prepared.
Now, we're not talking about the whole casino;
we're just talking about the VIP room,
- where high rollers do their thing.
- Oh.
Now, there's a security guard blocking that door.
Carol, you're gonna distract him by using whatever means necessary.
You cool with that?
Oh, baby, I'm cool with that.
Me and my means... are good to go.
Yes, honey.
Okay, now, Candace, you and hubby will get Giuliana out that door by Kevin here posing as a high roller.
Blackjack is my middle name.
Right, babe?
That's right, baby.
Okey-dokey.
Now, behind this door, there's a hallway that leads to the vault in one direction and Giuliana's office in the other.
Now, the door can only be opened by using a four-digit security code that gets changed daily.
We get the number, and that gets us to the safecracking.
Marvin, roll it in.
Wow.
Yeah.
You got to think of this safe as a piggy bank on steroids.
It's not that deep.
So who's gonna crack that?
Uh, I'm not a safecra...
Look, I'm not gonna crack a safe.
I'll do it.
I used to boost department stores a lot.
No, ma'am.
Can you back your ass up?
You have the chill disposition we need, so you will crack the safe, Becky.
Only reason I'm doing this is because of a helpless, blameless little girl who happens to be my blood.
Didn't do anything to deserve getting caught up in this ugliness you perpetuate.
This is Sam.
Sam, this is Lucious.
He needs your help with something.
Hello, Sam.
It's nice to meet you.
I'm told that, um... you might have been contacted by somebody to forge some documents.
Documents for my granddaughter?
I've never seen that kid in my life.
And even if I had, I don't dime on paying clients.
He don't dime on paying clients.
Okay, just take your time, all right?
Relax your shoulders, breathe through it.
- So, these are cameras?
- Yeah, just try one.
- Okay.
- Look there.
She'll show you.
Don't listen for the click.
Feel the click.
Oh, shut up, shut up.
I almost got it.
I got it.
Damn!
I just...
I don't know about this, Cookie.
Maybe we should just call this off.
No, no, we are not calling this off.
I haven't seen my Kevin this excited since...
Uh, I don't need to know what gets Kevin excited, okay?
Blackjack!
Honey, I got a blackjack.
Okay, Kevin, we get it that you like black.
Becky, look at this.
It's just me and you, okay?
Focus.
Be confident.
Put your hands on the dial... and breathe.
Who hired you?
Look, I'm not a bad guy.
You know, some poor orphan kid needs a shot at a decent life,
I get 'em out of the system, so maybe they won't become bottom-feeders.
Bottom-feeders?
Are you referring to these innocent children that's got no choice of where they are, thrown in a system... you calling them bottom-feeders?
People like me and my brother?
How do you feel about that, brother?
I don't like it one bit, brother.
How you feel about it?
It hurts my feelings.
That felt good.
Sorry it took so long for us to come together.
I'm-a... go and get to a meeting.
Maybe you can get some more out of him.
Okay?
Yeah.
I'm sorry it took us this long to get here.
This is called "open monitoring meditation."
So don't focus on the safe.
You focus on everything that exists.
Be aware of every sound.
Every sound.
Every thought.
Every thought.
Every memory...
let it flow through you.
Every memory's flowing through me.
You're not touching the lock, you are the lock.
The lock is you.
You and the lock are one.
I am the lock.
I am the lock.
- I...
- Feel the click!
...am the lock.
I am the lock.
I am the...
All right, get up, bitches!
- Yes!
- We are going to Vegas!
Get up, bitches.
- Pack up your clothes.
- I am the lock!
I am the lock!

A first-class casino would've comped us a room and had these winnings secure in a safe by now.
Mm-hmm.
- You know, just saying.
Sir, madam.
If you would like, we could put your winnings

- Oh.
Get off of me!
I will shut this place down!
Get your hands off of me!
My name is...!
Seems a little hectic here tonight.
If you don't mind,
I'd like to take a tour of the vault first.
One moment, sir.
You are canceled!
Get off of me!
Get off of me!
Get off of me.
Okay, all right, okay!
Keep your hands to yourself!
High-roller on table four would like a tour of the vaults.

Is everything okay?
Everything's absolutely fine.
Look, I know you've got concerns about Inferno's crowd, but I assure you, you'll be able to bring your husband and your kids to this place.
My father is a man of his word, Ms. Frost.
I can assure you.
It's Mrs. Frost.
Oh.
I'm Andre Lyon.
We haven't properly met, but I've heard wonderful things about you.
I'm quite surprised that you're here.
You know I just had your mother thrown out.
Are you next?
Actually, I came by to warn you.
Unfortunately, I was too late.
So, I'm Empire's CFO.
If I can be of service to you in any way, please do not hesitate, let me know.
Thank you.
Andre?
- That's right.
- Andre.
Very kind of you.
Did you see that bitch smirking down at me?
I should've threw my heel right at her neck.
- I did good, though, didn't I?
- Yeah.
Gave a little, little Kill Bill meets Casino, with the ass of Foxy Brown left up on there.
Uh, don't be looking at my ass.
No, I'm just...
Okay, look, they're headed to the security door.
Your winnings are totally secure, Mr. Mason.
All of our security are ex-military.
Oh.
That's nice to know.
Oh.
How grotesque.
Just sit your little debutante ass down right here, please.
Thank you.
Whatever.
Which screen is which?
All right, this is Carol, that's Becky, and there goes your little hubby right there.
We like to take extra special care of our high-rollers, like yourself.
How can I speak to him?
Grab the mic.
Ooh, I can see that.
Eyes up, Kevin.
Mama's watching.
She too old to be showing that much cleavage.
- I - got to beg to differ.
- Those are nice.
- Yeah, you would.
You like them big and fake, don't you?
The vault itself is state-of-the-art.
Well, as long as it's secure.
Do I look like the type of girl you can't trust?
All right, listen up, y'all.
six, six, four, nine.
Becky, you got that?
Six, six, four, nine.
I'm on it.
Right this way.
Give them time to get to the vault.
All right, Carol, it's your turn.
Strangé time.
That's the guy.
He's your target.
Go do your thing.
Hey, baby.
You know, a girl really feels safe with a big strapping brother like yourself keeping an eye on things.
Damn, my sister is a ho.
- Mm.
Thank God.
- If you're soliciting,
I will call the police.
Move along.
Honey, I'm not a working girl.
But you know I can work it, right?
You don't want to come get a drink with me?
Ma'am, move away from the door.
Uh... wait a minute.
You ain't got to call me "ma'am."
I'm probably younger than your big ass.
- He's not going for it.
- I know.
This is your final warning.
Step aside.
Ain't that a bitch.
All right, you know what, y'all?
I'm about to go to the bar while y'all figure this out, okay?
Hell no!
Okay, let me think, let me think for a minute.
Hurry up.
My man can't be entertaining Giuliana all night.
Oh, we're screwed.
How am I supposed to get past him?
He's not gonna budge.
Hold on, I think this freak is into Becky.
- What?
- Oh.
Hey, Becky, I think this dude is into you.
G-Go get your flirt on.
I am not trained for that.
Look, I can tell by the way he stands, he's in the military.
All right?
So just talk to him about military stuff.
And shake your ass, see if we can get him to "Oohrah."
All right, so, while she's shaking her ass and getting him to "Oohrah,"
who's gonna crack the safe, stupid?
- Carol.
- Carol?
!
What?
!
Me?
- What we got.
It's what we got!
- Her?
!
Ooh, Negro, I know that's not your plan.
My...
To get the flightiest, flakiest one on the yard
- to crack the damn safe?
- Really?
Look, I could've got my team together, but you're the one that wanted to have this little sisterhood of the traveling attitude on the road, so let's just deal with what we got!
You know, cut it out with the $10 jokes, looking like a sherbet pop.
Sit down!
Can we just deal with what we got?
- You know, Sit.
Sit!
- Could you just speak English?
This is exactly why I went Asian.
Let me guess.
Navy?
Nope.
Hmm.
Coast Guard?
Nope.
Army.
That's right.
Army Ranger.
Oh, you're a paratrooper.
Hi.
All right, go, go, go, now.
Six, six, four, nine.
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.
Oh, my God, you're so much taller when you get close to me like that.
- How have you been all night?
- I'm good.
Oh, you guys, I cannot do this.
Carol, you can and you will.
Just get in there and do it!
I'll be out of here soon.
Oh, soon?
How soon?
I'm almost done, too.
Yeah?
- Yeah.
- What time?
All right, you're in.
Whenever you're off, I'm off.
Oh, my God.
I'm so bad.
Okay, walk into the room on your left.
That should be Giuliana's office.
Look for the painting behind the desk.
Good.
There you go.
The safe should be behind the painting.
Come on, Carol honey, we don't have a lot of time.
You can do it.
Bingo.
All right, you guys, listen, I can't do this; my hands are shaking too much.
- Oh.
- Okay, all right.
Carol, yes you can and yes you will.
I will come in and beat...
Carol?
Carol, you got this.
Trying to act like you a damsel in distress when I know you got nerves of steel.
I'm telling you, I don't trust me.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
All right.
Okay, okay, okay.
All right.
I got it.
Carol?
You got this, girl.
Look, I know I give you flak a lot.
But you made of steel, girl.
You got this.
Okay, Thirsty, but you gonna have to Mr. Miyagi my ass through this.
Okay, okay, we got you now.
Okay?
All you got to do is breathe.
Carol?
Carol, are you there?
- Still nothing?
- Nothing.
And nobody saw her.
- Carol.
- Oh, my God.
We lost video feed.
I thought something happened to you.
What happened?
We were scared you got caught.
What?
Bam!
Is that what we need?
Yeah, the gaming commissioner gets one look at these, it's multiple indictments for sure.
Yes, ding dong, the bitch is dead!
- Yes, baby!
- I knew you could do it.
Told you, I did it!
Yeah, y'all.
You know I'm a safecracker, right?
I'm a safecracker, right?
We know you like crack, but we ain't gonna get into it.
Hey, Cookie!
Fraudulent reporting, money laundering, consorting with criminals?
This is really bad.
You have seven kids?
Damn.
I mean...
They must be proud of their mother.
Well, I hope they're proud of me someday.
Right now, they hate how hard I work and wonder why I can't be with them at home.
Yeah, I understand that.
Mine are grown, but they will always need their mama.
Especially...
Hakeem?
Frankly, I'm a bit disturbed to see that you've left him at a time of need.
You see, our youngest is going through a bit of a rough time right now.
Fortunately, I've been able to handle a few things while his mother has been here in Vegas, running around like a banshee.
Your last little stunt cost us a half a million dollars.
But it's worth it if it means I can get my gaming license.
So what are we calling this one?
"Charitable donation"?
I don't care what you call it.
But after reading these, the price might go up.
I didn't know Mormons took payoffs.
Wow.
You people really are prone to stereotypes.
- Come on.
- Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a lot of work to do.
"You people."
It's okay, come on.
Please.
Cookie, let's go.
Come on, you're gonna cost us some more money.
Wow.
You have an interesting family.
"Interesting" isn't the word I would've chosen.
Well, then.
I guess you're gonna have to help me find better words.
I'll get to work on that.
You talked to your father, right?
He said he expecting to know where she is today or tomorrow.
Yeah, I trust him on that.
It's the one thing I do trust him on.
You can trust him, too.
Who I shouldn't have trusted is that... shady-ass Mormon.
It's my own damn fault.
So, what, she a Mormon, you expect her not to be shady?
Ma, you just gonna have to dust yourself off and get back to work.
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
Now, sit down, so you can listen to my plan.
- Wait.
- No, no, no.
I got to tell you...
Sit down, boy, listen.
Now, y'all remember old Byron What's-His-Ass said we would never be able to go head-to-head with Inferno.
Well, I want to take them all by surprise and get out there tonight.
Tonight.
Mom...
Look, Coocious, the promo, still getting, like, 10,000 new streams a day.
Hmm.
When Lucious wakes up tomorrow morning,
I want the press to be all about how Inferno can't top When Cookie Met Lucious.
And I want y'all to get out on that stage, together, and do a-a APB shout-out.
So people can look for Bella.
In front of all those millions of people.
That's a great idea, right?
Come on.
It's a beautiful idea,
- Ma, it really is.
But listen.
- I know it is.
I made a decision, okay?
Uh, what is he doing here?
Am I interrupting something?
You're always interrupting something.
And what you make a decision about?
I decided to hold off on the release of When Cookie Met Lucious until after Inferno.
Why?
'Cause I'm gonna join Dad's show in Vegas.
Ma, come on, it's a good thing.
It's good for all of us.
You know what I'm saying?
It'll get everybody really hype.
Is that what your father's telling you?
What, you think I'm lying to him?
He doesn't care about you, boy, he just wants to win.
No, I want us all to win.
That's the whole point of this.
The stuff that he's saying on this album,
I mean, the things that he's saying to me,
I'm finally hearing him, and it's something that I think the critics and that his fans, if they got a chance to hear it...
- Oh, shut up.
- But they won't get a chance to listen to what I've heard if all they're hearing is noise from Inferno.
Mom, come on.
This is what I've been waiting... this is what both of us have been waiting for.
You know, he's actually hearing us.
You know you can't trust him.
You know you can't trust him.
Ma, how you gonna say don't trust him?
When you just told me to trust him about Bella.
- Boy...
- Yeah.
How can I trust him about my own daughter?
And that's a baby.
Like, that's ten times more important than our stupid record.
Wait, wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Y'all just ganging up on her right now.
She's having a hard time; maybe she just needs a few minutes to think things through.
Give her some space.
Mom, please.
Come on, don't be like that.
- Mom.
- Just let her go.
She came for me hard, had her feelings hurt.
Maybe she just needs to lick her wounds.
♪
Okay, here we go.
Come on, my little Bella.
All right.
Hello, Mrs. DuBois?
We just finished our walk.
We're at the gate.
Lucious here.
Leave a message.
Yo, it's Tariq.
I found her.
I'm on my way.
Your father...
I heard.
Vegas was a bust.
I was just trying to get Giuliana arrested.
Don't give up just yet.
No.
Dre, I-I'm done.
That's a shame.
'Cause I'm just getting started.
Boy, it's over.
Okay?
And I'm...
I know you heard that frosty bitch is all in your daddy's pocket.
Charlotte may have taken Pop's money, but she has no loyalty to him.
How do you know who she's loyal to?
We've had our own private conversations.
Dre.
I'm your mama.
Boy, give me the 411.
All right.
Charlotte doesn't have a problem taking payoffs as long as she tithes to her church.
But she is deadly serious about keeping the thug element out of Vegas.
Now, anything jumps off, anything at all, she will snuff out Inferno before Pop can even strike a match.
Hmm.
So she doesn't like thugs running amok in her town.
Well, we'll just have to give her Biggie and Pac times ten.
I owe you everything.
You found my grandbaby.
Please, don't keep me in suspense.
Oh, never that, my brother.
"Brother." Yo.
A lot's gone down between us, man.
I never thought we'd get here.
Neither did I.
Yeah.
You know, once Bella comes back home,
I think you and me, we should really sit down and talk about how we can look after each other, the way brothers are supposed to, you know, as a family.
Yeah.
We should drink to that.
You're not a Mormon, are you?
No, brother.
Yo, you gonna need all the family you got.
Wait till you find out where I found Bella.
What in the hell is wrong with you?
!
Tariq.

Doesn't have to end here.
You chose the wrong side, Sean.
That's enough.
Arrest him.
- Where's Eve?
- She went after Bonaparte.
We used the stick to heal her.
And then she woged and had some kind of seizure.
Tell me where he lives.
- Everybody into the tunnel.
- Nick, come on.
Let's go.
No!
I'm gonna stay here with Eve, make sure nobody follows us.
We'll see if there's an exit further down this way.
It's over.
How the hell?
Come on!
We're gonna have to go back and find another way.
I'm pregnant.
I should have killed you when I had the chance.
I won't make that mistake again?
I guess I should thank you.
I thought you were on his side.
You killed all of them.
You were shot.
You're not even wounded.
They said you were dead.
- I think I was.
- How does that happen?
I'm not sure.
Why'd you stop him?
I'm not sure either.
Maybe one of the others found a way out.
What... what was that?
We got to go back.
Yeah.
We break out.
We can circle back for Nick.
We shouldn't have left Nick.
He gave us no choice.
This fight's not over.
It is for Nick.
It would have been for us if we had stayed.
I'm not letting Renard get away with this.
Yeah, that son of a bitch is going down.
You hear that?
Sounds like water.
There's an opening.
It must connect to the city's storm drain.
Yeah, there's no way we can get out through there.
Oh, my God, this has to lead somewhere.
There.
This could be the way out.
Looks like there's some kind of door up here.
Oh, my God.
We can get out this way.
We got to go back and tell the others.
What?
I don't want to tell anybody about me being pregnant.
Okay, right.
I guess it's not really the time or the place for anything remotely happy.
I mean, why bring it up, right?
We may not even be getting out of here.
Hey.
We are getting out of here.
I don't need you to cheer me up right now.
We have no idea how many people attacked Nick or even if he's still alive or if they haven't found these tunnels and they're coming down here right now to kill us.
I mean, I think I actually need you to cheer me up right now.
Listen to me.
If they come down here after us, it is gonna be their mistake.
Okay?
Come on.
Let's go.
What are we supposed to do now?
- We keep fighting.
- Meisner's dead.
Nick might be too.
We can't do this alone.
We regroup.
We rebuild.
Not in Portland.
I'm tired of waiting.
I'm going back for Nick.
You stay here.
You wait for the others.
I owe him.
- Now who's talking?
- I am.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Something's in the way.
- You're feeling stuff.
- No, I won't go back.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Did you guys find a way out?
Yeah, we can all get out, but it's back that way.
I'm going back for Nick.
Us too.
Hey, guys, we found a way out.
Nick didn't.
There's somebody coming.
All right, turn off the lights.
Now.
- Nick!
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.
- You're alive.
- How many are behind you?
- None.
What?
We saw tons of them.
Yeah, they're all dead.
- All of 'em?
- Including Bonaparte.
- You killed Bonaparte?
- No.
Renard did.
Renard?
Kind of looks like you were shot.
Like, more than once.
You're not a ghost, are you?
I hope not.
♪ Grimm 6x01 ♪ Fugitive Original Air Date on January 6, 2017
Daddy's gonna be all right.
It's okay.
Daddy's gonna be all right.
He's gonna be all right.
Yeah.
It's okay.
Is Nick dead?
No.
What did you do to him?
- Not much.
- Is he okay?
- He's alive.
- Well, then how are you here?
What are you doing still alive?
Thanks for your concern.
You and Bonaparte went to kill Nick.
Why should I be concerned about you?
- Bonaparte is dead.
- What?
- Yeah, you must be relieved.
- Nick killed him?
No, he had nothing to do with it.
Then who did?
- I'm not entirely sure.
- You were there.
How did you not see who killed him?
- I saw it.
- You're not making any sense.
Because none of this makes any sense.
- Who killed him?
- I killed him.
I think.
Maybe.
I'm not sure.
How can you not be sure about something like that?
I stabbed him.
I stabbed him, but I didn't realize what I'd done until I saw that...
That bloody sword in my hand.
But you already know about that, don't you?
I had nothing to do with this.
Do you think I would risk that knowing what he can do to my children?
Has Diana been asleep all night?
You're gonna blame Diana for this too?
Well, somebody made me kill Bonaparte, just like somebody killed Rachel.
Who else has that kind of power?
She won't take Daddy away anymore.
Diana saw the bruises on my neck, and she asked me if you had done it.
And what did you tell her?
I said no, one of your friends did it and that she shouldn't worry about it.
What are you gonna do?
I'm not gonna let Diana control our lives.
If Diana made you kill Bonaparte,
I'd go a little easy on the discipline.
Bonaparte brought this on himself.
He would have killed me.
Maybe Diana just wanted her daddy to be a hero and save Mommy.
Well, she got her wish.
We better be careful what she wishes for.
Black Claw's gonna find out about Bonaparte, if they haven't already.
And they're gonna go after whoever did it.
I assume you're not gonna confess?
No.
Somebody is.
Who?
You should have never fallen in love with Burkhardt.
Now you're gonna regret it.
Hello.
Wake up.
Who is this?
Sean Renard.
I'm coming over.
At this hour?
I'll be outside your house in five minutes.
Mommy?
I'm sorry to wake you, sweetie.
That's okay.
Is something wrong?
Were you playing with your dolls again tonight?
- I couldn't sleep.
- Why not?
Because of that man who hurt your neck.
He was mean, and I didn't want him to ever hurt you again, Mommy.
- Oh, my God, Nick.
- Dude, there's so many.
They came here to kill all of us.
Killed Bonaparte?
Renard didn't know what he was doing.
He's gonna be trying to figure out a way to explain it.
You healed me.
How?
It's the same way I was saved.
Monroe and I found this in the Black Forest.
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
What is it?
It's connected with those keys.
It's some kind of stick thing the crusaders took when they sacked Constantinople.
They hid it in a chest and then buried it under a church in the Black Forest behind a bunch of skulls that, when you turn the lights down, they kind of glow green and...
Long story.
Basically, we don't know what it is.
All we know is, it has some kind of power to heal.
You were dying.
Nick used it on you.
And it worked.
Then you had some kind of seizure.
And when you came to...
I felt different.
How do you feel now?
Something's changed.
Yeah, a lot's changed.
I'm gonna have to tell HW what's happened.
We should probably figure out how to deal with all these bodies.
I mean, we can't just leave them here, you know?
Not if you ever want to have a dinner party for the living.
Yeah, we have to deal with this.
Well, we can't put them in the elevator and walk them out the front door, so...
The tunnel.
There's a big hole down there, dumps right into the storm drain.
What about the three bodies at the spice shop?
We're gonna have to deal with them, too, while it's still dark.
I'll go with Monroe and Rosalee.
I'm gonna go with them too, seeing as I'm the one that killed them.
Meet up with you later.
So, how do we get these guys down into the tunnel?
The hell do you think you're doing?
I need search warrants.
You woke me up for search warrants?
I need a lot of them.
I don't care if you are the new mayor.
You don't come here in the middle of the night demanding anything.
Bonaparte's dead.
What?
Burkhardt killed him.
The Grimm killed Bonaparte?
And I'm taking him down for it.
How many warrants do you need?
What the hell happened here?
We're not sure, Captain.
All we know is what the jailer told us.
Seven North Precinct cops were sent to transport Burkhardt to the North Precinct, and somehow, between the time he was taken out of his cell to before he got out of the building, these two got into it with somebody... or something.
There were no witnesses.
The rest of us were out on a bunch of bogus 911 calls.
And, you know, Captain, I think it's a little too coincidental that we got those calls just when they were coming to get Burkhardt.
He broke out before they could get him to the North Precinct.
What?
My guess is, Burkhardt had some help.
Nick?
I want him found, and I want him arrested.
Put out an APB.
Consider him armed and dangerous.
Sir, Nick wouldn't do this.
If he resists, shoot to kill.
Yes, sir.
You probably shouldn't stay here now.
Too many of the wrong people know where you live.
You stay out of sight till we find out what's going on.
You guys head back to the precinct.
See what you can find.
We'll call you when we know something.
Watch your backs.
This was on your desk at the precinct.
Adalind.
I'm so happy to hear your voice.
Are you all right?
Yeah, are you?
Renard was here.
He told me what happened.
He said Bonaparte's dead.
Is that true?
Yeah, but I didn't kill him.
I know.
Renard said he did.
Where is he now?
I don't know.
He left.
Nick, I really need to see you.
So does Kelly.
But I can't leave the house, not with the children here.
Can you come over?
The guards that were here are gone.
Nick, please, I need you.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Sorry for the mess.
This one's a Hundjaeger, and the other one was actually something
I've never seen before.
Let's get 'em out of here.
All right, you get the arms.
I'll get the legs.
He grabbed her!
Eve!
Eve!
She's not responding.
She's in some kind of trance.
He won't let go.
He's dead.
Try telling him that.
I can't get his hand off her.
I think I know what this is.
It's a death grip.
- You've seen this before?
- Read about it.
Has to do with the fear of dying and getting stuck in the underworld.
They believed that if you took a pure soul with you, you could trade your way into eternal afterlife or something.
Here it is.
First documented by Egyptian Wesen under the reign of Merenre Nemtyemsaf II
- in the sixth dynasty.
- Oh, my God.
Does it say anything about how to stop it?
Yes, actually, it does.
I don't think we have time for a complicated spell.
Not that complicated.
Hurry up.
I think we're losing her.
Give me some room.
Eve?
Yeah.
- Where the hell were you?
- I'm not sure.
I don't think you should be handling dead guys right now.
Thanks.
The death grip supposedly trades a pure soul for freedom from hell.
Pure soul?
I don't think so.
Yeah, that doesn't really make so much sense.
I mean, after everything she did?
No offense.
Maybe this has something to do with the stick.
Maybe your soul is not as dark as it used to be.
You know, like she got her soul cleaned.
I guess we could all use a little of that.
I just wish I knew what the hell we were dealing with, 'cause this piece of wood is scaring the crap out of me.
Crap.
Those are the guys I killed.
Don't worry.
They'll never connect this to you.
There are no surveillance cameras.
I saw you do it, and if I didn't know it was you,
I wouldn't know it was you.
Hey.
I'm glad to see you guys.
I was worried you might be involved in this.
What?
In this?
Are you kidding us?
I don't know who's involved with what anymore.
All hell's breaking loose around here.
We just got word that North Precinct is basically wiped out.
It's FBI now, and Captain's on the warpath, blaming Burkhardt for everything.
I don't know what's going on between him and the captain, but it's getting bad.
- Why would Nick do any of this?
- What are you talking about?
Captain thinks Burkhardt killed these two cops
- when he was busted out.
- What?
Yeah, and now Burkhardt's on the run.
We just put out an apb on him with a shoot-to-kill order.
This is going south fast.
- Where's Captain?
- He's in his office.
Listen, has Nick contacted you?
No.
Well, I'm thinking he should be turning himself in...
Or getting the hell out of the country, because I don't want anything to do with taking down one of our own.
What's he doing?
Looks like he's cleaning out his office.
If Renard's looking for a legitimate way to kill Nick, you can bet we're on his list.
Well, renard's on my list.
We need to warn Nick.
Yes.
Are you with Bonaparte?
No.
Where is he?
He's dead.
When?
Tonight.
How did he die?
The Grimm killed him.
We were told the Grimm was dead.
He should have been.
Something's protecting him.
I don't know what.
You find out and deal with it.
We have suffered a major setback in Portland.
It's imperative that you take control of the city.
I will.
Don't worry.
I'll have the Grimm in 24 hours.
Captain.
Search warrants just came in.
Anything else?
Just get ready to go.
Thank God you're alive.
This has been awful.
Did Renard do this to your neck?
No, Bonaparte.
Nick, I'm the one who told him where you live.
He would have killed me and our son.
I know.
I know.
You didn't have a choice.
Where's Kelly?
In my room.
Hey.
Hey!
Has he been okay?
Yeah, but I know he misses you.
Hey, bud.
What is that?
An engagement ring for me and Renard.
Bonaparte put it there...
And not normally.
He said if I ever took it off, it would cause great pain to my children.
I hate it, but I'm afraid to take it off without knowing how to break the spell.
Even if he's dead, it could still survive.
We'll find a way to break it.
I need to be with you.
And what about Diana?
- She's with you now.
- I don't know.
I know she wants me and her father to be together, but I'm afraid of what she might do.
You don't know how powerful she is.
But I hate him.
I hate all of this.
I got to get out of here.
You can't leave yet, not until I deal with Renard.
I don't know how much longer I can do this.
It's Hank.
Yeah, what have you got?
Renard wants you dead.
We just got back to the precinct.
He's got an APB out on you with a shoot-to-kill order.
He's blaming what happened at North Precinct on you, among other things.
He wants to take you down with the legitimacy of the city behind him.
You need to find a place to lay low till we can figure this out.
Yeah, I'll call you when I get there.
I think we should stop using our cell phones.
Yeah.
I'll warn the others.
Good luck.
You too.
If he hurts you,
I will kill him.
You can't take any chances.
But if I don't come back, feel free.
Where are you gonna go?
No, no, no, no.
Don't tell me.
Nick?
He's not here.
Maybe they're still in the tunnel dumping bodies.
We're losing her, Nick.
I hope that thing does what we think it does.
Yeah, me too.
How much do you know about the stick that he used to heal me with?
Not much more than he told you.
Does he always carry it?
No, he got it out to help you.
Got it out from where?
Where he keeps it hidden with the cloth wrapped around it.
Kind of forgot I had it.
Nick left it on the bed when he got out the stick to heal you.
It's really old.
Ancient writing on it.
Can't really see most of it.
- Yeah.
- Trubel, where are you?
We're in the loft.
Nick's not here.
I know.
Is Eve with you?
I'm here.
What about Monroe and Rosalee?
They were headed home.
Monroe and Rosalee are home.
Listen, there's not much time.
Renard's got a APB out on Nick.
He's got every cop in the city looking for him.
He wants Nick dead.
Now, they'll be hitting Nick's loft, so get out of there.
Got it.
Hank was right.
Here they come.
- How are you feeling?
- Tired.
Me too.
But I'm happy.
Despite everything that's going on, the thought of being a dad and you being a mom and...
And us being a family.
I know.
- Although...
- What?
I've just been thinking.
Maybe Portland isn't, like, the safest place to raise a family right now, you know?
I mean, with Renard as mayor, who knows what's gonna become of this city?
Let's not think about that stuff anymore tonight.
Let's just try to get some sleep.
- Okay.
- I love you.
I love you too.
It's the precinct.
What now?
Hey, are you with Rosalee?
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.
She should hear this too.
- Okay.
- What's wrong?
Renard put out an APB shoot-to-kill on Nick.
- What?
- He's got search warrants.
They will be hitting your shop and your house.
Do not try to stop them.
- Where's Nick?
- We don't know.
And it's better that we don't.
This is the police!
- Oh, my God, they're here.
- You stay here.
I'm not staying here.
If they're gonna shoot one of us, it's going to be in front of the other.
We have a warrant!
Nope, that didn't come out right.
All right, all right.
- Open the door, now!
- Just a second.
We have a warrant for the arrest of Nicholas Burkhardt and a warrant for the search of the premises.
Okay, he's not here, man, and my wife is pregnant, so take your hands...
Do not attempt to interfere.
No Burkhardt.
Clear!
I think they're leaving.
There are patterns on this cloth.
Here?
I don't see 'em.
You don't?
They're right here and here and here.
I can't see what you're seeing.
I've seen them before.
Where?
No sign of Burkhardt yet.
All these locations have been checked and cleared.
A surveillance team has been left at each location.
- What about his vehicle?
- Hasn't been located.
- What about his phone?
- It's no longer operational.
He probably took the SIM card out.
He's somewhere in the city.
Well, by now, he knows it's a full-on manhunt.
And he's not stupid.
He knows how this works.
So he might not even be in the city anymore.
I don't care where he is.
I don't care what it takes.
I want him found!
You chose the wrong side, Sean.
We located Burkhardt's car.
- Where?
- Laurelhurst.
Seal off the area.
Search every house, block by block.
- One-mile perimeter.
- Sir, that's not...
Just do it!
Oh, my God!
Hey, take anything you want.
Bud!
- It's me.
- Nick?
Oh, thank God.
You scared the living...
- I need your help.
- Well, yeah.
Of course.
Anything you need.
I'm guessing it's not your refrigerator.
No, but I'm on the run, and I need a place to hide.
That's why you're here.
Yeah, okay, okay.
What do you need me to do?
Do you have a cell phone?
Yeah, yeah.
Right here, right here.
Okay, I need you to make some calls.
Yeah.
What...
This is serious, isn't it?
Renard wants me dead.
They haven't found him.
- Good.
- But they found his car.
- Where?
- Laurelhurst.
Nick know anyone there?
Not that I know of.
Griffin.
Hey, Hank.
It's me, Bud.
Yeah, hi.
Look, we're kind of busy, Bud.
Yeah, yeah, I heard.
I kind of got a little problem.
What kind of problem?
I think I had a break-in in my repair shop.
You don't suppose you and Sergeant Wu could come over and check things out?
Because the perp...
that's what you call 'em, right?
Could still be in there.
I mean, what if he was a wanted man?
Yeah, yeah, that could be dangerous.
We're on our way.
You might want to change your clothes.
They're here, but...
But they took a cab.
Why would they take a cab?
Hey.
You took a cab so you wouldn't be followed, right?
Two cabs, one train, and a little walking.
Not in that order.
- Where is he?
- This way.
They put a tail on you?
- They did.
- We lost it.
We were followed too, but I'm pretty sure we lost them in a bar downtown.
Yeah, they were watching the loft when we left.
You left your car in Laurelhurst.
Last night.
They are searching the hell out of that area.
Well, that should keep 'em busy for a while.
- We contacted HW.
- Is anyone still alive?
Not here in Portland.
But Black Claw was badly compromised here too.
Renard is on his own.
Yeah, make it easier for us to kill him.
Not really.
He's got cops with him day and night.
So what do we do about Nick?
I think he has to leave Portland.
Renard won't stop until you're dead.
Then maybe that's what you have to do.
If I leave Portland, renard will control everything.
Nick, we can't afford to lose you.
Look, we need to think of someplace safe, and obviously it's not here.
So I hate to say this, Nick, but maybe they're right.
Maybe you got to go.
You should go back to the precinct.
Get back to work like everything's normal.
I don't want you getting drawn into this any more than you already have.
I don't like it, but okay.
We're still searching the Laurelhurst area, but so far, we got nothing.
We've already checked several blocks away from the parked car.
He dumped it there for us to find.
- Captain?
- Yeah.
We've run every incoming and outgoing phone call on Burkhardt's cell phone.
Besides the ones we've already checked, there's only one other number that has any kind of frequency.
What is it?
Probably doesn't mean anything.
We checked it out.
It's a refrigerator repair company owned by a...
- Bud Wurstner.
- Yeah, that's him.
Check his house.
Check his repair shop.
I want teams at both places.
Now!
We're moving teams from here to here.
What do you want us to do when they're in place?
I don't like the look of that.
How do we stop that son of a bitch?
There's always a bullet.
I'm sort of half joking.
I'm sort of half laughing.
Something's going on.
That something's coming at us.
I know you know where Burkhardt is.
I will find him, and if either one of you gets in my way,
I'm coming for you next.
And we won't be hard to find.
If he finds Nick...
They're not gonna be bringing him in.
Renard wants uniforms to do his killing for him.
Griffin.
Where?
Yeah, white female body.
Yeah.
I got it.
Got a body ID'd as Rachel Wood.
Rachel Wood?
Yeah, I think you should come with me on this one.
We need to be watching our backs for the time being.
I mean, we could take you in our car, but if they're watching us, they're watching our car.
Why don't you just steal one?
'Cause there's a risk in that too.
- What about Bud?
- Wait, what?
What... what... what about me?
Your truck.
You're off the grid.
For now.
Any chance we can see what vehicles the police are tracking?
Whatever car they put a BOLO on should be in the system.
Can you get into the system?
If I access it, they'll know.
Wu could help, but somebody else is gonna have to make that call.
I'll call Wu.
Nobody can track my phone.
Do you know what these mean?
No.
When I was with Monroe and Rosalee,
I touched one of the Black Claw bodies.
Yeah, right.
That was fun.
First time I've ever seen a death grip from a dead guy.
I saw these symbols on his face when I was there...
And also on the cloth.
Maybe there was more on that cloth than we could see.
Do you still have the stick with you?
Yes.
I'm not sure you should be carrying it all the time.
Miss Wood's coworker grew concerned when he couldn't reach her.
He came over and discovered this.
All right.
Bring in CSU.
Get this whole place fingerprinted.
She was Renard's campaign PR person.
Yeah.
When you're murdered in bed, it's usually by someone you know.
274, go ahead.
This is Unit 274, near the corner of Marks and Milwaukee.
Just completed a drive-by.
There's one truck parked in front.
Belongs to the company.
No sign of the suspect.
No activity at the exterior of the premises.
We're gonna have to send somebody in.
This is not good.
There are bolos out on Monroe and Rosalee's cars, your car and mine...
And Bud's.
Bud's on the list?
Yup, and the BOLO just came back on his truck.
It's at his shop.
Son of a bitch.
We need to get Nick out of there now.
Call Trubel.
On it.
Oh, jeez!
Oh, jeez.
S-s-somebody's here.
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do i... just calm down.
Probably just a customer.
Why don't you go find out what they want?
Right, right.
Business as usual.
Okay.
Wu.
Okay.
Yeah, I'll put you on speaker.
They know about Bud.
They put a BOLO out on his truck.
- It's in front of his shop.
- They're watching it, Nick.
You got to get out of there now.
- Got it, thanks.
- Check in with you when we can.
I'm gonna find out if Tactical's making a move.
- Check with Franco.
- Yup.
Well, looks clear.
- I hate that.
- What?
You know, people coming in here with a problem, asking me how much it's gonna cost to repair the refrigerator, and they don't even know what kind of refrigerator they got.
Bud, I don't think that was a customer.
That was a cop.
- Oh, God.
- They're watching the shop.
Nick, you got to get out of here, now.
We need a diversion.
If they think I'm in here, they're gonna send in a SERT team.
Bud.
Back your truck into the loading bay.
Help him load in a freezer.
- Why?
- So they think you're in it.
- Bud.
- Wh-what?
You're the diversion.
Right, right, right.
They follow me.
Hey, you could fit in that one if you were gonna fit in one.
I haven't fixed it yet, but...
But I guess that doesn't matter right now.
- I don't see anybody.
- You won't.
Franco.
Hey, it's Wu.
Where are you?
Captain ordered me not to talk to you guys.
Captain's out of control.
Seems like, but he's still got rank.
I got to ask you something.
Drew, you're putting me in a tough spot here.
Okay, then you don't need to.
I'm gonna give you an address.
If that's where you are, don't say anything.
4046 Marks.
Thanks.
SERT team's been ordered to Bud's shop.
Franco's there.
It's going down.
What the hell are we gonna do?
Wish I knew.
We ran the fingerprints from the Rachel Wood apartment.
This is where it gets a little awkward.
Well, that's why I brought it up personally.
What kind of awkward are we talking about?
Captain Renard's fingerprints are all over that place.
I know she was working on his campaign, but I think she was working on something else.
All right.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Suspect's vehicle just pulled into the loading bay.
They loaded in a freezer big enough to hold a man.
They're getting ready to go.
Get in position.
Nick!
Nick!
We're too late.
They're surrounding the place.
We're all gonna die!
All clear.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Isn't there something you can do?
I can try.
Eve!
I'm so sorry.
We're in position, sir.
Take them down.
Previously on "Grimm"...
Doesn't have to end here.
You chose the wrong side, Sean.
That's enough.
- Arrest him.
- Aah!
- Where's Eve?
- She went after Bonaparte.
We used the stick to heal her.
And then she woged and had some kind of seizure.
Tell me where he lives.
- Everybody into the tunnel.
- Nick, come on.
Let's go.
No!
I'm gonna stay here with Eve, make sure nobody follows us.
We'll see if there's an exit further down this way.
It's over.
How the hell?
Oh, come on!
We're gonna have to go back and find another way.
I'm pregnant.
I should have killed you when I had the chance.
I won't make that mistake again, huh?
_
I guess I should thank you.
I thought you were on his side.
You killed all of them.
You were shot.
You're not even wounded.
They said you were dead.
- I think I was.
- How does that happen?
I'm not sure.
Why'd you stop him?
I'm not sure either.
Maybe one of the others found a way out.
What... what was that?
We got to go back.
Yeah.
We break out.
We can circle back for Nick.
We shouldn't have left Nick.
He gave us no choice.
This fight's not over.
It is for Nick.
It would have been for us if we had stayed.
I'm not letting Renard get away with this.
Yeah, that son of a bitch is going down.
You hear that?
Sounds like water.
There's an opening.
It must connect to the city's storm drain.
Yeah, there's no way we can get out through there.
Oh, my God, this has to lead somewhere.
There.
This could be the way out.
Looks like there's some kind of door up here.
Oh, my God.
We can get out this way.
We got to go back and tell the others.
What?
I don't want to tell anybody about me being pregnant.
Okay, right.
I guess it's not really the time or the place for anything remotely happy.
I mean, why bring it up, right?
We may not even be getting out of here.
Hey.
We are getting out of here.
I don't need you to cheer me up right now.
We have no idea how many people attacked Nick or even if he's still alive or if they haven't found these tunnels and they're coming down here right now to kill us.
I mean, I think I actually need you to cheer me up right now.
Shh.
Listen to me.
If they come down here after us, it is gonna be their mistake.
Okay?
Come on.
Let's go.
What are we supposed to do now?
- We keep fighting.
- Meisner's dead.
Nick might be too.
We can't do this alone.
We regroup.
We rebuild.
Not in Portland.
I'm tired of waiting.
I'm going back for Nick.
You stay here.
You wait for the others.
I owe him.
- Now who's talking?
- I am.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Something's in the way.
- You're feeling stuff.
- No, I won't go back.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Did you guys find a way out?
Yeah, we can all get out, but it's back that way.
I'm going back for Nick.
Us too.
Hey, guys, we found a way out.
Nick didn't.
There's somebody coming.
All right, turn off the lights.
Now.
- Nick!
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.
- You're alive.
- How many are behind you?
- None.
What?
We saw tons of them.
Yeah, they're all dead.
- All of 'em?
- Including Bonaparte.
- You killed Bonaparte?
- No.
Renard did.
Renard?
Um... kind of looks like you were shot.
Like, more than once.
You're not a ghost, are you?
I hope not.
Daddy's gonna be all right.
It's okay.
Daddy's gonna be all right.
Daddy's gonna be all right.
Yeah.
It's okay.
Is Nick dead?
No.
What did you do to him?
- Not much.
- Is he okay?
- He's alive.
- Well, then how are you here?
What are you doing still alive?
Thanks for your concern.
You and Bonaparte went to kill Nick.
Why should I be concerned about you?
- Bonaparte is dead.
- What?
- Yeah, you must be relieved.
- Nick killed him?
No, he had nothing to do with it.
Then who did?
- I'm not entirely sure.
- You were there.
How did you not see who killed him?
- I saw it.
- You're not making any sense.
Because none of this makes any sense.
- Who killed him?
- I killed him.
I think.
Maybe.
I'm not sure.
- How can you not be sure - about something like that?
I stabbed him.
I stabbed him, but I didn't realize what I'd done until I saw that...
That bloody sword in my hand.
But you already know about that, don't you?
I had nothing to do with this.
Do you think I would risk that knowing what he can do to my children?
Has Diana been asleep all night?
You're gonna blame Diana for this too?
Well, somebody made me kill Bonaparte, just like somebody killed Rachel.
Who else has that kind of power?
She won't take Daddy away anymore.
Diana saw the bruises on my neck, and she asked me if you had done it.
And what did you tell her?
I said no, one of your friends did it and that she shouldn't worry about it.
What are you gonna do?
I'm not gonna let Diana control our lives.
If Diana made you kill Bonaparte,
I'd go a little easy on the discipline.
Bonaparte brought this on himself.
He would have killed me.
Maybe Diana just wanted her daddy to be a hero and save Mommy.
Well, she got her wish.
We better be careful what she wishes for.
Black Claw's gonna find out about Bonaparte, if they haven't already.
And they're gonna go after whoever did it.
I assume you're not gonna confess?
No.
Somebody is.
Who?
You should have never fallen in love with Burkhardt.
Now you're gonna regret it.
Hello.
Wake up.
Who is this?
Sean Renard.
I'm coming over.
At this hour?
I'll be outside your house in five minutes.
Mommy?
I'm sorry to wake you, sweetie.
That's okay.
Is something wrong?
Were you playing with your dolls again tonight?
- Mm-hmm.
I couldn't sleep.
- Why not?
Because of that man who hurt your neck.
He was mean, and I didn't want him to ever hurt you again, Mommy.
- Oh, my God, Nick.
- Dude, there's so many.
They came here to kill all of us.
Killed Bonaparte?
Renard didn't know what he was doing.
He's gonna be trying to figure out a way to explain it.
You healed me.
How?
It's the same way I was saved.
Monroe and I found this in the Black Forest.
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
What is it?
It's connected with those keys.
It's some kind of stick thing the crusaders took when they sacked Constantinople.
They hid it in a chest and then buried it under a church in the Black Forest behind a bunch of skulls that, when you turn the lights down, they kind of glow green and...
Long story.
Basically, we don't know what it is.
All we know is, it has some kind of power to heal.
You were dying.
Nick used it on you.
And it worked.
Then you had some kind of seizure.
And when you came to...
I felt different.
How do you feel now?
Something's changed.
Yeah, a lot's changed.
I'm gonna have to tell HW what's happened.
We should probably figure out how to deal with all these bodies.
I mean, we can't just leave them here, you know?
Not if you ever want to have a dinner party for the living.
Yeah, we have to deal with this.
Well, we can't put them in the elevator and walk them out the front door, so...
The tunnel.
There's a big hole down there, dumps right into the storm drain.
What about the three bodies at the spice shop?
We're gonna have to deal with them, too, while it's still dark.
I'll go with Monroe and Rosalee.
I'm gonna go with them too, seeing as I'm the one that killed them.
Meet up with you later.
So, uh, how do we get these guys down into the tunnel?
The hell do you think you're doing?
I need search warrants.
You woke me up for search warrants?
I need a lot of them.
I don't care if you are the new mayor.
You don't come here in the middle of the night demanding anything.
Bonaparte's dead.
What?
Burkhardt killed him.
The Grimm killed Bonaparte?
And I'm taking him down for it.
How many warrants do you need?
What the hell happened here?
We're not sure, Captain.
All we know is what the jailer told us.
Seven North Precinct cops were sent to transport Burkhardt to the North Precinct, and somehow, between the time he was taken out of his cell to before he got out of the building, these two got into it with somebody... or something.
There were no witnesses.
The rest of us were out on a bunch of bogus 911 calls.
And, you know, Captain, I think it's a little too coincidental that we got those calls just when they were coming to get Burkhardt.
He broke out before they could get him to the North Precinct.
What?
My guess is, Burkhardt had some help.
Nick?
I want him found, and I want him arrested.
Put out an APB.
Consider him armed and dangerous.
Sir, Nick wouldn't do this.
If he resists, shoot to kill.
Yes, sir.
You probably shouldn't stay here now.
Too many of the wrong people know where you live.
You stay out of sight till we find out what's going on.
You guys head back to the precinct.
See what you can find.
We'll call you when we know something.
Watch your backs.
Oh, this was on your desk at the precinct.
Adalind.
I'm so happy to hear your voice.
Are you all right?
Yeah, are you?
Renard was here.
He told me what happened.
He said Bonaparte's dead.
Is that true?
Yeah, but I didn't kill him.
I know.
Renard said he did.
Where is he now?
I don't know.
He left.
Nick, I really need to see you.
So does Kelly.
But I can't leave the house, not with the children here.
Can you come over?
The guards that were here are gone.
Nick, please, I need you.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Sorry for the mess.
This one's a Hundjaeger, and the other one was actually something
I've never seen before.
Let's get 'em out of here.
All right, you get the arms.
I'll get the legs.
He grabbed her!
Eve!
Eve!
She's not responding.
She's in some kind of trance.
He won't let go.
He's dead.
Try telling him that.
I can't get his hand off her.
I think I know what this is.
It's a death grip.
- You've seen this before?
- Read about it.
Has to do with the fear of dying and getting stuck in the underworld.
They believed that if you took a pure soul with you, you could trade your way into eternal afterlife or something.
Ah, here it is.
First documented by Egyptian Wesen under the reign of Merenre Nemtyemsaf II
- in the sixth dynasty.
- Oh, my God.
Does it say anything about how to stop it?
Yes, actually, it does.
I don't think we have time for a complicated spell.
Not that complicated.
Hurry up.
I think we're losing her.
Give me some room.
Oh!
Eve?
Yeah.
- Where the hell were you?
- I'm not sure.
I don't think you should be handling dead guys right now.
Thanks.
The death grip supposedly trades a pure soul for freedom from hell.
Pure soul?
I don't think so.
Yeah, that doesn't really make so much sense.
I mean, after everything she did?
No offense.
Maybe this has something to do with the stick.
Maybe your soul is not as dark as it used to be.
You know, like she got her soul cleaned.
I guess we could all use a little of that.
I just wish I knew what the hell we were dealing with, 'cause this piece of wood is scaring the crap out of me.
Aah!
Aah!
Oh, crap.
Those are the guys I killed.
Don't worry.
They'll never connect this to you.
There are no surveillance cameras.
I saw you do it, and if I didn't know it was you,
I wouldn't know it was you.
Hey.
I'm glad to see you guys.
I was worried you might be involved in this.
What?
In this?
Are you kidding us?
I don't know who's involved with what anymore.
All hell's breaking loose around here.
We just got word that North Precinct is basically wiped out.
It's FBI now, and Captain's on the warpath, blaming Burkhardt for everything.
I don't know what's going on between him and the captain, but it's getting bad.
- Why would Nick do any of this?
- What are you talking about?
Captain thinks Burkhardt killed these two cops
- when he was busted out.
- What?
Yeah, and now Burkhardt's on the run.
We just put out an APB on him with a shoot-to-kill order.
This is going south fast.
- Where's Captain?
- He's in his office.
Listen, has Nick contacted you?
No.
Well, I'm thinking he should be turning himself in... or getting the hell out of the country, because I don't want anything to do with taking down one of our own.
What's he doing?
Looks like he's cleaning out his office.
If Renard's looking for a legitimate way to kill Nick, you can bet we're on his list.
Well, Renard's on my list.
We need to warn Nick.
Yes.
Are you with Bonaparte?
No.
Where is he?
He's dead.
When?
Tonight.
How did he die?
The Grimm killed him.
We were told the Grimm was dead.
He should have been.
Something's protecting him.
I don't know what.
You find out and deal with it.
We have suffered a major setback in Portland.
It's imperative that you take control of the city.
I will.
Don't worry.
I'll have the Grimm in 24 hours.
Captain.
Search warrants just came in.
Anything else?
Just get ready to go.
Thank God you're alive.
This has been awful.
Did Renard do this no
- I give to your neck?
Berkeley, not you"
No, Bonaparte.
Nick, I'm the one who told him where you live.
He would have killed me and our son.
I know.
I know.
You didn't have a choice.
Where's Kelly?
In my room.
Hey.
Hey!
Has he been okay?
Yeah, but I know he misses you.
Hey, bud.
What is that?
An engagement ring for me and Renard.
Bonaparte put it there...
And not normally.
He said if I ever took it off, it would cause great pain to my children.
I hate it, but I'm afraid to take it off without knowing how to break the spell.
Even if he's dead, it could still survive.
We'll find a way to break it.
I need to be with you.
And what about Diana?
- She's with you now.
- I don't know.
I know she wants me and her father to be together, but I'm afraid of what she might do.
You don't know how powerful she is.
But I hate him.
I hate all of this.
I got to get out of here.
You can't leave yet, not until I deal with Renard.
I don't know how much longer I can do this.
It's Hank.
Yeah, what have you got?
Renard wants you dead.
We just got back to the precinct.
He's got an APB out on you with a shoot-to-kill order.
He's blaming what happened at North Precinct on you, among other things.
He wants to take you down with the legitimacy of the city behind him.
You need to find a place to lay low till we can figure this out.
Yeah, I'll call you when I get there.
I think we should stop using our cell phones.
Yeah.
I'll warn the others.
Good luck.
You too.
If he hurts you,
I will kill him.
You can't take any chances.
But if I don't come back, feel free.
Where are you gonna go?
No, no, no, no.
Don't tell me.
Nick?
He's not here.
Maybe they're still in the tunnel dumping bodies.
We're losing her, Nick.
I hope that thing does what we think it does.
Yeah, me too.
How much do you know about the stick that he used to heal me with?
Not much more than he told you.
Does he always carry it?
No, he got it out to help you.
Got it out from where?
Where he keeps it hidden with the cloth wrapped around it.
Kind of forgot I had it.
Nick left it on the bed when he got out the stick to heal you.
It's really old.
Ancient writing on it.
Can't really see most of it.
- Yeah.
- Trubel, where are you?
We're in the loft.
Nick's not here.
I know.
Is Eve with you?
I'm here.
What about Monroe and Rosalee?
They were headed home.
Monroe and Rosalee are home.
Listen, there's not much time.
Renard's got a APB out on Nick.
He's got every cop in the city looking for him.
He wants Nick dead.
Now, they'll be hitting Nick's loft, so get out of there.
Got it.
Hank was right.
Here they come.
- How are you feeling?
- Tired.
Me too.
But I'm happy.
Despite everything that's going on, the thought of being a dad and you being a mom and...
And us being a family.
I know.
- Although...
- What?
I've just been thinking.
Maybe Portland isn't, like, the safest place to raise a family right now, you know?
I mean, with Renard as mayor, who knows what's gonna become of this city?
Let's not think about that stuff anymore tonight.
Let's just try to get some sleep.
- Okay.
- I love you.
I love you too.
It's the precinct.
What now?
Hey, are you with Rosalee?
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.
She should hear this too.
- Okay.
- What's wrong?
Renard put out an APB shoot-to-kill on Nick.
- What?
- He's got search warrants.
They will be hitting your shop and your house.
Do not try to stop them.
- Where's Nick?
- We don't know.
And it's better that we don't.
This is the police!
- Oh, my God, they're here.
- You stay here.
I'm not staying here.
If they're gonna shoot one of us, it's going to be in front of the other.
We have a warrant!
Nope, that didn't come out right.
All right, all right.
- Open the door, now!
- Just a second.
We have a warrant for the arrest of Nicholas Burkhardt and a warrant for the search of the premises.
Okay, he's not here, man, and my wife is pregnant, so take your hands...
Do not attempt to interfere.
No Burkhardt.
Clear!
I think they're leaving.
There are patterns on this cloth.
Here?
I don't see 'em.
You don't?
They're right here and here and here.
I can't see what you're seeing.
I've seen them before.
Where?
No sign of Burkhardt yet.
All these locations have been checked and cleared.
A surveillance team has been left at each location.
- What about his vehicle?
- Hasn't been located.
- What about his phone?
- It's no longer operational.
He probably took the SIM card out.
He's somewhere in the city.
Well, by now, he knows it's a full-on manhunt.
And he's not stupid.
He knows how this works.
So he might not even be in the city anymore.
I don't care where he is.
I don't care what it takes.
I want him found!
You chose the wrong side, Sean.
We located Burkhardt's car.
- Where?
- Laurelhurst.
Seal off the area.
Search every house, block by block.
- One-mile perimeter.
- Sir, that's not...
Just do it!
Oh, my God!
Hey, take anything you want.
- Bud!
- Huh?
- It's me.
- Nick?
Oh, thank God.
You scared the living...
- I need your help.
- Well, yeah.
Of course.
Anything you need.
I'm guessing it's not your refrigerator.
No, but I'm on the run, and I need a place to hide.
Oh, that's why you're here.
Oh.
Yeah, okay, okay.
What do you need me to do?
Do you have a cell phone?
Yeah, yeah.
Right here, right here.
Okay, I need you to make some calls.
Yeah.
What...
This is serious, isn't it?
Renard wants me dead.
They haven't found him.
- Good.
- But they found his car.
- Where?
- Laurelhurst.
Nick know anyone there?
Not that I know of.
Griffin.
Hey, Hank.
It's me, Bud.
Yeah, hi.
Look, we're kind of busy, Bud.
Yeah, yeah, I heard.
I kind of got a little problem.
What kind of problem?
I think I had a break-in in my repair shop.
You don't suppose you and Sergeant Wu could come over and check things out?
Because the perp...
That's what you call 'em, right?
- Uh-huh.
- Could still be in there.
I mean, what if he was a wanted man?
Yeah, yeah, that could be dangerous.
We're on our way.
You might want to change your clothes.
They're here, but...
But they took a cab.
Why would they take a cab?
Hey.
You took a cab so you wouldn't be followed, right?
Two cabs, one train, and a little walking.
Not in that order.
- Where is he?
- This way.
They put a tail on you?
- They did.
- We lost it.
We were followed too, but I'm pretty sure we lost them in a bar downtown.
Yeah, they were watching the loft when we left.
You left your car in Laurelhurst.
Last night.
They are searching the hell out of that area.
Well, that should keep 'em busy for a while.
- We contacted HW.
- Is anyone still alive?
Not here in Portland.
But Black Claw was badly compromised here too.
Renard is on his own.
Yeah, make it easier for us to kill him.
Not really.
He's got cops with him day and night.
So what do we do about Nick?
I think he has to leave Portland.
Renard won't stop until you're dead.
Then maybe that's what you have to do.
If I leave Portland, Renard will control everything.
Nick, we can't afford to lose you.
Look, we need to think of someplace safe, and obviously it's not here.
So I hate to say this, Nick, but maybe they're right.
Maybe you got to go.
You should go back to the precinct.
Get back to work like everything's normal.
I don't want you getting drawn into this any more than you already have.
I don't like it, but okay.
We're still searching the Laurelhurst area, but so far, we got nothing.
We've already checked several blocks away from the parked car.
He dumped it there for us to find.
- Captain?
- Yeah.
We've run every incoming and outgoing phone call on Burkhardt's cell phone.
Besides the ones we've already checked, there's only one other number that has any kind of frequency.
What is it?
Probably doesn't mean anything.
We checked it out.
It's a refrigerator repair company owned by a...
- Bud Wurstner.
- Yeah, that's him.
Check his house.
Check his repair shop.
I want teams at both places.
Now!
We're moving teams from here to here.
What do you want us to do when they're in place?
in's.
I don't like the look of that.
How do we stop that son of a bitch?
There's always a bullet.
I'm sort of half joking.
I'm sort of half laughing.
Something's going on.
That something's coming at us.
I know you know where Burkhardt is.
I will find him, and if either one of you gets in my way,
I'm coming for you next.
And we won't be hard to find.
If he finds Nick...
They're not gonna be bringing him in.
Renard wants uniforms to do his killing for him.
Griffin.
Where?
Yeah, white female body.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I got it.
Got a body ID'd as Rachel Wood.
Rachel Wood?
Yeah, I think you should come with me on this one.
We need to be watching our backs for the time being.
I mean, we could take you in our car, but if they're watching us, they're watching our car.
Why don't you just steal one?
'Cause there's a risk in that too.
- What about Bud?
- Wait, what?
What... what... what about me?
Your truck.
You're off the grid.
Mm, for now.
Any chance we can see what vehicles the police are tracking?
Whatever car they put a BOLO on should be in the system.
Can you get into the system?
If I access it, they'll know.
Wu could help, but somebody else is gonna have to make that call.
I'll call Wu.
Nobody can track my phone.
Do you know what these mean?
No.
When I was with Monroe and Rosalee,
I touched one of the Black Claw bodies.
Oh, yeah, right.
That was fun.
First time I've ever seen a death grip from a dead guy.
I saw these symbols on his face when I was there... and also on the cloth.
Maybe there was more on that cloth than we could see.
Do you still have the stick with you?
Yes.
I'm not sure you should be carrying it all the time.
Miss Wood's coworker grew concerned when he couldn't reach her.
He came over and discovered this.
All right.
Bring in CSU.
Get this whole place fingerprinted.
She was Renard's campaign PR person.
Yeah.
When you're murdered in bed, it's usually by someone you know.
274, go ahead.
This is Unit 274, near the corner of Marks and Milwaukee.
Just completed a drive-by.
There's one truck parked in front.
Belongs to the company.
No sign of the suspect.
No activity at the exterior of the premises.
We're gonna have to send somebody in.
This is not good.
There are bolos out on Monroe and Rosalee's cars, your car and mine...
And Bud's.
Bud's on the list?
Yup, and the BOLO just came back on his truck.
It's at his shop.
Son of a bitch.
We need to get Nick out of there now.
Call Trubel.
On it.
Oh, jeez!
Oh, jeez.
S-s-somebody's here.
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I...
Just calm down.
Probably just a customer.
Why don't you go find out what they want?
Right, right.
Business as usual.
Okay.
Wu.
Okay.
Yeah, I'll put you on speaker.
They know about Bud.
They put a BOLO out on his truck.
- It's in front of his shop.
- They're watching it, Nick.
You got to get out of there now.
- Got it, thanks.
- Check in with you when we can.
I'm gonna find out if Tactical's making a move.
- Check with Franco.
- Yup.
Well, looks clear.
- Oh, I hate that.
- What?
Oh, you know, people coming in here with a problem, asking me how much it's gonna cost to repair the refrigerator, and they don't even know what kind of refrigerator they got.
Bud, I don't think that was a customer.
That was a cop.
- Oh, God.
- They're watching the shop.
Nick, you got to get out of here, now.
We need a diversion.
If they think I'm in here, they're gonna send in a SERT team.
- Bud.
- Huh?
Back your truck into the loading bay.
Help him load in a freezer.
- Why?
- So they think you're in it.
- Bud.
- Wh-what?
You're the diversion.
Right, right, right.
They follow me.
Hey, you could fit in that one if you were gonna fit in one.
I haven't fixed it yet, but...
But I guess that doesn't matter right now.
- I don't see anybody.
- You won't.
Franco.
Hey, it's Wu.
Where are you?
Captain ordered me not to talk to you guys.
Captain's out of control.
Seems like, but he's still got rank.
I got to ask you something.
Drew, you're putting me in a tough spot here.
Okay, then you don't need to.
I'm gonna give you an address.
If that's where you are, don't say anything.
4046 Marks.
Thanks.
SERT team's been ordered to Bud's shop.
Franco's there.
It's going down.
What the hell are we gonna do?
Wish I knew.
We ran the fingerprints from the Rachel Wood apartment.
This is where it gets a little awkward.
Well, that's why I brought it up personally.
What kind of awkward are we talking about?
Captain Renard's fingerprints are all over that place.
I know she was working on his campaign, but I think she was working on something else.
All right.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Suspect's vehicle just pulled into the loading bay.
They loaded in a freezer big enough to hold a man.
They're getting ready to go.
Get in position.
Nick!
Nick!
We're too late.
They're surrounding the place.
We're all gonna die!
All clear.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Isn't there something you can do?
I can try.
- Eve!
- Oh!
I'm so sorry.
We're in position, sir.
Take them down.
Previously on "Grimm"...
Doesn't have to end here.
You chose the wrong side, Sean.
That's enough.
- Arrest him.
- Aah!
- Where's Eve?
- She went after Bonaparte.
We used the stick to heal her.
And then she woged and had some kind of seizure.
Tell me where he lives.
- Everybody into the tunnel.
- Nick, come on.
Let's go.
No!
I'm gonna stay here with Eve, make sure nobody follows us.
We'll see if there's an exit further down this way.
It's over.
How the hell?
Oh, come on!
We're gonna have to go back and find another way.
I'm pregnant.
I should have killed you when I had the chance.
I won't make that mistake again, huh?
_
I guess I should thank you.
I thought you were on his side.
You killed all of them.
You were shot.
You're not even wounded.
They said you were dead.
- I think I was.
- How does that happen?
I'm not sure.
Why'd you stop him?
I'm not sure either.
Maybe one of the others found a way out.
What... what was that?
We got to go back.
Yeah.
We break out.
We can circle back for Nick.
We shouldn't have left Nick.
He gave us no choice.
This fight's not over.
It is for Nick.
It would have been for us if we had stayed.
I'm not letting Renard get away with this.
Yeah, that son of a bitch is going down.
You hear that?
Sounds like water.
There's an opening.
It must connect to the city's storm drain.
Yeah, there's no way we can get out through there.
Oh, my God, this has to lead somewhere.
There.
This could be the way out.
Looks like there's some kind of door up here.
Oh, my God.
We can get out this way.
We got to go back and tell the others.
What?
I don't want to tell anybody about me being pregnant.
Okay, right.
I guess it's not really the time or the place for anything remotely happy.
I mean, why bring it up, right?
We may not even be getting out of here.
Hey.
We are getting out of here.
I don't need you to cheer me up right now.
We have no idea how many people attacked Nick or even if he's still alive or if they haven't found these tunnels and they're coming down here right now to kill us.
I mean, I think I actually need you to cheer me up right now.
Shh.
Listen to me.
If they come down here after us, it is gonna be their mistake.
Okay?
Come on.
Let's go.
What are we supposed to do now?
- We keep fighting.
- Meisner's dead.
Nick might be too.
We can't do this alone.
We regroup.
We rebuild.
Not in Portland.
I'm tired of waiting.
I'm going back for Nick.
You stay here.
You wait for the others.
I owe him.
- Now who's talking?
- I am.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Something's in the way.
- You're feeling stuff.
- No, I won't go back.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Did you guys find a way out?
Yeah, we can all get out, but it's back that way.
I'm going back for Nick.
Us too.
Hey, guys, we found a way out.
Nick didn't.
There's somebody coming.
All right, turn off the lights.
Now.
- Nick!
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.
- You're alive.
- How many are behind you?
- None.
What?
We saw tons of them.
Yeah, they're all dead.
- All of 'em?
- Including Bonaparte.
- You killed Bonaparte?
- No.
Renard did.
Renard?
Um... kind of looks like you were shot.
Like, more than once.
You're not a ghost, are you?
I hope not.
Daddy's gonna be all right.
It's okay.
Daddy's gonna be all right.
Daddy's gonna be all right.
Yeah.
It's okay.
Is Nick dead?
No.
What did you do to him?
- Not much.
- Is he okay?
- He's alive.
- Well, then how are you here?
What are you doing still alive?
Thanks for your concern.
You and Bonaparte went to kill Nick.
Why should I be concerned about you?
- Bonaparte is dead.
- What?
- Yeah, you must be relieved.
- Nick killed him?
No, he had nothing to do with it.
Then who did?
- I'm not entirely sure.
- You were there.
How did you not see who killed him?
- I saw it.
- You're not making any sense.
Because none of this makes any sense.
- Who killed him?
- I killed him.
I think.
Maybe.
I'm not sure.
- How can you not be sure - about something like that?
I stabbed him.
I stabbed him, but I didn't realize what I'd done until I saw that...
That bloody sword in my hand.
But you already know about that, don't you?
I had nothing to do with this.
Do you think I would risk that knowing what he can do to my children?
Has Diana been asleep all night?
You're gonna blame Diana for this too?
Well, somebody made me kill Bonaparte, just like somebody killed Rachel.
Who else has that kind of power?
She won't take Daddy away anymore.
Diana saw the bruises on my neck, and she asked me if you had done it.
And what did you tell her?
I said no, one of your friends did it and that she shouldn't worry about it.
What are you gonna do?
I'm not gonna let Diana control our lives.
If Diana made you kill Bonaparte,
I'd go a little easy on the discipline.
Bonaparte brought this on himself.
He would have killed me.
Maybe Diana just wanted her daddy to be a hero and save Mommy.
Well, she got her wish.
We better be careful what she wishes for.
Black Claw's gonna find out about Bonaparte, if they haven't already.
And they're gonna go after whoever did it.
I assume you're not gonna confess?
No.
Somebody is.
Who?
You should have never fallen in love with Burkhardt.
Now you're gonna regret it.
Hello.
Wake up.
Who is this?
Sean Renard.
I'm coming over.
At this hour?
I'll be outside your house in five minutes.
Mommy?
I'm sorry to wake you, sweetie.
That's okay.
Is something wrong?
Were you playing with your dolls again tonight?
- Mm-hmm.
I couldn't sleep.
- Why not?
Because of that man who hurt your neck.
He was mean, and I didn't want him to ever hurt you again, Mommy.
- Oh, my God, Nick.
- Dude, there's so many.
They came here to kill all of us.
Killed Bonaparte?
Renard didn't know what he was doing.
He's gonna be trying to figure out a way to explain it.
You healed me.
How?
It's the same way I was saved.
Monroe and I found this in the Black Forest.
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
What is it?
It's connected with those keys.
It's some kind of stick thing the crusaders took when they sacked Constantinople.
They hid it in a chest and then buried it under a church in the Black Forest behind a bunch of skulls that, when you turn the lights down, they kind of glow green and...
Long story.
Basically, we don't know what it is.
All we know is, it has some kind of power to heal.
You were dying.
Nick used it on you.
And it worked.
Then you had some kind of seizure.
And when you came to...
I felt different.
How do you feel now?
Something's changed.
Yeah, a lot's changed.
I'm gonna have to tell HW what's happened.
We should probably figure out how to deal with all these bodies.
I mean, we can't just leave them here, you know?
Not if you ever want to have a dinner party for the living.
Yeah, we have to deal with this.
Well, we can't put them in the elevator and walk them out the front door, so...
The tunnel.
There's a big hole down there, dumps right into the storm drain.
What about the three bodies at the spice shop?
We're gonna have to deal with them, too, while it's still dark.
I'll go with Monroe and Rosalee.
I'm gonna go with them too, seeing as I'm the one that killed them.
Meet up with you later.
So, uh, how do we get these guys down into the tunnel?
The hell do you think you're doing?
I need search warrants.
You woke me up for search warrants?
I need a lot of them.
I don't care if you are the new mayor.
You don't come here in the middle of the night demanding anything.
Bonaparte's dead.
What?
Burkhardt killed him.
The Grimm killed Bonaparte?
And I'm taking him down for it.
How many warrants do you need?
What the hell happened here?
We're not sure, Captain.
All we know is what the jailer told us.
Seven North Precinct cops were sent to transport Burkhardt to the North Precinct, and somehow, between the time he was taken out of his cell to before he got out of the building, these two got into it with somebody... or something.
There were no witnesses.
The rest of us were out on a bunch of bogus 911 calls.
And, you know, Captain, I think it's a little too coincidental that we got those calls just when they were coming to get Burkhardt.
He broke out before they could get him to the North Precinct.
What?
My guess is, Burkhardt had some help.
Nick?
I want him found, and I want him arrested.
Put out an APB.
Consider him armed and dangerous.
Sir, Nick wouldn't do this.
If he resists, shoot to kill.
Yes, sir.
You probably shouldn't stay here now.
Too many of the wrong people know where you live.
You stay out of sight till we find out what's going on.
You guys head back to the precinct.
See what you can find.
We'll call you when we know something.
Watch your backs.
Oh, this was on your desk at the precinct.
Adalind.
I'm so happy to hear your voice.
Are you all right?
Yeah, are you?
Renard was here.
He told me what happened.
He said Bonaparte's dead.
Is that true?
Yeah, but I didn't kill him.
I know.
Renard said he did.
Where is he now?
I don't know.
He left.
Nick, I really need to see you.
So does Kelly.
But I can't leave the house, not with the children here.
Can you come over?
The guards that were here are gone.
Nick, please, I need you.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Sorry for the mess.
This one's a Hundjaeger, and the other one was actually something
I've never seen before.
Let's get 'em out of here.
All right, you get the arms.
I'll get the legs.
He grabbed her!
Eve!
Eve!
She's not responding.
She's in some kind of trance.
He won't let go.
He's dead.
Try telling him that.
I can't get his hand off her.
I think I know what this is.
It's a death grip.
- You've seen this before?
- Read about it.
Has to do with the fear of dying and getting stuck in the underworld.
They believed that if you took a pure soul with you, you could trade your way into eternal afterlife or something.
Ah, here it is.
First documented by Egyptian Wesen under the reign of Merenre Nemtyemsaf II
- in the sixth dynasty.
- Oh, my God.
Does it say anything about how to stop it?
Yes, actually, it does.
I don't think we have time for a complicated spell.
Not that complicated.
Hurry up.
I think we're losing her.
Give me some room.
Oh!
Eve?
Yeah.
- Where the hell were you?
- I'm not sure.
I don't think you should be handling dead guys right now.
Thanks.
The death grip supposedly trades a pure soul for freedom from hell.
Pure soul?
I don't think so.
Yeah, that doesn't really make so much sense.
I mean, after everything she did?
No offense.
Maybe this has something to do with the stick.
Maybe your soul is not as dark as it used to be.
You know, like she got her soul cleaned.
I guess we could all use a little of that.
I just wish I knew what the hell we were dealing with, 'cause this piece of wood is scaring the crap out of me.
Aah!
Aah!
Oh, crap.
Those are the guys I killed.
Don't worry.
They'll never connect this to you.
There are no surveillance cameras.
I saw you do it, and if I didn't know it was you,
I wouldn't know it was you.
Hey.
I'm glad to see you guys.
I was worried you might be involved in this.
What?
In this?
Are you kidding us?
I don't know who's involved with what anymore.
All hell's breaking loose around here.
We just got word that North Precinct is basically wiped out.
It's FBI now, and Captain's on the warpath, blaming Burkhardt for everything.
I don't know what's going on between him and the captain, but it's getting bad.
- Why would Nick do any of this?
- What are you talking about?
Captain thinks Burkhardt killed these two cops
- when he was busted out.
- What?
Yeah, and now Burkhardt's on the run.
We just put out an APB on him with a shoot-to-kill order.
This is going south fast.
- Where's Captain?
- He's in his office.
Listen, has Nick contacted you?
No.
Well, I'm thinking he should be turning himself in... or getting the hell out of the country, because I don't want anything to do with taking down one of our own.
What's he doing?
Looks like he's cleaning out his office.
If Renard's looking for a legitimate way to kill Nick, you can bet we're on his list.
Well, Renard's on my list.
We need to warn Nick.
Yes.
Are you with Bonaparte?
No.
Where is he?
He's dead.
When?
Tonight.
How did he die?
The Grimm killed him.
We were told the Grimm was dead.
He should have been.
Something's protecting him.
I don't know what.
You find out and deal with it.
We have suffered a major setback in Portland.
It's imperative that you take control of the city.
I will.
Don't worry.
I'll have the Grimm in 24 hours.
Captain.
Search warrants just came in.
Anything else?
Just get ready to go.
Thank God you're alive.
This has been awful.
Did Renard do this no
- I give to your neck?
Berkeley, not you"
No, Bonaparte.
Nick, I'm the one who told him where you live.
He would have killed me and our son.
I know.
I know.
You didn't have a choice.
Where's Kelly?
In my room.
Hey.
Hey!
Has he been okay?
Yeah, but I know he misses you.
Hey, bud.
What is that?
An engagement ring for me and Renard.
Bonaparte put it there...
And not normally.
He said if I ever took it off, it would cause great pain to my children.
I hate it, but I'm afraid to take it off without knowing how to break the spell.
Even if he's dead, it could still survive.
We'll find a way to break it.
I need to be with you.
And what about Diana?
- She's with you now.
- I don't know.
I know she wants me and her father to be together, but I'm afraid of what she might do.
You don't know how powerful she is.
But I hate him.
I hate all of this.
I got to get out of here.
You can't leave yet, not until I deal with Renard.
I don't know how much longer I can do this.
It's Hank.
Yeah, what have you got?
Renard wants you dead.
We just got back to the precinct.
He's got an APB out on you with a shoot-to-kill order.
He's blaming what happened at North Precinct on you, among other things.
He wants to take you down with the legitimacy of the city behind him.
You need to find a place to lay low till we can figure this out.
Yeah, I'll call you when I get there.
I think we should stop using our cell phones.
Yeah.
I'll warn the others.
Good luck.
You too.
If he hurts you,
I will kill him.
You can't take any chances.
But if I don't come back, feel free.
Where are you gonna go?
No, no, no, no.
Don't tell me.
Nick?
He's not here.
Maybe they're still in the tunnel dumping bodies.
We're losing her, Nick.
I hope that thing does what we think it does.
Yeah, me too.
How much do you know about the stick that he used to heal me with?
Not much more than he told you.
Does he always carry it?
No, he got it out to help you.
Got it out from where?
Where he keeps it hidden with the cloth wrapped around it.
Kind of forgot I had it.
Nick left it on the bed when he got out the stick to heal you.
It's really old.
Ancient writing on it.
Can't really see most of it.
- Yeah.
- Trubel, where are you?
We're in the loft.
Nick's not here.
I know.
Is Eve with you?
I'm here.
What about Monroe and Rosalee?
They were headed home.
Monroe and Rosalee are home.
Listen, there's not much time.
Renard's got a APB out on Nick.
He's got every cop in the city looking for him.
Z!
@ ~ Am@n
Z
Z!
@ ~
Z
Z!
@ ~
Z
Z!
@ ~
He wants Nick dead.
Now, they'll be hitting Nick's loft, so get out of there.
Got it.
Hank was right.
Here they come.
- How are you feeling?
- Tired.
Me too.
But I'm happy.
Despite everything that's going on, the thought of being a dad and you being a mom and...
And us being a family.
I know.
- Although...
- What?
I've just been thinking.
Maybe Portland isn't, like, the safest place to raise a family right now, you know?
I mean, with Renard as mayor, who knows what's gonna become of this city?
Let's not think about that stuff anymore tonight.
Let's just try to get some sleep.
- Okay.
- I love you.
I love you too.
It's the precinct.
What now?
Hey, are you with Rosalee?
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.
She should hear this too.
- Okay.
- What's wrong?
Renard put out an APB shoot-to-kill on Nick.
- What?
- He's got search warrants.
They will be hitting your shop and your house.
Do not try to stop them.
- Where's Nick?
- We don't know.
And it's better that we don't.
This is the police!
- Oh, my God, they're here.
- You stay here.
I'm not staying here.
If they're gonna shoot one of us, it's going to be in front of the other.
We have a warrant!
Nope, that didn't come out right.
All right, all right.
- Open the door, now!
- Just a second.
We have a warrant for the arrest of Nicholas Burkhardt and a warrant for the search of the premises.
Okay, he's not here, man, and my wife is pregnant, so take your hands...
Do not attempt to interfere.
No Burkhardt.
Clear!
I think they're leaving.
There are patterns on this cloth.
Here?
I don't see 'em.
You don't?
They're right here and here and here.
I can't see what you're seeing.
I've seen them before.
Where?
No sign of Burkhardt yet.
All these locations have been checked and cleared.
A surveillance team has been left at each location.
- What about his vehicle?
- Hasn't been located.
- What about his phone?
- It's no longer operational.
He probably took the SIM card out.
He's somewhere in the city.
Well, by now, he knows it's a full-on manhunt.
And he's not stupid.
He knows how this works.
So he might not even be in the city anymore.
I don't care where he is.
I don't care what it takes.
I want him found!
You chose the wrong side, Sean.
We located Burkhardt's car.
- Where?
- Laurelhurst.
Seal off the area.
Search every house, block by block.
- One-mile perimeter.
- Sir, that's not...
Just do it!
Oh, my God!
Hey, take anything you want.
- Bud!
- Huh?
- It's me.
- Nick?
Oh, thank God.
You scared the living...
- I need your help.
- Well, yeah.
Of course.
Anything you need.
I'm guessing it's not your refrigerator.
No, but I'm on the run, and I need a place to hide.
Oh, that's why you're here.
Oh.
Yeah, okay, okay.
What do you need me to do?
Do you have a cell phone?
Yeah, yeah.
Right here, right here.
Okay, I need you to make some calls.
Yeah.
What...
This is serious, isn't it?
Renard wants me dead.
They haven't found him.
- Good.
- But they found his car.
- Where?
- Laurelhurst.
Nick know anyone there?
Not that I know of.
Griffin.
Hey, Hank.
It's me, Bud.
Yeah, hi.
Look, we're kind of busy, Bud.
Yeah, yeah, I heard.
I kind of got a little problem.
What kind of problem?
I think I had a break-in in my repair shop.
You don't suppose you and Sergeant Wu could come over and check things out?
Because the perp...
That's what you call 'em, right?
- Uh-huh.
- Could still be in there.
I mean, what if he was a wanted man?
Yeah, yeah, that could be dangerous.
We're on our way.
You might want to change your clothes.
They're here, but...
But they took a cab.
Why would they take a cab?
Hey.
You took a cab so you wouldn't be followed, right?
Two cabs, one train, and a little walking.
Not in that order.
- Where is he?
- This way.
They put a tail on you?
- They did.
- We lost it.
We were followed too, but I'm pretty sure we lost them in a bar downtown.
Yeah, they were watching the loft when we left.
You left your car in Laurelhurst.
Last night.
They are searching the hell out of that area.
Well, that should keep 'em busy for a while.
- We contacted HW.
- Is anyone still alive?
Not here in Portland.
But Black Claw was badly compromised here too.
Renard is on his own.
Yeah, make it easier for us to kill him.
Not really.
He's got cops with him day and night.
So what do we do about Nick?
I think he has to leave Portland.
Renard won't stop until you're dead.
Then maybe that's what you have to do.
If I leave Portland, Renard will control everything.
Nick, we can't afford to lose you.
Look, we need to think of someplace safe, and obviously it's not here.
So I hate to say this, Nick, but maybe they're right.
Maybe you got to go.
You should go back to the precinct.
Get back to work like everything's normal.
I don't want you getting drawn into this any more than you already have.
I don't like it, but okay.
We're still searching the Laurelhurst area, but so far, we got nothing.
We've already checked several blocks away from the parked car.
He dumped it there for us to find.
- Captain?
- Yeah.
We've run every incoming and outgoing phone call on Burkhardt's cell phone.
Besides the ones we've already checked, there's only one other number that has any kind of frequency.
What is it?
Probably doesn't mean anything.
We checked it out.
It's a refrigerator repair company owned by a...
- Bud Wurstner.
- Yeah, that's him.
Check his house.
Check his repair shop.
I want teams at both places.
Now!
We're moving teams from here to here.
What do you want us to do when they're in place?
in's.
I don't like the look of that.
How do we stop that son of a bitch?
There's always a bullet.
I'm sort of half joking.
I'm sort of half laughing.
Something's going on.
That something's coming at us.
I know you know where Burkhardt is.
I will find him, and if either one of you gets in my way,
I'm coming for you next.
And we won't be hard to find.
If he finds Nick...
They're not gonna be bringing him in.
Renard wants uniforms to do his killing for him.
Griffin.
Where?
Yeah, white female body.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I got it.
Got a body ID'd as Rachel Wood.
Rachel Wood?
Yeah, I think you should come with me on this one.
We need to be watching our backs for the time being.
I mean, we could take you in our car, but if they're watching us, they're watching our car.
Why don't you just steal one?
'Cause there's a risk in that too.
- What about Bud?
- Wait, what?
What... what... what about me?
Your truck.
You're off the grid.
Mm, for now.
Any chance we can see what vehicles the police are tracking?
Whatever car they put a BOLO on should be in the system.
Can you get into the system?
If I access it, they'll know.
Wu could help, but somebody else is gonna have to make that call.
I'll call Wu.
Nobody can track my phone.
Do you know what these mean?
No.
When I was with Monroe and Rosalee,
I touched one of the Black Claw bodies.
Oh, yeah, right.
That was fun.
First time I've ever seen a death grip from a dead guy.
I saw these symbols on his face when I was there... and also on the cloth.
Maybe there was more on that cloth than we could see.
Do you still have the stick with you?
Yes.
I'm not sure you should be carrying it all the time.
Miss Wood's coworker grew concerned when he couldn't reach her.
He came over and discovered this.
All right.
Bring in CSU.
Get this whole place fingerprinted.
She was Renard's campaign PR person.
Yeah.
When you're murdered in bed, it's usually by someone you know.
274, go ahead.
This is Unit 274, near the corner of Marks and Milwaukee.
Just completed a drive-by.
There's one truck parked in front.
Belongs to the company.
No sign of the suspect.
No activity at the exterior of the premises.
We're gonna have to send somebody in.
This is not good.
There are bolos out on Monroe and Rosalee's cars, your car and mine...
And Bud's.
Bud's on the list?
Yup, and the BOLO just came back on his truck.
It's at his shop.
Son of a bitch.
We need to get Nick out of there now.
Call Trubel.
On it.
Oh, jeez!
Oh, jeez.
S-s-somebody's here.
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I...
Just calm down.
Probably just a customer.
Why don't you go find out what they want?
Right, right.
Business as usual.
Okay.
Wu.
Okay.
Yeah, I'll put you on speaker.
They know about Bud.
They put a BOLO out on his truck.
- It's in front of his shop.
- They're watching it, Nick.
You got to get out of there now.
- Got it, thanks.
- Check in with you when we can.
I'm gonna find out if Tactical's making a move.
- Check with Franco.
- Yup.
Well, looks clear.
- Oh, I hate that.
- What?
Oh, you know, people coming in here with a problem, asking me how much it's gonna cost to repair the refrigerator, and they don't even know what kind of refrigerator they got.
Bud, I don't think that was a customer.
That was a cop.
- Oh, God.
- They're watching the shop.
Nick, you got to get out of here, now.
We need a diversion.
If they think I'm in here, they're gonna send in a SERT team.
- Bud.
- Huh?
Back your truck into the loading bay.
Help him load in a freezer.
- Why?
- So they think you're in it.
- Bud.
- Wh-what?
You're the diversion.
Right, right, right.
They follow me.
Hey, you could fit in that one if you were gonna fit in one.
I haven't fixed it yet, but...
But I guess that doesn't matter right now.
- I don't see anybody.
- You won't.
Franco.
Hey, it's Wu.
Where are you?
Captain ordered me not to talk to you guys.
Captain's out of control.
Seems like, but he's still got rank.
I got to ask you something.
Drew, you're putting me in a tough spot here.
Okay, then you don't need to.
I'm gonna give you an address.
If that's where you are, don't say anything.
4046 Marks.
Thanks.
SERT team's been ordered to Bud's shop.
Franco's there.
It's going down.
What the hell are we gonna do?
Wish I knew.
We ran the fingerprints from the Rachel Wood apartment.
This is where it gets a little awkward.
Well, that's why I brought it up personally.
What kind of awkward are we talking about?
Captain Renard's fingerprints are all over that place.
I know she was working on his campaign, but I think she was working on something else.
All right.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Suspect's vehicle just pulled into the loading bay.
They loaded in a freezer big enough to hold a man.
They're getting ready to go.
Get in position.
Nick!
Nick!
We're too late.
They're surrounding the place.
We're all gonna die!
All clear.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Isn't there something you can do?
I can try.
- Eve!
- Oh!
I'm so sorry.
We're in position, sir.
Take them down.
Stay Tuned For Scenes from Our Next Episode on January 13, 2017 Zia
- Aman == Z!
@ ~ Am@n
Previously on "Grimm"...
Doesn't have to end here.
You chose the wrong side, Sean.
That's enough.
- Arrest him.
- Aah!
- Where's Eve?
- She went after Bonaparte.
We used the stick to heal her.
And then she woged and had some kind of seizure.
Tell me where he lives.
- Everybody into the tunnel.
- Nick, come on.
Let's go.
No!
I'm gonna stay here with Eve, make sure nobody follows us.
We'll see if there's an exit further down this way.
It's over.
How the hell?
Oh, come on!
We're gonna have to go back and find another way.
I'm pregnant.
I should have killed you when I had the chance.
I won't make that mistake again, huh?
_
I guess I should thank you.
I thought you were on his side.
You killed all of them.
You were shot.
You're not even wounded.
They said you were dead.
- I think I was.
- How does that happen?
I'm not sure.
Why'd you stop him?
I'm not sure either.
Maybe one of the others found a way out.
What... what was that?
We got to go back.
Yeah.
We break out.
We can circle back for Nick.
We shouldn't have left Nick.
He gave us no choice.
This fight's not over.
It is for Nick.
It would have been for us if we had stayed.
I'm not letting Renard get away with this.
Yeah, that son of a bitch is going down.
You hear that?
Sounds like water.
There's an opening.
It must connect to the city's storm drain.
Yeah, there's no way we can get out through there.
Oh, my God, this has to lead somewhere.
There.
This could be the way out.
Looks like there's some kind of door up here.
Oh, my God.
We can get out this way.
We got to go back and tell the others.
What?
I don't want to tell anybody about me being pregnant.
Okay, right.
I guess it's not really the time or the place for anything remotely happy.
I mean, why bring it up, right?
We may not even be getting out of here.
Hey.
We are getting out of here.
I don't need you to cheer me up right now.
We have no idea how many people attacked Nick or even if he's still alive or if they haven't found these tunnels and they're coming down here right now to kill us.
I mean, I think I actually need you to cheer me up right now.
Shh.
Listen to me.
If they come down here after us, it is gonna be their mistake.
Okay?
Come on.
Let's go.
What are we supposed to do now?
- We keep fighting.
- Meisner's dead.
Nick might be too.
We can't do this alone.
We regroup.
We rebuild.
Not in Portland.
I'm tired of waiting.
I'm going back for Nick.
You stay here.
You wait for the others.
I owe him.
- Now who's talking?
- I am.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Something's in the way.
- You're feeling stuff.
- No, I won't go back.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Did you guys find a way out?
Yeah, we can all get out, but it's back that way.
I'm going back for Nick.
Us too.
Hey, guys, we found a way out.
Nick didn't.
There's somebody coming.
All right, turn off the lights.
Now.
- Nick!
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.
- You're alive.
- How many are behind you?
- None.
What?
We saw tons of them.
Yeah, they're all dead.
- All of 'em?
- Including Bonaparte.
- You killed Bonaparte?
- No.
Renard did.
Renard?
Um... kind of looks like you were shot.
Like, more than once.
You're not a ghost, are you?
I hope not.
Daddy's gonna be all right.
It's okay.
Daddy's gonna be all right.
Daddy's gonna be all right.
Yeah.
It's okay.
Is Nick dead?
No.
What did you do to him?
- Not much.
- Is he okay?
- He's alive.
- Well, then how are you here?
What are you doing still alive?
Thanks for your concern.
You and Bonaparte went to kill Nick.
Why should I be concerned about you?
- Bonaparte is dead.
- What?
- Yeah, you must be relieved.
- Nick killed him?
No, he had nothing to do with it.
Then who did?
- I'm not entirely sure.
- You were there.
How did you not see who killed him?
- I saw it.
- You're not making any sense.
Because none of this makes any sense.
- Who killed him?
- I killed him.
I think.
Maybe.
I'm not sure.
- How can you not be sure - about something like that?
I stabbed him.
I stabbed him, but I didn't realize what I'd done until I saw that...
That bloody sword in my hand.
But you already know about that, don't you?
I had nothing to do with this.
Do you think I would risk that knowing what he can do to my children?
Has Diana been asleep all night?
You're gonna blame Diana for this too?
Well, somebody made me kill Bonaparte, just like somebody killed Rachel.
Who else has that kind of power?
She won't take Daddy away anymore.
Diana saw the bruises on my neck, and she asked me if you had done it.
And what did you tell her?
I said no, one of your friends did it and that she shouldn't worry about it.
What are you gonna do?
I'm not gonna let Diana control our lives.
If Diana made you kill Bonaparte,
I'd go a little easy on the discipline.
Bonaparte brought this on himself.
He would have killed me.
Maybe Diana just wanted her daddy to be a hero and save Mommy.
Well, she got her wish.
We better be careful what she wishes for.
Black Claw's gonna find out about Bonaparte, if they haven't already.
And they're gonna go after whoever did it.
I assume you're not gonna confess?
No.
Somebody is.
Who?
You should have never fallen in love with Burkhardt.
Now you're gonna regret it.
Hello.
Wake up.
Who is this?
Sean Renard.
I'm coming over.
At this hour?
I'll be outside your house in five minutes.
Mommy?
I'm sorry to wake you, sweetie.
That's okay.
Is something wrong?
Were you playing with your dolls again tonight?
- Mm-hmm.
I couldn't sleep.
- Why not?
Because of that man who hurt your neck.
He was mean, and I didn't want him to ever hurt you again, Mommy.
- Oh, my God, Nick.
- Dude, there's so many.
They came here to kill all of us.
Killed Bonaparte?
Renard didn't know what he was doing.
He's gonna be trying to figure out a way to explain it.
You healed me.
How?
It's the same way I was saved.
Monroe and I found this in the Black Forest.
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
What is it?
It's connected with those keys.
It's some kind of stick thing the crusaders took when they sacked Constantinople.
They hid it in a chest and then buried it under a church in the Black Forest behind a bunch of skulls that, when you turn the lights down, they kind of glow green and...
Long story.
Basically, we don't know what it is.
All we know is, it has some kind of power to heal.
You were dying.
Nick used it on you.
And it worked.
Then you had some kind of seizure.
And when you came to...
I felt different.
How do you feel now?
Something's changed.
Yeah, a lot's changed.
I'm gonna have to tell HW what's happened.
We should probably figure out how to deal with all these bodies.
I mean, we can't just leave them here, you know?
Not if you ever want to have a dinner party for the living.
Yeah, we have to deal with this.
Well, we can't put them in the elevator and walk them out the front door, so...
The tunnel.
There's a big hole down there, dumps right into the storm drain.
What about the three bodies at the spice shop?
We're gonna have to deal with them, too, while it's still dark.
I'll go with Monroe and Rosalee.
I'm gonna go with them too, seeing as I'm the one that killed them.
Meet up with you later.
So, uh, how do we get these guys down into the tunnel?
The hell do you think you're doing?
I need search warrants.
You woke me up for search warrants?
I need a lot of them.
I don't care if you are the new mayor.
You don't come here in the middle of the night demanding anything.
Bonaparte's dead.
What?
Burkhardt killed him.
The Grimm killed Bonaparte?
And I'm taking him down for it.
How many warrants do you need?
What the hell happened here?
We're not sure, Captain.
All we know is what the jailer told us.
Seven North Precinct cops were sent to transport Burkhardt to the North Precinct, and somehow, between the time he was taken out of his cell to before he got out of the building, these two got into it with somebody... or something.
There were no witnesses.
The rest of us were out on a bunch of bogus 911 calls.
And, you know, Captain, I think it's a little too coincidental that we got those calls just when they were coming to get Burkhardt.
He broke out before they could get him to the North Precinct.
What?
My guess is, Burkhardt had some help.
Nick?
I want him found, and I want him arrested.
Put out an APB.
Consider him armed and dangerous.
Sir, Nick wouldn't do this.
If he resists, shoot to kill.
Yes, sir.
You probably shouldn't stay here now.
Too many of the wrong people know where you live.
You stay out of sight till we find out what's going on.
You guys head back to the precinct.
See what you can find.
We'll call you when we know something.
Watch your backs.
Oh, this was on your desk at the precinct.
Adalind.
I'm so happy to hear your voice.
Are you all right?
Yeah, are you?
Renard was here.
He told me what happened.
He said Bonaparte's dead.
Is that true?
Yeah, but I didn't kill him.
I know.
Renard said he did.
Where is he now?
I don't know.
He left.
Nick, I really need to see you.
So does Kelly.
But I can't leave the house, not with the children here.
Can you come over?
The guards that were here are gone.
Nick, please, I need you.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Sorry for the mess.
This one's a Hundjaeger, and the other one was actually something
I've never seen before.
Let's get 'em out of here.
All right, you get the arms.
I'll get the legs.
He grabbed her!
Eve!
Eve!
She's not responding.
She's in some kind of trance.
He won't let go.
He's dead.
Try telling him that.
I can't get his hand off her.
I think I know what this is.
It's a death grip.
- You've seen this before?
- Read about it.
Has to do with the fear of dying and getting stuck in the underworld.
They believed that if you took a pure soul with you, you could trade your way into eternal afterlife or something.
Ah, here it is.
First documented by Egyptian Wesen under the reign of Merenre Nemtyemsaf II
- in the sixth dynasty.
- Oh, my God.
Does it say anything about how to stop it?
Yes, actually, it does.
I don't think we have time for a complicated spell.
Not that complicated.
Hurry up.
I think we're losing her.
Give me some room.
Oh!
Eve?
Yeah.
- Where the hell were you?
- I'm not sure.
I don't think you should be handling dead guys right now.
Thanks.
The death grip supposedly trades a pure soul for freedom from hell.
Pure soul?
I don't think so.
Yeah, that doesn't really make so much sense.
I mean, after everything she did?
No offense.
Maybe this has something to do with the stick.
Maybe your soul is not as dark as it used to be.
You know, like she got her soul cleaned.
I guess we could all use a little of that.
I just wish I knew what the hell we were dealing with, 'cause this piece of wood is scaring the crap out of me.
Aah!
Aah!
Oh, crap.
Those are the guys I killed.
Don't worry.
They'll never connect this to you.
There are no surveillance cameras.
I saw you do it, and if I didn't know it was you,
I wouldn't know it was you.
Hey.
I'm glad to see you guys.
I was worried you might be involved in this.
What?
In this?
Are you kidding us?
I don't know who's involved with what anymore.
All hell's breaking loose around here.
We just got word that North Precinct is basically wiped out.
It's FBI now, and Captain's on the warpath, blaming Burkhardt for everything.
I don't know what's going on between him and the captain, but it's getting bad.
- Why would Nick do any of this?
- What are you talking about?
Captain thinks Burkhardt killed these two cops
- when he was busted out.
- What?
Yeah, and now Burkhardt's on the run.
We just put out an APB on him with a shoot-to-kill order.
This is going south fast.
- Where's Captain?
- He's in his office.
Listen, has Nick contacted you?
No.
Well, I'm thinking he should be turning himself in... or getting the hell out of the country, because I don't want anything to do with taking down one of our own.
What's he doing?
Looks like he's cleaning out his office.
If Renard's looking for a legitimate way to kill Nick, you can bet we're on his list.
Well, Renard's on my list.
We need to warn Nick.
Yes.
Are you with Bonaparte?
No.
Where is he?
He's dead.
When?
Tonight.
How did he die?
The Grimm killed him.
We were told the Grimm was dead.
He should have been.
Something's protecting him.
I don't know what.
You find out and deal with it.
We have suffered a major setback in Portland.
It's imperative that you take control of the city.
I will.
Don't worry.
I'll have the Grimm in 24 hours.
Captain.
Search warrants just came in.
Anything else?
Just get ready to go.
Thank God you're alive.
This has been awful.
Did Renard do this to your neck?
No, Bonaparte.
Nick, I'm the one who told him where you live.
He would have killed me and our son.
I know.
I know.
You didn't have a choice.
Where's Kelly?
In my room.
Hey.
Hey!
Has he been okay?
Yeah, but I know he misses you.
Hey, bud.
What is that?
An engagement ring for me and Renard.
Bonaparte put it there...
And not normally.
He said if I ever took it off, it would cause great pain to my children.
I hate it, but I'm afraid to take it off without knowing how to break the spell.
Even if he's dead, it could still survive.
We'll find a way to break it.
I need to be with you.
And what about Diana?
- She's with you now.
- I don't know.
I know she wants me and her father to be together, but I'm afraid of what she might do.
You don't know how powerful she is.
But I hate him.
I hate all of this.
I got to get out of here.
You can't leave yet, not until I deal with Renard.
I don't know how much longer I can do this.
It's Hank.
Yeah, what have you got?
Renard wants you dead.
We just got back to the precinct.
He's got an APB out on you with a shoot-to-kill order.
He's blaming what happened at North Precinct on you, among other things.
He wants to take you down with the legitimacy of the city behind him.
You need to find a place to lay low till we can figure this out.
Yeah, I'll call you when I get there.
I think we should stop using our cell phones.
Yeah.
I'll warn the others.
Good luck.
You too.
If he hurts you,
I will kill him.
You can't take any chances.
But if I don't come back, feel free.
Where are you gonna go?
No, no, no, no.
Don't tell me.
Nick?
He's not here.
Maybe they're still in the tunnel dumping bodies.
We're losing her, Nick.
I hope that thing does what we think it does.
Yeah, me too.
How much do you know about the stick that he used to heal me with?
Not much more than he told you.
Does he always carry it?
No, he got it out to help you.
Got it out from where?
Where he keeps it hidden with the cloth wrapped around it.
Kind of forgot I had it.
Nick left it on the bed when he got out the stick to heal you.
It's really old.
Ancient writing on it.
Can't really see most of it.
- Yeah.
- Trubel, where are you?
We're in the loft.
Nick's not here.
I know.
Is Eve with you?
I'm here.
What about Monroe and Rosalee?
They were headed home.
Monroe and Rosalee are home.
Listen, there's not much time.
Renard's got a APB out on Nick.
He's got every cop in the city looking for him.
He wants Nick dead.
Now, they'll be hitting Nick's loft, so get out of there.
Got it.
Hank was right.
Here they come.
- How are you feeling?
- Tired.
Me too.
But I'm happy.
Despite everything that's going on, the thought of being a dad and you being a mom and...
And us being a family.
I know.
- Although...
- What?
I've just been thinking.
Maybe Portland isn't, like, the safest place to raise a family right now, you know?
I mean, with Renard as mayor, who knows what's gonna become of this city?
Let's not think about that stuff anymore tonight.
Let's just try to get some sleep.
- Okay.
- I love you.
I love you too.
It's the precinct.
What now?
Hey, are you with Rosalee?
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.
She should hear this too.
- Okay.
- What's wrong?
Renard put out an APB shoot-to-kill on Nick.
- What?
- He's got search warrants.
They will be hitting your shop and your house.
Do not try to stop them.
- Where's Nick?
- We don't know.
And it's better that we don't.
This is the police!
- Oh, my God, they're here.
- You stay here.
I'm not staying here.
If they're gonna shoot one of us, it's going to be in front of the other.
We have a warrant!
Nope, that didn't come out right.
All right, all right.
- Open the door, now!
- Just a second.
We have a warrant for the arrest of Nicholas Burkhardt and a warrant for the search of the premises.
Okay, he's not here, man, and my wife is pregnant, so take your hands...
Do not attempt to interfere.
No Burkhardt.
Clear!
I think they're leaving.
There are patterns on this cloth.
Here?
I don't see 'em.
You don't?
They're right here and here and here.
I can't see what you're seeing.
I've seen them before.
Where?
No sign of Burkhardt yet.
All these locations have been checked and cleared.
A surveillance team has been left at each location.
- What about his vehicle?
- Hasn't been located.
- What about his phone?
- It's no longer operational.
He probably took the SIM card out.
He's somewhere in the city.
Well, by now, he knows it's a full-on manhunt.
And he's not stupid.
He knows how this works.
So he might not even be in the city anymore.
I don't care where he is.
I don't care what it takes.
I want him found!
You chose the wrong side, Sean.
We located Burkhardt's car.
- Where?
- Laurelhurst.
Seal off the area.
Search every house, block by block.
- One-mile perimeter.
- Sir, that's not...
Just do it!
Oh, my God!
Hey, take anything you want.
- Bud!
- Huh?
- It's me.
- Nick?
Oh, thank God.
You scared the living...
- I need your help.
- Well, yeah.
Of course.
Anything you need.
I'm guessing it's not your refrigerator.
No, but I'm on the run, and I need a place to hide.
Oh, that's why you're here.
Oh.
Yeah, okay, okay.
What do you need me to do?
Do you have a cell phone?
Yeah, yeah.
Right here, right here.
Okay, I need you to make some calls.
Yeah.
What...
This is serious, isn't it?
Renard wants me dead.
They haven't found him.
- Good.
- But they found his car.
- Where?
- Laurelhurst.
Nick know anyone there?
Not that I know of.
Griffin.
Hey, Hank.
It's me, Bud.
Yeah, hi.
Look, we're kind of busy, Bud.
Yeah, yeah, I heard.
I kind of got a little problem.
What kind of problem?
I think I had a break-in in my repair shop.
You don't suppose you and Sergeant Wu could come over and check things out?
Because the perp...
That's what you call 'em, right?
- Uh-huh.
- Could still be in there.
I mean, what if he was a wanted man?
Yeah, yeah, that could be dangerous.
We're on our way.
You might want to change your clothes.
They're here, but...
But they took a cab.
Why would they take a cab?
Hey.
You took a cab so you wouldn't be followed, right?
Two cabs, one train, and a little walking.
Not in that order.
- Where is he?
- This way.
They put a tail on you?
- They did.
- We lost it.
We were followed too, but I'm pretty sure we lost them in a bar downtown.
Yeah, they were watching the loft when we left.
You left your car in Laurelhurst.
Last night.
They are searching the hell out of that area.
Well, that should keep 'em busy for a while.
- We contacted HW.
- Is anyone still alive?
Not here in Portland.
But Black Claw was badly compromised here too.
Renard is on his own.
Yeah, make it easier for us to kill him.
Not really.
He's got cops with him day and night.
So what do we do about Nick?
I think he has to leave Portland.
Renard won't stop until you're dead.
Then maybe that's what you have to do.
If I leave Portland, Renard will control everything.
Nick, we can't afford to lose you.
Look, we need to think of someplace safe, and obviously it's not here.
So I hate to say this, Nick, but maybe they're right.
Maybe you got to go.
You should go back to the precinct.
Get back to work like everything's normal.
I don't want you getting drawn into this any more than you already have.
I don't like it, but okay.
We're still searching the Laurelhurst area, but so far, we got nothing.
We've already checked several blocks away from the parked car.
He dumped it there for us to find.
- Captain?
- Yeah.
We've run every incoming and outgoing phone call on Burkhardt's cell phone.
Besides the ones we've already checked, there's only one other number that has any kind of frequency.
What is it?
Probably doesn't mean anything.
We checked it out.
It's a refrigerator repair company owned by a...
- Bud Wurstner.
- Yeah, that's him.
Check his house.
Check his repair shop.
I want teams at both places.
Now!
We're moving teams from here to here.
What do you want us to do when they're in place?
in's.
I don't like the look of that.
How do we stop that son of a bitch?
There's always a bullet.
I'm sort of half joking.
I'm sort of half laughing.
Something's going on.
That something's coming at us.
I know you know where Burkhardt is.
I will find him, and if either one of you gets in my way,
I'm coming for you next.
And we won't be hard to find.
If he finds Nick...
They're not gonna be bringing him in.
Renard wants uniforms to do his killing for him.
Griffin.
Where?
Yeah, white female body.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I got it.
Got a body ID'd as Rachel Wood.
Rachel Wood?
Yeah, I think you should come with me on this one.
We need to be watching our backs for the time being.
I mean, we could take you in our car, but if they're watching us, they're watching our car.
Why don't you just steal one?
'Cause there's a risk in that too.
- What about Bud?
- Wait, what?
What... what... what about me?
Your truck.
You're off the grid.
Mm, for now.
Any chance we can see what vehicles the police are tracking?
Whatever car they put a BOLO on should be in the system.
Can you get into the system?
If I access it, they'll know.
Wu could help, but somebody else is gonna have to make that call.
I'll call Wu.
Nobody can track my phone.
Do you know what these mean?
No.
When I was with Monroe and Rosalee,
I touched one of the Black Claw bodies.
Oh, yeah, right.
That was fun.
First time I've ever seen a death grip from a dead guy.
I saw these symbols on his face when I was there... and also on the cloth.
Maybe there was more on that cloth than we could see.
Do you still have the stick with you?
Yes.
I'm not sure you should be carrying it all the time.
Miss Wood's coworker grew concerned when he couldn't reach her.
He came over and discovered this.
All right.
Bring in CSU.
Get this whole place fingerprinted.
She was Renard's campaign PR person.
Yeah.
When you're murdered in bed, it's usually by someone you know.
274, go ahead.
This is Unit 274, near the corner of Marks and Milwaukee.
Just completed a drive-by.
There's one truck parked in front.
Belongs to the company.
No sign of the suspect.
No activity at the exterior of the premises.
We're gonna have to send somebody in.
This is not good.
There are bolos out on Monroe and Rosalee's cars, your car and mine...
And Bud's.
Bud's on the list?
Yup, and the BOLO just came back on his truck.
It's at his shop.
Son of a bitch.
We need to get Nick out of there now.
Call Trubel.
On it.
Oh, jeez!
Oh, jeez.
S-s-somebody's here.
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I...
Just calm down.
Probably just a customer.
Why don't you go find out what they want?
Right, right.
Business as usual.
Okay.
Wu.
Okay.
Yeah, I'll put you on speaker.
They know about Bud.
They put a BOLO out on his truck.
- It's in front of his shop.
- They're watching it, Nick.
You got to get out of there now.
- Got it, thanks.
- Check in with you when we can.
I'm gonna find out if Tactical's making a move.
- Check with Franco.
- Yup.
Well, looks clear.
- Oh, I hate that.
- What?
Oh, you know, people coming in here with a problem, asking me how much it's gonna cost to repair the refrigerator, and they don't even know what kind of refrigerator they got.
Bud, I don't think that was a customer.
That was a cop.
- Oh, God.
- They're watching the shop.
Nick, you got to get out of here, now.
We need a diversion.
If they think I'm in here, they're gonna send in a SERT team.
- Bud.
- Huh?
Back your truck into the loading bay.
Help him load in a freezer.
- Why?
- So they think you're in it.
- Bud.
- Wh-what?
You're the diversion.
Right, right, right.
They follow me.
Hey, you could fit in that one if you were gonna fit in one.
I haven't fixed it yet, but...
But I guess that doesn't matter right now.
- I don't see anybody.
- You won't.
Franco.
Hey, it's Wu.
Where are you?
Captain ordered me not to talk to you guys.
Captain's out of control.
Seems like, but he's still got rank.
I got to ask you something.
Drew, you're putting me in a tough spot here.
Okay, then you don't need to.
I'm gonna give you an address.
If that's where you are, don't say anything.
4046 Marks.
Thanks.
SERT team's been ordered to Bud's shop.
Franco's there.
It's going down.
What the hell are we gonna do?
Wish I knew.
We ran the fingerprints from the Rachel Wood apartment.
This is where it gets a little awkward.
Well, that's why I brought it up personally.
What kind of awkward are we talking about?
Captain Renard's fingerprints are all over that place.
I know she was working on his campaign, but I think she was working on something else.
All right.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Suspect's vehicle just pulled into the loading bay.
They loaded in a freezer big enough to hold a man.
They're getting ready to go.
Get in position.
Nick!
Nick!
We're too late.
They're surrounding the place.
We're all gonna die!
All clear.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Isn't there something you can do?
I can try.
- Eve!
- Oh!
I'm so sorry.
We're in position, sir.
Take them down.
Previously on "Grimm"...
Doesn't have to end here.
You chose the wrong side, Sean.
That's enough.
- Arrest him.
- Aah!
- Where's Eve?
- She went after Bonaparte.
We used the stick to heal her.
And then she woged and had some kind of seizure.
Tell me where he lives.
- Everybody into the tunnel.
- Nick, come on.
Let's go.
No!
I'm gonna stay here with Eve, make sure nobody follows us.
We'll see if there's an exit further down this way.
It's over.
How the hell?
Come on!
We're gonna have to go back and find another way.
I'm pregnant.
I should have killed you when I had the chance.
I won't make that mistake again?
I guess I should thank you.
I thought you were on his side.
You killed all of them.
You were shot.
You're not even wounded.
They said you were dead.
- I think I was.
- How does that happen?
I'm not sure.
Why'd you stop him?
I'm not sure either.
Maybe one of the others found a way out.
What... what was that?
We got to go back.
Yeah.
We break out.
We can circle back for Nick.
We shouldn't have left Nick.
He gave us no choice.
This fight's not over.
It is for Nick.
It would have been for us if we had stayed.
I'm not letting Renard get away with this.
Yeah, that son of a bitch is going down.
You hear that?
Sounds like water.
There's an opening.
It must connect to the city's storm drain.
Yeah, there's no way we can get out through there.
My God, this has to lead somewhere.
There.
This could be the way out.
Looks like there's some kind of door up here.
My God.
We can get out this way.
We got to go back and tell the others.
What?
I don't want to tell anybody about me being pregnant.
Okay, right.
I guess it's not really the time or the place for anything remotely happy.
I mean, why bring it up, right?
We may not even be getting out of here.
Hey.
We are getting out of here.
I don't need you to cheer me up right now.
We have no idea how many people attacked Nick or even if he's still alive or if they haven't found these tunnels and they're coming down here right now to kill us.
I mean, I think I actually need you to cheer me up right now.
Shh.
Listen to me.
If they come down here after us, it is gonna be their mistake.
Okay?
Come on.
Let's go.
What are we supposed to do now?
- We keep fighting.
- Meisner's dead.
Nick might be too.
We can't do this alone.
We regroup.
We rebuild.
Not in Portland.
I'm tired of waiting.
I'm going back for Nick.
You stay here.
You wait for the others.
I owe him.
- Now who's talking?
- I am.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Something's in the way.
- You're feeling stuff.
- No, I won't go back.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Did you guys find a way out?
Yeah, we can all get out, but it's back that way.
I'm going back for Nick.
Us too.
Hey, guys, we found a way out.
Nick didn't.
There's somebody coming.
All right, turn off the lights.
Now.
- Nick!
- My God.
- Sorry.
- You're alive.
- How many are behind you?
- None.
What?
We saw tons of them.
Yeah, they're all dead.
- All of 'em?
- Including Bonaparte.
- You killed Bonaparte?
- No.
Renard did.
Renard?
Um... kind of looks like you were shot.
Like, more than once.
You're not a ghost, are you?
I hope not.
Daddy's gonna be all right.
It's okay.
Daddy's gonna be all right.
He's gonna be all right.
Yeah.
It's okay.
Is Nick dead?
No.
What did you do to him?
- Not much.
- Is he okay?
- He's alive.
- Well, then how are you here?
What are you doing still alive?
Thanks for your concern.
You and Bonaparte went to kill Nick.
Why should I be concerned about you?
- Bonaparte is dead.
- What?
- Yeah, you must be relieved.
- Nick killed him?
No, he had nothing to do with it.
Then who did?
- I'm not entirely sure.
- You were there.
How did you not see who killed him?
- I saw it.
- You're not making any sense.
Because none of this makes any sense.
- Who killed him?
- I killed him.
I think.
Maybe.
I'm not sure.
How can you not be sure about something like that?
I stabbed him.
I stabbed him, but I didn't realize what I'd done until I saw that... that bloody sword in my hand.
But you already know about that, don't you?
I had nothing to do with this.
Do you think I would risk that knowing what he can do to my children?
Has Diana been asleep all night?
You're gonna blame Diana for this too?
Well, somebody made me kill Bonaparte, just like somebody killed Rachel.
Who else has that kind of power?
She won't take Daddy away anymore.
Diana saw the bruises on my neck, and she asked me if you had done it.
And what did you tell her?
I said no, one of your friends did it and that she shouldn't worry about it.
What are you gonna do?
I'm not gonna let Diana control our lives.
If Diana made you kill Bonaparte,
I'd go a little easy on the discipline.
Bonaparte brought this on himself.
He would have killed me.
Maybe Diana just wanted her daddy to be a hero and save Mommy.
Well, she got her wish.
We better be careful what she wishes for.
Black Claw's gonna find out about Bonaparte, if they haven't already.
And they're gonna go after whoever did it.
I assume you're not gonna confess?
No.
Somebody is.
Who?
You should have never fallen in love with Burkhardt.
Now you're gonna regret it.
Hello.
Wake up.
Who is this?
Sean Renard.
I'm coming over.
At this hour?
I'll be outside your house in five minutes.
Mommy?
I'm sorry to wake you, sweetie.
That's okay.
Is something wrong?
Were you playing with your dolls again tonight?
- I couldn't sleep.
- Why not?
Because of that man who hurt your neck.
He was mean, and I didn't want him to ever hurt you again, Mommy.
- My God, Nick.
- Dude, there's so many.
They came here to kill all of us.
Killed Bonaparte?
Renard didn't know what he was doing.
He's gonna be trying to figure out a way to explain it.
You healed me.
How?
It's the same way I was saved.
Monroe and I found this in the Black Forest.
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
What is it?
It's connected with those keys.
It's some kind of stick thing the crusaders took when they sacked Constantinople.
They hid it in a chest and then buried it under a church in the Black Forest behind a bunch of skulls that, when you turn the lights down, they kind of glow green and...
Long story.
Basically, we don't know what it is.
All we know is, it has some kind of power to heal.
You were dying.
Nick used it on you.
And it worked.
Then you had some kind of seizure.
And when you came to...
I felt different.
How do you feel now?
Something's changed.
Yeah, a lot's changed.
I'm gonna have to tell HW what's happened.
We should probably figure out how to deal with all these bodies.
I mean, we can't just leave them here, you know?
Not if you ever want to have a dinner party for the living.
Yeah, we have to deal with this.
Well, we can't put them in the elevator and walk them out the front door, so...
The tunnel.
There's a big hole down there, dumps right into the storm drain.
What about the three bodies at the spice shop?
We're gonna have to deal with them, too, while it's still dark.
I'll go with Monroe and Rosalee.
I'm gonna go with them too, seeing as I'm the one that killed them.
Meet up with you later.
So, how do we get these guys down into the tunnel?
The hell do you think you're doing?
I need search warrants.
You woke me up for search warrants?
I need a lot of them.
I don't care if you are the new mayor.
You don't come here in the middle of the night demanding anything.
Bonaparte's dead.
What?
Burkhardt killed him.
The Grimm killed Bonaparte?
And I'm taking him down for it.
How many warrants do you need?
What the hell happened here?
We're not sure, Captain.
All we know is what the jailer told us.
Seven North Precinct cops were sent to transport Burkhardt to the North Precinct, and somehow, between the time he was taken out of his cell to before he got out of the building, these two got into it with somebody... or something.
There were no witnesses.
The rest of us were out on a bunch of bogus 911 calls.
And, you know, Captain, I think it's a little too coincidental that we got those calls just when they were coming to get Burkhardt.
He broke out before they could get him to the North Precinct.
What?
My guess is, Burkhardt had some help.
Nick?
I want him found, and I want him arrested.
Put out an APB.
Consider him armed and dangerous.
Sir, Nick wouldn't do this.
If he resists, shoot to kill.
Yes, sir.
You probably shouldn't stay here now.
Too many of the wrong people know where you live.
You stay out of sight till we find out what's going on.
You guys head back to the precinct.
See what you can find.
We'll call you when we know something.
Watch your backs.
This was on your desk at the precinct.
Adalind.
I'm so happy to hear your voice.
Are you all right?
Yeah, are you?
Renard was here.
He told me what happened.
He said Bonaparte's dead.
Is that true?
Yeah, but I didn't kill him.
I know.
Renard said he did.
Where is he now?
I don't know.
He left.
Nick, I really need to see you.
So does Kelly.
But I can't leave the house, not with the children here.
Can you come over?
The guards that were here are gone.
Nick, please, I need you.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Sorry for the mess.
This one's a Hundjaeger, and the other one was actually something
I've never seen before.
Let's get 'em out of here.
All right, you get the arms.
I'll get the legs.
He grabbed her!
Eve!
Eve!
She's not responding.
She's in some kind of trance.
He won't let go.
He's dead.
Try telling him that.
I can't get his hand off her.
I think I know what this is.
It's a death grip.
- You've seen this before?
- Read about it.
Has to do with the fear of dying and getting stuck in the underworld.
They believed that if you took a pure soul with you, you could trade your way into eternal afterlife or something.
Here it is.
First documented by Egyptian Wesen under the reign of Merenre Nemtyemsaf II in the sixth dynasty.
My God.
Does it say anything about how to stop it?
Yes, actually, it does.
I don't think we have time for a complicated spell.
Not that complicated.
Hurry up.
I think we're losing her.
Give me some room.
Eve?
Yeah.
- Where the hell were you?
- I'm not sure.
I don't think you should be handling dead guys right now.
Thanks.
The death grip supposedly trades a pure soul for freedom from hell.
Pure soul?
I don't think so.
Yeah, that doesn't really make so much sense.
I mean, after everything she did?
No offense.
Maybe this has something to do with the stick.
Maybe your soul is not as dark as it used to be.
You know, like she got her soul cleaned.
I guess we could all use a little of that.
I just wish I knew what the hell we were dealing with, 'cause this piece of wood is scaring the crap out of me.
Aah!
Aah!
Crap.
Those are the guys I killed.
Don't worry.
They'll never connect this to you.
There are no surveillance cameras.
I saw you do it, and if I didn't know it was you,
I wouldn't know it was you.
Hey.
I'm glad to see you guys.
I was worried you might be involved in this.
What?
In this?
Are you kidding us?
I don't know who's involved with what anymore.
All hell's breaking loose around here.
We just got word that North Precinct is basically wiped out.
It's FBI now, and Captain's on the warpath, blaming Burkhardt for everything.
I don't know what's going on between him and the captain, but it's getting bad.
Why would Nick do any of this?
What are you talking about?
Captain thinks Burkhardt killed these two cops
- when he was busted out.
- What?
Yeah, and now Burkhardt's on the run.
We just put out an APB on him with a shoot-to-kill order.
This is going south fast.
- Where's Captain?
- He's in his office.
Listen, has Nick contacted you?
No.
Well, I'm thinking he should be turning himself in... or getting the hell out of the country, because I don't want anything to do with taking down one of our own.
What's he doing?
Looks like he's cleaning out his office.
If Renard's looking for a legitimate way to kill Nick, you can bet we're on his list.
Well, Renard's on my list.
We need to warn Nick.
Yes.
Are you with Bonaparte?
No.
Where is he?
He's dead.
When?
Tonight.
How did he die?
The Grimm killed him.
We were told the Grimm was dead.
He should have been.
Something's protecting him.
I don't know what.
You find out and deal with it.
We have suffered a major setback in Portland.
It's imperative that you take control of the city.
I will.
Don't worry.
I'll have the Grimm in 24 hours.
Captain.
Search warrants just came in.
Anything else?
Just get ready to go.
Thank God you're alive.
This has been awful.
Did Renard do this to your neck?
No, Bonaparte.
Nick, I'm the one who told him where you live.
He would have killed me and our son.
I know.
I know.
You didn't have a choice.
Where's Kelly?
In my room.
Hey.
Hey!
Has he been okay?
Yeah, but I know he misses you.
Hey, bud.
What is that?
An engagement ring for me and Renard.
Bonaparte put it there...
and not normally.
He said if I ever took it off, it would cause great pain to my children.
I hate it, but I'm afraid to take it off without knowing how to break the spell.
Even if he's dead, it could still survive.
We'll find a way to break it.
I need to be with you.
And what about Diana?
She's with you now.
I don't know.
I know she wants me and her father to be together, but I'm afraid of what she might do.
You don't know how powerful she is.
But I hate him.
I hate all of this.
I got to get out of here.
You can't leave yet, not until I deal with Renard.
I don't know how much longer I can do this.
It's Hank.
Yeah, what have you got?
Renard wants you dead.
We just got back to the precinct.
He's got an APB out on you with a shoot-to-kill order.
He's blaming what happened at North Precinct on you, among other things.
He wants to take you down with the legitimacy of the city behind him.
You need to find a place to lay low till we can figure this out.
Yeah, I'll call you when I get there.
I think we should stop using our cell phones.
Yeah.
I'll warn the others.
Good luck.
You too.
If he hurts you,
I will kill him.
You can't take any chances.
But if I don't come back, feel free.
Where are you gonna go?
No, no, no, no.
Don't tell me.
Nick?
He's not here.
Maybe they're still in the tunnel dumping bodies.
We're losing her, Nick.
I hope that thing does what we think it does.
Yeah, me too.
How much do you know about the stick that he used to heal me with?
Not much more than he told you.
Does he always carry it?
No, he got it out to help you.
Got it out from where?
Where he keeps it hidden with the cloth wrapped around it.
Kind of forgot I had it.
Nick left it on the bed when he got out the stick to heal you.
It's really old.
Ancient writing on it.
Can't really see most of it.
- Yeah.
- Trubel, where are you?
We're in the loft.
Nick's not here.
I know.
Is Eve with you?
I'm here.
What about Monroe and Rosalee?
They were headed home.
Monroe and Rosalee are home.
Listen, there's not much time.
Renard's got a APB out on Nick.
He's got every cop in the city looking for him.
He wants Nick dead.
Now, they'll be hitting Nick's loft, so get out of there.
Got it.
Hank was right.
Here they come.
- How are you feeling?
- Tired.
Me too.
But I'm happy.
Despite everything that's going on, the thought of being a dad and you being a mom and...
And us being a family.
I know.
- Although...
- What?
I've just been thinking.
Maybe Portland isn't, like, the safest place to raise a family right now, you know?
I mean, with Renard as mayor, who knows what's gonna become of this city?
Let's not think about that stuff anymore tonight.
Let's just try to get some sleep.
- Okay.
- I love you.
I love you too.
It's the precinct.
What now?
Hey, are you with Rosalee?
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.
She should hear this too.
- Okay.
- What's wrong?
Renard put out an APB shoot-to-kill on Nick.
- What?
- He's got search warrants.
They will be hitting your shop and your house.
Do not try to stop them.
- Where's Nick?
- We don't know.
And it's better that we don't.
This is the police!
- My God, they're here.
- You stay here.
I'm not staying here.
If they're gonna shoot one of us, it's going to be in front of the other.
We have a warrant!
Nope, that didn't come out right.
All right, all right.
- Open the door, now!
- Just a second.
We have a warrant for the arrest of Nicholas Burkhardt and a warrant for the search of the premises.
Okay, he's not here, man, and my wife is pregnant, so take your hands...
Do not attempt to interfere.
No Burkhardt.
Clear!
I think they're leaving.
There are patterns on this cloth.
Here?
I don't see 'em.
You don't?
They're right here and here and here.
I can't see what you're seeing.
I've seen them before.
Where?
No sign of Burkhardt yet.
All these locations have been checked and cleared.
A surveillance team has been left at each location.
- What about his vehicle?
- Hasn't been located.
- What about his phone?
- It's no longer operational.
He probably took the SIM card out.
He's somewhere in the city.
Well, by now, he knows it's a full-on manhunt.
And he's not stupid.
He knows how this works.
So he might not even be in the city anymore.
I don't care where he is.
I don't care what it takes.
I want him found!
You chose the wrong side, Sean.
We located Burkhardt's car.
- Where?
- Laurelhurst.
Seal off the area.
Search every house, block by block.
- Onemile perimeter.
- Sir, that's not...
Just do it!
My God!
Hey, take anything you want.
Bud!
- It's me.
- Nick?
Thank God.
You scared the living...
- I need your help.
- Well, yeah.
Of course.
Anything you need.
I'm guessing it's not your refrigerator.
No, but I'm on the run, and I need a place to hide.
That's why you're here.
Yeah, okay, okay.
What do you need me to do?
Do you have a cell phone?
Yeah, yeah.
Right here, right here.
Okay, I need you to make some calls.
Yeah.
What...
This is serious, isn't it?
Renard wants me dead.
They haven't found him.
- Good.
- But they found his car.
- Where?
- Laurelhurst.
Nick know anyone there?
Not that I know of.
Griffin.
Hey, Hank.
It's me, Bud.
Yeah, hi.
Look, we're kind of busy, Bud.
Yeah, yeah, I heard.
I kind of got a little problem.
What kind of problem?
I think I had a break-in in my repair shop.
You don't suppose you and Sergeant Wu could come over and check things out?
Because the perp...
that's what you call 'em, right?
-
- Could still be in there.
I mean, what if he was a wanted man?
Yeah, yeah, that could be dangerous.
We're on our way.
You might want to change your clothes.
They're here, but...
but they took a cab.
Why would they take a cab?
Hey.
You took a cab so you wouldn't be followed, right?
Two cabs, one train, and a little walking.
Not in that order.
- Where is he?
- This way.
They put a tail on you?
- They did.
- We lost it.
We were followed too, but I'm pretty sure we lost them in a bar downtown.
Yeah, they were watching the loft when we left.
You left your car in Laurelhurst.
Last night.
They are searching the hell out of that area.
Well, that should keep 'em busy for a while.
- We contacted HW.
- Is anyone still alive?
Not here in Portland.
But Black Claw was badly compromised here too.
Renard is on his own.
Yeah, make it easier for us to kill him.
Not really.
He's got cops with him day and night.
So what do we do about Nick?
I think he has to leave Portland.
Renard won't stop until you're dead.
Then maybe that's what you have to do.
If I leave Portland, Renard will control everything.
Nick, we can't afford to lose you.
Look, we need to think of someplace safe, and obviously it's not here.
So I hate to say this, Nick, but maybe they're right.
Maybe you got to go.
You should go back to the precinct.
Get back to work like everything's normal.
I don't want you getting drawn into this any more than you already have.
I don't like it, but okay.
We're still searching the Laurelhurst area, but so far, we got nothing.
We've already checked several blocks away from the parked car.
He dumped it there for us to find.
- Captain?
- Yeah.
We've run every incoming and outgoing phone call on Burkhardt's cell phone.
Besides the ones we've already checked, there's only one other number that has any kind of frequency.
What is it?
Probably doesn't mean anything.
We checked it out.
It's a refrigerator repair company owned by a...
- Bud Wurstner.
- Yeah, that's him.
Check his house.
Check his repair shop.
I want teams at both places.
Now!
We're moving teams from here to here.
What do you want us to do when they're in place?
I don't like the look of that.
How do we stop that son of a bitch?
There's always a bullet.
I'm sort of half joking.
I'm sort of half laughing.
Something's going on.
That something's coming at us.
I know you know where Burkhardt is.
I will find him, and if either one of you gets in my way,
I'm coming for you next.
And we won't be hard to find.
If he finds Nick...
They're not gonna be bringing him in.
Renard wants uniforms to do his killing for him.
Griffin.
Where?
Yeah, white female body.
Yeah.
I got it.
Got a body ID'd as Rachel Wood.
Rachel Wood?
Yeah, I think you should come with me on this one.
We need to be watching our backs for the time being.
I mean, we could take you in our car, but if they're watching us, they're watching our car.
Why don't you just steal one?
'Cause there's a risk in that too.
- What about Bud?
- Wait, what?
What... what... what about me?
Your truck.
You're off the grid.
For now.
Any chance we can see what vehicles the police are tracking?
Whatever car they put a BOLO on should be in the system.
Can you get into the system?
If I access it, they'll know.
Wu could help, but somebody else is gonna have to make that call.
I'll call Wu.
Nobody can track my phone.
Do you know what these mean?
No.
When I was with Monroe and Rosalee,
I touched one of the Black Claw bodies.
Yeah, right.
That was fun.
First time I've ever seen a death grip from a dead guy.
I saw these symbols on his face when I was there... and also on the cloth.
Maybe there was more on that cloth than we could see.
Do you still have the stick with you?
Yes.
I'm not sure you should be carrying it all the time.
Miss Wood's coworker grew concerned when he couldn't reach her.
He came over and discovered this.
All right.
Bring in CSU.
Get this whole place fingerprinted.
She was Renard's campaign PR person.
Yeah.
When you're murdered in bed, it's usually by someone you know.
274, go ahead.
This is Unit 274, near the corner of Marks and Milwaukee.
Just completed a drive-by.
There's one truck parked in front.
Belongs to the company.
No sign of the suspect.
No activity at the exterior of the premises.
We're gonna have to send somebody in.
This is not good.
There are bolos out on Monroe and Rosalee's cars, your car and mine... and Bud's.
Bud's on the list?
Yup, and the BOLO just came back on his truck.
It's at his shop.
Son of a bitch.
We need to get Nick out of there now.
Call Trubel.
On it.
Jeez!
Jeez.
S-s-somebody's here.
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I...
Just calm down.
Probably just a customer.
Why don't you go find out what they want?
Right, right.
Business as usual.
Okay.
Wu.
Okay.
Yeah, I'll put you on speaker.
They know about Bud.
They put a BOLO out on his truck.
It's in front of his shop.
They're watching it, Nick.
You got to get out of there now.
- Got it, thanks.
- Check in with you when we can.
I'm gonna find out if Tactical's making a move.
- Check with Franco.
- Yup.
Well, looks clear.
- I hate that.
- What?
You know, people coming in here with a problem, asking me how much it's gonna cost to repair the refrigerator, and they don't even know what kind of refrigerator they got.
Bud, I don't think that was a customer.
That was a cop.
- God.
- They're watching the shop.
Nick, you got to get out of here, now.
We need a diversion.
If they think I'm in here, they're gonna send in a SERT team.
Bud.
Back your truck into the loading bay.
Help him load in a freezer.
- Why?
- So they think you're in it.
- Bud.
- Wh-what?
You're the diversion.
Right, right, right.
They follow me.
Hey, you could fit in that one if you were gonna fit in one.
I haven't fixed it yet, but... but I guess that doesn't matter right now.
- I don't see anybody.
- You won't.
Franco.
Hey, it's Wu.
Where are you?
Captain ordered me not to talk to you guys.
Captain's out of control.
Seems like, but he's still got rank.
I got to ask you something.
Drew, you're putting me in a tough spot here.
Okay, then you don't need to.
I'm gonna give you an address.
If that's where you are, don't say anything.
4046 Marks.
Thanks.
SERT team's been ordered to Bud's shop.
Franco's there.
It's going down.
What the hell are we gonna do?
Wish I knew.
We ran the fingerprints from the Rachel Wood apartment.
This is where it gets a little awkward.
Well, that's why I brought it up personally.
What kind of awkward are we talking about?
Captain Renard's fingerprints are all over that place.
I know she was working on his campaign, but I think she was working on something else.
All right.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Suspect's vehicle just pulled into the loading bay.
They loaded in a freezer big enough to hold a man.
They're getting ready to go.
Get in position.
Nick!
Nick!
We're too late.
They're surrounding the place.
We're all gonna die!
All clear.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Isn't there something you can do?
I can try.
Eve!
I'm so sorry.
We're in position, sir.
Take them down.
- You chose the wrong side, Sean.
[Choking and gasping]
- That's enough.
[Gunshot]
[Men grunting]
- Arrest him.
- Aah!
-Where'sEve?
-ShewentafterBonaparte.
-Andthenshe woged andhadsomekindofseizure.
- [Choking]
- Tell me where he lives.
- Everybody into the tunnel.
- Nick, come on.
Let's go.
- No!
- I'm gonna stay here with Eve, make sure nobody follows us.
- We'll see if there's an exit further down this way.
- It's over.
How the hell?
[Yells]
- Oh, come on!
We're gonna have to go back and find another way.
- I'm pregnant.
-I shouldhavekilledyou whenI hadthechance.
I won't make that mistake again, huh?
[Intensemusic]
¶¶ [dramaticmusic]
¶¶
- I guess I should thank you.
I thought you were on his side.
- You killed all of them.
You were shot.
You're not even wounded.
They said you were dead.
- I think I was.
- How does that happen?
- I'm not sure.
Why'd you stop him?
- I'm not sure either.
- [Sighs] Maybe one of the others found a way out.
[Metallic clatter]
What--what was that?
- We got to go back.
- Yeah.
- We break out.
We can circle back for Nick.
- We shouldn't have left Nick.
- He gave us no choice.
This fight's not over.
- It would have been for us if we had stayed.
I'm not letting renard get away with this.
- Yeah, that son of a bitch is going down.
- You hear that?
[Water rushing faintly]
- Sounds like water.
There's an opening.
It must connect to the city's storm drain.
- Yeah, there's no way we can get out through there.
[Both sigh]
- Oh, my god, this has to lead somewhere.
- There.
This could be the way out.
[Softdramaticmusic]
¶¶
looks like there's some kind of door up here.
[Banging]
¶¶ oh, my god.
We got to go back and tell the others.
What?
- I don't want to tell anybody about me being pregnant.
- Okay, right.
I guess it's not really the time or the place for anything remotely happy.
- I mean, why bring it up, right?
We may not even be getting out of here.
- Hey.
We are getting out of here.
- I don't need you to cheer me up right now.
We have no idea how many people attacked Nick or even if he's still alive or if they haven't found these tunnels and they're coming down here right now to kill us.
I mean, I think I actually need you to cheer me up right now.
- Shh.
Listen to me.
If they come down here after us, it is gonna be their mistake.
Okay?
- [Chuckles]
- Come on.
Let's go.
- What are we supposed to do now?
- We keep fighting.
- Meisner's dead.
Nick might be too.
We can't do this alone.
- We regroup.
We rebuild.
- Not in Portland.
[Sighs]
I'm tired of waiting.
I'm going back for Nick.
- You stay here.
You wait for the others.
I owe him.
- Now who's talking?
- I am.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's wrong?
- I don't know.
Something's in the way.
- You're feeling stuff.
- No, I won't go back.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- Yeah, we can all get out, but it's back that way.
- I'm going back for Nick.
- Us too.
- Hey, guys, we found a way out.
- Nick didn't.
[Intensemusic]
¶¶ [footsteps tapping]
- There's somebody coming.
- All right, turn off the lights.
Now.
- Nick!
- Oh, my god.
- Sorry.
- You're alive.
- How many are behind you?
- None.
- What?
We saw tons of them.
- Yeah, they're all dead.
- All of 'em?
- Including Bonaparte.
- You killed Bonaparte?
- No.
Renard did.
- Renard?
- Um...
Kind of looks like you were shot.
- Like, more than once.
- You're not a ghost, are you?
- I hope not.
[Tensemusic]
¶¶
- daddy's gonna be all right.
It's okay.
Daddy's gonna be all right.
He's gonna be all right.
Yeah.
[Door clicks shut]
[Baby cooing]
It's okay.
[Door clicks open]
Is Nick dead?
- No.
- What did you do to him?
- Not much.
- Is he okay?
- He's alive.
- Well, then how are you here?
What are you doing still alive?
- Thanks for your concern.
- You and Bonaparte went to kill Nick.
Why should I be concerned about you?
- Bonaparte is dead.
- What?
- Yeah, you must be relieved.
- Nick killed him?
- No, he had nothing to do with it.
- Then who did?
- I'm not entirely sure.
- You were there.
How did you not see who killed him?
- I saw it.
- You're not making any sense.
- Because none of this makes any sense.
- Who killed him?
- I killed him.
I think.
Maybe.
- How can you not be sure about something like that?
- I stabbed him.
I stabbed him, but I didn't realize what I'd done until I saw that-- that bloody sword in my hand.
But you already know about that, don't you?
- I had nothing to do with this.
Do you think i would risk that knowing what he can do to my children?
- Has Diana been asleep all night?
- You're gonna blame Diana for this too?
- Well, somebody made me kill Bonaparte, just like somebody killed Rachel.
Who else has that kind of power?
- She won't take daddy away anymore.
- Diana saw the bruises on my neck, and she asked me if you had done it.
- And what did you tell her?
- I said no, one of your friends did it and that she shouldn't worry about it.
What are you gonna do?
- I'm not gonna let Diana control our lives.
- If Diana made you kill Bonaparte,
I'd go a little easy on the discipline.
[Sighs] Bonaparte brought this on himself.
He would have killed me.
Maybe Diana just wanted her daddy to be a hero and save mommy.
- Well, she got her wish.
- We better be careful what she wishes for.
- Black claw's gonna find out about Bonaparte, if they haven't already.
And they're gonna go after whoever did it.
- I assume you're not gonna confess?
- No.
Somebody is.
- Who?
- You should have never fallen in love with Burkhardt.
Now you're gonna regret it.
¶¶
[cell phone buzzing]
- Hello.
-Wakeup .
-Seanrenard.
I'mcomingover.
-I 'llbeoutsideyourhouse infiveminutes.
[Lineclicksandbeeps]
- [Sighs]
[Softeeriemusic]
¶¶
- mommy?
- I'm sorry to wake you, sweetie.
- That's okay.
Is something wrong?
- Were you playing with your dolls again tonight?
- Mm-hmm.
I couldn't sleep.
- Why not?
- Because of that man who hurt your neck.
and I didn't want him to ever hurt you again, mommy.
¶¶
- oh, my god, Nick.
- Dude, there's so many.
- They came here to kill all of us.
- Killed Bonaparte?
- Renard didn't know what he was doing.
He's gonna be trying to figure out a way to explain it.
- You healed me.
How?
- It's the same way i was saved.
Monroe and I found this in the black forest.
- I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
- What is it?
- It's connected with those keys.
- It's some kind of stick thing the crusaders took
They hid it in a chest and then buried it under a church in the black forest behind a bunch of skulls that, when you turn the lights down, they kind of glow green and- long story.
Basically, we don't know what it is.
- All we know is, it has some kind of power to heal.
- You were dying.
Nick used it on you.
- And it worked.
- Then you had some kind of seizure.
- And when you came to...
- I felt different.
- How do you feel now?
- Something's changed.
- Yeah, a lot's changed.
I'm gonna have to tell hw what's happened.
- We should probably figure out
I mean, we can't just leave them here, you know?
Not if you ever want to have a dinner party for the living.
- Yeah, we have to deal with this.
- Well, we can't put them in the elevator and walk them out the front door, so...
- The tunnel.
There's a big hole down there, dumps right into the storm drain.
- What about the three bodies at the spice shop?
- We're gonna have to deal with them, too, while it's still dark.
- I'll go with Monroe and rosalee.
- I'm gonna go with them too, seeing as I'm the one that killed them.
- Meet up with you later.
- So, uh, how do we get these guys down into the tunnel?
[Thud]
[Suspensefulmusic]
¶¶
- the hell do you think you're doing?
- I need search warrants.
- You woke me up for search warrants?
- I need a lot of them.
You don't come here in the middle of the night demanding anything.
- Bonaparte's dead.
- What?
- Burkhardt killed him.
- The grimm killed Bonaparte?
- And I'm taking him down for it.
- How many warrants do you need?
[Policeradiochatter]
[Indistinct chatter]
- What the hell happened here?
All we know is what the jailer told us.
Seven north precinct cops were sent to transport Burkhardt to the north precinct, and somehow, between the time he was taken out of his cell to before he got out of the building, these two got into it with somebody...
Or something.
The rest of us were out on a bunch of bogus 911 calls.
it's a little too coincidental that we got those calls just when they were coming to get Burkhardt.
- He broke out before they could get him to the north precinct.
- What?
- My guess is, Burkhardt had some help.
- Nick?
- I want him found, and I want him arrested.
Put out an apb.
Consider him armed and dangerous.
- Sir, Nick wouldn't do this.
- If he resists, shoot to kill.
- Yes, sir.
- [Grunting]
- You probably shouldn't stay here now.
Too many of the wrong people know where you live.
- You stay out of sight till we find out what's going on.
- You guys head back to the precinct.
See what you can find.
- Watch your backs.
[Cell phone buzzes]
- Oh, this was on your desk at the precinct.
- Adalind.
- I'm so happy to hear your voice.
Are you all right?
-Yeah,areyou ?
- Renard was here.
HesaidBonaparte'sdead.
Isthattrue?
- Yeah, but I didn't kill him.
- I know.
Renard said he did.
- Where is he now?
-I don'tknow.
Heleft .
Nick, I really need to see you.
So does Kelly.
But I can't leave the house, notwiththechildrenhere .
Canyoucomeover?
The guards that were here are gone.
Nick, please, I need you.
-I 'llbethere assoonas Ican .
- Sorry for the mess.
This one's a hundjaeger, and the other one was actually something
I've never seen before.
- Let's get 'em out of here.
- All right, you get the arms.
I'll get the legs.
[Electricity crackling]
[Lightbulb shatters]
- He grabbed her!
- Eve!
- Eve!
- She's not responding.
She's in some kind of trance.
- He won't let go.
[Glass shatters]
- He's dead.
- Try telling him that.
[Dramaticmusic]
¶¶
- [yells]
¶¶
- I can't get his hand off her.
- I think I know what this is.
It's a death grip.
- You've seen this before?
- Read about it.
Has to do with the fear of dying and getting stuck in the underworld.
They believed that if you took a pure soul with you, you could trade your way into eternal afterlife or something.
¶¶
- [grunting]
- Ah, here it is.
First documented by Egyptian wesen under the reign of merenre nemtyemsaf ii
Does it say anything about how to stop it?
- Yes, actually, it does.
- I don't think we have time for a complicated spell.
- Not that complicated.
¶¶
- hurry up.
I think we're losing her.
- Give me some room.
- Oh!
- [Gasping]
- Eve?
- Yeah.
- Where the hell were you?
- I'm not sure.
- I don't think you should be handling dead guys right now.
- Thanks.
- The death grip supposedly trades a pure soul for freedom from hell.
- Pure soul?
- Yeah, that doesn't really make so much sense.
I mean, after everything she did?
No offense.
- Maybe this has something to do with the stick.
Maybe your soul is not as dark as it used to be.
You know, like she got her soul cleaned.
- I guess we could all use a little of that.
- I just wish I knew what the hell we were dealing with, 'cause this piece of wood is scaring the crap out of me.
[Indistinct chatter]
[Both snarling]
- Aah!
Aah!
Oh, crap.
Those are the guys I killed.
- Don't worry.
They'll never connect this to you.
There are no surveillance cameras.
I saw you do it, and if I didn't know it was you,
I wouldn't know it was you.
- Hey.
I'm glad to see you guys.
I was worried you might be involved in this.
- What?
In this?
Are you kidding us?
- I don't know who's involved with what anymore.
All hell's breaking loose around here.
We just got word that north precinct is basically wiped out.
It's FBI now, and captain's on the warpath, blaming Burkhardt for everything.
I don't know what's going on between him and the captain, but it's getting bad.
Why would Nick do any of this?
- What are you talking about?
- Captain thinks Burkhardt killed these two cops when he was busted out.
- What?
- Yeah, and now Burkhardt's on the run.
We just put out an apb on him with a shoot-to-kill order.
This is going south fast.
- Where's captain?
- He's in his office.
Listen, has Nick contacted you?
- No.
- Well, I'm thinking he should be turning himself in...
Or getting the hell out of the country, because I don't want anything to do with taking down one of our own.
[Dramaticmusic]
¶¶
- what's he doing?
- Looks like he's cleaning out his office.
If renard's looking for a legitimate way to kill Nick, you can bet we're on his list.
- Well, renard's on my list.
- We need to warn Nick.
[Cell phone ringing and buzzing]
- [Sighs]
Yes.
-AreyouwithBonaparte?
- No.
-Whereis he ?
- He's dead.
-When?
- Tonight.
-Howdidhedie?
- The grimm killed him.
-Weweretold thegrimmwasdead.
- He should have been.
Something's protecting him.
I don't know what.
-Youfindout anddealwithit.
Wehavesuffered amajorsetbackinPortland.
It'simperativethatyou takecontrolof thecity.
- I will.
Don't worry.
I'll have the grimm in 24 hours.
[Linebeeps]
¶¶
[knock at door]
- Captain.
Search warrants just came in.
Anything else?
- Just get ready to go.
¶¶
- Thank god you're alive.
This has been awful.
- Did renard do this to your neck?
- No, Bonaparte.
Nick, I'm the one who told him where you live.
He would have killed me and our son.
- I know.
I know.
You didn't have a choice.
Where's Kelly?
- In my room.
[Baby cooing]
- Hey.
Hey!
Has he been okay?
- Yeah, but I know he misses you.
- Hey, bud.
What is that?
- An engagement ring for me and renard.
Bonaparte put it there-- and not normally.
He said if I ever took it off, it would cause great pain to my children.
I hate it, but I'm afraid to take it off without knowing how to break the spell.
Even if he's dead, it could still survive.
- We'll find a way to break it.
- I need to be with you.
[Baby cooing]
- And what about Diana?
She's with you now.
- I don't know.
I know she wants me and her father to be together, but I'm afraid of what she might do.
You don't know how powerful she is.
But I hate him.
I hate all of this.
I got to get out of here.
- You can't leave yet, not until I deal with renard.
- I don't know how much longer I can do this.
[Cell phone ringing]
- It's Hank.
Yeah, what have you got?
-Renardwantsyou dead.
We just got back to the precinct.
He's got an apb out on you with a shoot-to-kill order.
He'sblamingwhathappened atnorthprecinctonyou, among other things.
He wants to take you down with the legitimacy of the city behind him.
Youneedto findaplace tolaylow tillwecanfigurethis out.
- Yeah, I'll call you when I get there.
-I thinkwe shouldstop usingourcellphones.
- Yeah.
- I'll warn the others.
Good luck.
-Youtoo.
-Ifhe hurtsyou ,
I will kill him.
- You can't take any chances.
But if I don't come back, feel free.
- Where are you gonna go?
No, no, no, no.
Don't tell me.
[Softmusic]
¶¶
- Nick?
- He's not here.
- Maybe they're still in the tunnel dumping bodies.
- We're losing her, Nick.
I hope that thing does what we think it does.
- Yeah, me too.
- How much do you know about the stick that he used to heal me with?
- Not much more than he told you.
- Does he always carry it?
- No, he got it out to help you.
- Got it out from where?
- Where he keeps it hidden with the cloth wrapped around it.
Kind of forgot I had it.
Nick left it on the bed when he got out the stick to heal you.
It's really old.
Ancient writing on it.
Can't really see most of it.
[Cell phone rings]
- Yeah.
-Trubel,whereare you ?
- We're in the loft.
Nick's not here.
-I know.
IsEvewithyou ?
- I'm here.
- What about Monroe and rosalee?
-Theywereheadedhome .
- Monroe and rosalee are home.
Listen, there's not much time.
Renard's got a apb out on Nick.
He's got every cop in the city looking for him.
Now,they'llbe hitting Nick'sloft, sogetoutofthere.
- Got it.
[Sirens wailing]
Hank was right.
Here they come.
- How are you feeling?
- Tired.
- Me too.
But I'm happy.
Despite everything that's going on, the thought of being a dad and you being a mom and- and us being a family.
I know.
- Although...
- What?
- I've just been thinking.
Maybe Portland isn't, like, the safest place to raise a family right now, you know?
I mean, with renard as mayor, who knows what's gonna become of this city?
- Let's not think about that stuff anymore tonight.
Let's just try to get some sleep.
- Okay.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
[Softmusic]
[Cell phone rings]
It's the precinct.
-[Whispering] Hey, are you with rosalee?
-Yeah.
- Okay, good.
She should hear this too.
- Okay.
- What's wrong?
- Renard put out an apb shoot-to-kill on Nick.
- What?
-He'sgotsearchwarrants.
Theywillbe hittingyourshop andyourhouse.
Do not try to stop them.
-Where'sNick?
- We don't know.
And it's better that we don't.
[Poundingondoor]
-Thisis thepolice!
- Oh, my god, they're here.
- You stay here.
- I'm not staying here.
If they're gonna shoot one of us,
[Poundingondoor]
-Wehaveawarrant!
- Nope, that didn't come out right.
-Openthedoor,now!
- Just a second.
- We have a warrant for the arrest of Nicholas Burkhardt and a warrant for the search of the premises.
- Okay, he's not here, man, and my wife is pregnant, so take your hands- do not attempt to interfere.
[Intensemusic]
¶¶ [men speaking indistinctly]
¶¶
-noBurkhardt.
Clear!
[Elevatorwhirring]
- I think they're leaving.
- There are patterns on this cloth.
Here?
- I don't see 'em.
- You don't?
They're right here and here and here.
- I can't see what you're seeing.
- I've seen them before.
- Where?
[Intensemusic]
- No sign of Burkhardt yet.
All these locations have been checked and cleared.
A surveillance team has been left at each location.
- What about his vehicle?
- Hasn't been located.
- What about his phone?
- It's no longer operational.
He probably took the sim card out.
- He's somewhere in the city.
- Well, by now, he knows it's a full-on manhunt.
And he's not stupid.
He knows how this works.
So he might not even be in the city anymore.
- I don't care where he is.
I don't care what it takes.
I want him found!
- You chose the wrong side, Sean.
- We located Burkhardt's car.
- Where?
- Laurelhurst.
- Seal off the area.
Search every house, block by block.
One-mile perimeter.
- Sir, that's not- just do it!
[Dramaticmusic]
¶¶ [train horn blowing]
- Oh, my god!
Hey, take anything you want.
- Bud!
- Huh?
- It's me.
- Nick?
Oh, thank god.
You scared the living--
- I need your help.
- Well, yeah.
Of course.
Anything you need.
I'm guessing it's not your refrigerator.
- No, but I'm on the run, and I need a place to hide.
- Oh, that's why you're here.
Oh.
Yeah, okay, okay.
What do you need me to do?
- Yeah, yeah.
Right here, right here.
- Okay, I need you to make some calls.
- Yeah.
What...
This is serious, isn't it?
- Renard wants me dead.
-Theyhaven'tfoundhim.
- Good.
- But they found his car.
- Where?
- Laurelhurst.
Nick know anyone there?
- Not that I know of.
[Phone rings]
Griffin.
-Hey,Hank.
It'sme,bud.
- Yeah, hi.
Look, we're kind of busy, bud.
- Yeah, yeah, I heard.
I kind of got a little problem.
-Whatkindofproblem?
- I think I had a break-in in my repair shop.
Youdon'tsuppose youandsergeantwu couldcomeover andcheckthingsout ?
Because the perp-- that's what you call 'em, right?
-Uh-huh.
- Could still be in there.
I mean, what if he was a wanted man?
- Yeah, yeah, that could be dangerous.
We're on our way.
You might want to change your clothes.
¶¶
- they're here, but-- but they took a cab.
Why would they take a cab?
- Hey.
- You took a cab so you wouldn't be followed, right?
- Two cabs, one train, and a little walking.
Not in that order.
- Where is he?
- This way.
- They put a tail on you?
- They did.
- We lost it.
- We were followed too, but I'm pretty sure we lost them in a bar downtown.
- Yeah, they were watching the loft when we left.
- You left your car in laurelhurst.
- They are searching the hell out of that area.
- Well, that should keep 'em busy for a while.
- We contacted hw.
- Is anyone still alive?
- Not here in Portland.
- But black claw was badly compromised here too.
Renard is on his own.
- Yeah, make it easier for us to kill him.
- Not really.
He's got cops with him day and night.
- So what do we do about Nick?
- I think he has to leave Portland.
Renard won't stop until you're dead.
- Then maybe that's what you have to do.
- If I leave Portland, renard will control everything.
- Look, we need to think of someplace safe, and obviously it's not here.
So I hate to say this, Nick, but maybe they're right.
Maybe you got to go.
- You should go back to the precinct.
Get back to work like everything's normal.
I don't want you getting drawn into this any more than you already have.
- I don't like it, but okay.
-We'restillsearching thelaurelhurstarea, but so far, we got nothing.
We've already checked several blocks away from the parked car.
- He dumped it there for us to find.
- Captain?
- Yeah.
- We've run every incoming and outgoing phone call on Burkhardt's cell phone.
Besides the ones we've already checked, there's only one other number that has any kind of frequency.
- What is it?
- Probably doesn't mean anything.
We checked it out.
It's a refrigerator repair company owned by a...
- Bud wurstner.
- Yeah, that's him.
- Check his house.
Check his repair shop.
I want teams at both places.
Now!
What do you want us to do when they're in place?
- How do we stop that son of a bitch?
- There's always a bullet.
I'm sort of half joking.
- I'm sort of half laughing.
- Something's going on.
- That something's coming at us.
[Suspensefulmusic]
¶¶
- I know you know where Burkhardt is.
I will find him, and if either one of you gets in my way,
I'm coming for you next.
- And we won't be hard to find.
- If he finds Nick...
[Cell phone ringing]
They're not gonna be bringing him in.
Renard wants uniforms to do his killing for him.
- Griffin.
Where?
Yeah, white female body.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I got it.
Got a body ID'd as Rachel wood.
- Rachel wood?
- Yeah, I think you should come with me on this one.
We need to be watching our backs for the time being.
- I mean, we could take you in our car, but if they're watching us, they're watching our car.
- Why don't you just steal one?
- 'Cause there's a risk in that too.
- What about bud?
- Wait, what?
What--what--what about me?
- Your truck.
You're off the grid.
- Mm, for now.
- Any chance we can see what vehicles the police are tracking?
- Whatever car they put a bolo on should be in the system.
- Can you get into the system?
- If I access it, they'll know.
Wu could help, but somebody else is gonna have to make that call.
- I'll call wu.
Nobody can track my phone.
- Do you know what these mean?
- No.
- When I was with Monroe and rosalee,
I touched one of the black claw bodies.
- Oh, yeah, right.
That was fun.
First time I've ever seen a death grip from a dead guy.
- I saw these symbols on his face when I was there...
And also on the cloth.
- Maybe there was more on that cloth than we could see.
- Do you still have the stick with you?
- Yes.
- I'm not sure you should be carrying it all the time.
- Miss wood's coworker grew concerned when he couldn't reach her.
He came over and discovered this.
- All right.
Bring in csu.
Get this whole place fingerprinted.
- She was renard's campaign PR person.
- Yeah.
When you're murdered in bed, it's usually by someone you know.
[Dramaticmusic]
¶¶
-274,go ahead.
- This is unit 274, near the corner of marks and Milwaukee.
Just completed a drive-by.
There's one truck parked in front.
Belongs to the company.
No sign of the suspect.
No activity at the exterior of the premises.
We're gonna have to send somebody in.
- This is not good.
There are bolos out on Monroe and rosalee's cars, your car and mine-- and bud's.
- Yup, and the bolo just came back on his truck.
It's at his shop.
- Son of a bitch.
We need to get Nick out of there now.
Call trubel.
- On it.
[Doorbellbuzzes]
- Oh, jeez!
Oh, jeez.
S-s-somebody's here.
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do i- just calm down.
Probably just a customer.
[Cell phone ringing]
Why don't you go find out what they want?
- Right, right.
Business as usual.
Okay.
- Wu.
Okay.
Yeah, I'll put you on speaker.
-Theyknowaboutbud.
They put a bolo out on his truck.
It's in front of his shop.
- They're watching it, Nick.
Yougotto getout oftherenow.
- Got it, thanks.
- Check in with you when we can.
- I'm gonna find out if tactical's making a move.
Check with Franco.
- Yup.
- Well, looks clear.
- Oh, I hate that.
- What?
- Oh, you know, people coming in here it's gonna cost to repair the refrigerator, and they don't even know what kind of refrigerator they got.
- Bud, I don't think that was a customer.
That was a cop.
- Oh, god.
- They're watching the shop.
- Nick, you got to get out of here, now.
- We need a diversion.
If they think I'm in here, they're gonna send in a sert team.
Bud.
- Huh?
- Back your truck into the loading bay.
Help him load in a freezer.
- Why?
- So they think you're in it.
- Bud.
- Wh-what?
- You're the diversion.
- Right, right, right.
They follow me.
Hey, you could fit in that one if you were gonna fit in one.
I haven't fixed it yet, but-- but I guess that doesn't matter right now.
- I don't see anybody.
- You won't.
[Cell phone rings]
- Franco.
- Hey, it's wu.
Where are you?
- Captain ordered me not to talk to you guys.
- Captain's out of control.
- Seems like, but he's still got rank.
-I gotto askyou something.
- Drew, you're putting me in a tough spot here.
- Okay, then you don't need to.
I'm gonna give you an address.
If that's where you are, don't say anything.
4046marks.
Thanks.
[Linebeeps]
- Sert team's been ordered to bud's shop.
- Franco's there.
It's going down.
- What the hell are we gonna do?
- Wish I knew.
- We ran the fingerprints from the Rachel wood apartment.
This is where it gets a little awkward.
Well, that's why i brought it up personally.
- What kind of awkward are we talking about?
- Captain renard's fingerprints are all over that place.
I know she was working on his campaign, but I think she was working on something else.
- All right.
- [Grunting]
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Okay.
[Grunting]
[Tires squealing]
[Intensemusic]
¶¶
- suspect's vehicle just pulled into the loading bay.
They loaded in a freezer big enough to hold a man.
- They're getting ready to go.
Get in position.
- Nick!
Nick!
We're too late.
They're surrounding the place.
We're all gonna die!
-Allclear.
Let'sgo.
Let'sgo.
- Isn't there something you can do?
- I can try.
- Eve!
- Oh!
I'm so sorry.
- We're in position, sir.
- Take them down.
Previously on "Grimm"...
Doesn't have to end here.
You chose the wrong side, Sean.
That's enough.
- Arrest him.
- Aah!
- Where's Eve?
- She went after Bonaparte.
We used the stick to heal her.
And then she woged and had some kind of seizure.
Tell me where he lives.
- Everybody into the tunnel.
- Nick, come on.
Let's go.
No!
I'm gonna stay here with Eve, make sure nobody follows us.
We'll see if there's an exit further down this way.
It's over.
How the hell?
Come on!
We're gonna have to go back and find another way.
I'm pregnant.
I should have killed you when I had the chance.
I won't make that mistake again?
I guess I should thank you.
I thought you were on his side.
You killed all of them.
You were shot.
You're not even wounded.
They said you were dead.
- I think I was.
- How does that happen?
I'm not sure.
Why'd you stop him?
I'm not sure either.
Maybe one of the others found a way out.
What... what was that?
We got to go back.
Yeah.
We break out.
We can circle back for Nick.
We shouldn't have left Nick.
He gave us no choice.
This fight's not over.
It is for Nick.
It would have been for us if we had stayed.
I'm not letting Renard get away with this.
Yeah, that son of a bitch is going down.
You hear that?
Sounds like water.
There's an opening.
It must connect to the city's storm drain.
Yeah, there's no way we can get out through there.
My God, this has to lead somewhere.
There.
This could be the way out.
Looks like there's some kind of door up here.
My God.
We can get out this way.
We got to go back and tell the others.
What?
I don't want to tell anybody about me being pregnant.
Okay, right.
I guess it's not really the time or the place for anything remotely happy.
I mean, why bring it up, right?
We may not even be getting out of here.
Hey.
We are getting out of here.
I don't need you to cheer me up right now.
We have no idea how many people attacked Nick or even if he's still alive or if they haven't found these tunnels and they're coming down here right now to kill us.
I mean, I think I actually need you to cheer me up right now.
Shh.
Listen to me.
If they come down here after us, it is gonna be their mistake.
Okay?
Come on.
Let's go.
What are we supposed to do now?
- We keep fighting.
- Meisner's dead.
Nick might be too.
We can't do this alone.
We regroup.
We rebuild.
Not in Portland.
I'm tired of waiting.
I'm going back for Nick.
You stay here.
You wait for the others.
I owe him.
- Now who's talking?
- I am.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Something's in the way.
- You're feeling stuff.
- No, I won't go back.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Did you guys find a way out?
Yeah, we can all get out, but it's back that way.
I'm going back for Nick.
Us too.
Hey, guys, we found a way out.
Nick didn't.
There's somebody coming.
All right, turn off the lights.
Now.
- Nick!
- My God.
- Sorry.
- You're alive.
- How many are behind you?
- None.
What?
We saw tons of them.
Yeah, they're all dead.
- All of 'em?
- Including Bonaparte.
- You killed Bonaparte?
- No.
Renard did.
Renard?
Um... kind of looks like you were shot.
Like, more than once.
You're not a ghost, are you?
I hope not.
Daddy's gonna be all right.
It's okay.
Daddy's gonna be all right.
Daddy's gonna be all right.
Yeah.
It's okay.
Is Nick dead?
No.
What did you do to him?
- Not much.
- Is he okay?
- He's alive.
- Well, then how are you here?
What are you doing still alive?
Thanks for your concern.
You and Bonaparte went to kill Nick.
Why should I be concerned about you?
- Bonaparte is dead.
- What?
- Yeah, you must be relieved.
- Nick killed him?
No, he had nothing to do with it.
Then who did?
- I'm not entirely sure.
- You were there.
How did you not see who killed him?
- I saw it.
- You're not making any sense.
Because none of this makes any sense.
- Who killed him?
- I killed him.
I think.
Maybe.
I'm not sure.
- How can you not be sure.
- About something like that?
I stabbed him.
I stabbed him, but I didn't realize what I'd done until I saw that...
That bloody sword in my hand.
But you already know about that, don't you?
I had nothing to do with this.
Do you think I would risk that knowing what he can do to my children?
Has Diana been asleep all night?
You're gonna blame Diana for this too?
Well, somebody made me kill Bonaparte, just like somebody killed Rachel.
Who else has that kind of power?
She won't take Daddy away anymore.
Diana saw the bruises on my neck, and she asked me if you had done it.
And what did you tell her?
I said no, one of your friends did it and that she shouldn't worry about it.
What are you gonna do?
I'm not gonna let Diana control our lives.
If Diana made you kill Bonaparte,
I'd go a little easy on the discipline.
Bonaparte brought this on himself.
He would have killed me.
Maybe Diana just wanted her daddy to be a hero and save Mommy.
Well, she got her wish.
We better be careful what she wishes for.
Black Claw's gonna find out about Bonaparte, if they haven't already.
And they're gonna go after whoever did it.
I assume you're not gonna confess?
No.
Somebody is.
Who?
You should have never fallen in love with Burkhardt.
Now you're gonna regret it.
Hello.
Wake up.
Who is this?
Sean Renard.
I'm coming over.
At this hour?
I'll be outside your house in five minutes.
Mommy?
I'm sorry to wake you, sweetie.
That's okay.
Is something wrong?
Were you playing with your dolls again tonight?
- I couldn't sleep.
- Why not?
Because of that man who hurt your neck.
He was mean, and I didn't want him to ever hurt you again, Mommy.
- My God, Nick.
- Dude, there's so many.
They came here to kill all of us.
Killed Bonaparte?
Renard didn't know what he was doing.
He's gonna be trying to figure out a way to explain it.
You healed me.
How?
It's the same way I was saved.
Monroe and I found this in the Black Forest.
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
What is it?
It's connected with those keys.
It's some kind of stick thing the crusaders took when they sacked Constantinople.
They hid it in a chest and then buried it under a church in the Black Forest behind a bunch of skulls that, when you turn the lights down, they kind of glow green and...
Long story.
Basically, we don't know what it is.
All we know is, it has some kind of power to heal.
You were dying.
Nick used it on you.
And it worked.
Then you had some kind of seizure.
And when you came to...
I felt different.
How do you feel now?
Something's changed.
Yeah, a lot's changed.
I'm gonna have to tell HW what's happened.
We should probably figure out how to deal with all these bodies.
I mean, we can't just leave them here, you know?
Not if you ever want to have a dinner party for the living.
Yeah, we have to deal with this.
Well, we can't put them in the elevator and walk them out the front door, so...
The tunnel.
There's a big hole down there, dumps right into the storm drain.
What about the three bodies at the spice shop?
We're gonna have to deal with them, too, while it's still dark.
I'll go with Monroe and Rosalee.
I'm gonna go with them too, seeing as I'm the one that killed them.
Meet up with you later.
So, how do we get these guys down into the tunnel?
The hell do you think you're doing?
I need search warrants.
You woke me up for search warrants?
I need a lot of them.
I don't care if you are the new mayor.
You don't come here in the middle of the night demanding anything.
Bonaparte's dead.
What?
Burkhardt killed him.
The Grimm killed Bonaparte?
And I'm taking him down for it.
How many warrants do you need?
What the hell happened here?
We're not sure, Captain.
All we know is what the jailer told us.
Seven North Precinct cops were sent to transport Burkhardt to the North Precinct, and somehow, between the time he was taken out of his cell to before he got out of the building, these two got into it with somebody... or something.
There were no witnesses.
The rest of us were out on a bunch of bogus 911 calls.
And, you know, Captain, I think it's a little too coincidental that we got those calls just when they were coming to get Burkhardt.
He broke out before they could get him to the North Precinct.
What?
My guess is, Burkhardt had some help.
Nick?
I want him found, and I want him arrested.
Put out an APB.
Consider him armed and dangerous.
Sir, Nick wouldn't do this.
If he resists, shoot to kill.
Yes, sir.
You probably shouldn't stay here now.
Too many of the wrong people know where you live.
You stay out of sight till we find out what's going on.
You guys head back to the precinct.
See what you can find.
We'll call you when we know something.
Watch your backs.
This was on your desk at the precinct.
Adalind.
I'm so happy to hear your voice.
Are you all right?
Yeah, are you?
Renard was here.
He told me what happened.
He said Bonaparte's dead.
Is that true?
Yeah, but I didn't kill him.
I know.
Renard said he did.
Where is he now?
I don't know.
He left.
Nick, I really need to see you.
So does Kelly.
But I can't leave the house, not with the children here.
Can you come over?
The guards that were here are gone.
Nick, please, I need you.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Sorry for the mess.
This one's a Hundjaeger, and the other one was actually something
I've never seen before.
Let's get 'em out of here.
All right, you get the arms.
I'll get the legs.
He grabbed her!
Eve!
Eve!
She's not responding.
She's in some kind of trance.
He won't let go.
He's dead.
Try telling him that.
I can't get his hand off her.
I think I know what this is.
It's a death grip.
- You've seen this before?
- Read about it.
Has to do with the fear of dying and getting stuck in the underworld.
They believed that if you took a pure soul with you, you could trade your way into eternal afterlife or something.
Here it is.
First documented by Egyptian Wesen under the reign of Merenre Nemtyemsaf II
- in the sixth dynasty.
- My God.
Does it say anything about how to stop it?
Yes, actually, it does.
I don't think we have time for a complicated spell.
Not that complicated.
Hurry up.
I think we're losing her.
Give me some room.
Eve?
Yeah.
- Where the hell were you?
- I'm not sure.
I don't think you should be handling dead guys right now.
Thanks.
The death grip supposedly trades a pure soul for freedom from hell.
Pure soul?
I don't think so.
Yeah, that doesn't really make so much sense.
I mean, after everything she did?
No offense.
Maybe this has something to do with the stick.
Maybe your soul is not as dark as it used to be.
You know, like she got her soul cleaned.
I guess we could all use a little of that.
I just wish I knew what the hell we were dealing with, 'cause this piece of wood is scaring the crap out of me.
Aah!
Aah!
Crap.
Those are the guys I killed.
Don't worry.
They'll never connect this to you.
There are no surveillance cameras.
I saw you do it, and if I didn't know it was you,
I wouldn't know it was you.
Hey.
I'm glad to see you guys.
I was worried you might be involved in this.
What?
In this?
Are you kidding us?
I don't know who's involved with what anymore.
All hell's breaking loose around here.
We just got word that North Precinct is basically wiped out.
It's FBI now, and Captain's on the warpath, blaming Burkhardt for everything.
I don't know what's going on between him and the captain, but it's getting bad.
- Why would Nick do any of this?
- What are you talking about?
Captain thinks Burkhardt killed these two cops
- when he was busted out.
- What?
Yeah, and now Burkhardt's on the run.
We just put out an APB on him with a shoot-to-kill order.
This is going south fast.
- Where's Captain?
- He's in his office.
Listen, has Nick contacted you?
No.
Well, I'm thinking he should be turning himself in... or getting the hell out of the country, because I don't want anything to do with taking down one of our own.
What's he doing?
Looks like he's cleaning out his office.
If Renard's looking for a legitimate way to kill Nick, you can bet we're on his list.
Well, Renard's on my list.
We need to warn Nick.
Yes.
Are you with Bonaparte?
No.
Where is he?
He's dead.
When?
Tonight.
How did he die?
The Grimm killed him.
We were told the Grimm was dead.
He should have been.
Something's protecting him.
I don't know what.
You find out and deal with it.
We have suffered a major setback in Portland.
It's imperative that you take control of the city.
I will.
Don't worry.
I'll have the Grimm in 24 hours.
Captain.
Search warrants just came in.
Anything else?
Just get ready to go.
Thank God you're alive.
This has been awful.
Did Renard do this no
- I give to your neck?
Berkeley, not you...
No, Bonaparte.
Nick, I'm the one who told him where you live.
He would have killed me and our son.
I know.
I know.
You didn't have a choice.
Where's Kelly?
In my room.
Hey.
Hey!
Has he been okay?
Yeah, but I know he misses you.
Hey, bud.
What is that?
An engagement ring for me and Renard.
Bonaparte put it there...
And not normally.
He said if I ever took it off, it would cause great pain to my children.
I hate it, but I'm afraid to take it off without knowing how to break the spell.
Even if he's dead, it could still survive.
We'll find a way to break it.
I need to be with you.
And what about Diana?
- She's with you now.
- I don't know.
I know she wants me and her father to be together, but I'm afraid of what she might do.
You don't know how powerful she is.
But I hate him.
I hate all of this.
I got to get out of here.
You can't leave yet, not until I deal with Renard.
I don't know how much longer I can do this.
It's Hank.
Yeah, what have you got?
Renard wants you dead.
We just got back to the precinct.
He's got an APB out on you with a shoot-to-kill order.
He's blaming what happened at North Precinct on you, among other things.
He wants to take you down with the legitimacy of the city behind him.
You need to find a place to lay low till we can figure this out.
Yeah, I'll call you when I get there.
I think we should stop using our cell phones.
Yeah.
I'll warn the others.
Good luck.
You too.
If he hurts you,
I will kill him.
You can't take any chances.
But if I don't come back, feel free.
Where are you gonna go?
No, no, no, no.
Don't tell me.
Nick?
He's not here.
Maybe they're still in the tunnel dumping bodies.
We're losing her, Nick.
I hope that thing does what we think it does.
Yeah, me too.
How much do you know about the stick that he used to heal me with?
Not much more than he told you.
Does he always carry it?
No, he got it out to help you.
Got it out from where?
Where he keeps it hidden with the cloth wrapped around it.
Kind of forgot I had it.
Nick left it on the bed when he got out the stick to heal you.
It's really old.
Ancient writing on it.
Can't really see most of it.
- Yeah.
- Trubel, where are you?
We're in the loft.
Nick's not here.
I know.
Is Eve with you?
I'm here.
What about Monroe and Rosalee?
They were headed home.
Monroe and Rosalee are home.
Listen, there's not much time.
Renard's got a APB out on Nick.
He's got every cop in the city looking for him.
He wants Nick dead.
Now, they'll be hitting Nick's loft, so get out of there.
Got it.
Hank was right.
Here they come.
- How are you feeling?
- Tired.
Me too.
But I'm happy.
Despite everything that's going on, the thought of being a dad and you being a mom and...
And us being a family.
I know.
- Although...
- What?
I've just been thinking.
Maybe Portland isn't, like, the safest place to raise a family right now, you know?
I mean, with Renard as mayor, who knows what's gonna become of this city?
Let's not think about that stuff anymore tonight.
Let's just try to get some sleep.
- Okay.
- I love you.
I love you too.
It's the precinct.
What now?
Hey, are you with Rosalee?
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.
She should hear this too.
- Okay.
- What's wrong?
Renard put out an APB shoot-to-kill on Nick.
- What?
- He's got search warrants.
They will be hitting your shop and your house.
Do not try to stop them.
- Where's Nick?
- We don't know.
And it's better that we don't.
This is the police!
- My God, they're here.
- You stay here.
I'm not staying here.
If they're gonna shoot one of us, it's going to be in front of the other.
We have a warrant!
Nope, that didn't come out right.
All right, all right.
- Open the door, now!
- Just a second.
We have a warrant for the arrest of Nicholas Burkhardt and a warrant for the search of the premises.
Okay, he's not here, man, and my wife is pregnant, so take your hands...
Do not attempt to interfere.
No Burkhardt.
Clear!
I think they're leaving.
There are patterns on this cloth.
Here?
I don't see 'em.
You don't?
They're right here and here and here.
I can't see what you're seeing.
I've seen them before.
Where?
No sign of Burkhardt yet.
All these locations have been checked and cleared.
A surveillance team has been left at each location.
- What about his vehicle?
- Hasn't been located.
- What about his phone?
- It's no longer operational.
He probably took the SIM card out.
He's somewhere in the city.
Well, by now, he knows it's a full-on manhunt.
And he's not stupid.
He knows how this works.
So he might not even be in the city anymore.
I don't care where he is.
I don't care what it takes.
I want him found!
You chose the wrong side, Sean.
We located Burkhardt's car.
- Where?
- Laurelhurst.
Seal off the area.
Search every house, block by block.
- One-mile perimeter.
- Sir, that's not...
Just do it!
My God!
Hey, take anything you want.
Bud!
- It's me.
- Nick?
Thank God.
You scared the living...
- I need your help.
- Well, yeah.
Of course.
Anything you need.
I'm guessing it's not your refrigerator.
No, but I'm on the run, and I need a place to hide.
That's why you're here.
Yeah, okay, okay.
What do you need me to do?
Do you have a cell phone?
Yeah, yeah.
Right here, right here.
Okay, I need you to make some calls.
Yeah.
What...
This is serious, isn't it?
Renard wants me dead.
They haven't found him.
- Good.
- But they found his car.
- Where?
- Laurelhurst.
Nick know anyone there?
Not that I know of.
Griffin.
Hey, Hank.
It's me, Bud.
Yeah, hi.
Look, we're kind of busy, Bud.
Yeah, yeah, I heard.
I kind of got a little problem.
What kind of problem?
I think I had a break-in in my repair shop.
You don't suppose you and Sergeant Wu could come over and check things out?
Because the perp...
That's what you call 'em, right?
Could still be in there.
I mean, what if he was a wanted man?
Yeah, yeah, that could be dangerous.
We're on our way.
You might want to change your clothes.
They're here, but...
But they took a cab.
Why would they take a cab?
Hey.
You took a cab so you wouldn't be followed, right?
Two cabs, one train, and a little walking.
Not in that order.
- Where is he?
- This way.
They put a tail on you?
- They did.
- We lost it.
We were followed too, but I'm pretty sure we lost them in a bar downtown.
Yeah, they were watching the loft when we left.
You left your car in Laurelhurst.
Last night.
They are searching the hell out of that area.
Well, that should keep 'em busy for a while.
- We contacted HW.
- Is anyone still alive?
Not here in Portland.
But Black Claw was badly compromised here too.
Renard is on his own.
Yeah, make it easier for us to kill him.
Not really.
He's got cops with him day and night.
So what do we do about Nick?
I think he has to leave Portland.
Renard won't stop until you're dead.
Then maybe that's what you have to do.
If I leave Portland, Renard will control everything.
Nick, we can't afford to lose you.
Look, we need to think of someplace safe, and obviously it's not here.
So I hate to say this, Nick, but maybe they're right.
Maybe you got to go.
You should go back to the precinct.
Get back to work like everything's normal.
I don't want you getting drawn into this any more than you already have.
I don't like it, but okay.
We're still searching the Laurelhurst area, but so far, we got nothing.
We've already checked several blocks away from the parked car.
He dumped it there for us to find.
- Captain?
- Yeah.
We've run every incoming and outgoing phone call on Burkhardt's cell phone.
Besides the ones we've already checked, there's only one other number that has any kind of frequency.
What is it?
Probably doesn't mean anything.
We checked it out.
It's a refrigerator repair company owned by a...
- Bud Wurstner.
- Yeah, that's him.
Check his house.
Check his repair shop.
I want teams at both places.
Now!
We're moving teams from here to here.
What do you want us to do when they're in place?
in's.
I don't like the look of that.
How do we stop that son of a bitch?
There's always a bullet.
I'm sort of half joking.
I'm sort of half laughing.
Something's going on.
That something's coming at us.
I know you know where Burkhardt is.
I will find him, and if either one of you gets in my way,
I'm coming for you next.
And we won't be hard to find.
If he finds Nick...
They're not gonna be bringing him in.
Renard wants uniforms to do his killing for him.
Griffin.
Where?
Yeah, white female body.
Yeah.
I got it.
Got a body ID'd as Rachel Wood.
Rachel Wood?
Yeah, I think you should come with me on this one.
We need to be watching our backs for the time being.
I mean, we could take you in our car, but if they're watching us, they're watching our car.
Why don't you just steal one?
'Cause there's a risk in that too.
- What about Bud?
- Wait, what?
What... what... what about me?
Your truck.
You're off the grid.
For now.
Any chance we can see what vehicles the police are tracking?
Whatever car they put a BOLO on should be in the system.
Can you get into the system?
If I access it, they'll know.
Wu could help, but somebody else is gonna have to make that call.
I'll call Wu.
Nobody can track my phone.
Do you know what these mean?
No.
When I was with Monroe and Rosalee,
I touched one of the Black Claw bodies.
Yeah, right.
That was fun.
First time I've ever seen a death grip from a dead guy.
I saw these symbols on his face when I was there... and also on the cloth.
Maybe there was more on that cloth than we could see.
Do you still have the stick with you?
Yes.
I'm not sure you should be carrying it all the time.
Miss Wood's coworker grew concerned when he couldn't reach her.
He came over and discovered this.
All right.
Bring in CSU.
Get this whole place fingerprinted.
She was Renard's campaign PR person.
Yeah.
When you're murdered in bed, it's usually by someone you know.
274, go ahead.
This is Unit 274, near the corner of Marks and Milwaukee.
Just completed a drive-by.
There's one truck parked in front.
Belongs to the company.
No sign of the suspect.
No activity at the exterior of the premises.
We're gonna have to send somebody in.
This is not good.
There are bolos out on Monroe and Rosalee's cars, your car and mine...
And Bud's.
Bud's on the list?
Yup, and the BOLO just came back on his truck.
It's at his shop.
Son of a bitch.
We need to get Nick out of there now.
Call Trubel.
On it.
Jeez!
Jeez.
S-s-somebody's here.
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I...
Just calm down.
Probably just a customer.
Why don't you go find out what they want?
Right, right.
Business as usual.
Okay.
Wu.
Okay.
Yeah, I'll put you on speaker.
They know about Bud.
They put a BOLO out on his truck.
- It's in front of his shop.
- They're watching it, Nick.
You got to get out of there now.
- Got it, thanks.
- Check in with you when we can.
I'm gonna find out if Tactical's making a move.
- Check with Franco.
- Yup.
Well, looks clear.
- I hate that.
- What?
You know, people coming in here with a problem, asking me how much it's gonna cost to repair the refrigerator, and they don't even know what kind of refrigerator they got.
Bud, I don't think that was a customer.
That was a cop.
- God.
- They're watching the shop.
Nick, you got to get out of here, now.
We need a diversion.
If they think I'm in here, they're gonna send in a SERT team.
Bud.
Back your truck into the loading bay.
Help him load in a freezer.
- Why?
- So they think you're in it.
- Bud.
- Wh-what?
You're the diversion.
Right, right, right.
They follow me.
Hey, you could fit in that one if you were gonna fit in one.
I haven't fixed it yet, but...
But I guess that doesn't matter right now.
- I don't see anybody.
- You won't.
Franco.
Hey, it's Wu.
Where are you?
Captain ordered me not to talk to you guys.
Captain's out of control.
Seems like, but he's still got rank.
I got to ask you something.
Drew, you're putting me in a tough spot here.
Okay, then you don't need to.
I'm gonna give you an address.
If that's where you are, don't say anything.
4046 Marks.
Thanks.
SERT team's been ordered to Bud's shop.
Franco's there.
It's going down.
What the hell are we gonna do?
Wish I knew.
We ran the fingerprints from the Rachel Wood apartment.
This is where it gets a little awkward.
Well, that's why I brought it up personally.
What kind of awkward are we talking about?
Captain Renard's fingerprints are all over that place.
I know she was working on his campaign, but I think she was working on something else.
All right.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Suspect's vehicle just pulled into the loading bay.
They loaded in a freezer big enough to hold a man.
They're getting ready to go.
Get in position.
Nick!
Nick!
We're too late.
They're surrounding the place.
We're all gonna die!
All clear.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Isn't there something you can do?
I can try.
Eve!
I'm so sorry.
We're in position, sir.
Take them down.
Previously on "Grimm"...
Doesn't have to end here.
You chose the wrong side, Sean.
That's enough.
- Arrest him.
- Aah!
- Where's Eve?
- She went after Bonaparte.
We used the stick to heal her.
And then she woged and had some kind of seizure.
Tell me where he lives.
- Everybody into the tunnel.
- Nick, come on.
Let's go.
No!
I'm gonna stay here with Eve, make sure nobody follows us.
We'll see if there's an exit further down this way.
It's over.
How the hell?
Oh, come on!
We're gonna have to go back and find another way.
I'm pregnant.
I should have killed you when I had the chance.
I won't make that mistake again, huh?
_
I guess I should thank you.
I thought you were on his side.
You killed all of them.
You were shot.
You're not even wounded.
They said you were dead.
- I think I was.
- How does that happen?
I'm not sure.
Why'd you stop him?
I'm not sure either.
Maybe one of the others found a way out.
What... what was that?
We got to go back.
Yeah.
We break out.
We can circle back for Nick.
We shouldn't have left Nick.
He gave us no choice.
This fight's not over.
It is for Nick.
It would have been for us if we had stayed.
I'm not letting Renard get away with this.
Yeah, that son of a bitch is going down.
You hear that?
Sounds like water.
There's an opening.
It must connect to the city's storm drain.
Yeah, there's no way we can get out through there.
Oh, my God, this has to lead somewhere.
There.
This could be the way out.
Looks like there's some kind of door up here.
Oh, my God.
We can get out this way.
We got to go back and tell the others.
What?
I don't want to tell anybody about me being pregnant.
Okay, right.
I guess it's not really the time or the place for anything remotely happy.
I mean, why bring it up, right?
We may not even be getting out of here.
Hey.
We are getting out of here.
I don't need you to cheer me up right now.
We have no idea how many people attacked Nick or even if he's still alive or if they haven't found these tunnels and they're coming down here right now to kill us.
I mean, I think I actually need you to cheer me up right now.
Shh.
Listen to me.
If they come down here after us, it is gonna be their mistake.
Okay?
Come on.
Let's go.
What are we supposed to do now?
- We keep fighting.
- Meisner's dead.
Nick might be too.
We can't do this alone.
We regroup.
We rebuild.
Not in Portland.
I'm tired of waiting.
I'm going back for Nick.
You stay here.
You wait for the others.
I owe him.
- Now who's talking?
- I am.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Something's in the way.
- You're feeling stuff.
- No, I won't go back.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Did you guys find a way out?
Yeah, we can all get out, but it's back that way.
I'm going back for Nick.
Us too.
Hey, guys, we found a way out.
Nick didn't.
There's somebody coming.
All right, turn off the lights.
Now.
- Nick!
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.
- You're alive.
- How many are behind you?
- None.
What?
We saw tons of them.
Yeah, they're all dead.
- All of 'em?
- Including Bonaparte.
- You killed Bonaparte?
- No.
Renard did.
Renard?
Um... kind of looks like you were shot.
Like, more than once.
You're not a ghost, are you?
I hope not.
Daddy's gonna be all right.
It's okay.
Daddy's gonna be all right.
Daddy's gonna be all right.
Yeah.
It's okay.
Is Nick dead?
No.
What did you do to him?
- Not much.
- Is he okay?
- He's alive.
- Well, then how are you here?
What are you doing still alive?
Thanks for your concern.
You and Bonaparte went to kill Nick.
Why should I be concerned about you?
- Bonaparte is dead.
- What?
- Yeah, you must be relieved.
- Nick killed him?
No, he had nothing to do with it.
Then who did?
- I'm not entirely sure.
- You were there.
How did you not see who killed him?
- I saw it.
- You're not making any sense.
Because none of this makes any sense.
- Who killed him?
- I killed him.
I think.
Maybe.
I'm not sure.
- How can you not be sure - about something like that?
I stabbed him.
I stabbed him, but I didn't realize what I'd done until I saw that...
That bloody sword in my hand.
But you already know about that, don't you?
I had nothing to do with this.
Do you think I would risk that knowing what he can do to my children?
Has Diana been asleep all night?
You're gonna blame Diana for this too?
Well, somebody made me kill Bonaparte, just like somebody killed Rachel.
Who else has that kind of power?
She won't take Daddy away anymore.
Diana saw the bruises on my neck, and she asked me if you had done it.
And what did you tell her?
I said no, one of your friends did it and that she shouldn't worry about it.
What are you gonna do?
I'm not gonna let Diana control our lives.
If Diana made you kill Bonaparte,
I'd go a little easy on the discipline.
Bonaparte brought this on himself.
He would have killed me.
Maybe Diana just wanted her daddy to be a hero and save Mommy.
Well, she got her wish.
We better be careful what she wishes for.
Black Claw's gonna find out about Bonaparte, if they haven't already.
And they're gonna go after whoever did it.
I assume you're not gonna confess?
No.
Somebody is.
Who?
You should have never fallen in love with Burkhardt.
Now you're gonna regret it.
Hello.
Wake up.
Who is this?
Sean Renard.
I'm coming over.
At this hour?
I'll be outside your house in five minutes.
Mommy?
I'm sorry to wake you, sweetie.
That's okay.
Is something wrong?
Were you playing with your dolls again tonight?
- Mm-hmm.
I couldn't sleep.
- Why not?
Because of that man who hurt your neck.
He was mean, and I didn't want him to ever hurt you again, Mommy.
- Oh, my God, Nick.
- Dude, there's so many.
They came here to kill all of us.
Killed Bonaparte?
Renard didn't know what he was doing.
He's gonna be trying to figure out a way to explain it.
You healed me.
How?
It's the same way I was saved.
Monroe and I found this in the Black Forest.
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
What is it?
It's connected with those keys.
It's some kind of stick thing the crusaders took when they sacked Constantinople.
They hid it in a chest and then buried it under a church in the Black Forest behind a bunch of skulls that, when you turn the lights down, they kind of glow green and...
Long story.
Basically, we don't know what it is.
All we know is, it has some kind of power to heal.
You were dying.
Nick used it on you.
And it worked.
Then you had some kind of seizure.
And when you came to...
I felt different.
How do you feel now?
Something's changed.
Yeah, a lot's changed.
I'm gonna have to tell HW what's happened.
We should probably figure out how to deal with all these bodies.
I mean, we can't just leave them here, you know?
Not if you ever want to have a dinner party for the living.
Yeah, we have to deal with this.
Well, we can't put them in the elevator and walk them out the front door, so...
The tunnel.
There's a big hole down there, dumps right into the storm drain.
What about the three bodies at the spice shop?
We're gonna have to deal with them, too, while it's still dark.
I'll go with Monroe and Rosalee.
I'm gonna go with them too, seeing as I'm the one that killed them.
Meet up with you later.
So, uh, how do we get these guys down into the tunnel?
The hell do you think you're doing?
I need search warrants.
You woke me up for search warrants?
I need a lot of them.
I don't care if you are the new mayor.
You don't come here in the middle of the night demanding anything.
Bonaparte's dead.
What?
Burkhardt killed him.
The Grimm killed Bonaparte?
And I'm taking him down for it.
How many warrants do you need?
What the hell happened here?
We're not sure, Captain.
All we know is what the jailer told us.
Seven North Precinct cops were sent to transport Burkhardt to the North Precinct, and somehow, between the time he was taken out of his cell to before he got out of the building, these two got into it with somebody... or something.
There were no witnesses.
The rest of us were out on a bunch of bogus 911 calls.
And, you know, Captain, I think it's a little too coincidental that we got those calls just when they were coming to get Burkhardt.
He broke out before they could get him to the North Precinct.
What?
My guess is, Burkhardt had some help.
Nick?
I want him found, and I want him arrested.
Put out an APB.
Consider him armed and dangerous.
Sir, Nick wouldn't do this.
If he resists, shoot to kill.
Yes, sir.
You probably shouldn't stay here now.
Too many of the wrong people know where you live.
You stay out of sight till we find out what's going on.
You guys head back to the precinct.
See what you can find.
We'll call you when we know something.
Watch your backs.
Oh, this was on your desk at the precinct.
Adalind.
I'm so happy to hear your voice.
Are you all right?
Yeah, are you?
Renard was here.
He told me what happened.
He said Bonaparte's dead.
Is that true?
Yeah, but I didn't kill him.
I know.
Renard said he did.
Where is he now?
I don't know.
He left.
Nick, I really need to see you.
So does Kelly.
But I can't leave the house, not with the children here.
Can you come over?
The guards that were here are gone.
Nick, please, I need you.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Sorry for the mess.
This one's a Hundjaeger, and the other one was actually something
I've never seen before.
Let's get 'em out of here.
All right, you get the arms.
I'll get the legs.
He grabbed her!
Eve!
Eve!
She's not responding.
She's in some kind of trance.
He won't let go.
He's dead.
Try telling him that.
I can't get his hand off her.
I think I know what this is.
It's a death grip.
- You've seen this before?
- Read about it.
Has to do with the fear of dying and getting stuck in the underworld.
They believed that if you took a pure soul with you, you could trade your way into eternal afterlife or something.
Ah, here it is.
First documented by Egyptian Wesen under the reign of Merenre Nemtyemsaf II
- in the sixth dynasty.
- Oh, my God.
Does it say anything about how to stop it?
Yes, actually, it does.
I don't think we have time for a complicated spell.
Not that complicated.
Hurry up.
I think we're losing her.
Give me some room.
Oh!
Eve?
Yeah.
- Where the hell were you?
- I'm not sure.
I don't think you should be handling dead guys right now.
Thanks.
The death grip supposedly trades a pure soul for freedom from hell.
Pure soul?
I don't think so.
Yeah, that doesn't really make so much sense.
I mean, after everything she did?
No offense.
Maybe this has something to do with the stick.
Maybe your soul is not as dark as it used to be.
You know, like she got her soul cleaned.
I guess we could all use a little of that.
I just wish I knew what the hell we were dealing with, 'cause this piece of wood is scaring the crap out of me.
Aah!
Aah!
Oh, crap.
Those are the guys I killed.
Don't worry.
They'll never connect this to you.
There are no surveillance cameras.
I saw you do it, and if I didn't know it was you,
I wouldn't know it was you.
Hey.
I'm glad to see you guys.
I was worried you might be involved in this.
What?
In this?
Are you kidding us?
I don't know who's involved with what anymore.
All hell's breaking loose around here.
We just got word that North Precinct is basically wiped out.
It's FBI now, and Captain's on the warpath, blaming Burkhardt for everything.
I don't know what's going on between him and the captain, but it's getting bad.
- Why would Nick do any of this?
- What are you talking about?
Captain thinks Burkhardt killed these two cops
- when he was busted out.
- What?
Yeah, and now Burkhardt's on the run.
We just put out an APB on him with a shoot-to-kill order.
This is going south fast.
- Where's Captain?
- He's in his office.
Listen, has Nick contacted you?
No.
Well, I'm thinking he should be turning himself in... or getting the hell out of the country, because I don't want anything to do with taking down one of our own.
What's he doing?
Looks like he's cleaning out his office.
If Renard's looking for a legitimate way to kill Nick, you can bet we're on his list.
Well, Renard's on my list.
We need to warn Nick.
Yes.
Are you with Bonaparte?
No.
Where is he?
He's dead.
When?
Tonight.
How did he die?
The Grimm killed him.
We were told the Grimm was dead.
He should have been.
Something's protecting him.
I don't know what.
You find out and deal with it.
We have suffered a major setback in Portland.
It's imperative that you take control of the city.
I will.
Don't worry.
I'll have the Grimm in 24 hours.
Captain.
Search warrants just came in.
Anything else?
Just get ready to go.
Thank God you're alive.
This has been awful.
Did Renard do this no
- I give to your neck?
Berkeley, not you"
No, Bonaparte.
Nick, I'm the one who told him where you live.
He would have killed me and our son.
I know.
I know.
You didn't have a choice.
Where's Kelly?
In my room.
Hey.
Hey!
Has he been okay?
Yeah, but I know he misses you.
Hey, bud.
What is that?
An engagement ring for me and Renard.
Bonaparte put it there...
And not normally.
He said if I ever took it off, it would cause great pain to my children.
I hate it, but I'm afraid to take it off without knowing how to break the spell.
Even if he's dead, it could still survive.
We'll find a way to break it.
I need to be with you.
And what about Diana?
- She's with you now.
- I don't know.
I know she wants me and her father to be together, but I'm afraid of what she might do.
You don't know how powerful she is.
But I hate him.
I hate all of this.
I got to get out of here.
You can't leave yet, not until I deal with Renard.
I don't know how much longer I can do this.
It's Hank.
Yeah, what have you got?
Renard wants you dead.
We just got back to the precinct.
He's got an APB out on you with a shoot-to-kill order.
He's blaming what happened at North Precinct on you, among other things.
He wants to take you down with the legitimacy of the city behind him.
You need to find a place to lay low till we can figure this out.
Yeah, I'll call you when I get there.
I think we should stop using our cell phones.
Yeah.
I'll warn the others.
Good luck.
You too.
If he hurts you,
I will kill him.
You can't take any chances.
But if I don't come back, feel free.
Where are you gonna go?
No, no, no, no.
Don't tell me.
Nick?
He's not here.
Maybe they're still in the tunnel dumping bodies.
We're losing her, Nick.
I hope that thing does what we think it does.
Yeah, me too.
How much do you know about the stick that he used to heal me with?
Not much more than he told you.
Does he always carry it?
No, he got it out to help you.
Got it out from where?
Where he keeps it hidden with the cloth wrapped around it.
Kind of forgot I had it.
Nick left it on the bed when he got out the stick to heal you.
It's really old.
Ancient writing on it.
Can't really see most of it.
- Yeah.
- Trubel, where are you?
We're in the loft.
Nick's not here.
I know.
Is Eve with you?
I'm here.
What about Monroe and Rosalee?
They were headed home.
Monroe and Rosalee are home.
Listen, there's not much time.
Renard's got a APB out on Nick.
He's got every cop in the city looking for him.
He wants Nick dead.
Now, they'll be hitting Nick's loft, so get out of there.
Got it.
Hank was right.
Here they come.
- How are you feeling?
- Tired.
Me too.
But I'm happy.
Despite everything that's going on, the thought of being a dad and you being a mom and...
And us being a family.
I know.
- Although...
- What?
I've just been thinking.
Maybe Portland isn't, like, the safest place to raise a family right now, you know?
I mean, with Renard as mayor, who knows what's gonna become of this city?
Let's not think about that stuff anymore tonight.
Let's just try to get some sleep.
- Okay.
- I love you.
I love you too.
It's the precinct.
What now?
Hey, are you with Rosalee?
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.
She should hear this too.
- Okay.
- What's wrong?
Renard put out an APB shoot-to-kill on Nick.
- What?
- He's got search warrants.
They will be hitting your shop and your house.
Do not try to stop them.
- Where's Nick?
- We don't know.
And it's better that we don't.
This is the police!
- Oh, my God, they're here.
- You stay here.
I'm not staying here.
If they're gonna shoot one of us, it's going to be in front of the other.
We have a warrant!
Nope, that didn't come out right.
All right, all right.
- Open the door, now!
- Just a second.
We have a warrant for the arrest of Nicholas Burkhardt and a warrant for the search of the premises.
Okay, he's not here, man, and my wife is pregnant, so take your hands...
Do not attempt to interfere.
No Burkhardt.
Clear!
I think they're leaving.
There are patterns on this cloth.
Here?
I don't see 'em.
You don't?
They're right here and here and here.
I can't see what you're seeing.
I've seen them before.
Where?
No sign of Burkhardt yet.
All these locations have been checked and cleared.
A surveillance team has been left at each location.
- What about his vehicle?
- Hasn't been located.
- What about his phone?
- It's no longer operational.
He probably took the SIM card out.
He's somewhere in the city.
Well, by now, he knows it's a full-on manhunt.
And he's not stupid.
He knows how this works.
So he might not even be in the city anymore.
I don't care where he is.
I don't care what it takes.
I want him found!
You chose the wrong side, Sean.
We located Burkhardt's car.
- Where?
- Laurelhurst.
Seal off the area.
Search every house, block by block.
- One-mile perimeter.
- Sir, that's not...
Just do it!
Oh, my God!
Hey, take anything you want.
- Bud!
- Huh?
- It's me.
- Nick?
Oh, thank God.
You scared the living...
- I need your help.
- Well, yeah.
Of course.
Anything you need.
I'm guessing it's not your refrigerator.
No, but I'm on the run, and I need a place to hide.
Oh, that's why you're here.
Oh.
Yeah, okay, okay.
What do you need me to do?
Do you have a cell phone?
Yeah, yeah.
Right here, right here.
Okay, I need you to make some calls.
Yeah.
What...
This is serious, isn't it?
Renard wants me dead.
They haven't found him.
- Good.
- But they found his car.
- Where?
- Laurelhurst.
Nick know anyone there?
Not that I know of.
Griffin.
Hey, Hank.
It's me, Bud.
Yeah, hi.
Look, we're kind of busy, Bud.
Yeah, yeah, I heard.
I kind of got a little problem.
What kind of problem?
I think I had a break-in in my repair shop.
You don't suppose you and Sergeant Wu could come over and check things out?
Because the perp...
That's what you call 'em, right?
- Uh-huh.
- Could still be in there.
I mean, what if he was a wanted man?
Yeah, yeah, that could be dangerous.
We're on our way.
You might want to change your clothes.
They're here, but...
But they took a cab.
Why would they take a cab?
Hey.
You took a cab so you wouldn't be followed, right?
Two cabs, one train, and a little walking.
Not in that order.
- Where is he?
- This way.
They put a tail on you?
- They did.
- We lost it.
We were followed too, but I'm pretty sure we lost them in a bar downtown.
Yeah, they were watching the loft when we left.
You left your car in Laurelhurst.
Last night.
They are searching the hell out of that area.
Well, that should keep 'em busy for a while.
- We contacted HW.
- Is anyone still alive?
Not here in Portland.
But Black Claw was badly compromised here too.
Renard is on his own.
Yeah, make it easier for us to kill him.
Not really.
He's got cops with him day and night.
So what do we do about Nick?
I think he has to leave Portland.
Renard won't stop until you're dead.
Then maybe that's what you have to do.
If I leave Portland, Renard will control everything.
Nick, we can't afford to lose you.
Look, we need to think of someplace safe, and obviously it's not here.
So I hate to say this, Nick, but maybe they're right.
Maybe you got to go.
You should go back to the precinct.
Get back to work like everything's normal.
I don't want you getting drawn into this any more than you already have.
I don't like it, but okay.
We're still searching the Laurelhurst area, but so far, we got nothing.
We've already checked several blocks away from the parked car.
He dumped it there for us to find.
- Captain?
- Yeah.
We've run every incoming and outgoing phone call on Burkhardt's cell phone.
Besides the ones we've already checked, there's only one other number that has any kind of frequency.
What is it?
Probably doesn't mean anything.
We checked it out.
It's a refrigerator repair company owned by a...
- Bud Wurstner.
- Yeah, that's him.
Check his house.
Check his repair shop.
I want teams at both places.
Now!
We're moving teams from here to here.
What do you want us to do when they're in place?
in's.
I don't like the look of that.
How do we stop that son of a bitch?
There's always a bullet.
I'm sort of half joking.
I'm sort of half laughing.
Something's going on.
That something's coming at us.
I know you know where Burkhardt is.
I will find him, and if either one of you gets in my way,
I'm coming for you next.
And we won't be hard to find.
If he finds Nick...
They're not gonna be bringing him in.
Renard wants uniforms to do his killing for him.
Griffin.
Where?
Yeah, white female body.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I got it.
Got a body ID'd as Rachel Wood.
Rachel Wood?
Yeah, I think you should come with me on this one.
We need to be watching our backs for the time being.
I mean, we could take you in our car, but if they're watching us, they're watching our car.
Why don't you just steal one?
'Cause there's a risk in that too.
- What about Bud?
- Wait, what?
What... what... what about me?
Your truck.
You're off the grid.
Mm, for now.
Any chance we can see what vehicles the police are tracking?
Whatever car they put a BOLO on should be in the system.
Can you get into the system?
If I access it, they'll know.
Wu could help, but somebody else is gonna have to make that call.
I'll call Wu.
Nobody can track my phone.
Do you know what these mean?
No.
When I was with Monroe and Rosalee,
I touched one of the Black Claw bodies.
Oh, yeah, right.
That was fun.
First time I've ever seen a death grip from a dead guy.
I saw these symbols on his face when I was there... and also on the cloth.
Maybe there was more on that cloth than we could see.
Do you still have the stick with you?
Yes.
I'm not sure you should be carrying it all the time.
Miss Wood's coworker grew concerned when he couldn't reach her.
He came over and discovered this.
All right.
Bring in CSU.
Get this whole place fingerprinted.
She was Renard's campaign PR person.
Yeah.
When you're murdered in bed, it's usually by someone you know.
274, go ahead.
This is Unit 274, near the corner of Marks and Milwaukee.
Just completed a drive-by.
There's one truck parked in front.
Belongs to the company.
No sign of the suspect.
No activity at the exterior of the premises.
We're gonna have to send somebody in.
This is not good.
There are bolos out on Monroe and Rosalee's cars, your car and mine...
And Bud's.
Bud's on the list?
Yup, and the BOLO just came back on his truck.
It's at his shop.
Son of a bitch.
We need to get Nick out of there now.
Call Trubel.
On it.
Oh, jeez!
Oh, jeez.
S-s-somebody's here.
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I...
Just calm down.
Probably just a customer.
Why don't you go find out what they want?
Right, right.
Business as usual.
Okay.
Wu.
Okay.
Yeah, I'll put you on speaker.
They know about Bud.
They put a BOLO out on his truck.
- It's in front of his shop.
- They're watching it, Nick.
You got to get out of there now.
- Got it, thanks.
- Check in with you when we can.
I'm gonna find out if Tactical's making a move.
- Check with Franco.
- Yup.
Well, looks clear.
- Oh, I hate that.
- What?
Oh, you know, people coming in here with a problem, asking me how much it's gonna cost to repair the refrigerator, and they don't even know what kind of refrigerator they got.
Bud, I don't think that was a customer.
That was a cop.
- Oh, God.
- They're watching the shop.
Nick, you got to get out of here, now.
We need a diversion.
If they think I'm in here, they're gonna send in a SERT team.
- Bud.
- Huh?
Back your truck into the loading bay.
Help him load in a freezer.
- Why?
- So they think you're in it.
- Bud.
- Wh-what?
You're the diversion.
Right, right, right.
They follow me.
Hey, you could fit in that one if you were gonna fit in one.
I haven't fixed it yet, but...
But I guess that doesn't matter right now.
- I don't see anybody.
- You won't.
Franco.
Hey, it's Wu.
Where are you?
Captain ordered me not to talk to you guys.
Captain's out of control.
Seems like, but he's still got rank.
I got to ask you something.
Drew, you're putting me in a tough spot here.
Okay, then you don't need to.
I'm gonna give you an address.
If that's where you are, don't say anything.
4046 Marks.
Thanks.
SERT team's been ordered to Bud's shop.
Franco's there.
It's going down.
What the hell are we gonna do?
Wish I knew.
We ran the fingerprints from the Rachel Wood apartment.
This is where it gets a little awkward.
Well, that's why I brought it up personally.
What kind of awkward are we talking about?
Captain Renard's fingerprints are all over that place.
I know she was working on his campaign, but I think she was working on something else.
All right.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Suspect's vehicle just pulled into the loading bay.
They loaded in a freezer big enough to hold a man.
They're getting ready to go.
Get in position.
Nick!
Nick!
We're too late.
They're surrounding the place.
We're all gonna die!
All clear.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Isn't there something you can do?
I can try.
- Eve!
- Oh!
I'm so sorry.
We're in position, sir.
Take them down.
Previously on "Grimm"...
Doesn't have to end here.
You chose the wrong side, Sean.
- (CHOKING AND GASPING)
- That's enough.
(GUNSHOT)
(MEN GRUNTING)
- Arrest him.
- Aah!
- Where's Eve?
- She went after Bonaparte.
We used the stick to heal her.
And then she woged and had some kind of seizure.
(CHOKING)
Tell me where he lives.
- Everybody into the tunnel.
- Nick, come on.
Let's go.
No!
I'm gonna stay here with Eve, make sure nobody follows us.
We'll see if there's an exit further down this way.
It's over.
How the hell?
(YELLS)
Oh, come on!
We're gonna have to go back and find another way.
I'm pregnant.
I should have killed you when I had the chance.
I won't make that mistake again, huh?
(INTENSE MUSIC)
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)
_
I guess I should thank you.
I thought you were on his side.
You killed all of them.
You were shot.
You're not even wounded.
They said you were dead.
- I think I was.
- How does that happen?
I'm not sure.
Why'd you stop him?
I'm not sure either.
(SIGHS) Maybe one of the others found a way out.
(METALLIC CLATTER)
What... what was that?
We got to go back.
Yeah.
We break out.
We can circle back for Nick.
We shouldn't have left Nick.
He gave us no choice.
This fight's not over.
It is for Nick.
It would have been for us if we had stayed.
I'm not letting Renard get away with this.
Yeah, that son of a bitch is going down.
You hear that?
(WATER RUSHING FAINTLY)
Sounds like water.
There's an opening.
It must connect to the city's storm drain.
Yeah, there's no way we can get out through there.
(BOTH SIGH)
Oh, my God, this has to lead somewhere.
There.
This could be the way out.
(SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC)
Looks like there's some kind of door up here.
(BANGING)
Oh, my God.
We can get out this way.
We got to go back and tell the others.
What?
I don't want to tell anybody about me being pregnant.
Okay, right.
I guess it's not really the time or the place for anything remotely happy.
I mean, why bring it up, right?
We may not even be getting out of here.
Hey.
We are getting out of here.
I don't need you to cheer me up right now.
We have no idea how many people attacked Nick or even if he's still alive or if they haven't found these tunnels and they're coming down here right now to kill us.
I mean, I think I actually need you to cheer me up right now.
Shh.
Listen to me.
If they come down here after us, it is gonna be their mistake.
Okay?
(CHUCKLES)
Come on.
Let's go.
What are we supposed to do now?
- We keep fighting.
- Meisner's dead.
Nick might be too.
We can't do this alone.
We regroup.
We rebuild.
Not in Portland.
(SIGHS)
I'm tired of waiting.
I'm going back for Nick.
You stay here.
You wait for the others.
I owe him.
- Now who's talking?
- I am.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Something's in the way.
- You're feeling stuff.
- No, I won't go back.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Did you guys find a way out?
Yeah, we can all get out, but it's back that way.
I'm going back for Nick.
Us too.
Hey, guys, we found a way out.
Nick didn't.
(INTENSE MUSIC)
(FOOTSTEPS TAPPING)
There's somebody coming.
All right, turn off the lights.
Now.
- Nick!
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.
- You're alive.
- How many are behind you?
- None.
What?
We saw tons of them.
Yeah, they're all dead.
- All of 'em?
- Including Bonaparte.
- You killed Bonaparte?
- No.
Renard did.
Renard?
Um... kind of looks like you were shot.
Like, more than once.
You're not a ghost, are you?
I hope not.
(TENSE MUSIC)
Daddy's gonna be all right.
It's okay.
Daddy's gonna be all right.
- (BABY COOING)
- Daddy's gonna be all right.
Yeah.
It's okay.
(DOOR CLICKS OPEN)
Is Nick dead?
No.
What did you do to him?
- Not much.
- Is he okay?
- He's alive.
- Well, then how are you here?
What are you doing still alive?
Thanks for your concern.
You and Bonaparte went to kill Nick.
Why should I be concerned about you?
- Bonaparte is dead.
- What?
- Yeah, you must be relieved.
- Nick killed him?
No, he had nothing to do with it.
Then who did?
- I'm not entirely sure.
- You were there.
How did you not see who killed him?
- I saw it.
- You're not making any sense.
Because none of this makes any sense.
- Who killed him?
- I killed him.
I think.
Maybe.
I'm not sure.
- How can you not be sure - about something like that?
I stabbed him.
I stabbed him, but I didn't realize what I'd done until I saw that...
That bloody sword in my hand.
But you already know about that, don't you?
I had nothing to do with this.
Do you think I would risk that knowing what he can do to my children?
Has Diana been asleep all night?
You're gonna blame Diana for this too?
Well, somebody made me kill Bonaparte, just like somebody killed Rachel.
Who else has that kind of power?
She won't take Daddy away anymore.
Diana saw the bruises on my neck, and she asked me if you had done it.
And what did you tell her?
I said no, one of your friends did it and that she shouldn't worry about it.
What are you gonna do?
I'm not gonna let Diana control our lives.
If Diana made you kill Bonaparte,
I'd go a little easy on the discipline.
(SIGHS) Bonaparte brought this on himself.
He would have killed me.
Maybe Diana just wanted her daddy to be a hero and save Mommy.
Well, she got her wish.
We better be careful what she wishes for.
Black Claw's gonna find out about Bonaparte, if they haven't already.
And they're gonna go after whoever did it.
I assume you're not gonna confess?
No.
Somebody is.
Who?
You should have never fallen in love with Burkhardt.
Now you're gonna regret it.
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)
Hello.
Wake up.
Who is this?
Sean Renard.
I'm coming over.
At this hour?
I'll be outside your house in five minutes.
(LINE CLICKS AND BEEPS)
(SIGHS)
(SOFT EERIE MUSIC)
Mommy?
I'm sorry to wake you, sweetie.
That's okay.
Is something wrong?
Were you playing with your dolls again tonight?
- Mm-hmm.
I couldn't sleep.
- Why not?
Because of that man who hurt your neck.
He was mean, and I didn't want him to ever hurt you again, Mommy.
- Oh, my God, Nick.
- Dude, there's so many.
They came here to kill all of us.
Killed Bonaparte?
Renard didn't know what he was doing.
He's gonna be trying to figure out a way to explain it.
You healed me.
How?
It's the same way I was saved.
Monroe and I found this in the Black Forest.
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
What is it?
It's connected with those keys.
It's some kind of stick thing the crusaders took when they sacked Constantinople.
They hid it in a chest and then buried it under a church in the Black Forest behind a bunch of skulls that, when you turn the lights down, they kind of glow green and...
Long story.
Basically, we don't know what it is.
All we know is, it has some kind of power to heal.
You were dying.
Nick used it on you.
And it worked.
Then you had some kind of seizure.
And when you came to...
I felt different.
How do you feel now?
Something's changed.
Yeah, a lot's changed.
I'm gonna have to tell HW what's happened.
We should probably figure out how to deal with all these bodies.
I mean, we can't just leave them here, you know?
Not if you ever want to have a dinner party for the living.
Yeah, we have to deal with this.
Well, we can't put them in the elevator and walk them out the front door, so...
The tunnel.
There's a big hole down there, dumps right into the storm drain.
What about the three bodies at the spice shop?
We're gonna have to deal with them, too, while it's still dark.
I'll go with Monroe and Rosalee.
I'm gonna go with them too, seeing as I'm the one that killed them.
Meet up with you later.
So, uh, how do we get these guys down into the tunnel?
(THUD)
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)
The hell do you think you're doing?
I need search warrants.
You woke me up for search warrants?
I need a lot of them.
I don't care if you are the new mayor.
You don't come here in the middle of the night demanding anything.
Bonaparte's dead.
What?
Burkhardt killed him.
The Grimm killed Bonaparte?
And I'm taking him down for it.
How many warrants do you need?
(POLICE RADIO CHATTER)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
What the hell happened here?
We're not sure, Captain.
All we know is what the jailer told us.
Seven North Precinct cops were sent to transport Burkhardt to the North Precinct, and somehow, between the time he was taken out of his cell to before he got out of the building, these two got into it with somebody... or something.
There were no witnesses.
The rest of us were out on a bunch of bogus 911 calls.
And, you know, Captain, I think it's a little too coincidental that we got those calls just when they were coming to get Burkhardt.
He broke out before they could get him to the North Precinct.
What?
My guess is, Burkhardt had some help.
Nick?
I want him found, and I want him arrested.
Put out an APB.
Consider him armed and dangerous.
Sir, Nick wouldn't do this.
If he resists, shoot to kill.
Yes, sir.
(GRUNTING)
You probably shouldn't stay here now.
Too many of the wrong people know where you live.
You stay out of sight till we find out what's going on.
You guys head back to the precinct.
See what you can find.
We'll call you when we know something.
Watch your backs. (CELL PHONE BUZZES)
Oh, this was on your desk at the precinct.
Adalind.
I'm so happy to hear your voice.
Are you all right?
Yeah, are you?
Renard was here.
He told me what happened.
He said Bonaparte's dead.
Is that true?
Yeah, but I didn't kill him.
I know.
Renard said he did.
Where is he now?
I don't know.
He left.
Nick, I really need to see you.
So does Kelly.
But I can't leave the house, not with the children here.
Can you come over?
The guards that were here are gone.
Nick, please, I need you.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Sorry for the mess.
This one's a Hundjaeger, and the other one was actually something
I've never seen before.
Let's get 'em out of here.
All right, you get the arms.
I'll get the legs.
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)
(LIGHTBULB SHATTERS)
He grabbed her!
Eve!
Eve!
She's not responding.
She's in some kind of trance.
He won't let go.
(GLASS SHATTERS)
He's dead.
Try telling him that.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)
(YELLS)
I can't get his hand off her.
I think I know what this is.
It's a death grip.
- You've seen this before?
- Read about it.
Has to do with the fear of dying and getting stuck in the underworld.
They believed that if you took a pure soul with you, you could trade your way into eternal afterlife or something.
(GRUNTING)
Ah, here it is.
First documented by Egyptian Wesen under the reign of Merenre Nemtyemsaf II
- in the sixth dynasty.
- Oh, my God.
Does it say anything about how to stop it?
Yes, actually, it does.
I don't think we have time for a complicated spell.
Not that complicated.
Hurry up.
I think we're losing her.
Give me some room.
Oh!
(GASPING)
Eve?
Yeah.
- Where the hell were you?
- I'm not sure.
I don't think you should be handling dead guys right now.
Thanks.
The death grip supposedly trades a pure soul for freedom from hell.
Pure soul?
I don't think so.
Yeah, that doesn't really make so much sense.
I mean, after everything she did?
No offense.
Maybe this has something to do with the stick.
Maybe your soul is not as dark as it used to be.
You know, like she got her soul cleaned.
I guess we could all use a little of that.
I just wish I knew what the hell we were dealing with, 'cause this piece of wood is scaring the crap out of me.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
(BOTH SNARLING)
Aah!
Aah!
Oh, crap.
Those are the guys I killed.
Don't worry.
They'll never connect this to you.
There are no surveillance cameras.
I saw you do it, and if I didn't know it was you,
I wouldn't know it was you.
Hey.
I'm glad to see you guys.
I was worried you might be involved in this.
What?
In this?
Are you kidding us?
I don't know who's involved with what anymore.
All hell's breaking loose around here.
We just got word that North Precinct is basically wiped out.
It's FBI now, and Captain's on the warpath, blaming Burkhardt for everything.
I don't know what's going on between him and the captain, but it's getting bad.
- Why would Nick do any of this?
- What are you talking about?
Captain thinks Burkhardt killed these two cops
- when he was busted out.
- What?
Yeah, and now Burkhardt's on the run.
We just put out an APB on him with a shoot-to-kill order.
This is going south fast.
- Where's Captain?
- He's in his office.
Listen, has Nick contacted you?
No.
Well, I'm thinking he should be turning himself in... or getting the hell out of the country, because I don't want anything to do with taking down one of our own.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)
What's he doing?
Looks like he's cleaning out his office.
If Renard's looking for a legitimate way to kill Nick, you can bet we're on his list.
Well, Renard's on my list.
We need to warn Nick.
(CELL PHONE RINGING AND BUZZING)
(SIGHS)
Yes.
Are you with Bonaparte?
No.
Where is he?
He's dead.
When?
Tonight.
How did he die?
The Grimm killed him.
We were told the Grimm was dead.
He should have been.
Something's protecting him.
I don't know what.
You find out and deal with it.
We have suffered a major setback in Portland.
It's imperative that you take control of the city.
I will.
Don't worry.
I'll have the Grimm in 24 hours.
(LINE BEEPS)
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
Captain.
Search warrants just came in.
Anything else?
Just get ready to go.
Thank God you're alive.
This has been awful.
Did Renard do this to your neck?
No, Bonaparte.
Nick, I'm the one who told him where you live.
He would have killed me and our son.
I know.
I know.
You didn't have a choice.
Where's Kelly?
In my room.
(BABY COOING)
Hey.
Hey!
Has he been okay?
Yeah, but I know he misses you.
Hey, bud.
What is that?
An engagement ring for me and Renard.
Bonaparte put it there...
And not normally.
He said if I ever took it off, it would cause great pain to my children.
I hate it, but I'm afraid to take it off without knowing how to break the spell.
Even if he's dead, it could still survive.
We'll find a way to break it.
I need to be with you.
(BABY COOING)
And what about Diana?
- She's with you now.
- I don't know.
I know she wants me and her father to be together, but I'm afraid of what she might do.
You don't know how powerful she is.
But I hate him.
I hate all of this.
I got to get out of here.
You can't leave yet, not until I deal with Renard.
I don't know how much longer I can do this.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
It's Hank.
Yeah, what have you got?
Renard wants you dead.
We just got back to the precinct.
He's got an APB out on you with a shoot-to-kill order.
He's blaming what happened at North Precinct on you, among other things.
He wants to take you down with the legitimacy of the city behind him.
You need to find a place to lay low till we can figure this out.
Yeah, I'll call you when I get there.
I think we should stop using our cell phones.
Yeah.
I'll warn the others.
Good luck.
You too.
If he hurts you,
I will kill him.
You can't take any chances.
But if I don't come back, feel free.
Where are you gonna go?
No, no, no, no.
Don't tell me.
(SOFT MUSIC)
Nick?
He's not here.
Maybe they're still in the tunnel dumping bodies.
We're losing her, Nick.
I hope that thing does what we think it does.
Yeah, me too.
How much do you know about the stick that he used to heal me with?
Not much more than he told you.
Does he always carry it?
No, he got it out to help you.
Got it out from where?
Where he keeps it hidden with the cloth wrapped around it.
Kind of forgot I had it.
Nick left it on the bed when he got out the stick to heal you.
It's really old.
Ancient writing on it.
Can't really see most of it.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
- Yeah.
- Trubel, where are you?
We're in the loft.
Nick's not here.
I know.
Is Eve with you?
I'm here.
What about Monroe and Rosalee?
They were headed home.
Monroe and Rosalee are home.
Listen, there's not much time.
Renard's got a APB out on Nick.
He's got every cop in the city looking for him.
He wants Nick dead.
Now, they'll be hitting Nick's loft, so get out of there.
Got it.
(SIRENS WAILING)
Hank was right.
Here they come.
- How are you feeling?
- Tired.
Me too.
But I'm happy.
Despite everything that's going on, the thought of being a dad and you being a mom and...
And us being a family.
I know.
- Although...
- What?
I've just been thinking.
Maybe Portland isn't, like, the safest place to raise a family right now, you know?
I mean, with Renard as mayor, who knows what's gonna become of this city?
Let's not think about that stuff anymore tonight.
Let's just try to get some sleep.
- Okay.
- I love you.
I love you too.
(SOFT MUSIC)
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
It's the precinct.
What now?
(WHISPERING) Hey, are you with Rosalee?
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.
She should hear this too.
- Okay.
- What's wrong?
Renard put out an APB shoot-to-kill on Nick.
- What?
- He's got search warrants.
They will be hitting your shop and your house.
Do not try to stop them.
- Where's Nick?
- We don't know.
And it's better that we don't.
(POUNDING ON DOOR) This is the police!
- Oh, my God, they're here.
- You stay here.
I'm not staying here.
If they're gonna shoot one of us, it's going to be in front of the other.
(POUNDING ON DOOR) We have a warrant!
Nope, that didn't come out right.
All right, all right.
- Open the door, now!
- Just a second.
We have a warrant for the arrest of Nicholas Burkhardt and a warrant for the search of the premises.
Okay, he's not here, man, and my wife is pregnant, so take your hands...
Do not attempt to interfere.
(MEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
No Burkhardt.
Clear!
(ELEVATOR WHIRRING)
I think they're leaving.
There are patterns on this cloth.
Here?
I don't see 'em.
You don't?
They're right here and here and here.
I can't see what you're seeing.
I've seen them before.
Where?
(INTENSE MUSIC)
No sign of Burkhardt yet.
All these locations have been checked and cleared.
A surveillance team has been left at each location.
- What about his vehicle?
- Hasn't been located.
- What about his phone?
- It's no longer operational.
He probably took the SIM card out.
He's somewhere in the city.
Well, by now, he knows it's a full-on manhunt.
And he's not stupid.
He knows how this works.
So he might not even be in the city anymore.
I don't care where he is.
I don't care what it takes.
I want him found!
You chose the wrong side, Sean.
We located Burkhardt's car.
- Where?
- Laurelhurst.
Seal off the area.
Search every house, block by block.
- One-mile perimeter.
- Sir, that's not...
Just do it!
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)
(TRAIN HORN BLOWING)
Oh, my God!
Hey, take anything you want.
- Bud!
- Huh?
- It's me.
- Nick?
Oh, thank God.
You scared the living...
- I need your help.
- Well, yeah.
Of course.
Anything you need.
I'm guessing it's not your refrigerator.
No, but I'm on the run, and I need a place to hide.
Oh, that's why you're here.
Oh.
Yeah, okay, okay.
What do you need me to do?
Do you have a cell phone?
Yeah, yeah.
Right here, right here.
Okay, I need you to make some calls.
Yeah.
What...
This is serious, isn't it?
Renard wants me dead.
They haven't found him.
- Good.
- But they found his car.
- Where?
- Laurelhurst.
Nick know anyone there?
Not that I know of.
(PHONE RINGS)
Griffin.
Hey, Hank.
It's me, Bud.
Yeah, hi.
Look, we're kind of busy, Bud.
Yeah, yeah, I heard.
I kind of got a little problem.
What kind of problem?
I think I had a break-in in my repair shop.
You don't suppose you and Sergeant Wu could come over and check things out?
Because the perp...
That's what you call 'em, right?
- Uh-huh.
- Could still be in there.
I mean, what if he was a wanted man?
Yeah, yeah, that could be dangerous.
We're on our way.
You might want to change your clothes.
They're here, but...
But they took a cab.
Why would they take a cab?
Hey.
You took a cab so you wouldn't be followed, right?
Two cabs, one train, and a little walking.
Not in that order.
- Where is he?
- This way.
They put a tail on you?
- They did.
- We lost it.
We were followed too, but I'm pretty sure we lost them in a bar downtown.
Yeah, they were watching the loft when we left.
You left your car in Laurelhurst.
Last night.
They are searching the hell out of that area.
Well, that should keep 'em busy for a while.
- We contacted HW.
- Is anyone still alive?
Not here in Portland.
But Black Claw was badly compromised here too.
Renard is on his own.
Yeah, make it easier for us to kill him.
Not really.
He's got cops with him day and night.
So what do we do about Nick?
I think he has to leave Portland.
Renard won't stop until you're dead.
Then maybe that's what you have to do.
If I leave Portland, Renard will control everything.
Nick, we can't afford to lose you.
Look, we need to think of someplace safe, and obviously it's not here.
So I hate to say this, Nick, but maybe they're right.
Maybe you got to go.
You should go back to the precinct.
Get back to work like everything's normal.
I don't want you getting drawn into this any more than you already have.
I don't like it, but okay.
We're still searching the Laurelhurst area, but so far, we got nothing.
We've already checked several blocks away from the parked car.
He dumped it there for us to find.
- Captain?
- Yeah.
We've run every incoming and outgoing phone call on Burkhardt's cell phone.
Besides the ones we've already checked, there's only one other number that has any kind of frequency.
What is it?
Probably doesn't mean anything.
We checked it out.
It's a refrigerator repair company owned by a...
- Bud Wurstner.
- Yeah, that's him.
Check his house.
Check his repair shop.
I want teams at both places.
Now!
We're moving teams from here to here.
What do you want us to do when they're in place?
in's.
I don't like the look of that.
How do we stop that son of a bitch?
There's always a bullet.
I'm sort of half joking.
I'm sort of half laughing.
Something's going on.
That something's coming at us.
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)
I know you know where Burkhardt is.
I will find him, and if either one of you gets in my way,
I'm coming for you next.
And we won't be hard to find.
If he finds Nick... (CELL PHONE RINGING)
They're not gonna be bringing him in.
Renard wants uniforms to do his killing for him.
Griffin.
Where?
Yeah, white female body.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I got it.
Got a body ID'd as Rachel Wood.
Rachel Wood?
Yeah, I think you should come with me on this one.
We need to be watching our backs for the time being.
I mean, we could take you in our car, but if they're watching us, they're watching our car.
Why don't you just steal one?
'Cause there's a risk in that too.
- What about Bud?
- Wait, what?
What... what... what about me?
Your truck.
You're off the grid.
Mm, for now.
Any chance we can see what vehicles the police are tracking?
Whatever car they put a BOLO on should be in the system.
Can you get into the system?
If I access it, they'll know.
Wu could help, but somebody else is gonna have to make that call.
I'll call Wu.
Nobody can track my phone.
Do you know what these mean?
No.
When I was with Monroe and Rosalee,
I touched one of the Black Claw bodies.
Oh, yeah, right.
That was fun.
First time I've ever seen a death grip from a dead guy.
I saw these symbols on his face when I was there... and also on the cloth.
Maybe there was more on that cloth than we could see.
Do you still have the stick with you?
Yes.
I'm not sure you should be carrying it all the time.
Miss Wood's coworker grew concerned when he couldn't reach her.
He came over and discovered this.
All right.
Bring in CSU.
Get this whole place fingerprinted.
She was Renard's campaign PR person.
Yeah.
When you're murdered in bed, it's usually by someone you know.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)
274, go ahead.
This is Unit 274, near the corner of Marks and Milwaukee.
Just completed a drive-by.
There's one truck parked in front.
Belongs to the company.
No sign of the suspect.
No activity at the exterior of the premises.
We're gonna have to send somebody in.
This is not good.
There are bolos out on Monroe and Rosalee's cars, your car and mine...
And Bud's.
Bud's on the list?
Yup, and the BOLO just came back on his truck.
It's at his shop.
Son of a bitch.
We need to get Nick out of there now.
Call Trubel.
On it.
(DOORBELL BUZZES)
Oh, jeez!
Oh, jeez.
S-s-somebody's here.
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I...
Just calm down.
Probably just a customer.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Why don't you go find out what they want?
Right, right.
Business as usual.
Okay.
Wu.
Okay.
Yeah, I'll put you on speaker.
They know about Bud.
They put a BOLO out on his truck.
- It's in front of his shop.
- They're watching it, Nick.
You got to get out of there now.
- Got it, thanks.
- Check in with you when we can.
I'm gonna find out if Tactical's making a move.
- Check with Franco.
- Yup.
Well, looks clear.
- Oh, I hate that.
- What?
Oh, you know, people coming in here with a problem, asking me how much it's gonna cost to repair the refrigerator, and they don't even know what kind of refrigerator they got.
Bud, I don't think that was a customer.
That was a cop.
- Oh, God.
- They're watching the shop.
Nick, you got to get out of here, now.
We need a diversion.
If they think I'm in here, they're gonna send in a SERT team.
- Bud.
- Huh?
Back your truck into the loading bay.
Help him load in a freezer.
- Why?
- So they think you're in it.
- Bud.
- Wh-what?
You're the diversion.
Right, right, right.
They follow me.
Hey, you could fit in that one if you were gonna fit in one.
I haven't fixed it yet, but...
But I guess that doesn't matter right now.
- I don't see anybody.
- You won't.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
Franco.
Hey, it's Wu.
Where are you?
Captain ordered me not to talk to you guys.
Captain's out of control.
Seems like, but he's still got rank.
I got to ask you something.
Drew, you're putting me in a tough spot here.
Okay, then you don't need to.
I'm gonna give you an address.
If that's where you are, don't say anything.
4046 Marks.
Thanks.
(LINE BEEPS)
SERT team's been ordered to Bud's shop.
Franco's there.
It's going down.
What the hell are we gonna do?
Wish I knew.
We ran the fingerprints from the Rachel Wood apartment.
This is where it gets a little awkward.
Well, that's why I brought it up personally.
What kind of awkward are we talking about?
Captain Renard's fingerprints are all over that place.
I know she was working on his campaign, but I think she was working on something else.
All right.
(GRUNTING)
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Okay. (GRUNTING)
(TIRES SQUEALING)
(INTENSE MUSIC)
Suspect's vehicle just pulled into the loading bay.
They loaded in a freezer big enough to hold a man.
They're getting ready to go.
Get in position.
Nick!
Nick!
We're too late.
They're surrounding the place.
We're all gonna die!
All clear.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Isn't there something you can do?
I can try.
- Eve!
- Oh!
I'm so sorry.
We're in position, sir.
Take them down.
And then she woged and had some kind of seizure.
- You're feeling stuff.
- No.
They believed that if you took a pure soul with you, you could trade your way into eternal afterlife.
I saw these symbols on his face when I was there...
and also on the cloth.
I can't see what you're seeing.
Somebody made me kill Bonaparte.
She was Renard's campaign PR person.
Captain Renard's fingerprints are all over that place.
Captain thinks Burkhardt killed these two cops when he was busted out.
We just put out an APB on him with a shoot-to-kill order.
I'm on the run.
I need a place to hide.
They know about Bud.
They put a BOLO out on his truck.
It's in front of his shop.
They're watching it, Nick.
You got to get out of there now.
- We're in position, sir.
- Take them down.
This is Alpha Team.
In position.
Stand by.
- They're coming.
- What are we gonna do?
Truck's clear.
Roger that.
- Let's take 'em on.
- Rosalee's pregnant.
- Bro!
- Sorry.
Whoa, you're pregnant?
Right now?
Oh, my God, that's wonderful!
I mean, it would be if we...
That's great news.
I'm so sorry I dragged you guys into this.
Everybody into the back now.
I'm gonna turn myself in.
- No, Nick, you can't.
- No.
We're in position.
Are we clear to move in?
We're ready to execute.
Repeat.
We are ready to execute.
Do you copy?
You two are in the wrong place.
I told you to stay out of this.
Sean Renard, you are under arrest...
- You can't arrest me.
- For the murder of Rachel Wood.
Surrender your weapon and your badge.
Like hell I will.
What the hell are you guys doing?
Do not interfere with this arrest.
What the hell is going on?
Oh, you're not coming back from this.
- Execute your mission.
- You are relieved of command.
You are no longer giving orders.
You have the right to remain silent.
- Arrest these men!
- Stay out of it, guys!
This is a capital crime.
Nick, you are not giving yourself up.
Then what do we do?
They're coming in here.
I don't want anyone to get hurt.
Now move out of my way.
There's a fugitive in that building.
Take it down!
Ignore him.
He's no longer in command.
Now what?
Clear to move.
- Nobody move.
- Hands up.
Hands up!
I'm Nick Burkhardt.
I'm the one you want.
We have Burkhardt in custody.
Roger that.
Turn around.
What the hell is this?
Maybe they shouldn't have tried to take that from you.
SERT team leader, status?
What a mess.
You better think about what you're doing.
We're doing our job.
You're not helping Burkhardt.
I suggest you take me back now.
We're not taking you back.
You're under arrest.
Burkhardt's a dead man.
Whatever happens to Nick is gonna happen to you.
What's taking so long?
They should have brought out Burkhardt by now.
What's the status?
Report in.
Holy crap.
Burkhardt got away!
Going south on Milwaukee.
We are in pursuit.
- Close off Milwaukee.
- Set up a perimeter.
We can't go far.
We're gonna have to dump it.
And you got to get out of sight.
I can't stay with anybody who knows me.
The tunnels.
Dude, it's the safest place.
I can't get back to the tunnels without going through the loft, and they're watching the loft.
- No!
We found a way out.
- What?
- Rosalee and me...
- It's, like, a little trapdoor down by the railroad tracks.
You'd never see it unless you knew it was there.
How do I find it?
It's, like, a couple blocks from the loft.
I'll draw you a map.
You and Rosalee need to get back to the spice shop.
You shouldn't be anywhere near me right now.
You really think this is gonna go anywhere?
We take our job seriously, Captain.
Yes, I appreciate your dedication, really, but don't you think you're making a pretty big mistake?
You were arrested for the murder of Rachel Wood.
Where were you the night she was murdered?
I don't know when she was murdered.
You didn't seem surprised when we told you.
- I did not kill Rachel Wood.
- But you knew she was dead.
And you were in her apartment.
Your fingerprints are all over it.
Including the bedroom.
Now, why don't you tell us about your relationship with your public relations manager?
Now, if you think that going after me is somehow gonna help Burkhardt, then you two might want to reconsider a career in law enforcement.
Now, we know your relationship with her was more than professional.
We can put you at the scene of the crime, sir.
And give you motive.
Oh, well, I can't wait to hear what that might be.
You were running for mayor.
You wanted to present a happy family.
The woman you were having an affair with threatens to blackmail you, endanger your political ambitions.
So you kill her.
Seems like that'd be pretty easy for a jury to understand.
This will never go to trial, and you know it.
Then if you didn't kill her, who did?
The only person we can place there is you.
Rachel's dead.
Suffocated to death in her bed, and it wasn't an accident or something a normal person could do.
I didn't think she was capable at such a young age, but...
Tell us where you were last night.
I was with my campaign adviser.
Name.
Think carefully about what you're doing.
Name.
You gonna take this to trial?
Name.
- Conrad Bonaparte.
- Where can we find him?
He left the country.
And you with no alibi.
I'm calling my lawyer.
Hello?
Will you accept a collect call from Sean Renard at the Portland precinct jail?
- I guess.
- Adalind.
What's going on?
I've been arrested for murder.
- Really?
- Who'd you kill?
I didn't kill anybody.
Well, who do they think you killed?
- Rachel Wood.
- Oh.
Yeah.
So listen to me very closely.
I need you to get somebody to watch the kids and get down here right away.
Why?
Because you're gonna get me out of here.
This isn't right, Captain.
Anything you need, let me know.
Get me a phone.
How long can we keep him in there?
I don't know...
No bail on a murder case, but he's got a lot of connections.
- What happens if he gets out?
- Not good for us.
If he comes after me, I'm telling you now, one of us is not walking away from it.
- I know how you feel.
- All right, yeah.
I'll call you back.
Hey, you want to tell me what the hell is going on?
- Where's Nick?
- I don't know.
He got away.
- How'd he do that?
- You tell me.
When we found the SERT team, they were unconscious on the floor.
Nick was gone; not one of 'em knew what happened.
The SERT team leader woke up in the truck six miles away, has no idea how he got there.
None of it makes any sense, including you arresting the captain.
What was that about?
Just going where the evidence takes us.
Well, I'm glad it wasn't me who had to arrest him, but if you get a line on Burkhardt, tell him to turn himself in.
Because next time, they're gonna shoot first.
- Griffin.
- Hank, it's me.
Trubel, where are you?
We're going back to the tunnels through the way Monroe found.
Yeah, we need you to come out here.
Go through the loft, and if anybody's watching, they'll just think you're looking for him.
All right.
Put it on speaker.
Nick's got to hear this.
- Yeah?
- We arrested Renard.
Tell you about it later.
At least he's off the street for a while.
- They arrested Renard?
- Whoa!
He can't be too happy about that.
He's not, but I am.
Uh, sure we're not being followed, right?
They can't be following us.
They don't know where we are.
Well, they know where I work.
It's not gonna take 'em long to figure out where I live.
What am I gonna tell my wife?
Nothing until we figure out what they know.
Hey!
Hey, that could be it.
That looks like an old furnace door.
- Without a furnace.
- This has got to be it.
My wife is gonna miss me eventually, and I'm gonna miss her.
I mean, how long you think we're gonna have to live down here?
I don't know, Bud.
Well, maybe it's just better if she thinks I'm dead.
Why would she think you're dead, Bud?
Well, I'm missing, aren't I?
Oh, God, you think they're in danger?
Could they try to get to you through me through them?
We'll have someone reach out to your wife and kids, Bud, but they might want to leave Portland for a little while.
Oh, my God, if anything were to happen to my family...
Bud, as soon as we're done here, we'll make sure they're all right.
Okay.
Okay.
I feel sorry for Rosalee getting pregnant right now, with everything that's going on.
When has there been a good time?
How are you feeling?
Different... and the same, like... like there's two of me.
It's very confusing.
A lot is.
Nick, I'm gonna need you to give me that cloth.
I want to take it to Rosalee.
Why?
After everything that happened to us, we need to know what it is and where it came from.
The answer might be on the cloth.
I'm not sure that it is.
We need to find out where its power comes from before it kills one of us.
Watch it.
I didn't see anybody.
- Did you see anybody?
- No.
Doesn't mean they're not there.
Boy, oh, boy, I'm gonna need a lot of glue.
So... should we just open up shop, act like nothing's wrong?
Or keep it closed and act like we're paranoid?
- Well, aren't we?
- I don't know.
I'm trying very hard not to be.
I don't want our baby to be born full of tension, thank you.
No, you're right.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
We'll just open up shop like it's any normal day.
- Spice Tea.
- Hey, it's Adalind.
Got a minute?
I kind of need a favor.
Sure, what?
Can I bring the kids by the shop for a couple of hours?
There's something I have to do and I don't trust my kids with anybody else.
Except for Nick, but I don't know where he is, and I'm just too afraid to contact him.
- Yes.
Bring them over.
- Great.
Thank you.
We'll be there soon.
- Okay.
- "Bring them over"?
- Who's them?
- Kelly and Diana.
- Adalind wants us to watch them.
- Whoa, wait a minute, Diana?
You mean the one who, like, beamed herself into Nick's loft?
You sure that's such a good idea?
If Adalind didn't think it was a good idea, she wouldn't bring them over.
They're her children.
Okay, fine, whatever you say.
But if Diana, like, disappears, we can't be held accountable.
That's all I'm saying.
- Hello?
- It's me.
We have a problem.
- Well, where are you?
- In jail.
I've been arrested for murder.
- What?
- They have evidence.
It puts me at the scene.
- So you knew the victim?
- Yeah.
Well, that complicates it.
I know.
Now un-complicate it.
Nick, we need answers.
This isn't a good idea.
You went all the way to Germany to find this thing.
What's stopping you now?
I'm not sure.
Nick, we got to find out what's going on with this.
I saw this one, this one, and this one.
I can't see what you're seeing.
Yeah, I couldn't see it either.
I didn't see them until I touched the body in the spice shop.
That was fun.
Didn't think she was coming back.
A dead guy touched you.
How is that possible if he's, you know, dead?
Death grip.
That's what Rosalee called it, anyway.
"Death grip" does not sound good.
How did you get out of it?
Rosalee cut the dead guy's arm off.
Oh, well, yeah, I guess that could do it.
You have to be very careful with that.
I will be.
You need to be careful too.
I don't think you should be carrying the stick around all the time.
It's the only reason I'm alive.
Yeah.
It's powerful.
But we don't know where that power comes from.
- I don't think that matters.
- It does matter.
Look what happened when those guys tried to take the stick away from you.
It acted defensively, like it was connected to you.
That's different from what it did to Monroe or me or you when you were shot.
Nick, maybe she's right.
- You know, maybe...
- Look.
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the stick.
So I think I should be the one who decides when not to use it.
Well, there's no risk for you down here, so I don't see how it would hurt to put it away for a while... if you can.
Happy?
We should get going.
You were shot?
Shouldn't we have some games or something?
You know what?
I'm gonna go out and get some toys.
- It's gonna be fine.
- You don't know that.
Diana is the offspring of a full-on Hexenbiest and a half Zauberbiest, and Kelly is the son of the same Hexenbiest and a Grimm.
I'm sorry, but that is a big, weird gene pool to just be diving into.
Oh, hi.
Hello.
Hi.
Thanks so much for helping us out.
- Of course.
- Hi, Diana.
I'm glad we finally get a chance to meet.
I'm Rosalee, and this is Monroe.
- Hi.
- I know.
I saw both of you with Kelly's daddy.
That's right; that was pretty impressive what you did, just appearing like that out of the blue.
Why?
Oh, um, just 'cause most people can't really do that sort of thing.
What is all this stuff?
Just a bunch of herbs and spices.
Kelly's still asleep.
Do you mind if I just put him in the back room?
Sure.
Let's find a cozy spot.
So... okay.
Um... you want to see some of the herbs and spices?
- Uh-huh.
- Hey, you like cinnamon?
We got some cinnamon sticks right over here.
You know where cinnamon comes from?
- Do you?
- Actually, I do.
Uh, it comes from the inner bark of several trees of the genus Cinnamomum.
Now, this bark contains certain oils that provide the...
Thank you so much for doing this.
I can't even imagine what you're going through, considering what's going on.
- Sean's been arrested.
- What?
Yeah.
For murder.
I'm...
I'm surprised.
Not that he murdered somebody but that he was arrested for it.
Was it Bonaparte?
- No, Rachel Wood.
- He killed his own mistress?
It's complicated, but he wants me to get him out of it.
How?
I don't know, but I'll be back as soon as I can.
Bye.
Okay.
You are so lucky Nick is your dad.
- You okay?
- What?
It seems like you're, you know, a little antsy.
Not that you shouldn't be antsy with all that's been going on.
Uh, God knows I'm antsy.
- They were wrong.
- Who?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nick, Nick, Nick, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
- It should be with me.
- Uh, Nick, Nick, Nick.
I-I don't think that's such a good idea.
You know, and it's not just me...
Look, look, look, Nick, Nick,
I just think, you know, too much of a good thing is... is not a good thing.
Oh!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I... you know, I think you did the right thing there.
- We got to move.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I hope my baby is as cute as you are.
Yes.
I, uh... a little help out here, maybe, with Diana.
What's wrong?
I think you just...
I think you need to see it.
Okay.
Oh.
Do you like it?
Oh, yeah.
It's... it's so...
It's so beautiful, but, um... you need to be very careful with these things.
They can all break.
I know.
Look.
- Oh!
- Want to see another one?
No, no, no, that was plenty.
That was great.
I think we should put them all back now.
I can help you, if you want.
- No, I can do it.
- Are you sure?
So what do you want to do now?
Uh...
Adalind's here?
No, she just needed someone to watch the kids.
I know you.
You're a friend of Kelly's daddy.
Yeah.
I am.
And I know you.
You're Diana.
I know you too.
You're different now.
Yes.
Everything okay?
We need to find out more about this.
- Yes.
- Okay, let's do that.
Are you just... leaving me up here?
All alone?
You're not alone.
I'm here.
What do you want me to do now?
Never thought I'd see this.
Well, enjoy it while you can.
- What do you want from me?
- A little help.
And what kind of help would that be?
Well, ironically, I don't have an alibi for the night Rachel was killed.
- Where were you?
- I was killing Bonaparte.
Oh, well, that is awkward.
But we both know I didn't kill Rachel.
What do you want me to do?
Turn in our daughter so you can get out of this?
No, you're gonna get me out of this.
How?
You're gonna be my alibi.
We were together all night.
I never left the house.
You expect me to be your alibi for a murder you didn't commit because you were actually murdering the person who was your alibi?
Basically, yeah.
Shouldn't be too hard.
Unless I perjure myself and I end up going to jail.
Let me tell you something:
I have two kids to take care of.
I'm not going to jail for a murder I did not commit.
Why not?
You're not going to jail for one you did commit.
You owe me.
I owe my children, and if I have to choose between me going to jail and you going to jail, good luck with the grand jury.
Hey.
Oh!
Oh, thank God it's you guys.
You never know what you're gonna meet down here.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Thanks for what you did.
We tried to stop Renard.
How the hell did you get out of there?
It was unbelievable.
It was that stick thing.
Talk about talking softly and carrying a big stick.
They tried to take it from him, and it was like they got hit with a bolt of lightning.
- Seriously?
- Something like that.
What'd you charge Renard with?
The murder of Rachel Wood.
Her body was found on her bed, wrapped in a sheet, smothered to death.
Renard's fingerprints were all over the place.
- Well, did he do it?
- He says he didn't.
But we've got enough to take it to grand jury.
I think we got enough to take this son of a bitch down.
But I'm still on the run.
Well, at least we got him off your back for a while.
That's not good enough.
We need to get him to drop the charges against me.
Good idea, but how you gonna do that?
That guy is a dick.
We don't bring him down.
We let him go.
What the hell are you talking about?
Renard doesn't want to go to jail any more than I do, so we need to talk.
You think you can trust him, Nick?
No, but I trust his need to destroy me.
Is there anything I can do?
Well, you've done enough.
Why don't you just go back home?
Okay, okay, but if you need me,
I'm willing to spend the rest of my life down here in this tunnel, if that's what it takes.
- Uh, what about your wife?
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah, she probably wouldn't like living down here that much.
But the kids sure would.
Be advised, APB is still out on Detective Burkhardt.
He is to be considered armed and dangerous
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.
Oh, hey, where are you?
Wait, don't tell me.
I need your help with something.
Where are you?
Uh, actually, I'm in your precinct.
- Can you talk?
- I think so.
I need to make a deal with somebody who I don't trust.
Oh, you need a Trust Me Knot.
It's not a not-not.
It's a knot with a K, like you tie with a rope.
- And how does that work?
- It's pretty simple, actually.
Whoever signs the Trust Me Knot has to do what they promise, or they choke to death, like a hangman's knot around their neck.
I can do one for you.
Can you do it now?
Uh, yeah.
Let me just grab a couple things, and where should I meet you?
Where you first told me you loved me.
Okay.
Now what?
Somebody doesn't think you belong here.
Let's go.
Where?
You're looking for Burkhardt.
He's looking for you.
I assume you have the proper paperwork for transferring a prisoner?
- Probably not.
- Don't worry.
We're not gonna kill you.
Turn around.
Guard?
Hell of a dιjΓ vu.
Glad you could make it.
Well, I can't pass up such an invitation.
Just so you know, if I wind up missing or dead, you're suspect number one.
You're no good to me dead.
I tried to convince him otherwise, but...
We have enough evidence to convince the grand jury to put you on trial for her murder.
I did not kill Rachel Wood.
Your fingerprints were at the crime scene, and you have no alibi for that night.
He has an alibi.
Me.
I know where he was and what he was doing.
But if I testify that you were killing Bonaparte at the time, that might complicate both of our lives even more.
- But that's not why we're here.
- We're here to help you.
And how do you suggest we do that?
You drop all of the charges against me.
And reinstate him into the department.
And we give you an alibi that'll work for the night Rachel was killed.
- You have an alibi in mind?
- Adalind.
- Little late for that.
- Already tried.
She turned me down.
She didn't turn me down.
Well, she'll have to testify.
She will.
Look, even if she doesn't, I don't believe she will.
I'm not dropping the charges against you until I'm cleared by a grand jury.
And Adalind won't be testifying until we have a guarantee that you will drop the charges against me.
So how do we get around this little mutual distrust of ours?
A Trust Me Knot.
You really get around, don't you?
Take his cuffs off.
He's gonna need his hands for this.
You know how this works?
Sort of.
Take it.
This is a blood oath.
Whoever breaks it first will die.
You, Nick Burkhardt, agree that I will testify at the grand jury on Sean Renard's behalf.
And you, Sean Renard, agree that once my testimony is given, you will drop all charges against Nick Burkhardt and reinstate him.
- Agreed?
- Agreed.
Agreed?
Agreed.
Si fides solvitur nodus interficit.
If the trust is broken, the knot will kill.
Well, don't want to be breaking that.
Maybe you should just try it on the corner.
In case something happens, we don't destroy it.
Why don't we try it on a different piece of cloth first?
Yeah.
Probably a good idea.
So far, so good.
Sorry that took me so long.
No problem.
He was an angel.
What did Renard want?
- For me to be his alibi.
- What did you tell him?
- That I wouldn't do it.
- I bet that went over well.
- Well, we sort of made a deal.
- A deal with Renard?
About what?
- Nick.
- He's on his way over.
They're still looking for him.
He knows.
He's taking the long way around.
This looks really old.
What are you trying to do?
It's an ancient cloth that has some writing on it, and we're trying to read it.
Without destroying it.
We used a spectral imaging machine, but we can only make out a few letters.
Yeah, one of the words is "miracle,"
and the other is, like, "dangerous" or "perilous."
What are you using?
Well, since it's so old, we were starting with a mix of phenolphthalein and red cabbage water.
If the ink is ammonium-based...
It'll turn pink and become more legible.
That's the theory.
Maybe it's not enough?
Wait, something's happening.
Okay, clearly not ammonia-based.
Mommy, I thought we were going to go.
- We are.
- Just one second.
Not that we wouldn't be happy to have you a little longer.
What are you doing?
I'm just trying to help Rosalee and Eve see something.
See something where?
On this really old piece of cloth.
It has some writing on it, and we're having a tough time seeing it.
- Can I try?
- Oh, honey, it's really old.
And we should get going.
I can see it.
What can you see?
Lots of stuff.
Can you tell us what you see?
Little pictures and some strange writing.
- How many little pictures?
- All over it.
You can see more than just what's here?
Uh-huh.
- Nick.
Are you okay?
- Yeah.
I just wanted to make sure I wasn't being followed.
Nick, Diana can see something on the cloth.
- What?
- Strange drawings and pictures.
You're the one my mom wanted me to talk to.
- Thank you for helping us.
- You're Kelly's daddy.
I am, and you're his sister.
I like him.
He doesn't talk much.
Can you draw what you're seeing?
Sure.
Here.
- It's HW.
- In Portland?
Not anymore.
I'm here.
No, this isn't a good time for me to...
When?
Yeah, I understand that.
It's just...
Okay, okay.
Nick, I'm leaving Portland in four hours.
- Where?
- I'll know when I get there.
- What about me?
- Didn't say anything about you.
Just Grimms.
They want you to come with me.
I'm sorry, you guys, but you got to look at this.
It's like some kind of weird symbol-filled equation-esque, kind of hieroglyphic-y, astrological cornucopia of something
I've run out of words for.
I've never seen anything like this.
Me neither.
Check it out on the computer.
Man.
I just had a really awful thought.
What if our evidence against Renard is too strong and they take it to trial?
Then the deal is off, and Nick is screwed.
You're not helping.
There are no witnesses, and Adalind's alibi should clear him.
Okay, she's believable, right?
Well, when you're that pretty, people want to believe you.
Griffin.
What?
When?
You got to be kidding me.
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.
We'll be there.
They're convening the grand jury for Renard in two hours.
Two hours?
It takes three days to convene a grand jury.
But they're making an exception for Renard, considering he's a police captain and a mayor-elect.
Okay.
We got to call Nick.
Whatever these symbols are, I don't think they're numerical.
I can't find them anywhere.
Maybe we're looking in the wrong place.
I've looked at the Babylonians and the Egyptians, and that's as far back as arithmetic, which is about 2,000 B.C., so...
How do we know the right place to look if we've never seen them before?
Except in hell.
I've got to go.
I want you to come with me.
You know I can't.
I know, but even if you get out of this,
Renard's still gonna be running the city.
It'll be bad.
Well, someone has to stay here and deal with it.
Hey.
You better be alive when I get back.
It's Hank.
Hey, I thought we weren't supposed to be using our cell phones.
We've got a bigger problem.
Where's Nick?
Hey, what's going on?
They're convening the grand jury now.
We need Adalind at the courthouse.
What?
This soon?
Because of who he is, they want to get it over fast.
Okay.
I'm on my way.
All of a sudden, I'm nervous.
Ladies and gentlemen, this court is now in session.
Please take your seats.
The grand jury in case number 75-6574 is now convened.
Good afternoon, Ms. Hurtz.
Good afternoon, Judge Stancroft.
Captain Renard, having thoroughly reviewed all the evidence with the district attorney...
It is my opinion that the evidence clearly does not support this case going to trial.
Is he serious?
He's throwing the whole thing out.
I thank the jury for your service and for convening on such short notice.
You are dismissed.
The defendant is free to go.
You remember that deal we had, right?
Well, you never testified, so the deal is off.
I'll expect your resignations on my desk in the morning.
That couldn't have gone better, I don't think.
Just be a little more careful where you leave your fingerprints next time.
I will, and as soon as I take office,
I'm gonna clean house in Portland.
I hope that includes the Grimm.
- And all his friends.
- Oh, it will.
So the whole deal with Renard is off?
Yeah, what about this whole Trust Me Knot thing?
Wasn't Renard supposed to choke on that if he didn't live up to his end of the deal?
No, because I had to testify first in order for Renard to release him.
And since she didn't testify, the deal never happened.
So that son of a bitch walks, and Nick is still a fugitive.
We were set up.
It was all a show.
- And we resign tomorrow.
- What about us?
You're gonna have to move back in with him.
- What?
No, I hate him.
- He's coming after me.
And if you don't go back, he's gonna be coming after both of us.
Bastard got everything he wanted.
What do you need, sir?
I want Burkhardt found.
Yes, sir.
Previously on "Grimm"...
Doesn't have to end here.
You chose the wrong side, Sean.
- (CHOKING AND GASPING)
- That's enough.
(GUNSHOT)
(MEN GRUNTING)
- Arrest him.
- Aah!
- Where's Eve?
- She went after Bonaparte.
We used the stick to heal her.
And then she woged and had some kind of seizure.
(CHOKING)
Tell me where he lives.
- Everybody into the tunnel.
- Nick, come on.
Let's go.
No!
I'm gonna stay here with Eve, make sure nobody follows us.
We'll see if there's an exit further down this way.
It's over.
How the hell?
(YELLS)
Oh, come on!
We're gonna have to go back and find another way.
I'm pregnant.
I should have killed you when I had the chance.
I won't make that mistake again, huh?
(INTENSE MUSIC)
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)
_
I guess I should thank you.
I thought you were on his side.
You killed all of them.
You were shot.
You're not even wounded.
They said you were dead.
- I think I was.
- How does that happen?
I'm not sure.
Why'd you stop him?
I'm not sure either.
(SIGHS) Maybe one of the others found a way out.
(METALLIC CLATTER)
What... what was that?
We got to go back.
Yeah.
We break out.
We can circle back for Nick.
We shouldn't have left Nick.
He gave us no choice.
This fight's not over.
It is for Nick.
It would have been for us if we had stayed.
I'm not letting Renard get away with this.
Yeah, that son of a bitch is going down.
You hear that?
(WATER RUSHING FAINTLY)
Sounds like water.
There's an opening.
It must connect to the city's storm drain.
Yeah, there's no way we can get out through there.
(BOTH SIGH)
Oh, my God, this has to lead somewhere.
There.
This could be the way out.
(SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC)
Looks like there's some kind of door up here.
(BANGING)
Oh, my God.
We can get out this way.
We got to go back and tell the others.
What?
I don't want to tell anybody about me being pregnant.
Okay, right.
I guess it's not really the time or the place for anything remotely happy.
I mean, why bring it up, right?
We may not even be getting out of here.
Hey.
We are getting out of here.
I don't need you to cheer me up right now.
We have no idea how many people attacked Nick or even if he's still alive or if they haven't found these tunnels and they're coming down here right now to kill us.
I mean, I think I actually need you to cheer me up right now.
Shh.
Listen to me.
If they come down here after us, it is gonna be their mistake.
Okay?
(CHUCKLES)
Come on.
Let's go.
What are we supposed to do now?
- We keep fighting.
- Meisner's dead.
Nick might be too.
We can't do this alone.
We regroup.
We rebuild.
Not in Portland.
(SIGHS)
I'm tired of waiting.
I'm going back for Nick.
You stay here.
You wait for the others.
I owe him.
- Now who's talking?
- I am.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Something's in the way.
- You're feeling stuff.
- No, I won't go back.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Did you guys find a way out?
Yeah, we can all get out, but it's back that way.
I'm going back for Nick.
Us too.
Hey, guys, we found a way out.
Nick didn't.
(INTENSE MUSIC)
(FOOTSTEPS TAPPING)
There's somebody coming.
All right, turn off the lights.
Now.
- Nick!
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.
- You're alive.
- How many are behind you?
- None.
What?
We saw tons of them.
Yeah, they're all dead.
- All of 'em?
- Including Bonaparte.
- You killed Bonaparte?
- No.
Renard did.
Renard?
Um... kind of looks like you were shot.
Like, more than once.
You're not a ghost, are you?
I hope not.
(TENSE MUSIC)
Daddy's gonna be all right.
It's okay.
Daddy's gonna be all right.
- (BABY COOING)
- Daddy's gonna be all right.
Yeah.
It's okay.
(DOOR CLICKS OPEN)
Is Nick dead?
No.
What did you do to him?
- Not much.
- Is he okay?
- He's alive.
- Well, then how are you here?
What are you doing still alive?
Thanks for your concern.
You and Bonaparte went to kill Nick.
Why should I be concerned about you?
- Bonaparte is dead.
- What?
- Yeah, you must be relieved.
- Nick killed him?
No, he had nothing to do with it.
Then who did?
- I'm not entirely sure.
- You were there.
How did you not see who killed him?
- I saw it.
- You're not making any sense.
Because none of this makes any sense.
- Who killed him?
- I killed him.
I think.
Maybe.
I'm not sure.
- How can you not be sure - about something like that?
I stabbed him.
I stabbed him, but I didn't realize what I'd done until I saw that...
That bloody sword in my hand.
But you already know about that, don't you?
I had nothing to do with this.
Do you think I would risk that knowing what he can do to my children?
Has Diana been asleep all night?
You're gonna blame Diana for this too?
Well, somebody made me kill Bonaparte, just like somebody killed Rachel.
Who else has that kind of power?
She won't take Daddy away anymore.
Diana saw the bruises on my neck, and she asked me if you had done it.
And what did you tell her?
I said no, one of your friends did it and that she shouldn't worry about it.
What are you gonna do?
I'm not gonna let Diana control our lives.
If Diana made you kill Bonaparte,
I'd go a little easy on the discipline.
(SIGHS) Bonaparte brought this on himself.
He would have killed me.
Maybe Diana just wanted her daddy to be a hero and save Mommy.
Well, she got her wish.
We better be careful what she wishes for.
Black Claw's gonna find out about Bonaparte, if they haven't already.
And they're gonna go after whoever did it.
I assume you're not gonna confess?
No.
Somebody is.
Who?
You should have never fallen in love with Burkhardt.
Now you're gonna regret it.
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)
Hello.
Wake up.
Who is this?
Sean Renard.
I'm coming over.
At this hour?
I'll be outside your house in five minutes.
(LINE CLICKS AND BEEPS)
(SIGHS)
(SOFT EERIE MUSIC)
Mommy?
I'm sorry to wake you, sweetie.
That's okay.
Is something wrong?
Were you playing with your dolls again tonight?
- Mm-hmm.
I couldn't sleep.
- Why not?
Because of that man who hurt your neck.
He was mean, and I didn't want him to ever hurt you again, Mommy.
- Oh, my God, Nick.
- Dude, there's so many.
They came here to kill all of us.
Killed Bonaparte?
Renard didn't know what he was doing.
He's gonna be trying to figure out a way to explain it.
You healed me.
How?
It's the same way I was saved.
Monroe and I found this in the Black Forest.
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
What is it?
It's connected with those keys.
It's some kind of stick thing the crusaders took when they sacked Constantinople.
They hid it in a chest and then buried it under a church in the Black Forest behind a bunch of skulls that, when you turn the lights down, they kind of glow green and...
Long story.
Basically, we don't know what it is.
All we know is, it has some kind of power to heal.
You were dying.
Nick used it on you.
And it worked.
Then you had some kind of seizure.
And when you came to...
I felt different.
How do you feel now?
Something's changed.
Yeah, a lot's changed.
I'm gonna have to tell HW what's happened.
We should probably figure out how to deal with all these bodies.
I mean, we can't just leave them here, you know?
Not if you ever want to have a dinner party for the living.
Yeah, we have to deal with this.
Well, we can't put them in the elevator and walk them out the front door, so...
The tunnel.
There's a big hole down there, dumps right into the storm drain.
What about the three bodies at the spice shop?
We're gonna have to deal with them, too, while it's still dark.
I'll go with Monroe and Rosalee.
I'm gonna go with them too, seeing as I'm the one that killed them.
Meet up with you later.
So, uh, how do we get these guys down into the tunnel?
(THUD)
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)
The hell do you think you're doing?
I need search warrants.
You woke me up for search warrants?
I need a lot of them.
I don't care if you are the new mayor.
You don't come here in the middle of the night demanding anything.
Bonaparte's dead.
What?
Burkhardt killed him.
The Grimm killed Bonaparte?
And I'm taking him down for it.
How many warrants do you need?
(POLICE RADIO CHATTER)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
What the hell happened here?
We're not sure, Captain.
All we know is what the jailer told us.
Seven North Precinct cops were sent to transport Burkhardt to the North Precinct, and somehow, between the time he was taken out of his cell to before he got out of the building, these two got into it with somebody... or something.
There were no witnesses.
The rest of us were out on a bunch of bogus 911 calls.
And, you know, Captain, I think it's a little too coincidental that we got those calls just when they were coming to get Burkhardt.
He broke out before they could get him to the North Precinct.
What?
My guess is, Burkhardt had some help.
Nick?
I want him found, and I want him arrested.
Put out an APB.
Consider him armed and dangerous.
Sir, Nick wouldn't do this.
If he resists, shoot to kill.
Yes, sir.
(GRUNTING)
You probably shouldn't stay here now.
Too many of the wrong people know where you live.
You stay out of sight till we find out what's going on.
You guys head back to the precinct.
See what you can find.
We'll call you when we know something.
Watch your backs. (CELL PHONE BUZZES)
Oh, this was on your desk at the precinct.
Adalind.
I'm so happy to hear your voice.
Are you all right?
Yeah, are you?
Renard was here.
He told me what happened.
He said Bonaparte's dead.
Is that true?
Yeah, but I didn't kill him.
I know.
Renard said he did.
Where is he now?
I don't know.
He left.
Nick, I really need to see you.
So does Kelly.
But I can't leave the house, not with the children here.
Can you come over?
The guards that were here are gone.
Nick, please, I need you.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Sorry for the mess.
This one's a Hundjaeger, and the other one was actually something
I've never seen before.
Let's get 'em out of here.
All right, you get the arms.
I'll get the legs.
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)
(LIGHTBULB SHATTERS)
He grabbed her!
Eve!
Eve!
She's not responding.
She's in some kind of trance.
He won't let go.
(GLASS SHATTERS)
He's dead.
Try telling him that.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)
(YELLS)
I can't get his hand off her.
I think I know what this is.
It's a death grip.
- You've seen this before?
- Read about it.
Has to do with the fear of dying and getting stuck in the underworld.
They believed that if you took a pure soul with you, you could trade your way into eternal afterlife or something.
(GRUNTING)
Ah, here it is.
First documented by Egyptian Wesen under the reign of Merenre Nemtyemsaf II
- in the sixth dynasty.
- Oh, my God.
Does it say anything about how to stop it?
Yes, actually, it does.
I don't think we have time for a complicated spell.
Not that complicated.
Hurry up.
I think we're losing her.
Give me some room.
Oh!
(GASPING)
Eve?
Yeah.
- Where the hell were you?
- I'm not sure.
I don't think you should be handling dead guys right now.
Thanks.
The death grip supposedly trades a pure soul for freedom from hell.
Pure soul?
I don't think so.
Yeah, that doesn't really make so much sense.
I mean, after everything she did?
No offense.
Maybe this has something to do with the stick.
Maybe your soul is not as dark as it used to be.
You know, like she got her soul cleaned.
I guess we could all use a little of that.
I just wish I knew what the hell we were dealing with, 'cause this piece of wood is scaring the crap out of me.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
(BOTH SNARLING)
Aah!
Aah!
Oh, crap.
Those are the guys I killed.
Don't worry.
They'll never connect this to you.
There are no surveillance cameras.
I saw you do it, and if I didn't know it was you,
I wouldn't know it was you.
Hey.
I'm glad to see you guys.
I was worried you might be involved in this.
What?
In this?
Are you kidding us?
I don't know who's involved with what anymore.
All hell's breaking loose around here.
We just got word that North Precinct is basically wiped out.
It's FBI now, and Captain's on the warpath, blaming Burkhardt for everything.
I don't know what's going on between him and the captain, but it's getting bad.
- Why would Nick do any of this?
- What are you talking about?
Captain thinks Burkhardt killed these two cops
- when he was busted out.
- What?
Yeah, and now Burkhardt's on the run.
We just put out an APB on him with a shoot-to-kill order.
This is going south fast.
- Where's Captain?
- He's in his office.
Listen, has Nick contacted you?
No.
Well, I'm thinking he should be turning himself in... or getting the hell out of the country, because I don't want anything to do with taking down one of our own.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)
What's he doing?
Looks like he's cleaning out his office.
If Renard's looking for a legitimate way to kill Nick, you can bet we're on his list.
Well, Renard's on my list.
We need to warn Nick.
(CELL PHONE RINGING AND BUZZING)
(SIGHS)
Yes.
Are you with Bonaparte?
No.
Where is he?
He's dead.
When?
Tonight.
How did he die?
The Grimm killed him.
We were told the Grimm was dead.
He should have been.
Something's protecting him.
I don't know what.
You find out and deal with it.
We have suffered a major setback in Portland.
It's imperative that you take control of the city.
I will.
Don't worry.
I'll have the Grimm in 24 hours.
(LINE BEEPS)
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
Captain.
Search warrants just came in.
Anything else?
Just get ready to go.
Thank God you're alive.
This has been awful.
Did Renard do this no
- I give to your neck?
Berkeley, not you"
No, Bonaparte.
Nick, I'm the one who told him where you live.
He would have killed me and our son.
I know.
I know.
You didn't have a choice.
Where's Kelly?
In my room.
(BABY COOING)
Hey.
Hey!
Has he been okay?
Yeah, but I know he misses you.
Hey, bud.
What is that?
An engagement ring for me and Renard.
Bonaparte put it there...
And not normally.
He said if I ever took it off, it would cause great pain to my children.
I hate it, but I'm afraid to take it off without knowing how to break the spell.
Even if he's dead, it could still survive.
We'll find a way to break it.
I need to be with you.
(BABY COOING)
And what about Diana?
- She's with you now.
- I don't know.
I know she wants me and her father to be together, but I'm afraid of what she might do.
You don't know how powerful she is.
But I hate him.
I hate all of this.
I got to get out of here.
You can't leave yet, not until I deal with Renard.
I don't know how much longer I can do this.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
It's Hank.
Yeah, what have you got?
Renard wants you dead.
We just got back to the precinct.
He's got an APB out on you with a shoot-to-kill order.
He's blaming what happened at North Precinct on you, among other things.
He wants to take you down with the legitimacy of the city behind him.
You need to find a place to lay low till we can figure this out.
Yeah, I'll call you when I get there.
I think we should stop using our cell phones.
Yeah.
I'll warn the others.
Good luck.
You too.
If he hurts you,
I will kill him.
You can't take any chances.
But if I don't come back, feel free.
Where are you gonna go?
No, no, no, no.
Don't tell me.
(SOFT MUSIC)
Nick?
He's not here.
Maybe they're still in the tunnel dumping bodies.
We're losing her, Nick.
I hope that thing does what we think it does.
Yeah, me too.
How much do you know about the stick that he used to heal me with?
Not much more than he told you.
Does he always carry it?
No, he got it out to help you.
Got it out from where?
Where he keeps it hidden with the cloth wrapped around it.
Kind of forgot I had it.
Nick left it on the bed when he got out the stick to heal you.
It's really old.
Ancient writing on it.
Can't really see most of it.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
- Yeah.
- Trubel, where are you?
We're in the loft.
Nick's not here.
I know.
Is Eve with you?
I'm here.
What about Monroe and Rosalee?
They were headed home.
Monroe and Rosalee are home.
Listen, there's not much time.
Renard's got a APB out on Nick.
He's got every cop in the city looking for him.
He wants Nick dead.
Now, they'll be hitting Nick's loft, so get out of there.
Got it.
(SIRENS WAILING)
Hank was right.
Here they come.
- How are you feeling?
- Tired.
Me too.
But I'm happy.
Despite everything that's going on, the thought of being a dad and you being a mom and...
And us being a family.
I know.
- Although...
- What?
I've just been thinking.
Maybe Portland isn't, like, the safest place to raise a family right now, you know?
I mean, with Renard as mayor, who knows what's gonna become of this city?
Let's not think about that stuff anymore tonight.
Let's just try to get some sleep.
- Okay.
- I love you.
I love you too.
(SOFT MUSIC)
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
It's the precinct.
What now?
(WHISPERING) Hey, are you with Rosalee?
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.
She should hear this too.
- Okay.
- What's wrong?
Renard put out an APB shoot-to-kill on Nick.
- What?
- He's got search warrants.
They will be hitting your shop and your house.
Do not try to stop them.
- Where's Nick?
- We don't know.
And it's better that we don't.
(POUNDING ON DOOR) This is the police!
- Oh, my God, they're here.
- You stay here.
I'm not staying here.
If they're gonna shoot one of us, it's going to be in front of the other.
(POUNDING ON DOOR) We have a warrant!
Nope, that didn't come out right.
All right, all right.
- Open the door, now!
- Just a second.
We have a warrant for the arrest of Nicholas Burkhardt and a warrant for the search of the premises.
Okay, he's not here, man, and my wife is pregnant, so take your hands...
Do not attempt to interfere.
(MEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
No Burkhardt.
Clear!
(ELEVATOR WHIRRING)
I think they're leaving.
There are patterns on this cloth.
Here?
I don't see 'em.
You don't?
They're right here and here and here.
I can't see what you're seeing.
I've seen them before.
Where?
(INTENSE MUSIC)
No sign of Burkhardt yet.
All these locations have been checked and cleared.
A surveillance team has been left at each location.
- What about his vehicle?
- Hasn't been located.
- What about his phone?
- It's no longer operational.
He probably took the SIM card out.
He's somewhere in the city.
Well, by now, he knows it's a full-on manhunt.
And he's not stupid.
He knows how this works.
So he might not even be in the city anymore.
I don't care where he is.
I don't care what it takes.
I want him found!
You chose the wrong side, Sean.
We located Burkhardt's car.
- Where?
- Laurelhurst.
Seal off the area.
Search every house, block by block.
- One-mile perimeter.
- Sir, that's not...
Just do it!
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)
(TRAIN HORN BLOWING)
Oh, my God!
Hey, take anything you want.
- Bud!
- Huh?
- It's me.
- Nick?
Oh, thank God.
You scared the living...
- I need your help.
- Well, yeah.
Of course.
Anything you need.
I'm guessing it's not your refrigerator.
No, but I'm on the run, and I need a place to hide.
Oh, that's why you're here.
Oh.
Yeah, okay, okay.
What do you need me to do?
Do you have a cell phone?
Yeah, yeah.
Right here, right here.
Okay, I need you to make some calls.
Yeah.
What...
This is serious, isn't it?
Renard wants me dead.
They haven't found him.
- Good.
- But they found his car.
- Where?
- Laurelhurst.
Nick know anyone there?
Not that I know of.
(PHONE RINGS)
Griffin.
Hey, Hank.
It's me, Bud.
Yeah, hi.
Look, we're kind of busy, Bud.
Yeah, yeah, I heard.
I kind of got a little problem.
What kind of problem?
I think I had a break-in in my repair shop.
You don't suppose you and Sergeant Wu could come over and check things out?
Because the perp...
That's what you call 'em, right?
- Uh-huh.
- Could still be in there.
I mean, what if he was a wanted man?
Yeah, yeah, that could be dangerous.
We're on our way.
You might want to change your clothes.
They're here, but...
But they took a cab.
Why would they take a cab?
Hey.
You took a cab so you wouldn't be followed, right?
Two cabs, one train, and a little walking.
Not in that order.
- Where is he?
- This way.
They put a tail on you?
- They did.
- We lost it.
We were followed too, but I'm pretty sure we lost them in a bar downtown.
Yeah, they were watching the loft when we left.
You left your car in Laurelhurst.
Last night.
They are searching the hell out of that area.
Well, that should keep 'em busy for a while.
- We contacted HW.
- Is anyone still alive?
Not here in Portland.
But Black Claw was badly compromised here too.
Renard is on his own.
Yeah, make it easier for us to kill him.
Not really.
He's got cops with him day and night.
So what do we do about Nick?
I think he has to leave Portland.
Renard won't stop until you're dead.
Then maybe that's what you have to do.
If I leave Portland, Renard will control everything.
Nick, we can't afford to lose you.
Look, we need to think of someplace safe, and obviously it's not here.
So I hate to say this, Nick, but maybe they're right.
Maybe you got to go.
You should go back to the precinct.
Get back to work like everything's normal.
I don't want you getting drawn into this any more than you already have.
I don't like it, but okay.
We're still searching the Laurelhurst area, but so far, we got nothing.
We've already checked several blocks away from the parked car.
He dumped it there for us to find.
- Captain?
- Yeah.
We've run every incoming and outgoing phone call on Burkhardt's cell phone.
Besides the ones we've already checked, there's only one other number that has any kind of frequency.
What is it?
Probably doesn't mean anything.
We checked it out.
It's a refrigerator repair company owned by a...
- Bud Wurstner.
- Yeah, that's him.
Check his house.
Check his repair shop.
I want teams at both places.
Now!
We're moving teams from here to here.
What do you want us to do when they're in place?
in's.
I don't like the look of that.
How do we stop that son of a bitch?
There's always a bullet.
I'm sort of half joking.
I'm sort of half laughing.
Something's going on.
That something's coming at us.
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)
I know you know where Burkhardt is.
I will find him, and if either one of you gets in my way,
I'm coming for you next.
And we won't be hard to find.
If he finds Nick... (CELL PHONE RINGING)
They're not gonna be bringing him in.
Renard wants uniforms to do his killing for him.
Griffin.
Where?
Yeah, white female body.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I got it.
Got a body ID'd as Rachel Wood.
Rachel Wood?
Yeah, I think you should come with me on this one.
We need to be watching our backs for the time being.
I mean, we could take you in our car, but if they're watching us, they're watching our car.
Why don't you just steal one?
'Cause there's a risk in that too.
- What about Bud?
- Wait, what?
What... what... what about me?
Your truck.
You're off the grid.
Mm, for now.
Any chance we can see what vehicles the police are tracking?
Whatever car they put a BOLO on should be in the system.
Can you get into the system?
If I access it, they'll know.
Wu could help, but somebody else is gonna have to make that call.
I'll call Wu.
Nobody can track my phone.
Do you know what these mean?
No.
When I was with Monroe and Rosalee,
I touched one of the Black Claw bodies.
Oh, yeah, right.
That was fun.
First time I've ever seen a death grip from a dead guy.
I saw these symbols on his face when I was there... and also on the cloth.
Maybe there was more on that cloth than we could see.
Do you still have the stick with you?
Yes.
I'm not sure you should be carrying it all the time.
Miss Wood's coworker grew concerned when he couldn't reach her.
He came over and discovered this.
All right.
Bring in CSU.
Get this whole place fingerprinted.
She was Renard's campaign PR person.
Yeah.
When you're murdered in bed, it's usually by someone you know.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)
274, go ahead.
This is Unit 274, near the corner of Marks and Milwaukee.
Just completed a drive-by.
There's one truck parked in front.
Belongs to the company.
No sign of the suspect.
No activity at the exterior of the premises.
We're gonna have to send somebody in.
This is not good.
There are bolos out on Monroe and Rosalee's cars, your car and mine...
And Bud's.
Bud's on the list?
Yup, and the BOLO just came back on his truck.
It's at his shop.
Son of a bitch.
We need to get Nick out of there now.
Call Trubel.
On it.
(DOORBELL BUZZES)
Oh, jeez!
Oh, jeez.
S-s-somebody's here.
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I...
Just calm down.
Probably just a customer.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Why don't you go find out what they want?
Right, right.
Business as usual.
Okay.
Wu.
Okay.
Yeah, I'll put you on speaker.
They know about Bud.
They put a BOLO out on his truck.
- It's in front of his shop.
- They're watching it, Nick.
You got to get out of there now.
- Got it, thanks.
- Check in with you when we can.
I'm gonna find out if Tactical's making a move.
- Check with Franco.
- Yup.
Well, looks clear.
- Oh, I hate that.
- What?
Oh, you know, people coming in here with a problem, asking me how much it's gonna cost to repair the refrigerator, and they don't even know what kind of refrigerator they got.
Bud, I don't think that was a customer.
That was a cop.
- Oh, God.
- They're watching the shop.
Nick, you got to get out of here, now.
We need a diversion.
If they think I'm in here, they're gonna send in a SERT team.
- Bud.
- Huh?
Back your truck into the loading bay.
Help him load in a freezer.
- Why?
- So they think you're in it.
- Bud.
- Wh-what?
You're the diversion.
Right, right, right.
They follow me.
Hey, you could fit in that one if you were gonna fit in one.
I haven't fixed it yet, but...
But I guess that doesn't matter right now.
- I don't see anybody.
- You won't.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
Franco.
Hey, it's Wu.
Where are you?
Captain ordered me not to talk to you guys.
Captain's out of control.
Seems like, but he's still got rank.
I got to ask you something.
Drew, you're putting me in a tough spot here.
Okay, then you don't need to.
I'm gonna give you an address.
If that's where you are, don't say anything.
4046 Marks.
Thanks.
(LINE BEEPS)
SERT team's been ordered to Bud's shop.
Franco's there.
It's going down.
What the hell are we gonna do?
Wish I knew.
We ran the fingerprints from the Rachel Wood apartment.
This is where it gets a little awkward.
Well, that's why I brought it up personally.
What kind of awkward are we talking about?
Captain Renard's fingerprints are all over that place.
I know she was working on his campaign, but I think she was working on something else.
All right.
(GRUNTING)
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Okay. (GRUNTING)
(TIRES SQUEALING)
(INTENSE MUSIC)
Suspect's vehicle just pulled into the loading bay.
They loaded in a freezer big enough to hold a man.
They're getting ready to go.
Get in position.
Nick!
Nick!
We're too late.
They're surrounding the place.
We're all gonna die!
All clear.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Isn't there something you can do?
I can try.
- Eve!
- Oh!
I'm so sorry.
We're in position, sir.
Take them down.
Tonight the struggle for live starts with the Knockouts!
At this stage, the artists will make the choice of which song to sing.
"My Church" do Maren Morris.
- I love this song.
- It's full of words.
Don't let me downnnnn.
Getting more intense with the individual training from our coaches
Sometimes, how emotional you get can derail the performance.
I want you to take the intensity and put full force.
Bring it on.
I was singing, but I was not feeling.
I want you from the real place
Knockouts have a lot of pressure, but I need to see who is ready pro live, and who is not.
And for the 1st time ...
You will watch each other's test.
- Next victim!
- You are professional how to cause heart attack.
It is intimidating because TSoul is like a unicorn.
It is.
The knockouts are the most competitive in history.
The artists hope to represent their mentors
Classifiers in Live ...
Thank you, God, for letting me witness it.
You come here and make a Grammy performance.
I get chills.
You are a new species which had not yet seen.
Or expect to prove another mentor they deserve to be ...
America, get ready ...
The biggest night of knockouts is starting!
Boys, boys, boys!
- They felt our lack?
- Wow!
Hello guys!
See us.
We are ...
- We do not know.
- We are a group!
Me and Blake are combining,
I dress well and he dresses badly.
But see, he's got the button
- on the jacket.
Beautiful.
- Thank you, Alicia.
- You're welcome.
- Let the Knockouts!
While the mentors are accommodated, we will see the first knockout of Alicia Team.
I put Chris and Quizz together because both have this soul vibe , R B.
Chris has the power to reach, and Quizz is innocence that is genuine.
They have much to learn from each other.
- I want the first hug.
- Quizz Hi!
She just left the best for last.
- How are you doing?
- And your family?
Your bride?
It goes well.
It has all this way.
How is your family?
It has a new baby in the area?
I have a new baby brother!
His name is
Courtney DeMarcus Jai Swanigan Jr.
We'll do things differently.
I'll start with Chris.
Quizz, you watch Chris and our interaction, then exchanged and you watch Quizz.
We give a little more intensity.
Well, are you ready?
Big brother and little brother.
I am the youngest among seven brothers, grow has been very difficult.
I grew up in a house that had four rooms,
We never counted the bathroom because it never worked.
Finalmente estou no The Voice,
It was a moment of relief.
By Team Alicia, Chris Blue!
Alicia Keys was destined to be my mentor.
Being under his leadership is the best thing in the world.
I want her to know believe me it was the right decision.
In the hearings, I said that someone was waiting for me.
Nobody can push me, they were upset.
I'm regretting much about it.
I know how to sleep without anything down.
That is why it is important.
I have to win this knockout.
I have to win.
For the knockout, I chose "Superstition" of Stevie Wonder.
I can see myself as an artist soul and pop, then "Superstition" was perfect.
After seeing Chris, I'm a little nervous.
It has a great presence,
It is older than me, has experience.
I feel that means I'll have to work hard.
It was good, it was great.
The only thing is that you never miss ... has a lot going on!
In the second verse, she did not yield to decrease a little,
It got a little rough to remember people you're beyond that.
Would be crazy!
If you want the time to show everything you can do, the space is all yours!
"Superstition" has an energy, but it has too much to compete.
His challenge is to use the space.
Musically and vocally dance in a way that it is quite natural.
I have to win this knockout, because me and my girlfriend want to get married in July, and I want her to feel safe.
Being in The Voice is more than a dream.
Ok, Quizz, we are ready for you.
I'm just kidding.
- Just kidding!
- I know I'm short.
- I'm so small. -.
No.
You're perfect.
Its height is perfect.
As an artist, mix styles like pop, soul, R B .
It is very important to win this knockout.
I am 13 years old.
We never had anyone with 13 years.
Since I am the youngest of all seasons,
I have to push myself further than the older, because they have more experience.
It takes a lot of commitment, but I know I can face the big dogs.
For the knockout, I chose "Chains", Nick Jonas.
13 years, I have some insecurities,
They are as chains, and I'm trying to free myself.
I have to face this guy?
The boy is amazing.
I have to be ready for it.
- I was excellent.
- It was mind-blowing.
You have to stretch.
I want you to stretch ...
If you can...
You do not do this every second, but I want the audience to be impressed, like ...
"Wow, this kid is ..."
- Are you understanding?
- Yes ma'am.
He's getting better, and every time an idea haul it is time.
- That's exactly.
- Yes ma'am.
Thank you.
As sente, Chris?
I have work to do.
To decide who will win the knockout,
I have to assess who evolved more.
Like, I'll enjoy watching most?
difficult decisions ahead.
Help me!
Cantando "Superstition", aqui est Chris Blue.
I want you all clapping!

Singing "Chains", here's Quizz Swaningan.
With her wine-stained lips
Yeah, she's nothing but trouble
Cold to the touch
But she's warm as a devil
I gave her my heart
But she wanted my soul
Oh, no
She takes till I break

Applause for Chris and Quizz!
Alicia Keys, who Knockout!
- Help!
- two incredible performances.
Impressive.
Gwen Stefani, what do you think?
Chris, I think I'm the biggest fan you've ever had, because you are everything I love.
What I like most is the way you do ...
It's just ...
Every time it's like ... incredible.
What the hell was that?
It's what he does!
I do not know how to do it.
It's too good and ...
I honestly do not believe you're human and to sing that way.
You are magical.
But Quizz is unfolding and spins you made were lovely and it was a deep, full sound you had not shown before and I had no idea you had.
You are also magical.
Thank you, mentor.
I appreciate it.
Adam.
Quizz had a trial by fire today.
Because you have only 13 years.
I'll tell you what would have happened to me.
I would have peed my pants and run out the door screaming since Chris razed.
But you came and had a responsibility superhuman.
Congratulations.
So, Chris, you were Chris.
It is a phenomenon.
I do not know how you move ...
I will not try to do the same,
I tried.
because it will not be a good idea.
- But ...
- I take that back.
Now I can not.
It is on TV forever.
You arrived in the competition and ...
Amazing what you do.
Thank you, Adam.
Blake.
If I am not wrong, you were the last artist in the hearings.
It's insane.
And I sent a message after his hearing to Gwen and pro Adam.
Not sent to Alicia, because she must find it strange I have her number ...
Which is understandable.
It's funny because it's true.
I was crazy, thinking, "can you believe it?"
We do not even ...
This guy will win The Voice.
It is documented.
I will show the message.
I have not forgotten you, Quizz.
The important thing about you is not have 13 years, but at this point of its development
It is crucial you have a mentor, and she is Alicia Keys.
What a chance for you.
And a great opportunity for her working with this boy and help you on the path that it deserves.
This was very manipulative.
It's kind :, "I think Chris can win, but Alicia, you will leave the young Chris? "
- It is true.
- How do you sleep at night, man?
Alicia, the final decision is yours.
Quizz, you are very special.
I am amazed to see who you will become.
You are the youngest who have participated in the program and not without reason.
I do not think any of us here would be able to do what you did earlier.
You're amazing, honestly, really.
Really.
On the other hand, Chris, waited for you.
I could not believe someone like you
He returned to testify.
You've become a wild animal!
I've never seen something like that.
Was very good.
It's great to see him rampant, fearless and without fear.
I'm very proud of you.
- I love you, man.
- Hard decision.
I'm sorry, Alicia.
Who wins the knockout?
The winner of the knockout ... is Chris.
Congratulations, Chris!
This means that you will sing in the Classifiers Live.
It was very difficult, but Chris is something unbelievable.
He drops this whole building, like the Incredible Hulk.
That's it man!
Let's move on!
It has the hoarseness of a rocker and that soul R B.
But I could also sing great pop songs.
There are no boundaries for him.
I'll pras live stage ?
!
That's how I feel it, man!
We can do this now?
I'm ready to sing!
Mentors, noting that Quizz is available for theft.
Quizz, you mean something for your mentor?
Now is the time.
I love you so much and I want to thank you for the opportunity.
Ladies and gentlemen, applause for Quizz Swanigan.
You're not kidding, Quizz.
We have a theft in the Knockouts!
It is by Quizz!
It was easy to choose the Quizz.
It is a boy of 13 years which has very gift.
It is very talented.
- You were great!
- Thank you very much.
It was great, man.
Congratulations!
That boy gave his all.
He worked hard.
We are very proud of it.
Our family is happy and we can not wait to win it all.
Also can not wait!
So happy that I will win!
I did not know this would happen today.
What is amazing in this program.
- We will work hard.
- Yes!
- See you later.
- Thank you.
God bless her.
Alicia is the one that has a vacant place in the team.
And here comes a guy who, I believe, can win the show.
I even sent message to Adam.
I still have it saved in the phone.
- I think that message.
- I know.
I remember her.
Next, our mentors prepare their teams ...
Every word counts.
- It is a compilation.
- It's kind of tune,
- because you're forcing.
- I want to hear the "nerve".
for the most competitive knockouts in history.

We came back with the Knockouts, at Universal Studios, Hollywood.
Everyone stretching.
Blake never lengthened in life.
If Blake try to stretch, will have back pain.
Namaste , folks.
- What?
- Namaste .
While Adam prepares mentally, we see the double of their knockout.
Autumn and Hanna have a lot of strength, but I can not have two singers occupying the same space.
We have to be selective with who'll take you to sing live.
Autumn e Hanna!
Cumprimentarei a novata primeiro.
- She is new to the team.
- Thanks!
- How are you?
- Good!
Is that you?
We met.
We have a past!
Hanna is literally the sweetest person.
What she ever does is to let you fool.
Autumn Alicia stole the team.
It's a great singer.
She still has a long journey here.
Autumn, you go first.
So Hanna, sit down.
My mother alone raised me.
She showed me how to live life as a young woman.
After participating in a group of girls and almost succeed,
I pulled back and let the music back,
I started to teach English and to be skating coach.
Alicia!
Come here!
Being with Alicia was fabulous.
During the duels, I was going home.
We have two Robbery!
To participate in the Team Adam
It is a great blessing.
I did not think I would have another chance in music.
This may be the last.
I have to give my best.
For knockouts, chose "Respect" by Aretha Franklin.
My genre is a little soul with a bit of R B.
This song is about how a woman should be treated.
I will stage the demand a little respect!
- Great.
- Thanks.
Of course, do not need help with the beat and the rhythm.
Not force much hoarseness.
You have a great voice, you do not need to force it.
I want you to take the intensity of growls
- and put in full force.
- It's all right.
When you do...
Try not to make those curves, as in ...
Bring it on.
You Aretha now.
This song is difficult.
It Aretha, and is his most famous song.
But his work ethic is strong, then it can go well.
One of the things that makes me more nervous singing against Autumn is the stage presence she has to perform.
She is amazing, and I really need to do my best.
Much better!
The part of the growl was perfect.
I like the way the set.
- Next victim!
- It's all right.
How will I compete with Aretha Franklin?
Well, you will not.
You will do your part and let me handle the competition.
Knockout win that would be so amazing.
I frequent the school of Arts in Orange County, but this is one of the greatest things I've ever done.
I could barely follow singing when Adam turned.
You kind of forgot he was singing.
And in the end, I thought
It was your best moment in the entire presentation.
- Hanna Eyre!
- During this experience,
Adam was there with me, and I feel more confident in each presentation.
I chose "Bleeding Love" by Leona Lewis.
I see myself as an R B artist and pop.
This music will work just fine for me, because it is different than it sang here in the program.
It's emotional.
It is more intense.
I've already beat Aretha Franklin to advance.
So I need just to make sure I'm doing everything.
Cero, you are a very talented person ... and this is a very simple song.
Make sure it looks good.
Save some air.
You do not want to embellish too much, because you lose some people.
Formulate a good plan for what you want.
When I heard her sing, I thrilled me.
I cringed whole.
It was almost, "Go Hanna!"
I need to improve my game plan.
It has to do with the rhythm.
And those 3 huge notes, I want to go but try to be in your mind tuned.
You have a big voice, but it's a bit out of tune.
Hanna has a lot of potential.
If it continues like this and keep improving, the sky is the limit.
You two are so good.
- Thanks!
- Very good.
Hug group.
I do not know who will choose.
Both have much to offer.
I think it will be a great knockout.
Com "Respect", Autumn Turner.
What you want
Baby, I got it
What you need
You know I got it
And all I'm askin'

Hey, baby

R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Take care, TCB
- So amazing!
- Drop all, girl!
@GrupoSubVoice
We are back!
Agora, cantando "Bleeding Love", Hanna Eyre.
Closed off from love
I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough
And it was all in vain
Time starts to pass
Before you know it you're frozen
But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open, and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open
I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein I keep on closing
And I
You cut me open
I keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding
Love
- So good!
- Applause for Autumn and Hanna!
- Blake?
- It's so shocking when Hanna, that little girl standing there, suddenly starts singing and you think, "Wow!"
It looked like a Transformer .
You have so much control of his voice.
You have an incredible reach.
Autumn, you did an amazing job with music that is considered somewhat untouchable.
- It was risky for you ...
- Yeah.
But very talented.
I would probably go with Hanna.
Autumn, I really loved the bass in his voice.
Before I think I felt more beauty, and today I heard over the strength of her voice,
- and I loved it.
- Thanks.
And Hanna has been an exponential growth even after these few presentations.
You have such a beautiful voice.
It's not an easy song to sing.
You two were super brave, and showed beautifully who you are.
Thank you, mentor.
Gwen, your comments?
So, Hanna, this was his presentation that I liked to hear.
- It was so good.
- Thank you.
His voice is so intense and rich, and you have much control over it.
And, Autumn, I wanted you so much in my team.
I think there's something really magical about you.
I was somewhat disappointed with the choice of music.
I wanted to hear the kind of album you want to do.
I'd love to hear you sing "Bleeding Love".
I probably would choose to Hanna, because it was unbelievable.
Adam, everything depends on you.
I'm proud of both manage to do what we agreed in the assay.
Hanna, you have only 15 years, and repeat it, it is incredible that with only 15 years you come here and do it all.
And Autumn, you was accurate.
This chorus is unique.
They make us wait 20 minutes before the chorus happen.
And Aretha was a bold choice.
difficult decision, Adam.
Who won the knockout?
Well, I will make my decision based on what I think
I would feel most lacking to go away.
The winner...
This knockout ...
- Is Hanna!
- My God!
Hanna, congratulations!
You advance to
- Thanks!
- the live Classifiers.
Hanna chose because she is young and has a lot of potential.
Keep an eye, it will continue improving and surprising.
You are amazing!
Having Adam Levine believing in me is all!
I wanna cry!
- It was amazing!
I'm proud!
- My God!
- I can not believe!
- You were great!
- Autumn, to say something?
- Adam, thanks for believe me twice.
I am sad to leave, of course, but very happy to have had this experience.
Autumn Turner palms, people!
These were the most disputed knockouts in history!
Autumn is very talented!
I want it to continue in music and follow your heart.
Wow, Hanna is very good!
My God!
To follow...
Most amazing knockouts ...
They make our mentors emocionarem.
You chose a song that I listen to dating.
- Yuck!
- That cute, Gwen!
So I know the song.
Group Sub Voice features ...
Butchers making the best rolls!
Welcome back to the knockouts.
Alicia, her hair is preventing me and Gwen to exchange glances.
You are tying our love.
And now?
It got better?
Now let's see Gwen Team!
- Hi people!
- What's up?
My freshman and my veteran.
- They want to know why the two?
- Must be tights.
- Perhaps the tights ...
- Or the boots.
Down here makes a lot of sense.
I chose Hunter and Johnny as they both sing alternative rock, and it seemed obvious join them.
Here was my first time singing outside the church.
Before the hearings, had married me, and it was the happiest of all days.
Then a flood hit
Louisiana and we lost our home.
Two months later,
I was already on the stage of The Voice singing.
I'm new on Team Gwen because she stole.
Hunter, you touch me a lot when singing.
- Thank you.
- It's amazing!
I got here, and I want to stay with Gwen to the live stage.
In knockouts, I chose "I Want To Know What Love Is"
Foreigner.
My father attended a gospel rock band in the 80s and 90s, called Brother.
Many of their songs
They looked like Foreigner.
It has to do with this song.
Hunter is a great singer.
It has a differential in his voice, which is amazing.
I'm nervous having to face someone like him.
It was great!
I think at times, when you hold the elongated notes, is half stuck, because you're forcing.
Use your abs to force, not your voice, you know?
Seriously, it's too much effort.
If you can relax a little, still be able to get the note.
It helps a lot when you decide not force either.
Something I hate is when stir in classics, but here it was really cool.
He incorporated the personality.
- You are changing a little
- Yes.
the rhythm of the melody.
But I think it updated the music.
- Well, thank you.
- Hello!
- Hunter, you rocked!
- Johnny, want to sing now?
- Of course, it's for now!
- Come on, Johnny!
Ever took!
I've been a band for 13 years.
It is my first time as a solo singer, here in The Voice.
My God!
Goodbye to you!
Team Gwen, Johnny Gates!
I feel and Gwen have a special connection.
Our families are Italian, we both come from bands and she has a solo career.
All this together makes perfeira the mentor to me.
I want to give the best of me, to let Gwen proud to have given me a chance.
- I want to know your music.
- I really want to sing
"Million Reasons", Lady Gaga, for corner 13 years ago, and I have had many reasons to give up.
And for not giving up until I got here.
- Certainly.
- Yes.
- So come on, Johnny Gates.
- Let's start.
This time will be no guitar.
Just me singing.
Of course I'm nervous.
It's something new for me.
Seeing Johnny dropped my file that will be hotly contested.
That was cool!
The power you have, to sing long notes ...
It's amazing!
- I noticed something on you ...
- What?
When you arrive in the highest parts, you do not express in your face what you are singing.
- Got it.
- It's like you sing,
- Yes.
- But do not feel the music.
- If you connect with the letter!
- Yes, I understood.
Johnny has a good sense of music.
And Hunter is a creative guy.
Both are talented and have many chances to advance.
Cantando "I Want To Know What Love Is", Hunter Plake.
I gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older
In my life
There's been heartache and pain
I don't know
If I can face it again
I can't stop now
I've traveled too far
To change this lonely life
I want to know what love is
I want you to show me
I want to feel what love is
I want you to show me
I want you to show me
I want you to show me
I want you to show me
We came back with the 1st night of knockouts.
Agora, com "Million Reasons", Johnny Gates.
You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
Giving me a million reasons to quit the show
Givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons
If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all this worn-out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But, baby, I just need one good one to stay
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needing'?
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But, baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one
When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all this worn-out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But, baby, I just need one good one
To stay
Applause for Hunter and Johnny in a Knockout Team Gwen.
What I'll do?
Friends, good work from you.
Adam Levine, his comments.
Hunter, my ear just met you,
I tried to catch him in duels.
I'm not so cool as Gwen, so ...
- Truth.
- Nobody asked you, okay?
You are so different.
Johnny, you are already an accomplished artist.
It's a great artist.
But Hunter, you hit something that is a little deeper.
I was amazed at the level of thought, creativity and art in what you just did ...
And I reward it with you being the winner of the knockout.
Thank you, mentor.
Blake, wants to help Gwen?
It's always fun to see a presentation of Johnny.
He has stage presence.
And Hunter, being the new guy on the team, sometimes puts you in a difficult situation, but ours!
The man sang a song that everyone knows.
Even I know this song.
- Do you believe that, Alicia?
- I believe.
I Do not.
He honored the original, but still has his music.
You are a new species which we have not seen here.
And that's a good guy thing.
I would say that Hunter won the knockout, if it was me.
Thank you, mentor.
Hunter his former mentor, Alicia.
Good job, Hunter.
I was encouraged to see the piano.
The intimacy that you create in that space
It is not an easy thing to do.
And Johnny, the way he jumps and dance across the stage, remember the way you jump and dance around the stage.
And I like this.
Always I found the like of it.
I think it's an Italian thing.
He is the male version.
You have a strong vocal ability.
I thought it was a great choice of song for you.
So for me, the winner would be Johnny.
Gwen, the decision is yours.
Tell what you think.
It has something positive about you, Johnny.
See you at the moment, which is this trading platform, which is different everything you've done, and you deal with it so well.
And today you have prepared and did a great job.
Very good.
But what makes it so difficult is that,
Hunter, I think I got to know you very quickly in a short time.
And this is the first stage in which it is presented outside the Church.
It's unbelievable.
You got a song
It is on my list of dating.
Eca!
How cute, Gwen.
I said I knew the music.
Seriously, do what he did with the music was very good.
I have no idea what to do.
Not even a little.
Gwen, who won the knockout?
I'm really shaking now.
I know.
Road.
Needless to say, the winner of this knockout ... will be or Hunter.
Congratulations!
You go to Classifiers Live!
Hunter!
- Thank you - was very good.
It was the craziest moment of my life.
- Congratulations, man.
- Thank you.
Gwen heard something in me, and I feel very honored.
I remember Johnny is available for theft.
Johnny, you mean something to your mentor?
I just want to thank you for giving me a chance.
This experience has proven that no matter what happened today, I could continue in music.
Ladies and gentlemen, applaud
Johnny Gates.
All are very good.
Let someone go at this point is very difficult.
Johnny has a great voice.
But Hunter has creativity and it is hard to ignore.
He deserved to win the Knockout.
Damn, that's awful.
The two are so good in their own way.
- IT IS.
- This is sad.
To follow...
Some of the most amazing performances ever seen
Knockouts lead to new heights.
Bruce Lee appeared.
I cringed.
This is very, very challenging.
Sorry, I'm being honest.
This is a theft!
We are back.
Welcome to the good team.
Thank you for having me.
The other three are the villains.
We're the good guys.
This will be ...
I'm not happy about it.
- Believe me, I also am not.
- We lived together!
- Oh really?
- Yes!
Cruel, Blake.
Cruel.
Joined Casi and Felicia because even though one country and pop , both are powerful singers in my team.
What will you sing?
"My Church", de Maren Morris.
Love this song.
Will play too?
I'll try.
Unless you do not like.
I think I'll love it.
It's great to be able to sing a song country Current and show all the different tones of my voice.
When I was 17,
I formed a rock band and we played on the Warped Tour.
I think that's how I learned to introduce myself.
But I found I need to be with the country .
A long time ago I want to shout: "I'm on Team Blake."
That!
Almost Joy!
Being in this huge stage ...
The winner of the duel is the Casi.
It is surreal to finally have arrived where I try since I was five years.
I love the choice of Casi because it gives her the chance to consolidate the fact that it is a bolder version of an artist country .
Casi is amazing.
She sings and he shakes his head, like, "That's it."
So I have to give my best.
She's good, Felicia.
You are professional how to cause heart attack.
When you use the yodeling, it is because you
You think you can not reach the note?
I did this because I used to play four hours a day and I thought, "I will not reach the note is not necessary"
Well, that part ...
- Is a building.
- Yes.
When you break this energy, it withered.
If you get hit with full voice,
It would be more powerful that way.
As a singer, you learn tricks as not reach high notes and destroy his voice for the night, or worse, by the week.
Casi has some of these habits you need to lose while in the program.
We can bring a bottle of whiskey or something?
Drink plenty of water.
The only time I drink water is when I sing.
Maybe I should try some water these days.
Agora podemos chamar a novata.
I have much to learn here then, come and we start singing.
Felicia stole because I thought she had a mountain impossible to climb against Quizz in Duel.
I think she did an equally amazing job.
I thought she still deserved a place in the program.
The Frosty even spoke, there is no reason for her to win the program.
I'm excited to start the journey with Team Blake.
After all I've been through with cancer, receive this opportunity was my best gift.
- O que vai cantar?
- "My Heart Will Go On"
Cline Dion. "Titanic" I'll have my moment.
Celine Dion?
No pressure.
She is one of the greatest singers since the beginning of time.
It's a lot of responsibility.
This song makes me think of my grandmother.
She passed away.
Funny that my grandmother was called Shirley Temple.
She was a cabaret singer and loved the great voices.
So when I sing, I always want to be the high point because my grandmother was.
Not only am I intimidated by singing against Felicia.
If you perform this song perfectly, is kind, large microphone.
Finished.
That was amazing.
I'm here crying, singing along, vibrating.
There is much more in you and your ability than what we have seen so far.
Was very good.
But the moment they know you sing this song, and all these sequences in it, they will immediately wait for these moments.
I felt that you lost a little energy.
You need to keep your breath.
When the note below, the vibrato is a bit ...
I love the range of Felicia.
I love his passion.
If she can use these points and keep quiet,
It will be hard to beat it.
You make me nervous and my heart beats fast.
Which is!
It is the 1st time working with Blake and I feel like I'm hanging by a thread and I need to prove I'm good.
It's bad for me.
It's called Knockout for a reason.
Then destroying the roof of that place.
That's what you should do as singers.
Cantando "My Church", essa Casi Joy.
I've cussed on a Sunday
I've cheated, and I've lied
I've fallen down from grace
A few too many times
But I find holy redemption
When I put this car in drive
I roll the windows down
And turn up the dial
So, can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost
Running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singing every single word
Yeah I guess that's my church
When Hank brings the sermon
And Cash leads the choir
It gets my cold Cold heart burning
Hotter than a ring of fire
When this wonderful world Gets heavy
And I need to find my escape
I keep the wheels rolling
Radio scrolling
Till my sins wash away
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost
Running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singing every single verse
Yeah I guess that's my church
Yeah I guess that's my church
Yeah I guess that's my church
We're back with the Knockouts.
E agora, com "My Heart Will Go On"
this is Felicia Temple.
Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Near, far
Wherever you are
I believe in my heart and
My heart will go on
And on
You're here
There's nothing I fear
And I know
That my heart will go on
We'll stay
Forever this way
You are safe in my heart and
My heart will go on
And on
And on
Casi applaud and Felicia, folks!
Why put them together?
I know, right?
Blake Shelton, you will have a difficult decision to follow.
Let's start with Mrs. Alicia Keys.
What was it that made him put you two together?
Do not know.
My team is so good that all double has this dynamic.
Anyway, Casi, I thought I had much control from instructing the audience to clap to the note at the end which was very overwhelming.
- Thanks.
- Beautiful work.
Felicia, I had goose bumps on the arm while singing.
And it was Cline Dion.
Like, our.
I know.
Gwen?
Casi, I felt that you were like, "I'll be there and I know exactly what to do.
And I know exactly how to do it "
Everyone should learn from their confidence.
Felicia, I was shocked because
It is a well-known and great music.
- IT IS.
- I feared for you.
But you were unbelievable today.
I also cringed.
My chin was down all the time.
I was like, "Wow!"
The two did an amazing job.
Thank you, mentor.
Adam.
So Casi, I'm a big fan of yours.
But Felicia, listen to the introduction of this song
It is to hear her say,
"Look, I'll climb Mount Everest.
Pay attention."
And you think, "No, she will not."
But you could, and it was amazing.
I probably still would choose the Casi.
But the courage of the award goes to you today.
I'll start with you, Felicia.
This was an outstanding presentation for you.
Every time I sing, it's amazing.
It is the next level.
And that's why you stole.
And you proved now.
Congratulations.
Was very good.
Casi, the notes you hit him with full voice, on the spot, full of confidence, and you keep doing it every time you go onstage.
There's no stopping Casi Joy.
Why I joined them two?
Tell me.
I wanted to be surprised at his idiocy but unfortunately I'm not.
2003 called and they want the mohawk back.
You need to go back there.
Blake, this is difficult friend.
Who won the knockout?
I guess...
The winner of this knockout is the Casi.
Casi Joy advances to Classifiers Live, representing Team Blake.
I am, frankly, enough to have gain surprise.
But I am very excited about the live stages.
I can not wait to call my mom.
Felicia, to say something to your mentor?
Thank you for stealing me.
It was a great pleasure.
By this time last year, I was in chemotherapy, and now, I am cancer free.
This was the best experience of my entire life.
Ladies and gentlemen, let's give it to Felicia Temple.
These artists are all no match to match.
Both of these girls gave their best, but Casi is the old.
It has a youthful enthusiasm for their presentations.
I'm already thinking about the music that it needs to move forward.
Felicia did a great presentation, but I prefer the more Casi, it's kind of eccentric, but the best way.
The Casi these is to keep an eye.
I do not care what they say.
This mohawk is funny!
Never accept advice fashion and hair salt and pepper .
We are back.
You can not make fun of that sweater.
I know you're trying, but there is nothing.
Who has the winning team?
I have the winning team right now.
But I almost always have.
So who do you think you have the 2nd best?
Let's check the next match Adam Team.
I pareei Johnny against Josh because they are my rock.
I want to see who can outdo the other here.
What song will sing, man?
Vou cantar "Statesboro Blues" dos Allman Brothers.
The Allmans are the best.
I play it with my band, so I thought I honor her.
The name of my band is Johnny Hayes and Loveseats.
It is a rock band and soul .
We had been playing almost every weekend.
Last year, I could not turn a chair, then I returned.
I am very happy not to have given up.
Just I wish my wife thought it was fine.
- This is our music.
- It is cute.
- Johnny Hayes!
- My wife encouraged me a continuar no The Voice.
I want to give it all I can give.
Johnny Hayes, "Statesboro Blues"
It has been on 11 all the time.
This is hard.
But he has this power and this charisma.
Only one detail.
I want to hear the "nerve".
So breathe deeper.
In music blues I tend to be lazy in the enunciation, so I need to do it right.
Take the opportunity to use all the space you have.
Use the four corners of the stage.
Let's do one more time.
Hold the note.
I love it when risks and hits the note.
This is how you sing blues !
Compete with Johnny has been painful.
It has a presence so strong.
And he has done it longer than me.
Hopefully, I can show that I am able to challenge.
So ...
The kid has a cool hair.
I mean, look at this.
It's like...
- Insane.
- It's amazing.
As a child, I wanted to be a rockstar .
And it will be a rockstar , have to have big hair.
Before The Voice, I was living in Glendale, Arizona, playing in restaurants and bars.
Being in a program like this being so young is incredible.
Josh is a rocker nerd .
I was a rocker nerd , I see Josh.
I know who it is at its core.
My favorite band of the 90's Soundgarden!
"Superunkown" is the best CD ever!
"Badmotorfinger"!
f de "Screaming Life/Fopp"?
We are in a record store, by chance ?
!
Josh West!
Being in The Voice, I definitely grew up,
I progressed and became a better artist.
I chose "Carry On Wayward Son", Kansas.
This is the first real rock music I caught.
This is so radical!
are not happy this is happening here?
Break it all!
I love watching him perform, but I do not want to be in 11 all the time.
The voice of Josh is quite sharp.
It has that whole rock Kansas, Boston, 70.
The guy has power and charisma, but I think it's important pro Josh going to grow up to 11.
I am grateful to Adam.
He always has tips that take the song to another level, and I want to prove to him
I should stay in your team.
Josh is a rocker.
Man, I did not sing like him when I was 18.
I need to make sure I can handle it.
I can not wait to see what happens.
Both of these guys keep surprising me and impressing me.
This knockout will be very difficult.
Decision super hard.
Sim, Johnny e Josh!
Johnny e Josh!
Battle of the vibrations.
Com "Statesboro Blues", Johnny Hayes.
Wake up, Mama
Turn your lamp down low
Wake up, Mama
Turn your lamp down low
You know, I say you got no nerve, baby
To turn Uncle Johnny from you door
Oh, well, I woke up this morning
Yeah, I had them Statesboro Blues
Come on.
I said I woke up this morning, baby
Had them Statesboro Blues
You know
And I looked over in the corner, baby
Grandpa seemed to have them too, you know
I said my mama died and left me
My papa died and left me
I ain't good-looking, baby
Want someone sweet and kind I'm goin' to the country
Baby, do you want to go?
If you can't make it, baby
Your sister Lucille said she wanna go
And I'm sure gonna take her
- Vamos I.
Wake up, Mama
Turn your lamp down low
Oh, wake up, Mama
Turn your lamp down low
Come on guys.
I see you got no nerve, baby
To turn Uncle Johnny from your door, you know
I see you got no nerve, baby
To turn Uncle Johnny from your door
We are back.
E agora, Josh West com "Carry On Wayward Son".
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high
Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
But I can hear them say
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more No!
Carry on You will always remember
Carry on Nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
Surely heaven waits for you
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
Applause to Jonnhy and Josh!
Great Knockout, Adam.
- Blake, help him.
- It will be difficult pro Adam!
Jonnhy his voice has extension and you have a great stage presence.
You do not stop.
You tried to place the microphone on the stand, but refused.
I'll put it.
No, no you're not!
It's fun to watch him perform.
So Bruce Lee comes, and literally, he kills a fly with a kick.
- Right in the middle of the stage.
- You're such an idiot.
The vocals were another level.
Because of Chuck Norris movement, and what happened next, I would choose Josh.
Thank you, mentor.
Alicia.
- Do not understand you.
- Neither do I understand what he says.
Has a dead fly there, he jumped up and killed.
Johnny, did an amazing job.
I love their energy, the sound of your voice, you work well on stage.
Josh, you're 18.
There is a lot to learn, but I was taken by you.
Especially as you let go.
I do not think Adam needs help.
Everyone needs less the Adam.
- Need?
- He knows everything, you do not need.
Josh, it's almost impossible to sing this song.
It's insane.
- I can not.
- It was amazing.
I want you and Blake know,
I did the same kick in the past.
So...
Johnny, you're natural on stage.
You hold us and we have to remember that sings.
There is a lot going personality.
But it is hard to resist, want to see a 18 year old with such an unusual approach, a voice rock.
It makes me curious.
I would say, "Let's Josh!
I want more!"
Do not know...
Johnny returned after not turn a chair.
This is already a success.
You have improved and I knew he would.
I'm glad that happens in my team.
Josh, this song is one of the most difficult for a man.
I do not know how he managed.
It was all in full voice.
Not used falsetto!
Like ... what madness.
You are insane.
This is hard, but I have to choose.
The winner of the knockout ...
The winner of the knockout ... is Josh.
Josh, congratulations, you go Classifiers.
He has a pure tone of voice.
It is always strong and accurate.
I had to reward his audacity to sing a song so hard and raze.
I'm excited to go Classifiers.
It is a journey of discovery for him.
- I love watching him flourish.
- Thanks, Dad.
Mentors, Johnny can be stolen.
Johnny, that is something to mentor?
Thanks for the chance.
From the bottom of my heart.
Aplausos ao Johnny Rayes.
Leave Johnny was not easy.
I like him.
You can purchase today's music on iTunes, or hear them in the Apple Music.
- Then ...
- What does this have to do with you?
the final double of the night!
Do not disappoint me!
I quit!
We have a theft!
We're back to the knockouts.
- Hi Hello.
- Welcome to my team!
- Thank you for saving me.
Ashley want to mix country and soul .
Lilli tem natural.
Both have a strong approach.
I think it makes sense to be together.
How is your father?
Sometimes good, others bad.
- I love you.
- Me too.
My father has Alzheimer .
This is hard.
The man who took care of you, needs care now.
childhood dreams come true.
Music country is sacred.
There is much soul within you.
I choose the Blake.
We have a theft!
Blake started the team, but I am the only country in Alicia Team.
Music soul and country belong together.
I want to discover more of who you want to be.
I can learn from it to be more daring.
I'm excited for it.
For my knockout round I'm singing "Fancy" by Reba McEntire.
The original version has a country vibe and soul .
That's really me.
See Ashley rehearse ...
Our ...
She has a voice that covers the whole environment.
I pressed.
Legal!
It is complicated, there are many words.
They are all important.
All the excitement has to be there.
It's challenging.
It has a little pain there, her mother knew that there was no other choice.
It's sad.
She said:
Do not disappoint me!
Wow, that's heavy!
You have to decide how you feel.
It seems that you carry the pain of the world.
Doing all the family.
Having Alicia trying to make me identify,
It was quite powerful.
Things with my father ...
This is my life.
I will work hard for everything.
It is a deep, painful, exposed song.
You have to work a lot, but started well.
How are you?
- What song!
- What voice, girl!
Insane!
Before the hearings, I worked in a restaurant.
Always looking for a show.
Suddenly I heard people screaming and cheering,
I thought, "God, I got!"
What is going on?
I want to show that it was right to believe me.
- Lilli can win.
- I love it.
Escolhi "Tear Dry on their Own" da Amy Winehouse.
It is influenced by musicians jazz old.
She managed to modernize it.
That's how I like to sing too.
Lilli's voice is impeccable.
It's intimidating to know that I will face it.
What does this have to do with you?
I've been through something that ends.
You have to rebuild.
Music is about having heartbroken.
I identify because it happened to me.
I've been left behind.
You have to see how each verse resonates in you.
It's a great song, but it is challenging.
You can sing beautifully and did not spend emotion.
Maybe a little slower.
You can leave as if drunk.
It will also help.
Must resonate ...
I have to show everything.
I can not shut myself.
It was much better.
A million times better.
This is hard.
Both have strong vocals.
And unique styles.
Let's see who shows up.
I will choose this.
- God!
- How hard!
Com "Fancy", Ashley Levin.
I remember it all very well looking back
Was the summer I turned 18
We lived in a one-room, rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least, we were hard-pressed
Mama spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancing dress
She handed me a heart-shaped locket that said
"To thine own self be true"
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high-heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talking
Asking:
"Mama, what do I do?"
She said: "Just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy,
They'll be nice to you"
She said:
"Here's your one chance, Fancy,
Don't let me down"
She said:
"Here's your one chance, Fancy,
Don't let me down.
Lord, forgive me for what I do
If you want out, then it's up to you
Now don't let me down now, girl
Your mama's gonna move you uptown"
It wasn't long after a benevolent man
Took me in off the streets
And one week later, I was pouring his tea
In a five-room hotel suite
Oh, I charmed a king, a congressman
An occasional aristocrat
And now I got me a Georgia mansion
And an elegant New York townhouse flat
And I ain't done bad, no
"Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do
If you want out, well, it's up to you
Don't let me down, girl
Your mama's gonna move you uptown
No, don't let me down, your mama's gonna move up uptown"
Thanks.
We are back.
Agora, cantando "Tears Dry On Their Own",
Lilli Passero.
All I can ever be to you
Is a darkness that we knew
And this regret I've got accustomed to
Once it was so right
When we were at our height
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
I knew I hadn't met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got attached
It's my responsibility
You don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away, I have no capacity
He, he walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I am grown
And in your way, my blue shade
My tears dry on their own
So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above a blaze
He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way, my blue shade
My tears dry on their own
Wish I could say no regrets
No emotional debt
'Cause as we kiss goodbye, the sun sets
So we are history
The shadow covers me
The sky above a blaze that only lovers see
He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I am grown
And in your way, my deep shade
My tears dry on their own
My tears dry
Own
Applause for Ashley and Lilli, folks!
Good job.
Gwen Stefani, what do you think?
Ashley, her voice is so familiar.
- Thanks.
- It's so strong and confident.
It is so rich, and it is beautiful.
And Lilli, you caught this mood music ...
It's so theatrical.
I love this song...
And you did what was necessary, I found very beautiful.
His voice is very strong.
Sincerely, swear to you, Alicia, this is a really hard pairing.
I'm so sorry.
I do not ...
I'm being sincere.
- I do not know what to say.
- I know.
If you had to choose, I think I'd go with Ashley.
Thanks.
The difference between them is that Ashley
It has evolved a lot and soon, amazing.
Lilli, when I saw his last performance
I thought "this girl can win."
I'd go with Lilli.
The way you behave is champion of The Voice.
Right.
Thank you, Adam.
Blake?
The interesting thing Ashley is a blast to perform.
Lilli is already more serene, calm and composed.
She does what she was born to do, it seems.
If fits to me, I would also go with Lilli.
Thanks, Blake.
Alicia, the final decision is yours.
I quit!
This is too hard!
I'm still getting to know Ashley.
Lilli, when I heard him in the hearings, you have something that I understand deeply!
Ashley, this song is so complex.
So many words and all are important!
We talk a lot about it.
It is difficult to follow this pace, sing this song about complex super humans.
But you could.
Lilli, I know what we can do!
You give the impression that it is already an artist ready.
I say that you are "pre-cooked".
It's like that with you.
Have you ever come this way, as a charming snakes,
- it's very cool!
- Difficult decision, Alicia.
Who won this Knockout?
Sure.
Sure!
I have to choose ...
I knew today would be difficult for me.
The winner of this knockout ...
It's Ashley.
Ashley, congratulations.
You are in Classifiers.
I do not think I'm in Live Programs!
I'm still in the team Alicia and I'm so excited!
Ashley chose because she wants to mix country and soul , and I feel I can help a lot of it!
Mentors, Lilli can be stolen.
We have a theft!
Adam Levine Rouba a Lilli da Alicia!
O Blake Shelton entra na parada!
2 are now mentors.
Adam, why do you want to Lilli?
Nor do I believe that this is happening,
I found it really the last time I saw you sing, you can win.
I think you have the necessary and I want you on my team please!
I also think you can win.
And this is the 2nd time I turn to you.
- Adam did not turn the hearings.
- Do not fall for it!
I believe in you from the 1st day.
Please do not fall for it to "come to you 10 years ago."
- For no matter ...
- It yes!
No matter not.
If you think what mentor believes in you from the beginning ...
Does not matter!
What matters is who believes in you to the end!
By the way, David Beckham wants hairstyle back!
It's not how it starts, is how it ends!
You are mine, do not fall on his bullshit.
Thank you, mentor.
Lilli is with you!
Who will be your new mentor?
Adam or Blake?
Come on, Lilli!
- I choose Adam.
- That!
Adam rouba Lilli Passero!
Congratulations, we see the Classifiers.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
Lilli is talented, charismatic, powerful and has an amazing voice.
Keep an eye, it is lacrante diva.
I know it was the 1st turning to me, thank you.
I had to go with Adam, for he put hot in the race for me.
I love his works with past artists.
There is much potential in what we can do together.
Fuck, I quit me.
Tomorrow, mentors lead performances to another level.
well expresses the story.
You have style, keep pro right time.
The dispute has never been so fierce.
Decisions have never been so difficult.
- Who won the knockout?
- I do not know.
Nothing compares to Rob that will rock the competition!
I'm going to shock everyone.
We have a theft!
Learn everything from The Voice to Voice Sub Group.

- [Mindy] Richard Nixon High wasn't the worst place to spend four years.
Well for the most part.
By and large, it was your average suburban high school full of self-segregated cliques and stereotypical angst and at the top of the food chain, the rich and beautiful.
That's us.
There's me, Mindy Lipschitz.
The assault victim.
And the girl with the Home Alone look on her face.
- [Mindy] That's Jodi, my best friend.
We've been best friends since third grade.
I'm the one with the unfortunate eye patch.
(yelling)
As you can see, my school kind of sucked for us and so did Jodi's aim.
- [Jodi] Zombie fascist!
- [Mindy] Intended target, Whitney Bennett, voted most likely to be charged with war crimes.
She was 5'7" of sculpted, flawless, sociopath.
(glass shattering) (car alarm blaring)
Actual target.
- Son of a...
- [Mindy] Principal Whitmore, tormenting students since 1979.
- So sorry!
- [Mindy] And that's how this whole thing started, the rock that launched a revolution.
- X-Files is on tonight.
- Can't, I have homework.
- What the F?
We get detention and Whitney does a hair flip and gets off Scot-free.
- Well if it makes you feel any better, in at least one of the infinite multiverses, she doesn't.
Hey, I know it seems like high school is the center of this universe right now.
- Do not say it gets better.
Next year you'll be in Nerdvana at MIT and I'll still be here serving quadruple bypass burgers at TGI Fridays.
- Or you could be serving an entirely new and decidedly classier set in Boston when you come to live with me.
- Great.
So in every multiverse you know of,
I'm still waiting tables.
(sputters lips)
That's awesome.
- I gotta go.
I've got family jazzercise at five.
It's gonna get physical!
(both laugh)
- [Jodi] Good luck with that jazzercising!
(laughs)
- I am in control!
(Jodi laughs)
- Weirdo!
- [Mindy] Maniac!
(oven timer dings)
- Hey Dad!
- Hey hon.
Mm mmm something smells scrum-diddly-icious.
How was school?
Legalized torture paid for by the American taxpayer.
- Did you make the appointment with the college counselor?
Jodi, you're graduating this year.
I think it's time you figured out where you're headed.
- Most likely into a menial job that doesn't pay a living wage so I can become a cog in the 21st century's version of serfdom.
- When did you start speaking like Trotsky?
Look, I just want you to be happy.
I want you to find something that you love.
Follow your dreams.
- So single 40-something postal carrier with a PEZ collection
- Hey, this PEZ collection is gonna be valuable one day and single and widow are two completely different things.
- I know.
Dad, I mean it's been five years.
You know, you're not getting any younger.
- Age is just a number.
- That closely correlates with death.
- You want me to start dating?
- I just want you to find something you love, Herb.
Follow your dreams.
- I'll find a date if you find a direction.
- One of those things is a lot easier than the other.
- It's not finding a date...
- And it's not finding a direction.
(sighs)
(beeping)
All right, so here's a new song.
I hope you enjoy it and by you, I mean me because I would rather admit that Taylor Swift's music has touched my cold, dark heart than show it to anybody.
It's called Suburbageddon.
(guitar music)
(school bell rings)
- Bernoulli's theorem will be on test next week.
Uh hey Mindy, could you uh stick around for a nanosecond?
- (gasps) Oh did my spectrofloatometer malfunction.
I knew I should have gotten...
- Hey, slow down, Sonic.
I spoke with my old roommate who is on the alumni board at MIT and she agreed to set up a special interview for you.
- (gasps) Are you serious?
- As a radiation leak.
- Oh my god, this is perfect.
Okay, next step is the interview, then get in obviously, get first pick for all my classes, graduate with honors and then it will set me up for one of the more prestigious graduate programs.
- Mindy, one step at a time.
College is about more than just classes and grades.
It's about exploring, having fun.
I remember staying up all night with my friends solving proofs, cracking equations.
It was pretty wild.
But some of my best memories are just hanging out, meeting new people, living on the edge.
God I miss college.
- Well in my experience, meeting new people usually leads to relentless mockery by said people.
- Don't you think that's a little pessimistic.
Give people a chance.
They can often surprise you.
- That is a point worth considering, Mr. Samuels.
- Go forth.
Go!
The world is ready to embrace you.
(grunts)
- Boo loser.
- Eventually.
- [Mindy] Since Mr. Samuels was basically my real-life Yoda,
I knew he was right.
He'd proven it was time to give people a chance.
I think we should ask Whitney to stop torturing us.
- Did you forget to wear your gas mask in lab again?
- Whitney's a person too, right?
If we approach her like confident, mature adults, she will respect us and then we can coexist in peace.
- Of all the douche-nozzles in this school,
Whitney is the worst.
- She hasn't been that horrible.
(squeals)
(yells)
(rattling) (banging)
- What the?
- Okay fine.
But it's this or suffer from abject humiliation for the rest of the year.
- So I said to her if you don't stay away from Rick,
I will call the police and say that you molested my hat and you have to register for that. (giggles)
- I'm here.
- Took you long enough.
- One center cut rare, three meatball subs, extra sauce, a hard boiled egg and a Kombucha.
- I'm going to die a virgin and you don't even care.
- Shh.
- Are you guys selling band candy or something?
- Actually, no.
We were wondering if we could talk to Whitney for a second.
- Do you have an appointment?
I want to hear what Bill Nye and the lesbian have to say.
- Hello.
We know that there has been some bad blood between us throughout the years, but we are seniors now and there is no reason why we can't finish off the school year being civil to each other.
We thought that if we came and spoke to you like adults, we could come to some sort of mutually beneficial agreement.
- Wow.
I applaud your courage.
Okay.
- Wait what?
- It didn't occur to me until this exact moment that I kind of respect you.
You didn't change yourself to blend in, which is much more than can be said for the rest of these automatons.
- Well I'm glad we could come to this understanding.
- Actually, Colin's throwing a party this Saturday.
You should come.
(energetic party music)
- Thank you for coming.
Friends don't let friends drive drunk.
Ow.
The mean attractiveness of this party is statistically significant.
How do I look?
- Soccer mom goes to the Olive Garden.
I guess we should...
- [Mindy] Colin!
- Thank you for hosting us.
You have a lovely home.
My mom says never come to a party empty handed.
- Sweet.
(urine splattering)
- Oh.
(Colin sighs of relief)
- Have fun, baby.
(lips smack) (Mindy giggles awkwardly)
Hey bro, we got next game.
- Oh my god.
Is that really how I just saw my first human penis?
- See, we are diversifying our portfolio of high school experiences already.
That contains Colin's urine.
- Hey.
MIT and what was it?
How's it going, guys?
- Well we haven't been roofied yet so.
- Wow.
Aren't you enchanting?
- This is her trying to be nice.
- (scoffs) I'm hoping to get time off from this conversation for good behavior.
- You're funny, Wellesley.
- Thanks, Penn State.
- I'm Dave by the way.
- We were lab partners sophomore year.
- Um Mandy.
- Mindy.
- Mindy like...
- Like Mindy.
- Like Mindy, cool.
Any reason it would be awkward for me not to know your name?
- Not unless you're an avid follower of the piccolo section in the school marching band.
- Ah I'm more of a tuba section guy myself.
- Well then I'm Jodi.
- Hi.
- There you guys are.
Welcome to the 1%. (giggles)
Follow me.
- Our pleasure.
- Good luck!
(mouth popping)
- Cool, right?
Go fetch some drinks for our guests of honor, please.
- Oh that's not, not.
(claps)
- Dorks, balls now.
- They want you to play pong.
- Like ping?
- No, beer.
- Oh.
- Thank you.
- Boom!
Drink.
- I think it's gone bad.
- No, that's just what beer tastes like.
(chuckles)
- I don't lose.
(cheering)
- You did it!
- Yeah!
("We Gon' Dance" by Hans Inglish)
- Excuse me!
Hello everyone.
Can I have your attention please?
- Shh!
- Whitney would like to say a few words.
(cheering) (applause)
- As you may have noticed, we have some new additions tonight,
Jodi Shallenberger and Mindy Lipschitz.
(cheering) (applause)
- Shit lips!
(laughter)
- Not so funny after four years.
- Now, most of us walk past these two and have never bothered to get to know them.
So I put together a little video of our very own Jodi so we could all learn a bit more about her.
(laughter)
- Someone's ballin'.
- [Boy] Who's Jodi?
Oh.
(keyboard clattering)
(lighthearted flute playing)
(laughter)
- Well any requests?
♪ Ooh eczema, I'm gonna vanquish ya ♪
Yow!
(laughter)
Oh you're such a good kisser.
I'd party down with you any time, Adam Scott.
- You know how there are the birds and there are the bees.
How familiar are you with male anatomy?
- Oh my god, Dad, I am 17.
- Hon, got your tampons.
(laughter)
- Dad!
No, I need maximum flow.
I told you, Dad!
- Oh no!
(laughter)
- Jodi, wait!
You're all mean!
Jodi!
(upbeat pop music)
- You're late.
(rattles handle)
- How epic was prank eight?
I want to be you when I grow up.
- If you're going to be in power next year, this is your new Bible, the 48 Laws of Power.
I suggest you heed law number one.
- Never outshine the master.
(whistling)
- Your lawnmower man is like so happy.
- Don't wave!
Mackenzie, drive.

- Hey, Jodi.
It's me, your best friend.
Um I'm at school right now and you know, it is really, really not that bad.
Oy vey.
- Oh my god, have you seen Jodi's Instagram feed?
Someone tagged a photo of her on a box of tampons.
That is really not right.
- Oh my god.
- That prank was pretty twisted, Whitney.
Even for you.
I mean, how mental do you have to be to put that much effort into messing with a couple of nerds
- All I had to do was teach myself how to hack a webcam, figure out Jodi's IP address and then trick her into responding to a spyware email I learned how to write.
- [Dave] You guys are demonic.
You're like medieval to each other.
- I will not allow Big Bang Theory and her frizzy-haired lap dog to roam the halls of this school thinking that for one second they are my equal.
- Law 15, crush your enemy totally.
- [Rick] Right. (chuckles)
(knocking)
- Oh Jodi, coming in.
Remember that only my opinion matters.
Hey, I brought you something.
I brought you my favorite book on Tesla, who was also totally defeated and humiliated in his lifetime and has since regained popularity and had a resurgence of respect.
Also brought some cookies.
They'll be good in an hour.
And a mint.
Yeah!
Oh.
You know, one day we are gonna look back on this and it is going to be...
- Uh just stop, Mindy.
I told you this was gonna happen.
People like Whitney don't change.
God, I knew I shouldn't have clicked on that attachment.
New Tina Fey series, piccolo players wanted.
- Okay, all right.
No, no.
No.
We're not accepting defeat.
Do we accept defeat?
No.
- I'm sure you understand the definition of winning.
This...
Not winning.
- Hey.
I am serious.
We are gonna stand up for ourselves.
- Yeah?
And how exactly are we gonna do that?
- By beating those fascists at their own game.
We're gonna be popular.
And not lame top 40 popular, awesome popular.
All of us.
All of the people they have treated like second class citizens and then copied their calculus homework.
- Popular people don't take calculus.
- I know because they are stupid dolts who are gonna go to below average universities and get mediocre grades and still end up being our bosses unless we do something about it right now.
- Just like that, we're gonna overthrow generations of ingrained high school social strata?
- Yes.
Is there anything we have ever put our minds to that we have not accomplished?
- Well we didn't get Firefly back on the air.
- Shh!
Besides getting Firefly back on the air.
- Then...
No.
- [Mindy] Let's do this.
Boom!
And so it was.
The revolution was born.
And Tina Fey, if you're listening,
I'd still play piccolo for you.
- Power to the peons.
The facts were simple.
There were more of us than there were of them.
So all we had to do was convince the outsiders, misfits and weirdos of the school to ban together.
Basically we were gonna unionize the outcasts.
Power to the peons.
- [Mindy] Unfortunately, it wasn't that simple.
- Oh!
- Well that was a lucky shot.
Gross, but lucky.
- Yeah.
- Power to the peons!
(yells)
(shoes squeaking)
- Hi guys.
I am Claire, ambassador troop 2579.
- Welcome, Claire.
- I like where your horse head's at.
Going straight Godfather, huh?
- It's a unicorn for my spirit animal badge.
- You do realize that this is a meeting to launch a social revolution.
- Yup, I'm in.
Whatever you guys need.
- Oh great.
Well why don't you take a seat inside and we will be with you shortly.
- Yay!
We talked to pretty much every misfitoy in this school and the only thing we have to show for it is Marcia Brady.
- Hey, all revolutions have to start somewhere.
Oh my god, Sugar Jones incoming 12 o'clock.
("Step Aside" by Cheryl P.)
- No eye witnesses.
- Activate shield.
- I hear you're trying to obliterate the jackhole normative power hierarchy of this pathetic excuse for a school.
- Well obliterate is kind of extreme, but yeah.
- I'm in.
(hip hop music)
- Okay, we may be small in number, but we're all here for a reason, right?
- Right.
Wait, why are we here?
- Jesus.
I say we just burn this mother down and be done with it.
- Arson sounds like a fabulous plan.
- But if we need to get more people, we could go door to door like I do with cookies.
It's an excellent way to bond with people in a place where they feel comfortable being themselves.
- Screw Girl Scout cookies, an obvious conspiracy to subjugate girls and force them into traditional gender roles by selling overpriced, unremarkable, and nutritionally-deficient baked goods.
- We suck at this.
This isn't a revolution, this is a girl band.
We need someone who can work the system,
Karl Rove good witch style.
- Wait.
(liquid squirts)
- [Both] Virginia.
- As president of the History,
Young Democrats,
Multi United Nations Club, I am...
- [Mindy] Virginia Vanderkamp had locked up most likely to succeed in third grade.
Our junior year, Virginia launched the culmination of all her hard work, a campaign for student council president.
She had a well-oiled political machine and several key endorsements.
- Vote for me, Virginia.
Do you want a pin?
- Hey Twilight, go Kyle.
- [Mindy] But despite her best efforts, she lost to Kyle McDevon.
- Chipotle burritos, yeah!
- [Mindy] Whose campaign speech consisted of giving out free Chipotle gift cards.
- You want a burrito, Virginia?
- [Mindy] And spectacular abs.
- [Kyle] Oh yeah!
- [Mindy] After a crushing defeat, she went where many a depressed and disgruntled American has gone before,
France.
(film reel flapping)
Needless to say, she didn't come back from summer break the same.
- What's your shirt say?
- Hell is other people.
- [Woman] Next.
- [Jodi] Oh this girl definitely owns a pony.
- [Mindy] Does anyone else feel underdressed?
(doorbell rings)
- [Virginia] Speak.
- Hi, Virginia.
This is Mindy Lipschitz, Jodi Shallenberger,
Sugar Jones and Claire the Girl Scout.
We were trying to upend the social hierarchy of our school.
- Or destroy it.
- And we could use your help.
- [Virginia] I'm not interested in your futile attempts to make sense of the world's chaos.
Be gone.
(clears throat)
- We were actually thinking more along the lines of revenge.
- What?
We tried to talk to all the different groups, but nobody wanted to join the cause.
You think all the outcasts are the same, but really we're like snowflakes, snowflakes that hate each other.
Let me break it down for you.
You've got your basic overachievers, your underachievers, your emos, your goths, your bandos, your drama dorks, orchestra oddballs and gleeks.
Kids lost in space, kids who take up too much space, your steampunk, cyber punk, classic punk, kids with foreign parents, kids who are parents,
Twihards, kids who try too hard, kids who write binary, kids who reject the gender binary, gamers, stoners, loners, anarchists, activists, masochists, and atheists.
There are more strains of loser out there than the herpes virus.
Uniting them under one banner, that is no easy task.
- So we're screwed.
- I said it wasn't easy, I didn't say it was impossible.
- [Mindy] What is this place?
- It used to be my campaign headquarters.
Prior to that it was used by my father to house his miniature horse collection.
Prior to that it was used by my schizophrenic grandfather to interrogate imaginary communists.
He won an imaginary medal for that.
- Man, rich white people are messed up.
- When I was running for office,
I did a little research on the voters.
- So this is where the NSA stores its data.
- These files represent the entire student body.
Each one of them contains your standard class list,
GPA, activities, hobbies, psychological profile, past and current lovers, and most importantly weaknesses.
- No effing way.
- Point of weakness, Tina Fey piccolo.
Geeze am I that transparent?
- Overtly aggressive, lack of impulse control militant with anarchist undertones.
Nice.
- Latent Napoleonic tendencies.
What does yours say, Claire?
- It just says Girl Scout.
- What's in your file, Virginia?
- I don't have any weaknesses.
These three files represent the king pins of the school's underclass.
Convince them and you have a shot at this thing.
The key is figuring out what makes people tick and then exploiting it mercilessly.
- I like you, Virginia even if you are named after a slave state.
- First up, Howard Chang, leader of the young entrepreneurs.
Points of weakness, black mock turtlenecks, technology savvy women and the word billion.
- I get what you guys are going for.
I think it's very innovative, but it's just not right for us.
We're working on an app right now that's gonna blow up.
Asiavous, Facebook for Asians.
And besides, I've got to look to the future, not worry about high school.
I still have to get before I can start my first company.
- Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels.
You can quote them or disagree with them, but the only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things.
- Do you know who said that?
Apple and that is why they make billions.
- Next is Martin Vimmel, head of the Science Fiction Club.
Points of weakness, hard sci-fi, the sound of his own voice and very aggressive women.
(dark music)
- Okay, here's the deal.
Just because you're a science geek, doesn't mean we're your comrades in arms.
Science is about what is.
Any idiot can do that.
Science-fiction is about what could be.
- We're huge Dr. Who fans.
- Yeah, the Matt Smith years completely turned the series around.
- Completely.
- Tell you what, give me the title of one Neal Stephenson novel, just one, and I'll join your little group.
- You think skinny, anemic fanboys have a monopoly on the one fictional genre where women and people of color get to exist outside of backwards societal norms and traditional confinements?
Not to mention a genre largely premised on the idea that future dystopia is the inevitable outcome of the current system of patriarchal excess?
Idiot.
Oh and Cryptonomicon, Snow Crash, Anathem.
Should I go on?
(zipper sliding)
- Louis Hammerschmidt, leader of the Fantasy Club.
Points of weakness, Elven languages, heroic aspirations and any woman.
- Whitney Bennett is the Cersei Lannister of high school.
You can play the Game of Thrones with her.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to end up like Ned Stark.
- Louis, think of it like this.
What if Frodo hadn't left the Shire and fought against the Dark Lord?
(chuckles)
- (speaks in Elven) Louis.
(bubbles rumble)
Thanks for the ride.
- I'm really glad I'm helping you guys with this whole thing.
I've always admired you.
- Really?
Why?
- You're just so unapologetic for who you are.
- That's been a recurring problem.
- So when did you know?
- That I rubbed people the wrong way?
- I haven't heard that one before, but yeah.
- Um you know, I guess it was pretty obvious since
I was a kid, but I really hit my stride in middle school.
(laughs)
- I rub people the wrong way too.
I mean, I haven't actually yet.
But I want to someday.
First I have to figure out how to tell them.
- That you're rude and obnoxious?
- That I'm gay.
- It's so great to talk to somebody who's already out.
You're like my hero.
With that sign on your back announcing that you were gay,
I could not believe how brave you were.
- Okay first of all, someone put that sign on my back as a prank and secondly, why does everyone think I'm gay?
- You do wear a lot of vests.
- Huh.
- I'm sorry, I just, I thought that...
- No, it's okay.
I'm really glad that you told me.
So...
When did you know?
- I think it finally clicked when I realized
I didn't just love Veronica Mars,
I loved Veronica Mars.
- Preach.
- I will, I will see you at school in the halls.
You know and say hi to me.
- See you later.
- [Claire] See you.
(car horn beeps)
- Things are happening, Herb.
Things are happening.
- Yes they are.
New York Performing Arts School.
(groans)
Deal's a deal.
I have a date with Carol and you have a date with destiny.
(sighs)
- [Woman] Find love today.
- Things are happening.
- Raise your hand if you've ever eaten lunch in a bathroom stall.
Been made fun of because of your weight, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or knowledge of the periodic table of elements.
- Well it's time we did something about it.
It's been 42 seconds and I still don't know your product, your plan or your profit point.
If you want to endlessly pontificate start a blog.
- We have a blog.
- Oh no, here comes angry black girl.
- Oh I'm not angry because I'm black.
I'm angry because I'm paying attention.
- All we're saying is that if we don't stick together, we have no chance of standing up to the evil empire.
- What you're proposing is like the Rebel Alliance.
- Star Wars, classic sci-fi.
- I'm sorry to interrupt, but I think Star Wars technically constitutes fantasy.
- Uh in what galaxy?
- It's an archetypal hero's quest.
That's fantasy.
- Um yeah, set in a technologically advanced society with space ships.
- [Louis] And sword fighting.
- [Martin] Light sabers are not swords.
- What about the Force?
That's magic.
- Which was scientifically explained by midichlorians.
- Are you actually citing the prequels to me right now?
- Why do we have two sci-fi nerds here?
- He's sci-fi, I'm fantasy.
It's totally different.
- Totally different.
- But neither of you get laid, right?
- This is exactly the problem.
What is a popular person?
What makes them different from us?
- Attractiveness.
- Flawless skin.
- A large number of followers.
- Wrong.
That's what they want you to think because they need you to believe that it's hard to be popular.
The only difference between them and us
So while we're sitting here tearing each other apart over who would win in a battle between Batman and Green Lantern.
- Batman.
- Green Lantern.
- They're sitting pretty and ruling our school.
- So what are you asking for, blind loyalty, that we just pretend we're all friends?
- No, not blind loyalty, real loyalty.
We all have something in common.
We've been kept on the outskirts of a school that we help make great and...
- We are the movers and the shakers.
We are the club presidents and the innovators.
We are the ones with our hands on the beating pulse of otherness that make America the best effing country in the GD world.
So I say let's stop bending over and taking it and stand together.
(inspirational music)
And so it began, our Independence Day.
At first, the changes were small, a smile here,
a random act of non-douche baggery there.
In shared struggles, former enemies forged new alliances.
- Lactards unite.
- [Mindy] Some of us learned the ancient art of not getting our asses kicked.
(grunting)
- So I'll try not to hurt you too... (coughs) to design innovative solutions to age-old problems.
- What's up, turtleneck?
I lost my iPhone and I'm gonna need yours.
(cell phone buzzing)
(alarm blaring)
You've got five seconds to hand it over.
(dramatic music)
What the hell is that?
What are you gonna do, Dildo Baggins?
- Hi-yah!
(coughing)
(inspirational music)
- Get him!
Smells like Comic Con in here anyway.
- Yes!
(cheering) (applause)
- [Mindy] And once the outcasts became a united front, the rest of the school fell like dominoes.
Political power, check.
Never getting picked last again.
- Come on!
- [Mindy] Check.
- And that is why the singularity is near.
(cheering) (applause)
- [Mindy] Debate tournaments were in.
Organized sports were out.
(cheering) (party horn blares)
And slowly, things began to actually change.
Dork was the new popular.
- [Girl] Ow!
(locker slams)
Every flavor of weirdo was breaking bread together.
- We should do something to celebrate how awesome we are.
- Yeah, even the goths look kind of happy.
- Guys, we just pulled off the bloodless coup of the century and it is...
- Probably just a phase or something.
Like I herd Mercury is supposedly going renegade.
- Here's the truth.
One day, I will be in a place where power isn't determined by acned suburban subliterates and that place will be Princeton.
But for now, I have to cater to these morons who apparently think pretending they're popular actually means they're popular.
What's law number five?
Much depends on our reputation.
Guard it with our life, get it?
So right now I'd say it's pretty clear that we are...
- Mmm toast.
- The thing about power is when you don't have it, someone else does.
So you say phase and I say insurrection the only response to insurrection is to crush it.
Quickly.
- Stephanie, purple is definitely your color.
Chase, good luck on that first chair open audition.
Sarah, your Blanche DuBois was transcendental.
Hey, you, me, Magic the Gathering.
Fifth period, whoo!
Oh Mr. Samules.
(gasps) Methane!
I'm just goofing.
- Oh well.
Nice balls, Milton.
(laughs)
- Shenanigans.
- Geeze, like Pandora's box opened up and it was filled with weirdos and losers.
Oh what's that?
Yup.
- Every scientist needs an arch nemesis.
He's right though.
The school does seem different lately.
You have anything to do with that?
- I can neither prove nor disprove that hypothesis.
I can't help but thinking it is exactly the type of person who would go over like gangbusters in an MIT interview.
(laughs)
- Gangbusters.
(chuckles)
I don't know, I've got it narrowed down to two.
I've got maroon and black and I'm not sure which goes better with my dickey, but my dickey kind of goes with everything and I keep thinking what would Neil deGrasse Tyson do, but then again I'm not Neil deGrasse Tyson,
but then again.
- Mindy, Mindy, stop worrying.
They'd be Darwin Award grade morons not to take you.
- I keep imagining how great it would be next year, me at MIT, you coming to live with me in Boston.
- Um Mindy, there's something I've...
- Oh oh!
(car horn blares)
Okay, I gotta go, that's my mom.
Wish me luck.
- Good luck.
- But then in ninth grade, the Young Astronomers Association selected me for the Rising Star Award, which I accepted despite the lazy pun and then in 10th grade I won second prize at the state science fair for my project anisotropic versus isotropic materials.
- Okay Mindy, it's clear that you're a really talented scientist.
Great grades, great test scores.
But what makes you tick?
What makes you special?
Like okay, when I was at MIT,
I was a member of the Hacks, right.
Learned more from pulling off those pranks than in any class I took so.
- Well as I mentioned,
I am president of the school science club and a national merit scholar and I can recite the entire periodic table of elements.
Would you like me to?
I can do it.
There's antimony, arsenic, aluminum, selenium and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium and nickel, neodymium, neptunium, germanium and iron, americium, ruthenium, uranium, europium, zirconium, lutetium, vanadium
and lanthanum and osmium and astatine and radium and gold and protactinium and indium and gallium (gasps) and iodine and thorium and thulium and thallium.
There's... (hums)
- Hey.
I saw you dancing.
What's going on?
What you listening to?
- Um Bowie.
What's that, Nickelback?
- Oh yeah, huge Nickelback fan.
Love it.
Canadian icons.
- You like Carole King?
- It makes me feel like a natural woman.
Who can't relate to that, you know what I mean?
- Let's not forget that the last time I saw you, the most humiliating moment of my life.
- Yeah, okay.
First of all, I'm sorry.
I had no idea that was gonna happen.
What's going on in American Psycho Barbie's head?
No and second of all, that stuff was not humiliating.
Except in all the ways that it was humiliating.
I'm surprised you didn't change schools.
But here look, hey, positive side.
Eczema song, knocked it out the park.
- Can you just not?
- Rickets.
Do you have a song about rickets for my grandad?
He's got rickets.
- I don't, I don't get it.
- I guess you wouldn't get it, you're a young woman, very healthy.
- No.
I mean, you know, you seem like you aren't a completely heinous human being and have at least a modicum of a soul.
- That is the sweetest thing that anyone's ever said to me.
Thank you.
- How can you hang out with Adolf Whitler?
- Look, trust me, I know how awful she is.
What you think you have a copyright on teen angst?
It's high school, we're all put into a box and marginalized.
Look at me, I hang out with Colin.
I've known Colin since the second grade.
The guy is, he's an idiot.
But what am I supposed to do?
Not all of us have the guts to stage a full-scale rebellion.
- Mindy's the brains behind the operation.
- You just write the theme music?
Look um, for what it's worth,
I'm glad you didn't transfer schools.
My hand's on your shoulder.
Full contact, shoulder touching.
Pound it, blow it up.
(imitates explosion)
Explosion.
- Yeah.
- Okay. (laughs awkwardly)
Oh um by the way,
Bowie totally made weird awesome.

- Killing it.
- People think pretty girls can't be smart, but it's like don't pigeon hold me.
- Uh don't you mean pigeon hole?
- Ew what's a pigeon hole?
- It's like if you hold onto a pigeon, it can't fly away.
- Yeah.
- It's like let me fly.
- Where the hell is everyone?
("Drop It Low" by DJ Dolls)
(cheering)
(cheering)
- Hey Mackenzie, look at that.
You like that?
- I think everyone's at the lame party.
- Really?
That's awesome.
- What the hell is your problem, hmm?
- You know what my problem is?
You're uh you're super evil.
You're like African rebel group dictator evil
So I think I'm gonna check out the lame party where I hear the hosts aren't total ass hats.
- [Whitney] You'll fit right in.
- I think I'm gonna go to that party too.
It sounds like there's girls there.
- [Colin] Dude.
- I think someone should probably scope it out too.
You know, like do some double agent Shenans.
- Mackenzie!
- Hey, so what's in this anyway?
- My own personal secret blend of choice chemicals and a dash of genius.
I call it Lipschitz and giggles.
- You're right, I do have the vague urge to laugh.
- Whoa, looks like I picked the right party.
- Oh Dan, right?
- Dave.
- Dave, Dave like..
- Like Dave.
- Like Dave.
- So do you know anyone who can get me into the Whitney protection program?
- Oh my god.
Tell me everything.
- And for you.
Who wants Lipshots?
(upbeat music)
- So Principal Whitmore gave you two months detention for protesting the summer reading list?
I always heard it was because you threw a flash bomb into glee club.
- That was just a rumor I started.
- Well we should organize a protest.
- What do you know about protesting, Pollyanna?
- I know you think Girl Scouts are silly, but the whole point is to empower girls so we can change the world.
You know, Gloria Steinem, Hilary Clinton, and Sandra Day O'Connor were all Girl Scouts.
- Hmm maybe you're not as "puppies and unicorns" as you seem.
- I thought I would be just better at jousting,
I don't know, like 'cause of a reach thing
- 'Cause you got those long, spindly ones.
- Thank you, spindly ones, sure.
Oh whoa, there's a piano here.
You know what that means.
Will you write any new songs?
- You know what, I actually just wrote one in my head called Our Party is Way Better Than Your Party.
It's weird.
- Thank you, it's nice.
Sweet.
- Actually...
I am working on one now.
But um...
It's stupid.
- Oh I will be the judge of that.
Sit down.
(groans)
- Do I have to?
- Yeah, yeah you're gonna have to play a song for me.
Sorry.
- I can't believe you're making me do this.
All right.

♪ But I've heard that the truth is out there
♪ I just hope one day I can show
♪ There is more here than what they know ♪
And that's all I have.
That was great, are you kidding me?
That was awesome.
That was really good.
- I was just thinking for the chorus.
(hums "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star")
- Wow, I didn't know you played.
- I don't like to let people behind the candelabra.
It's my secret place.
(laughs)
So when do I get to hear the rest of your songs?
- Maybe...
Some time.
- Later, maybe later, maybe later.
- Hey, oh.
Oh hey guys.
Um I just wanted to let you know that they're reenacting the Battle of Trafalgar out on the beach.
So... (squeals)
- Awesome, let's do that.
That's way better than...
Naval battle, huh?
Hmm?
- I think I speak for everyone when I say that Saturday's shindig was one of the best, nay, the best party of all time.
- Here here.
(applause)
- Now, does anyone have anything to bring to the council's attention?
Upcoming events, seminar ideas?
Yes.
- Sugar and I did some research and it turns out...
- What about sabotaging the lacrosse team.
We've finally established strategic dominance.
Now is the time to exploit our advantage and those guys had it coming.
- A few tablets of Ex-Lax in the team's water coolers and their bowels will explode like krypton.
- Do you think Steve Jobs became the greatest visionary of all time by being satisfied with creating the iMac?
He changed it up and created the iPod, then the iPhone, then the iPod touch, then...

I guess a little explosive diarrhea never hurt anyone.
- Yes!
(claps)
- Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
- Hey, want to play Settlers of Catan?
My dad's new lady friend is coming over with her kid so we can all meet each other even though it's only their second date.
- Well that sounds fun.
- All right, you guys gotta go.
You know how my parents feel about organized labor, so.
- Right.
- Oh god.
(groans)
What do I do?
Is it too neat?
Is my hair too neat?
Should I mess it up?
I mean, don't the ladies like it messy?
- Oh, Herb.
Listen, you haven't dated in awhile so I feel the need to tell you that at your age, women aren't super concerned as much as they are impressed that you still have hair.
(doorbell rings)
- Oh no.
- Relax.
Awkward doesn't suit you.
- Yes.
No awkward.
Okay.
Hi.
- [Carol] Hi.
- You must be David, of course you are.
Who else would you be?
(laughs awkwardly)
You wouldn't bring a date to dinner, right?
I'm Herb.
Uh uh David, this is my daughter Jodi.
Jodi, David.
Jodi, Carol, Carol, Jodi.
David, Carol, Herb, Jodi.
Everybody knows each other.
Introductions out of the way.
Come into the house please.
This is the way in.

- Jodi, it's Mindy.
Call me.
- I suggested hey, why not take the shorts up an inch above the knee.
They said no, but with respect they said no.
Um I also have made...
- Hey, guys.
Just give me these, give me these.
You guys are done, right?
- Not quite, but.
- Mom's done, Mom's done.
- Sure, thank you.
That's good. (laughs)
- Hey, hey.
What if they get married?
- Then we almost committed stepcest.
Hey, you were the one who went in for the kiss.
- No, no way.
You were practically undressing me with your eyes.
- Undressing you?
Mister oh I don't let many people behind the candelabra.
- Fine, we'll just chalk it up to equal parts creepy.
I don't know where this goes.
- So...
Friends it is?
- Yeah, in the interest of not having our family tree go in a circle friends.
I'm sorry, I realize referencing having children with you makes it more creepy.
- Yeah, it did.
(Herb and Carol laughing)
- I got an operation plan to Photoshop the cheerleaders' yearbook picture.
Can I get the green light?
- I don't care, do what you want.
- I have been looking for you all day.
Oh my god, last night was like the seventh circle of awkwardness.
- I called you.
- I know.
It was insane.
- I got waitlisted at MIT.
- Wait, wha, wha?
No, no, no, there's gotta be a mistake.
Hey, I want names.
- It doesn't matter.
- Hey, guess who's coming to dinner?
We're joking.
Hey, did you hear?
- Actually not.
- [Dave] Um...
- [Jodi] Not a good time.
- Her dad and my mom, they're like totally dating now.
- That's crazy.
- Oh hey, side point.
I found a perfect song for your audition.
- Audition?
- Thanks Dave, I'll take it from here.
- It's just for a performing arts school.
- In Boston?
- In New York.
I was gonna tell you.
It's no big deal.
- Of course it's a big deal.
I'm sure you'll get in and it's a good thing you've got Dave to help you with your audition.
- Mindy, don't be mad.
I gotta go.
- Yep.
- Hey, we'll talk later, okay?
- [Dave] Sorry.
- [Jodi] It's fine, let's just go.
- [Woman] Mindy Lipschitz, please report to the principal's office.
- This is an all new level.
Stealing chemicals and lab equipment from the school?
- Come on, Les, Mindy is one of my best students.
She would never do that.
- Really?
Why don't you have a look-see.
- Okay, well that one is clearly Photoshopped.
- [Mr. Samuels] Mindy.
- Well guess what.
You're out of the science club forever.
- This must be some mistake.
- Save it, sweater vest.
Luckily, we still have students like Whitney Bennett who had the courage to bring this sick delinquency to my attention.
Get out of my office.
(door slams)
- Mr. Samuels.
Why didn't you defend me?
- What do you want me to do, Mindy?
- You went to MIT, the greatest academic institution and you're still being bullied by an overgrown frat boy.
- Oh my god, you totally broke her.
- Law 42, strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter.
- [Mackenzie] Straight back to you.
- Are you sure you want this?
- I want it.
Can anyone tell me what the exception to the rule of... (dramatic music)
- [Television Voice] Brothers and sisters, it is time to open your eyes.
Whitney Bennett, for four years she has crafted a meticulous image as the rich girl who had it all.
Well brothers and sisters,
Whitney Bennett is not who you thought.
The mansion her family supposedly lives in, try the servants' quarters.
Her father, the hedge fund manager, these are the only hedges he's ever managed.
The mother who works in fashion, only if this constitutes working in the fashion industry.
Her older brother getting a master's in business at Wharton.
The only business he's mastered is delivering pizzas.
The truth is revealed.
The only reason Whitney was always so intent on exposing all of your weaknesses was so that you would never discover hers.
Whitney Bennett is a liar.
- Dude.
What was that?
- That was our revenge over Whitney.
- You do realize that you just did the same thing to her that she did to me.
- Exactly, it's called revenge.
I don't get what your problem is.
This is what you wanted.
We set out to change things and we did it.
We won.
- It doesn't feel like we won.
It feels like we're becoming the things that we used to hate.
- My whole life I played by the rules.
I colored in the bubbles with my number two pencils and what did it get me?
Teased, tortured, ignored, waitlisted.
Do you know what turning the other cheek gets you?
Two black eyes.
- The old Mindy...
- Was a pushover who thought she was gonna go to MIT, engineer the perfect hydrogen fuel cell and get an element named after her.
- Lipschitzium can still happen.
- If you have a problem with what you're doing, you should do something about it.
- If this is what it is...
Then I'm out.
("Let's Roll")
- [Jodi] So we had succeeded in creating a new world order at Richard Milhous Nixon High.
Turns out power is a potent drug and with Whitney publicly humiliated and officially dethroned, the underlings of our school had now become its overlords.
- Dude, that was amazing.
- [Louis] I'm registered as a lethal weapon.
- Well this sucks.
- I told you we should have just burned this mother down.
- Here here.
- Has anyone seen Whitney?
- Oh she's gone AWOL.
I never thought I'd feel bad for someone who affectionately references Stalin.
- Now we should shove his head into a toilet.
You know what I'm saying?
(garage door squeaking)
- Look, I never meant for things to go down like that.
- Oh come on, don't tell me you're not having a dorkgasm over this.
- Google alert, you did the same thing to me
- But your threshold for humiliation was already so high.
No wait, I, I'm, s-s-s...
- Were you trying to apologize?
- It just gets stuck in my throat.
But I know you're right, okay.
You're right.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
- I'm going to cut right to the chase.
I intend to rule this school next year.
But the only way you become the best is by working for the best.
I thought that was Whitney, but apparently I was wrong.
I won't pretend to like your fashion choices.
But you've got a lot to teach me and I'd like to offer my services as your intern for the rest of the school year.
(locker door slams)
- Prom is almost here and we still don't have a theme.
So I'd like you to rally your various factions to back my proposal for Ender's prom.
- Support my bid for prom king,
I vote for whatever theme you want.
- Wait, I'm running for prom king.
I'm the only one who knows how to wield a sword effectively.
- Whoa whoa whoa.
I thought we were letting Colin win so we could prank him.
- No, we never went over that.
- Um no, you're not gonna be king, I'm gonna be king.
- Mindy, I am willing to make you queen with a five-year no-beheading clause.
- [Howard] A no beheading clause?
- [Mindy] As I sat there listening,
I realized how ridiculous it all was.
We had pretended we cared about coming together, but in the end people only cared about themselves.
Even best friends.
So it had all been a lie, which was fitting since when you think about it most of high school is a lie.
Everyone faking it, trying to act cooler or smarter or older or just more sure of themselves than they really are and I couldn't help but think wouldn't it be nice for once if people just told the truth.
- So you're going to drug prom?
- That makes it sound so serious.
Lipschitzium is a very mild form of truth serum in gaseous form.
Think of it like a very smart person's version of spiking the punch, okay?
- Oh I'm fine with you drugging prom.
So what changed your mind about working with me?
- You may be a duplicitous opportunist, but at least you're honest about what you want.
- Hmm.
- Thank god you're back.
Being the only hot person in this school?
The army of dorkness is multiplying faster than the Kardashians.
(locker door slams)
- Oh!
(gasps)
Sorry, (laughs) habit.
- So are you going to prom?
- Hell no.
- Hey Whitney, can your dad mow my lawn?
- [Computerized Voice] You have a message from Mom.
Make sure you drive safely to school, honey.
You'll know.
Love, Mommy.
- I'm sorry you had to see that.
You don't need a date to go to prom.
- The date, the dress, the revelry.
I don't even know where to begin with my hatred.
And anyways, Mindy and I had always planned on doing a Star Wars marathon on prom night.
13.24 hours prequels and all.
- I get it, it's just...
- What?
- I had a chat with Mackenzie.
She's apparently Mindy's intern now and she wouldn't tell me anything, but it sounds like Mindy's planning some sort of crazy prank at prom.
Guess she's not done getting her revenge.
(dooming music)
- Why are they fighting on a hovercraft above molten lava?
- Well Herb, I'll tell you.
Obi-Wan here is just trying to be a good friend and to keep Anakin from acting like a total jackhole, but Anakin is more interested in making a stupid power play than in hanging out with his best friend.
- Hmm I don't know.
It seems to me Obi-Wan is being pretty brave, standing up for the fate of the universe and trying to help out his friend who seems to be going through maybe a rough time.
- Even if Obi-Wan ends up having to chop off his best friend's legs and his best friend ends up turning into some mouth-breathing, goth cyborg who eventually kills him?
- Yeah, even then.
Jodi.
There's one thing that I do know.
Nothing great ever happens when you're sitting on the sidelines.
- Shit.
I gotta go to prom.
(sighs)
Thanks, Dad.
- Jodi, I am your father.
Your founding father.
- I really hope this isn't genetic.
(energetic music)
Dad, are there any old clothes in Mom's closet I can wear?
- Wow.
What a vision.
Just got off the phone with Carol.
Dave doesn't have a date either.
So she's gonna bring him over here so you guys can carpool.
- Dad!
- It's fine.
You're just carpooling.
It's not gonna be awkward at all.
(upbeat party music)
- You guys, come on, squeeze in over here.
Grab her waist.
She's not your sister.
And...
(camera clicks)
Perfect.
All right, see ya.
(phone chimes)
All right, so I'm just gonna go.
(camera clicks)
(metal bangs)
- Shh!
Okay the coast is clear, let's go.
- We are so Breaking Bad right now.
(phone chimes) - [Boy] Hey Colin.
(phone chimes)
- Who came up with this theme anyway?
- The patriarchy.
- You back in?
Wanna bust a move?
- Fine, whatever.
- [Martin] You gotta get up to get down.
(sighs)
(phone chimes)
- I think I might actually be a PC.
- Maybe my therapist is right.
I am dating my father.
- Is there any way to deny that all human suffering originates from human desire?
Unless the only way to end suffering is to end desire.
But the illogical and futile nature of desire will inevitably win out over our rational nature.
- This punch...
Is good.
- I know that everybody loves Harry, but I can certainly appreciate Zayn's brooding charm, but for my money, Liam is the unsung hero of One Direction.
- I find everything about you repulsive, yet I'm strangely drawn to you.
- That is the nicest thing a girl has ever said to me.
- I love you, man.
- Yes homo.
- I find myself incredibly attracted to you despite that pantsuit.
(squeals)
This is awesome.
Thank you, Adam Scott.
Hey um...
I really like you.
- I really like.
(phone chimes)
(groans)
Damn it.
Um I gotta go.
I'll find you later.
(moaning)
- Promise?
- Hey.
- Where have you been?
- Sorry I was, I was just in the janitor's closet making out with my future stepbrother.
- Okay, we have to find Mindy.
- And before her plan goes into effect.
She is a really good chemist, you know?
Really good.
Oh my god, what is all this?
- Is she trying to poison the school?
- I wouldn't put it past her at this point.
What do you think this does?
- I don't, I don't...
- Expose the truth.
Nice.
Some best friend you are.
- I'm sorry, is the person who's building a chemical weapon questioning my integrity in this scenario?
- I figured it was about time somebody cut through all the bullshit so we could see who people really were.
- I told you you couldn't trust her.
- And now all of a sudden you're, you're,
- Yeah because between you and Whitney,
Whitney is the one who is acting less like an evil dictator.
- You are just jealous because I am the one who finally stood up to her, which is something that you've always been too scared to do.
- I'm turning you in.
- If you're not with me, you are my enemy.
- Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
I will do what I must.
- You will try.
(grunts)
No, no!
- Whitney, go get help.
- Eh no thanks. (giggles)

- You shall not pass!
(yelling)
- And the prom king is...
Louis Hammerschmidt?
(booing)
Wow, you guys suck at this.
- Make way or I'll have you drawn and quartered.

My fellow classmates,
I intend to rule you all with an iron but noble fist.
- No!

- And the prom queen is...
The lovely Miss Claire Stuart.
- That's you, go.
- Congratulations.
Oh wow, you look lovely.
- [Claire] Thank you.
- And let's let beauty and the beast regale us with a little dance.

- No, I got this.
(chuckles)
- Where have you been?
- In Europe, proms don't start until 11.
- Say you're sorry!
- Why couldn't you just be happy for me?
- Because you were too busy exploring your sexuality to attend to my emotional needs.
You knew how much MIT meant to me.
- You know what, I am sorry that for once in my life
I found a boy that is totally awesome and broodingly sexy.
Oh my god, Jodi, stop it.
- You think I'm totally awesome?
- Yeah.
- Cool, that's great.
- And I am really sorry that for once in your life your 10-year plan didn't go perfectly, but you know what, suck it up and deal with it like the rest of us!
- Oh ew, are you two gonna make out now?
- You know what, Whitney, shut up!
Even after all of the horrible crap that you put me through,
I still tried because I was stupid enough to feel bad for you.
- Do you think I actually care what these people think of me?
High school is over.
I just wanted you two to know before we all left that I won, that I will always win and whenever I want
I can take away that which you hold most dear and crush it and it barely took any push at all to turn you two into Cain and Abel.
Frankly, I think I did you a favor, otherwise this little horror show likely would have dragged on for another few years before you two cut your losses and moved on.
(solemn music)
- Maybe she's right.
It was stupid to think that we would still be friends after high school.
You're gonna do your thing, I'm gonna do mine and, and in 10 years we'll see each other at the reunion and smile.
Maybe that's the way it's supposed to be.
- If that's how you really feel, then maybe we should just stop avoiding the inevitable and end this right now.
- It is how I feel.
- Well that hurts.
(thudding) (gasping)
Not as bad as that.
Oh you gotta be kidding me.

And with that the revolution was over.
The police let me go, calling Lipschitzium a misguided but ultimately harmless prank.
- [Jodi] After a hefty suspension, Mindy returned to school and all the cliques returned to how they'd been before.
- Yep.
I drugged prom.
- Every scientist has one great regret.
Look at Oppenheimer.
- So I had time to do some thinking while I was in the clink.
It wasn't just an adolescent right of passage I ruined,
I destroyed all the good I did.
I had an opportunity to really change things and when it came down to it,
I was no different than Whitney Bennett.
- I'm not gonna tell you it was okay what you did.
But I understand.
It's hard feeling like you're giving your best and people don't value you.
There are always gonna be jerks.
That doesn't change after high school.
And you can spend your life trying to beat them or prove them wrong or get even with them, but that's all wasted energy.
What you need to do is figure out what and who is important to you and fight for that.
The rest doesn't matter.
(gentle music)
(excitedly hyperventilating)
(yells)
- Yes, yes!
(yells)
(elegant music)
- [Woman] Mr. Flemming.
(feet squeaking)
- Jodi Shallenberger, is it Jodi?
Jodi Shallenberger!
Oh my god!
(gasping)
I couldn't.
- What are you doing here?
(exhales heavily)
- I couldn't let you go in there without you knowing how proud I am of you.
- I got into MIT today and it didn't mean anything because you weren't there to celebrate with me.
I don't know how things got so messed up.
Okay no, I do know.
I went totally Dr. Strangelove.
But the thing you said about us being high school friends.
You're not my high school friend.
You're my best friend.
We're the radical two.
You will always know about the face plant I got that got me this dental bridge.
(laughs)
You will always know I prefer odd numbers to even.
I don't know where life will take us.
Hopefully, hopefully to the 2020 Grammy's and the first human settlement on Mars.
But it doesn't matter because all I know is that I want you in my life for all of it.
I am so sorry and I'm back.
(sobbing)
- I'm so sorry I was too busy exploring my sexuality.
- It's okay, sexuality is important.
- Oh my god.
Oh I am so glad you're here, you have no idea.
I'm totally freaking out.
- Look at me.
Remember science fair finals.
I was so nervous, I could almost puke on my bacteria cultures.
You made me do it.
- Okay.
Get yourself together, Jodi.
I think I know what we have to do.
- [Both] Oh!

- [Woman] Shh!
- As I stand before you...
- [Mindy] So high school was finally over.
- [Jodi] And maybe it was just the Stockholm syndrome talking, but for the first time I kind of felt like
I was gonna miss the place.
- [Mindy] We had tried so hard to tear down the entire system that we lost sight of what our high school really was, people, people on the inside, people on the outside,
people learning who they are.
- [Jodi] Who they want to be.
- [Mindy] Who they don't want to be.
- Are you serious?
- [Jodi] Because no matter who you are.
- [Mindy] The prom king, the Fashionista, or the future disgraced senator, high school is the same.
- [Jodi] It's the best of times.
- [Mindy] It's the worst of times.
Full of wonderful people and not so wonderful people.
- [Jodi] And it's once in a lifetime.
- [Mindy] And we made it through.
We're members of society, we have the diploma.
We can prove it to everyone.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well done.
- Well done to you too.
- I'll call you, Wellesley.
- All right, Penn State.
- You guys.
- Come on.

(laughter)
That was classic.
- Wait.
(students chattering)
(clears throat)
- Hi.
Mindy, Jodi, Claire, Virginia.
Sugar, I was wondering if you would perhaps honor me.
- I'll see you this week, Martin.
- Thank you.
- Hey, the heart wants whatever pasty, bespectacled thing the heart wants and don't you look so smug because you know what our next mission is, getting you your first date.
- Yes.
(claps)
(car horn blares)
- [Claire] That's me.
- I'll see you this week?
- Deal.
- Bye.
- That's my driver.
- Spill it.
What are you doing next year?
- Little of this, little of that.
I'm just gonna see where the wind takes me.
- That girl's going into the CIA.
- No doubt.
- You ready, Dolores?
(gasps)
- Don't even.
That woman birthed me.
She can call me whatever she wants.
- No problem, Dolores.
- Hey.
- Pound it, Dolores.
(laughs)
- We'll see you this summer, Dolores, yeah?
(grunts)
- We miss you already, Dolores!
- Love you, Dolores!
Really strong pound, Dolores.
So Martin and Dolores.
- [Jodi] Weird, right?
- [Mindy] Who'd have thunk it?
- We gotta...
- Oh!
Wait.
I almost forgot.
Open it.
- One economy class train ticket from Boston to New York City.
(laughs)
- Next year is going to be epic.
- Next year?
We still got the summer.
Summer go to my place.
- Oh you know it, whoo!

- [Woman] Fin.
Richard Nixon High wasn't the worst place to spend four years.
Well for the most part.
By and large, it was your average suburban high school full of self-segregated cliques and stereotypical angst, and at the top of the food chain, the rich and beautiful.
That's us.
In the background.
There's me, Mindy Lipschitz.
The assault victim.
And the girl with the Home Alone look on her face.
Oh thanks.
That's Jodi, my best friend.
We've been best friends since third grade.
I'm the one with the unfortunate eye patch.
As you can see, my school kind of sucked for us, and so did Jodi's aim.
Zombie fascist!
Intended target, Whitney Bennett, voted most likely to be charged with war crimes.
She was 5'7" of sculpted, flawless, sociopath.
Actual target.
Son of a...
Principal Whitmore, tormenting students since 1979.
So sorry!
And that's how this whole thing started, the rock that launched a revolution.
X-Files is on tonight.
Can't, I have homework.
What the F?
We get detention and Whitney does a hair flip and gets off scot-free.
Well if it makes you feel any better, in at least one of the infinite multiverses, she doesn't.
Hey, I know it seems like high school is the center of this universe right now.
Do not say it gets better.
Next year you'll be in nerdvana at MIT and I'll still be here serving quadruple bypass burgers at TGI Fridays.
Or you could be serving an entirely new and decidedly classier set in Boston when you come to live with me.
Great.
So in every multiverse you know of,
I'm still waiting tables.
That's awesome.
I gotta go.
I've got family jazzercise at five.
It's gonna get physical!
Good luck with that jazzercising!
I am in control!
Weirdo!
Maniac!
Hey Dad!
Hey hon.
Mm mmm something smells scrum-diddly-icious.
How was school?
Oh you know, legalized torture paid for by the American taxpayer.
Did you make the appointment with the college counselor?
Jodi, you're graduating this year.
I think it's time you figured out where you're headed.
Most likely into a menial job that doesn't pay a living wage so I can become a cog in the 21st century's version of serfdom.
When did you start speaking like Trotsky?
Look, I just want you to be happy.
I want you to find something that you love.
Follow your dreams.
So single 40-something postal carrier with a PEZ collection was what you put under your yearbook photo?
Hey, this PEZ collection is gonna be valuable one day and single and widow are two completely different things.
I know.
Dad, I mean it's been five years.
You know, you're not getting any younger.
Age is just a number.
That closely correlates with death.
You want me to start dating?
I just want you to find something you love, Herb.
Follow your dreams.
I'll find a date if you find a direction.
One of those things is a lot easier than the other.
It's not finding a date...
And it's not finding a direction.
All right, so here's a new song.
I hope you enjoy it and by you, I mean me because I would rather admit that Taylor Swift's music has touched my cold, dark heart than show it to anybody.
It's called Suburbageddon.
Bernoulli's theorem will be on test next week.
Uh hey Mindy, could you, uh, stick around for a nanosecond?
Oh, did my Spectro floato-meter malfunction.
I knew I should have gotten...
Hey, slow down, Sonic.
I spoke with my old roommate who is on the alumni board at MIT and she agreed to set up a special interview for you.
Are you serious?
As a radiation leak.
Oh my god, this is perfect.
Okay, next step is the interview, then get in obviously, get first pick for all my classes, graduate with honors and then it will set me up for one of the more prestigious graduate programs.
Mindy, one step at a time.
College is about more than just classes and grades.
It's about exploring, having fun.
I remember staying up all night with my friends solving proofs, cracking equations.
It was pretty wild.
But some of my best memories are just hanging out, meeting new people, living on the edge.
God I miss college.
Well in my experience, meeting new people usually leads to relentless mockery by said people.
Don't you think that's a little pessimistic.
Give people a chance.
They can often surprise you.
That is a point worth considering, Mr. Samuels.
Go forth.
Go!
The world is ready to embrace you.
Boo loser.
Eventually.
Since Mr. Samuels was basically my real-life Yoda,
I knew he was right.
He'd proven it was time to give people a chance.
I think we should ask Whitney to stop torturing us.
Did you forget to wear your gas mask in lab again?
Whitney's a person too, right?
If we approach her like confident, mature adults, she will respect us and then we can coexist in peace.
Of all the douche-nozzles in this school,
Whitney is the worst.
She hasn't been that horrible.
What the?
Okay fine.
But it's this or suffer from abject humiliation for the rest of the year.
So I said to her if you don't stay away from Rick,
I will call the police and say that you molested my hat and you have to register for that.
I'm here.
Took you long enough.
One center cut rare, three meatball subs, extra sauce, a hard boiled egg and a kombucha.
I'm going to die a virgin and you don't even care.
Shh.
Are you guys selling band candy or something?
Actually, no.
We were wondering if we could talk to Whitney for a second.
Do you have an appointment?
It's fine, Mackenzie.
I want to hear what Bill Nye and the lesbian have to say.
Hello.
We know that there has been some bad blood between us throughout the years, but we are seniors now and there is no reason why we can't finish off the school year being civil to each other.
We thought that if we came and spoke to you like adults, we could come to some sort of mutually beneficial agreement.
Wow.
I applaud your courage.
Okay.
Wait what?
It didn't occur to me until this exact moment that I kind of respect you.
You didn't change yourself to blend in, which is much more than can be said for the rest of these automatons.
Well I'm glad we could come to this understanding.
Actually, Colin's throwing a party this Saturday.
You should come.
Thank you for coming.
Friends don't let friends drive drunk.
Ow.
The mean attractiveness of this party is statistically significant.
How do I look?
Soccer mom goes to the Olive Garden.
I guess we should...
Colin!
Oh perfect.
Thank you for hosting us.
You have a lovely home.
My mom says never come to a party empty handed.
Sweet.
Oh.
Have fun, baby.
Hey bro, we got next game.
Oh my god.
Is that really how I just saw my first human penis?
See, we are diversifying our portfolio of high school experiences already.
That contains Colin's urine.
Hey.
MIT and what was it?
How's it going, guys?
Well we haven't been roofied yet so.
Wow.
Aren't you enchanting?
This is her trying to be nice.
I'm hoping to get time off from this conversation for good behavior.
You're funny, Wellesley.
Thanks, Penn State.
I'm Dave by the way.
We were lab partners sophomore year.
Um Mandy.
Mindy.
Mindy like...
- Like Mindy.
- Like Mindy, cool.
Any reason it would be awkward for me not to know your name?
Not unless you're an avid follower of the piccolo section in the school marching band.
Ah I'm more of a tuba section guy myself.
Well then I'm Jodi.
Hi.
There you guys are.
Welcome to the 1%.
- Follow me.
- Our pleasure.
Good luck!
Cool, right?
Mackenzie!
Go fetch some drinks for our guests of honor, please.
Oh that's not, not.
Dorks, balls now.
They want you to play pong.
Like ping?
No, beer.
Oh.
Thank you.
Boom!
Drink.
I think it's gone bad.
No, that's just what beer tastes like.
I don't lose.
- You did it!
- Yeah!
Excuse me!
Hello everyone.
Can I have your attention please?
Shh!
Whitney would like to say a few words.
As you may have noticed, we have some new additions tonight,
Jodi Shallenberger and Mindy Lipschitz.
Shit lips!
Not so funny after four years.
Now, most of us walk past these two and have never bothered to get to know them.
So I put together a little video of our very own Jodi so we could all learn a bit more about her.
Someone's ballin'.
Who's Jodi?
Oh.
Well any requests?
♪ Ooh eczema, I'm gonna vanquish ya ♪
Yow!
Oh you're such a good kisser.
I'd party down with you any time, Adam Scott.
Oh my god.
You know how there are the birds and there are the bees.
How familiar are you with male anatomy?
Oh my god, Dad, I am 17.
Hon, got your tampons.
Dad!
No, I need maximum flow.
I told you, Dad!
Oh no!
Jodi, wait!
You're all mean!
Jodi!
You're late.
How epic was prank eight?
I want to be you when I grow up.
If you're going to be in power next year, this is your new Bible, the 48 Laws of Power.
I suggest you heed law number one.
Never outshine the master.
Your lawnmower man is like so happy.
Don't wave!
Mackenzie, drive.

Hey, Jodi.
It's me, your best friend.
Um I'm at school right now and you know, it is really, really not that bad.
Oy vey.
Oh my god, have you seen Jodi's Instagram feed?
Someone tagged a photo of her on a box of tampons.
- That is really not right.
- Oh my god.
That prank was pretty twisted, Whitney.
Even for you.
I mean, how mental do you have to be to put that much effort into messing with a couple of nerds who were just trying to make peace?
All I had to do was teach myself how to hack a webcam, figure out Jodi's IP address and then trick her into responding to a spyware email I learned how to write.
You guys are demonic.
You're like medieval to each other.
I will not allow Big Bang Theory and her frizzy-haired lap dog to roam the halls of this school thinking that for one second they are my equal.
Law 15, crush your enemy totally.
Right.
Oh Jodi, coming in.
Remember that only my opinion matters.
Hey, I brought you something.
I brought you my favorite book on Tesla, who was also totally defeated and humiliated in his lifetime and has since regained popularity and had a resurgence of respect.
Also brought some cookies.
They'll be good in an hour.
And a mint.
Yeah!
Oh.
You know, one day we are gonna look back on this and it is going to be...
Uh just stop, Mindy.
I told you this was gonna happen.
People like Whitney don't change.
God, I knew I shouldn't have clicked on that attachment.
New Tina Fey series, piccolo players wanted.
Okay, all right.
No, no.
No.
We're not accepting defeat.
Do we accept defeat?
No.
We are gonna win this one.
I'm sure you understand the definition of winning.
This...
Not winning.
Hey.
I am serious.
We are gonna stand up for ourselves.
Yeah?
And how exactly are we gonna do that?
By beating those fascists at their own game.
We're gonna be popular.
And not lame top 40 popular, awesome popular.
All of us.
All of the people they have treated like second class citizens and then copied their calculus homework.
Popular people don't take calculus.
I know because they are stupid dolts who are gonna go to below average Universities and get mediocre grades and still end up being our bosses unless we do something about it right now.
Just like that, we're gonna overthrow generations of ingrained high school social strata?
Yes.
Is there anything we have ever put our minds to that we have not accomplished?
Well we didn't get Firefly back on the air.
Shh!
Besides getting Firefly back on the air.
Then...
No.
Let's do this.
Boom!
And so it was.
The revolution was born.
And Tina Fey, if you're listening,
I'd still play piccolo for you.
Power to the peons.
The facts were simple.
There were more of us than there were of them.
So all we had to do was convince the outsiders, misfits and weirdos of the school to ban together.
Basically we were gonna unionize the outcasts.
Power to the peons.
Oh wait.
Unfortunately, it wasn't that simple.
Oh!
Well that was a lucky shot.
- Gross, but lucky.
- Yeah.
Power to the peons!
Hi guys.
I am Claire, ambassador troop 2579.
Welcome, Claire.
I like where your horse head's at.
Going straight Godfather, huh?
It's a unicorn for my spirit animal badge.
You do realize that this is a meeting to launch a social revolution.
Yup, I'm in.
Whatever you guys need.
Oh great.
Well why don't you take a seat inside and we will be with you shortly.
Yay!
What the hell?
We talked to pretty much every misfitoy in this school and the only thing we have to show for it is Marcia Brady.
Hey, all revolutions have to start somewhere.
Oh my god, Sugar Jones incoming 12 o'clock.
No eye witnesses.
Activate shield.
I hear you're trying to obliterate the jackhole normative power hierarchy of this pathetic excuse for a school.
Well obliterate is kind of extreme, but yeah.
I'm in.
Okay, we may be small in number, but we're all here for a reason, right?
Right.
- Wait, why are we here?
- Jesus.
If this is all we got to show,
I say we just burn this mother down and be done with it.
Arson sounds like a fabulous plan.
But if we need to get more people, we could go door to door like I do with cookies.
It's an excellent way to bond with people in a place where they feel comfortable being themselves.
Screw Girl Scout cookies, an obvious conspiracy to subjugate girls and force them into traditional gender roles by selling overpriced, unremarkable, and nutritionally-deficient baked goods.
We suck at this.
This isn't a revolution, this is a girl band.
We need someone who can work the system,
Karl Rove good witch style.
Wait.
Virginia.
As president of the History,
Young Democrats,
Multi United Nations Club, I am...
Virginia Vanderkamp had locked up most likely to succeed in third grade.
Our junior year, Virginia launched the culmination of all her hard work, a campaign for student council president.
She had a well-oiled political machine and several key endorsements.
Vote for me, Virginia.
- Do you want a pin?
- Hey Twilight, go Kyle.
But despite her best efforts, she lost...
- ...to Kyle McDevon.
- Chipotle burritos, yeah!
Whose campaign speech consisted of giving out free Chipotle gift cards.
You want a burrito, Virginia?
And spectacular abs.
Oh yeah!
After a crushing defeat, she went where many a depressed and disgruntled American has gone before,
France.
Needless to say, she didn't come back from summer break the same.
What's your shirt say?
Hell is other people.
Next.
Oh this girl definetely owns a pony.
Does anyone else feel underdressed?
Speak.
Hi, Virginia.
This is Mindy Lipschitz, Jodi Shallenberger,
Sugar Jones and Claire the Girl Scout.
We were trying to upend the social hierarchy of our school.
Or destroy it.
And we could use your help.
I'm not interested in your futile attempts to make sense of the world's chaos.
Be gone.
We were actually thinking more along the lines of revenge.
What?
We tried to talk to all the different groups, but nobody wanted to join the cause.
Well of course not.
You think all the outcasts are the same, but really we're like snowflakes, snowflakes that hate each other.
Let me break it down for you.
You've got your basic overachievers, your underachievers, your emos, your goths, your bandos, your drama dorks, orchestra oddballs and gleeks.
Then there are kids lost in middle earth, kids lost in space, kids who take up too much space, your steampunk, cyber punk, classic punk, kids with foreign parents, kids who are parents,
Twihards, kids who try too hard, kids who write binary, kids who reject the gender binary, gamers, stoners, loners, anarchists, activists, masochists, and atheists.
There are more strains of loser out there than the herpes virus.
Uniting them under one banner, that is no easy task.
So we're screwed.
I said it wasn't easy, I didn't say it was impossible.
What is this place?
It used to be my campaign headquarters.
Prior to that it was used by my father to house his miniature horse collection.
Prior to that it was used by my schizophrenic grandfather to interrogate imaginary communists.
He won an imaginary medal for that.
Man, rich white people are messed up.
When I was running for office,
I did a little research on the voters.
So this is where the NSA stores its data.
These files represent the entire student body.
Each one of them contains your standard class list,
GPA, activities, hobbies, psychological profile, past and current lovers, and most importantly weaknesses.
No effing way.
Point of weakness, Tina Fey piccolo.
Geeze, am I that transparent?
Overtly aggressive, lack of impulse control militant with anarchist undertones.
Nice.
Latent Napoleonic tendencies.
What does yours say, Claire?
It just says Girl Scout.
What's in your file, Virginia?
I don't have any weaknesses.
These three files represent the king pins of the school's underclass.
Convince them and you have a shot at this thing.
The key is figuring out what makes people tick and then exploiting it mercilessly.
I like you, Virginia even if you are named after a slave state.
First up, Howard Chang, leader of the young entrepreneurs.
Points of weakness, black mock turtlenecks, technology savvy women and the word billion.
I get what you guys are going for.
I think it's very innovative, but it's just not right for us.
We're working on an app right now that's gonna blow up.
Asiavous, Facebook for Asians.
And besides, I've got to look to the future, not worry about high school.
I still have to get into Harvard, then drop out of Harvard before I can start my first company.
Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels.
You can quote them or disagree with them, but the only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things.
Do you know who said that?
Apple and that is why they make billions.
Next is Martin Vimmel, head of the Science Fiction Club.
Points of weakness, hard sci-fi, the sound of his own voice and very aggressive women.
Okay, here's the deal.
Just because you're a science geek, doesn't mean we're your comrades in arms.
Science is about what is.
Any idiot can do that.
Science-fiction is about what could be.
We're huge Dr. Who fans.
Yeah, the Matt Smith years completely turned the series around.
Completely.
Tell you what, give me the title of one Neal Stephenson novel, just one, and I'll join your little group.
You think skinny, anemic fanboys have a monopoly on the one fictional genre where women and people of color get to exist outside of backwards societal norms and traditional confinements?
Not to mention a genre largely premised on the idea that future dystopia is the inevitable outcome of the current system of patriarchal excess?
Idiot.
Oh and Cryptonomicon, Snow Crash, Anathem.
Should I go on?
Louis Hammerschmidt, leader of the Fantasy Club.
Points of weakness, Elven languages, heroic aspirations and any woman.
Whitney Bennett is the Cersei Lannister of high school.
You guys are idiots if you think you can play the Game of Thrones with her.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to end up like Ned Stark.
Louis, think of it like this.
What if Frodo hadn't left the Shire and fought against the Dark Lord?
Louis.
Thanks for the ride.
I'm really glad I'm helping you guys with this whole thing.
I've always admired you.
Really?
Why?
You're just so unapologetic for who you are.
That's been a recurring problem.
So when did you know?
That I rubbed people the wrong way?
I haven't heard that one before, but yeah.
Um you know, I guess it was pretty obvious since
I was a kid, but I really hit my stride in middle school.
I rub people the wrong way too.
I mean, I haven't actually yet.
But I want to someday.
First I have to figure out how to tell them.
That you're rude and obnoxious?
That I'm gay.
Wait what?
It's so great to talk to somebody who's already out.
You're like my hero.
When you walked through the school with that sign on your back announcing that you were gay,
I could not believe how brave you were.
Okay first of all, someone put that sign on my back as a prank and secondly, why does everyone think I'm gay?
You do wear a lot of vests.
Huh.
I'm sorry, I just, I thought that...
No, it's okay.
I'm really glad that you told me.
So...
When did you know?
I think it finally clicked when I realized
I didn't just love Veronica Mars,
I loved Veronica Mars.
Preach.
I will, I will see you at school in the halls.
You know and say hi to me.
- See you later.
- See you.
Things are happening, Herb.
Things are happening.
Yes they are.
New York Performing Arts School.
Deal's a deal.
I have a date with Carol and you have a date with destiny.
Find love today.
Things are happening.
Raise your hand if you've ever eaten lunch in a bathroom stall.
Been made fun of because of your weight, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or knowledge of the periodic table of elements.
Well it's time we did something about it.
It's time you got to the point.
It's been 42 seconds and I still don't know your product, your plan or your profit point.
If you want to endlessly pontificate start a blog.
We have a blog.
Oh no, here comes angry black girl.
Oh I'm not angry because I'm black.
I'm angry because I'm paying attention.
All we're saying is that if we don't stick together, we have no chance of standing up to the evil empire.
What you're proposing is like the Rebel Alliance.
Star Wars, classic sci-fi.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I think Star Wars technically constitutes fantasy.
Uh in what galaxy?
It's an archetypal hero's quest.
That's fantasy.
Um yeah, set in a technologically advanced society with space ships.
And sword fighting.
Light sabers are not swords.
What about the Force?
That's magic.
Which was scientifically explained by midichlorians.
Are you actually citing the prequels to me right now?
Why do we have two sci-fi nerds here?
He's sci-fi, I'm fantasy.
It's totally different.
Totally different.
But neither of you get laid, right?
This is exactly the problem.
What is a popular person?
What makes them different from us?
Attractiveness.
Flawless skin.
A large number of followers.
Wrong.
That's what they want you to think because they need you to believe that it's hard to be popular.
The only difference between them and us is that they are unified.
So while we're sitting here tearing each other apart over who would win in a battle between Batman and Green Lantern.
- Batman.
- Green Lantern.
They're sitting pretty and ruling our school.
So what are you asking for, blind loyalty, that we just pretend we're all friends?
No, not blind loyalty, real loyalty.
We all have something in common.
We've been kept on the outskirts of a school that we help make great and...
We are the movers and the shakers.
We are the club presidents and the innovators.
We are the ones with our hands on the beating pulse of otherness that make America the best effing country in the GD world.
So I say let's stop bending over and taking it and stand together.
And so it began, our Independence Day.
At first, the changes were small, a smile here,
a random act of non-douche baggery there.
In shared struggles, former enemies forged new alliances.
Lactards unite.
Some of us learned the ancient art of not getting our asses kicked.
So I'll try not to hurt you too...
Some of us combined forces to design innovative solutions to age-old problems.
What's up, turtleneck?
I lost my iPhone and I'm gonna need yours.
You've got five seconds to hand it over.
What the hell is that?
What are you gonna do, Dildo Baggins?
Hi-yah!
Get him!
Smells like Comic Con in here anyway.
Yes!
And once the outcasts became a united front, the rest of the school fell like dominoes.
Political power, check.
Never getting picked last again.
Come on!
Check.
You guys can suck it!
And that is why the singularity is near.
Debate tournaments were in.
Organized sports were out.
And slowly, things began to actually change.
Dork was the new popular.
Ow!
We couldn't believe it.
Every flavor of weirdo was breaking bread together.
We should do something to celebrate how awesome we are.
Yeah, even the goths look kind of happy.
Guys, we just pulled off the bloodless coup of the century and it is...
Probably just a phase or something.
Like I herd Mercury is supposedly going renegade.
Here's the truth.
One day, I will be in a place where power isn't determined by acned suburban subliterates and that place will be Princeton.
But for now, I have to cater to these morons who apparently think pretending they're popular actually means they're popular.
What's law number five?
Much depends on our reputation.
Guard it with our life, get it?
We are our reputation.
So right now I'd say it's pretty clear that we are...
Mmm toast.
The thing about power is when you don't have it, someone else does.
So you say phase and I say insurrection and if Stalin taught us anything, the only response to insurrection is to crush it.
Quickly.
Stephanie, purple is definetely your color.
Chase, good luck on that first chair open audition.
Sarah, your Blanche DuBois was transcendental.
Hey, you, me, Magic the Gathering.
Fifth period, whoo!
Oh Mr. Samules.
Methane!
I'm just goofing.
Oh well.
Nice balls, Milton.
Shenanigans.
Geez, like Pandora's box opened up and it was filled with weirdos and losers.
Oh what's that?
Yup.
Every scientist needs an arch nemesis.
He's right though.
The school does seem different lately.
You have anything to do with that?
I can neither prove nor disprove that hypothesis.
Well whoever is responsible,
I can't help but thinking it is exactly the type of person who would go over like gangbusters in an MIT interview.
Gangbusters.
I don't know, I've got it narrowed down to two.
I've got maroon and black and I'm not sure which goes better with my dickey, but my dickey kind of goes with everything and I keep thinking what would Neil deGrasse Tyson do, but then again I'm not Neil deGrasse Tyson,
but then again.
Mindy, Mindy, stop worrying.
They'd be Darwin Award grade morons not to take you.
I keep imagining how great it would be next year, me at MIT, you coming to live with me in Boston.
Um Mindy, there's something I've...
Oh oh!
Okay, I gotta go, that's my mom.
Wish me luck.
Good luck.
But then in ninth grade, the Young Astronomers Association selected me for the Rising Star Award, which I accepted despite the lazy pun and then in 10th grade, I won second prize at the state science fair for my project anisotropic versus isotropic materials.
Okay Mindy, it's clear that you're a really talented scientist.
Great grades, great test scores.
But what makes you tick?
What makes you special?
Like okay, when I was at MIT,
I was a member of the Hacks, right.
Learned more from pulling off those pranks than in any class I took so.
Well as I mentioned,
I am president of the School Science Club and a national merit scholar and I can recite the entire periodic table of elements.
Would you like me to?
I can do it.
There's antimony, arsenic, aluminum, selenium and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium and nickel, neodymium, neptunium, germanium and iron, americium, ruthenium, uranium, europium, zirconium, lutetium, vanadium
and lanthanum and osmium and astatine and radium and gold and protactinium and indium and gallium...
And iodine and thorium and thulium and thallium.
There's...
Hey.
I saw you dancing.
What's going on?
What you listening to?
Um Bowie.
What's that, Nickelback?
Oh yeah, huge Nickelback fan.
Love it.
Canadian icons.
You like Carole King?
It makes me feel like a natural woman.
Who can't relate to that, you know what I mean?
Let's not forget that the last time I saw you, you and your friends orchestrated the most humiliating moment of my life.
Yeah, okay.
First of all, I'm sorry.
I had no idea that was gonna happen.
Do you think that anyone knows what's going on in American Psycho Barbie's head?
No and second of all, that stuff was not humiliating.
Except in all the ways that it was humiliating.
I'm surprised you didn't change schools.
But here look, hey, positive side.
Eczema song, knocked it out the park.
- Can you just not?
- Rickets.
Do you have a song about rickets for my grandad?
He's got rickets.
I don't, I don't get it.
I guess you wouldn't get it, you're a young woman, very healthy.
No.
I mean, you know, you seem like you aren't a completely heinous human being and have at least a modicum of a soul.
That is the sweetest thing that anyone's ever said to me.
Thank you.
How can you hang out with Adolf Whitler?
Look, trust me, I know how awful she is.
What you think you have a copyright on teen angst?
It's high school, we're all put into a box and marginalized.
Look at me, I hang out with Colin.
I've known Colin since the second grade.
The guy is, he's an idiot.
But what am I supposed to do?
Not all of us have the guts to stage a full-scale rebellion.
Mindy's the brains behind the operation.
You just write the theme music?
Look um, for what it's worth,
I'm glad you didn't transfer schools.
My hand's on your shoulder.
Full contact, shoulder touching.
Pound it, blow it up.
- Explosion.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Oh um by the way,
Bowie totally made weird awesome.
Check mate.
Killing it.
People think pretty girls can't be smart, but it's like don't pigeon hold me.
Uh don't you mean pigeon hole?
Ew, what's a pigeon hole?
What's a pigeon hold?
It's like if you hold onto a pigeon, it can't fly away.
- Yeah.
- It's like let me fly.
Where the hell is everyone?
Hey Mackenzie, look at that.
You like that?
I think everyone's at the lame party.
Really?
That's awesome.
What the hell is your problem, hmm?
You know what my problem is?
You're uh you're super evil.
You're like African rebel group dictator evil and I can't do it anymore.
So I think I'm gonna check out the lame party where I hear the hosts aren't total ass hats.
You'll fit right in.
I think I'm gonna go to that party too.
It sounds like there's girls there.
Dude.
I think someone should probably scope it out too.
You know, like do some double agent shenans.
Mackenzie!
Hey, so what's in this anyway?
My own personal secret blend of choice chemicals and a dash of genius.
I call it Lipschitz and giggles.
You're right, I do have the vague urge to laugh.
Whoa, looks like I picked the right party.
Oh Dan, right?
- Dave.
- Dave, Dave like..
- Like Dave.
- Like Dave.
So do you know anyone who can get me into the Whitney protection program?
Oh my god.
Tell me everything.
And for you.
Who wants Lipshots?
So Principal Whitmore gave you two months detention for protesting the summer reading list?
I always heard it was because you threw a flash bomb into glee club.
That was just a rumor I started.
Well we should organize a protest.
What do you know about protesting, Pollyanna?
I know you think Girl Scouts are silly, but the whole point is to empower girls so we can change the world.
You know, Gloria Steinem, Hilary Clinton, and Sandra Day O'Connor were all Girl Scouts.
Hmm maybe you're not as "puppies and unicorns" as you seem.
I thought I would be just better at jousting,
I don't know, like 'cause of a reach thing 'cause I have long arms.
'Cause you got those long, spindly ones.
Thank you, spindly ones, sure.
Oh whoa, there's a piano here.
You know what that means.
Will you write any new songs?
You know what, I actually just wrote one in my head called "Our Party is Way Better Than Your Party."
It's weird.
Thank you, it's nice.
Sweet.
Actually...
I am working on one now.
But um...
It's stupid.
Oh I will be the judge of that.
Sit down.
Do I have to?
Yeah, yeah you're gonna have to play a song for me.
Sorry.
I can't believe you're making me do this.
All right.
♪ On the outskirts going nowhere ♪
♪ But I've heard that the truth is out there ♪
♪ I just hope one day I can show ♪
♪ There is more here than what they know ♪
And that's all I have.
That was all you?
That was great, are you kidding me?
That was awesome.
That was really good.
Thanks.
I was just thinking for the chorus.
What if it went.
Wow, I didn't know you played.
I don't like to let people behind the candelabra.
It's my secret place.
So when do I get to hear the rest of your songs?
Maybe...
Some time.
Later, maybe later, maybe later.
Hey, oh.
Oh hey guys.
Um I just wanted to let you know that they're reenacting the Battle of Trafalgar out on the beach.
So...
Awesome, let's do that.
That's way better than...
Naval battle, huh?
Hmm?
I think I speak for everyone when I say that Saturday's shindig was one of the best, nay, the best party of all time.
Here here.
Now, does anyone have anything to bring to the council's attention?
Upcoming events, seminar ideas?
Yes.
Sugar and I did some research and it turns out...
What about sabotaging the lacrosse team.
We've finally established strategic dominance.
Now is the time to exploit our advantage and those guys had it coming.
A few tablets of Ex-Lax in the team's water coolers and their bowels will explode like krypton.
Do you think Steve Jobs became the greatest visionary of all time by being satisfied with creating the iMac?
He changed it up and created the iPod, then the iPhone, then the iPod touch, then...
I got it, I got it.
I guess a little explosive diarrhea never hurt anyone.
Yes!
Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
Hey, want to play Settlers of Catan?
Oh I can't.
My dad's new lady friend is coming over with her kid so we can all meet each other even though it's only their second date.
Well that sounds fun.
All right, you guys gotta go.
You know how my parents feel about organized labor, so.
Right.
Oh god.
What do I do?
Is it too neat?
Is my hair too neat?
Should I mess it up?
I mean, don't the ladies like it messy?
Oh, Herb.
Sweet, sweet Herb.
Listen, you haven't dated in awhile so I feel the need to tell you that at your age, women aren't super concerned with the way you style your hair as much as they are impressed that you still have hair.
Oh no.
Relax.
Awkward doesn't suit you.
Yes.
No awkward.
Okay.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You must be David, of course you are.
Who else would you be?
You wouldn't bring a date to dinner, right?
I'm Herb.
Uh uh David, this is my daughter Jodi.
Jodi, David.
Jodi, Carol, Carol, Jodi.
David, Carol, Herb, Jodi.
Everybody knows each other.
Introductions out of the way.
Come into the house please.
This is the way in.
♪ Boom shaka laka laka ♪
♪ Boom shaka laka laka boom ♪
♪ Shaka laka laka boom ♪
Jodi, it's Mindy.
Call me.
I suggested hey, why not take the shorts up an inch above the knee.
They said no, but with respect they said no.
Um I also have made...
Hey, guys.
Just give me these, give me these.
You guys are done, right?
- Not quite, but.
- Mom's done, Mom's done.
Sure, thank you.
That's good.
Hey, hey.
What if they get married?
Then we almost committed stepcest.
Hey, you were the one who went in for the kiss.
No, no way.
You were practically undressing me with your eyes.
Undressing you?
Are you 40?
Mister oh I don't let many people behind the candelabra.
Fine, we'll just chalk it up to equal parts creepy.
I don't know where this goes.
So...
Friends it is?
Yeah, in the interest of not having our family tree go in a circle friends.
I'm sorry, I realize referencing having children with you makes it more creepy.
Yeah, it did.
I got an operation plan to Photoshop the cheerleaders' yearbook picture.
Can I get the green light?
I don't care, do what you want.
I have been looking for you all day.
Oh my god, last night was like the seventh circle of awkwardness.
I called you.
I know.
It was insane.
I got waitlisted at MIT.
Wait, wha, wha?
No, no, no, there's gotta be a mistake.
Hey, I want names.
It doesn't matter.
Hey, guess who's coming to dinner?
We're joking.
Hey, did you hear?
Actually not.
- Um...
- Not a good time.
Her dad and my mom, they're like totally dating now.
That's crazy.
Oh hey, side point.
I found a perfect song for your audition.
Audition?
Thanks Dave, I'll take it from here.
It's just for a performing arts school.
In Boston?
In New York.
I was gonna tell you.
It's no big deal.
Of course it's a big deal.
I'm sure you'll get in and it's a good thing you've got Dave to help you with your audition.
Mindy, don't be mad.
I gotta go.
Yep.
Hey, we'll talk later, okay?
Sorry.
It's fine, let's just go.
Mindy Lipschitz, please report to the principal's office.
This is an all new level.
Stealing chemicals and lab equipment from the school?
Come on, Les, Mindy is one of my best students.
She would never do that.
Really?
Why don't you have a look-see.
Okay, well that one is clearly Photoshopped.
- Mindy.
- Well guess what.
You're out of the science club forever.
- This must be some mistake.
- Save it, sweater vest.
Luckily, we still have students like Whitney Bennett who had the courage to bring this sick delinquency to my attention.
Get out of my office.
Mr. Samuels.
Why didn't you defend me?
What do you want me to do, Mindy?
You went to MIT, the greatest academic institution in the known universe and you're still being bullied by an overgrown frat boy.
Oh my god, you totally broke her.
Law 42, strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter.
Straight back to you.
Are you sure you want this?
I want it.
So phase change in pressure.
Can anyone tell me what the exception to the rule of...
Brothers and sisters, it is time to open your eyes.
Whitney Bennett, for four years she has crafted a meticulous image as the rich girl who had it all.
Well brothers and sisters,
Whitney Bennett is not who you thought.
The mansion her family supposedly lives in, try the servants' quarters.
Her father, the hedge fund manager, these are the only hedges he's ever managed.
The mother who works in fashion, only if this constitutes working in the fashion industry.
Her older brother getting a master's in business at Wharton.
The only business he's mastered is delivering pizzas.
The truth is revealed.
The only reason Whitney was always so intent on exposing all of your weaknesses was so that you would never discover hers.
Whitney Bennett is a liar.
Dude.
What was that?
That was our revenge over Whitney.
You do realize that you just did the same thing to her that she did to me.
Exactly, it's called revenge.
I don't get what your problem is.
This is what you wanted.
We set out to change things and we did it.
We won.
It doesn't feel like we won.
It feels like we're becoming the things that we used to hate.
My whole life I played by the rules.
I did all my homework,
I colored in the bubbles with my number two pencils and what did it get me?
Teased, tortured, ignored, waitlisted.
Do you know what turning the other cheek gets you?
Two black eyes.
The old Mindy...
Was a pushover who thought she was gonna go to MIT, engineer the perfect hydrogen fuel cell and get an element named after her.
Lipschitzium can still happen.
If you have a problem with what you're doing, you should do something about it.
If this is what it is...
Then I'm out.
So we had succeeded in creating a new world order at Richard Milhous Nixon High.
Turns out power is a potent drug and with Whitney publicly humiliated and officially dethroned, the underlings of our school had now become its overlords.
Dude, that was amazing.
I'm registered as a lethal weapon.
Well this sucks.
I told you we should have just burned this mother down.
Here here.
Has anyone seen Whitney?
Oh she's gone AWOL.
I never thought I'd feel bad for someone who affectionately references Stalin.
Now we should shove his head into a toilet.
You know what I'm saying?
Look, I never meant for things to go down like that.
Oh come on, don't tell me you're not having a dorkgasm over this.
Google alert, you did the same thing to me and did I go into hiding?
But your threshold for humiliation was already so high.
No wait, I, I'm, s-s-s...
Were you trying to apologize?
It just gets stuck in my throat.
But I know you're right, okay.
You're right.
Okay.
Thanks.
I'm going to cut right to the chase.
I intend to rule this school next year.
But the only way you become the best is by working for the best.
I thought that was Whitney, but apparently I was wrong.
I won't pretend to like your fashion choices.
But you've got a lot to teach me and I'd like to offer my services as your intern for the rest of the school year.
Prom is almost here and we still don't have a theme.
So I'd like you to rally your various factions to back my proposal for Ender's prom.
Support my bid for prom king,
I vote for whatever theme you want.
Wait, I'm running for prom king.
I'm the only one who knows how to wield a sword effectively.
Whoa whoa whoa.
I thought we were letting Colin win so we could prank him.
No, we never went over that.
I'm going to be king.
Um no, you're not gonna be king, I'm gonna be king.
Mindy, I am willing to make you queen with a five-year no-beheading clause.
A no beheading clause?
As I sat there listening,
I realized how ridiculous it all was.
We had pretended we cared about coming together, but in the end people only cared about themselves.
Even best friends.
So it had all been a lie, which was fitting since when you think about it most of high school is a lie.
Everyone faking it, trying to act cooler or smarter or older or just more sure of themselves than they really are and I couldn't help but think wouldn't it be nice for once if people just told the truth.
So you're going to drug prom?
That makes it sound so serious.
Lipschitzium is a very mild form of truth serum in gaseous form.
Think of it like a very smart person's version of spiking the punch, okay?
Oh I'm fine with you drugging prom.
So what changed your mind about working with me?
You may be a duplicitous opportunist, but at least you're honest about what you want.
Hmm.
Thank god you're back.
Do you know what it was like being the only hot person in this school?
The army of dorkness is multiplying faster than the Kardashians.
Oh!
Sorry, habit.
So are you going to prom?
Hell no.
Hey Whitney, can your dad mow my lawn?
You have a message from Mom.
Make sure you drive safely to school, honey.
You'll know.
Love, Mommy.
I'm sorry you had to see that.
You don't need a date to go to prom.
The date, the dress, the revelry.
I don't even know where to begin with my hatred.
And anyways, Mindy and I had always planned on doing a Star Wars marathon on prom night.
13.24 hours prequels and all.
I get it, it's just...
What?
I had a chat with Mackenzie.
She's apparently Mindy's intern now and she wouldn't tell me anything, but it sounds like Mindy's planning some sort of crazy prank at prom.
Guess she's not done getting her revenge.
Why are they fighting on a hovercraft above molten lava?
Well Herb, I'll tell you.
Obi-Wan here is just trying to be a good friend and to keep Anakin from acting like a total jackhole, but Anakin is more interested in making a stupid power play than in hanging out with his best friend.
Hmm I don't know.
It seems to me Obi-Wan is being pretty brave, standing up for the fate of the universe and trying to help out his friend who seems to be going through maybe a rough time.
Even if Obi-Wan ends up having to chop off his best friend's legs and his best friend ends up turning into some mouth-breathing, goth cyborg who eventually kills him?
Yeah, even then.
Jodi.
There's one thing that I do know.
Nothing great ever happens when you're sitting on the sidelines.
Shit.
I gotta go to prom.
Thanks, Dad.
Jodi, I am your father.
Your founding father.
I really hope this isn't genetic.
Dad, are there any old clothes in Mom's closet I can wear?
Wow.
What a vision.
Just got off the phone with Carol.
Dave doesn't have a date either.
So she's gonna bring him over here so you guys can carpool.
Dad!
It's fine.
You're just carpooling.
It's not gonna be awkward at all.
You guys, come on, squeeze in over here.
Grab her waist.
She's not your sister.
And...
Perfect.
All right, see ya.
All right, so I'm just gonna go.
Shh!
Okay the coast is clear, let's go.
We are so Breaking Bad right now.
Hey Colin.
Who came up with this theme anyway?
The patriarchy.
You back in?
Wanna bust a move?
Fine, whatever.
You gotta get up to get down.
I think I might actually be a PC.
Maybe my therapist is right.
I am dating my father.
Is there any way to deny that all human suffering originates from human desire?
Unless the only way to end suffering is to end desire.
But the illogical and futile nature of desire will inevitably win out over our rational nature.
This punch...
Is good.
I know that everybody loves Harry, but I can certainly appreciate Zayn's brooding charm, but for my money, Liam is the unsung hero of One Direction.
I find everything about you repulsive, yet I'm strangely drawn to you.
That is the nicest thing a girl has ever said to me.
I love you, man.
Yes homo.
I find myself incredibly attracted to you despite that pantsuit.
This is awesome.
Thank you, Adam Scott.
Hey um...
I really like you.
I really like.
Damn it.
Um I gotta go.
I'll find you later.
Promise?
Hey.
Where have you been?
Sorry I was, I was just in the janitor's closet making out with my future stepbrother.
Okay, we have to find Mindy.
And before her plan goes into effect.
God knows what she could do.
She is a really good chemist, you know?
Really good.
Oh my god, what is all this?
Is she trying to poison the school?
I wouldn't put it past her at this point.
What do you think this does?
I don't, I don't...
Expose the truth.
Nice.
Some best friend you are.
I'm sorry, is the person who's building a chemical weapon questioning my integrity in this scenario?
I figured it was about time somebody cut through all the bullshit so we could see who people really were.
I told you you couldn't trust her.
And now all of a sudden you're, you're, you guys are BFFs?
Yeah because between you and Whitney,
Whitney is the one who is acting less like an evil dictator.
You are just jealous because I am the one who finally stood up to her, which is something that you've always been too scared to do.
I'm turning you in.
If you're not with me, you are my enemy.
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
I will do what I must.
You will try.
No, no!
Whitney, go get help.
Eh no thanks.
Law 21.
Play a sucker to catch a sucker.
Emergency.
I need to report a crime in progress.
Okay everybody.
It is that time of the evening that you've all been waiting for.
Your very handsome principal is about to announce your prom king and queen.
You shall not pass!
And the prom king is...
Louis Hammerschmidt?
Wow, you guys suck at this.
Make way or I'll have you drawn and quartered.
My fellow classmates,
I intend to rule you all with an iron but noble fist.
No!
And the prom queen is...
Oh.
The lovely Miss Claire Stuart.
- That's you, go.
- Congratulations.
Oh wow, you look lovely.
Thank you.
And let's let beauty and the beast regale us with a little dance.
Watch your step.
Seize fire!
Seize fire!
That was exhausting.
Nerd fight!
No!
Oh my god!
Hey, do you need my help?
No, I got this.
Where have you been?
In Europe, proms don't start until 11.
Say you're sorry!
Why couldn't you just be happy for me?
Because you were too busy exploring your sexuality to attend to my emotional needs.
You knew how much MIT meant to me.
You know what, I am sorry that for once in my life
I found a boy that is totally awesome and broodingly sexy.
Oh my god, Jodi, stop it.
You think I'm totally awesome?
- Yeah.
- Cool, that's great.
- That's awesome.
- Thanks, man.
And I am really sorry that for once in your life your 10-year plan didn't go perfectly, but you know what, suck it up and deal with it like the rest of us!
Oh ew, are you two gonna make out now?
You know what, Whitney, shut up!
I defended you.
Even after all of the horrible crap that you put me through,
I still tried because I was stupid enough to feel bad for you.
Do you think I actually care what these people think of me?
High school is over.
I just wanted you two to know before we all left that I won, that I will always win and whenever I want
I can take away that which you hold most dear and crush it and it barely took any push at all to turn you two into Cain and Abel.
Frankly, I think I did you a favor, otherwise this little horror show likely would have dragged on for another few years before you two cut your losses and moved on.
Maybe she's right.
It was stupid to think that we would still be friends after high school.
You're gonna do your thing, I'm gonna do mine and, and in 10 years we'll see each other at the reunion and smile.
Maybe that's the way it's supposed to be.
If that's how you really feel, then maybe we should just stop avoiding the inevitable and end this right now.
It is how I feel.
Well that hurts.
Not as bad as that.
Oh you gotta be kidding me.
And with that the revolution was over.
The police let me go, calling Lipschitzium a misguided but ultimately harmless prank.
After a hefty suspension, Mindy returned to school and all the cliques returned to how they'd been before.
Yep.
I drugged prom.
Every scientist has one great regret.
Look at Oppenheimer.
So I had time to do some thinking while I was in the clink.
It wasn't just an adolescent right of passage I ruined,
I destroyed all the good I did.
I had an opportunity to really change things and when it came down to it,
I was no different than Whitney Bennett.
I'm not gonna tell you it was okay what you did.
But I understand.
It's hard feeling like you're giving your best and people don't value you.
There are always gonna be jerks.
That doesn't change after high school.
And you can spend your life trying to beat them or prove them wrong or get even with them, but that's all wasted energy.
What you need to do is figure out what and who is important to you and fight for that.
The rest doesn't matter.
Yes, yes!
Mr. Flemming.
Jodi Shallenberger, is it Jodi?
Jodi Shallenberger!
Oh my god!
I couldn't.
What are you doing here?
I couldn't let you go in there without you knowing how proud I am of you.
Mindy.
I got into MIT today and it didn't mean anything because you weren't there to celebrate with me.
I don't know how things got so messed up.
Okay no, I do know.
I went totally Dr. Strangelove.
But the thing you said about us being high school friends.
You're not my high school friend.
You're my best friend.
We're the radical two.
You will always know about the face plant I got that got me this dental bridge.
You will always know I prefer odd numbers to even.
I don't know where life will take us.
Hopefully, hopefully to the 2020 Grammy's and the first human settlement on Mars.
But it doesn't matter because all I know is that I want you in my life for all of it.
I am so sorry and I'm back.
I'm so sorry I was too busy exploring my sexuality.
It's okay, sexuality is important.
Oh my god.
Oh I am so glad you're here, you have no idea.
I'm totally freaking out.
Look at me.
Remember science fair finals.
I was so nervous, I could almost puke on my bacteria cultures.
You made me do it.
Okay.
Get yourself together, Jodi.
I think I know what we have to do.
Oh!
Boom shaka laka laka, boom shaka laka laka, boom shaka laka laka boom.

Miss Shallenberger.
Wait!
Do or do not, there is no try.
Right.

Star Wars quote, the end of it.
Yes, yes, yes, yes!
Shh!
As I stand before you...
So high school was finally over.
And maybe it was just the Stockholm syndrome talking, but for the first time I kind of felt like
I was gonna miss the place.
We had tried so hard to tear down the entire system that we lost sight of what our high school really was, people, people on the inside, people on the outside,
people learning who they are.
Who they want to be.
Who they don't want to be.
Are you serious?
Because no matter who you are.
The prom king, the fashionista, or the future disgraced senator, high school is the same.
It's the best of times.
It's the worst of times.
Full of wonderful people and not so wonderful people.
And it's once in a lifetime.
And we made it through.
We did it.
We're members of society, we have the diploma.
We can prove it to everyone.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well done.
Well done to you too.
I'll call you, Wellesley.
All right, Penn State.
- You guys.
- Come on.
Hey guys.
- That was classic.
- Wait.
Hi.
Mindy, Jodi, Claire, Virginia.
Sugar, I was wondering if you would perhaps honor me.
I'll see you this week, Martin.
Thank you.
Hey, the heart wants whatever pasty, bespectacled thing the heart wants and don't you look so smug because you know what our next mission is, getting you your first date.
Yes.
That's me.
I'll see you this week?
Deal.
Bye.
That's my driver.
Spill it.
What are you doing next year?
Little of this, little of that.
I'm just gonna see where the wind takes me.
That girl's going into the CIA.
No doubt.
You ready, Dolores?
Don't even.
That woman birthed me.
She can call me whatever she wants.
- No problem, Dolores.
- Hey.
Pound it, Dolores.
We'll see you this summer, Dolores, yeah?
We miss you already, Dolores!
Love you, Dolores!
Really strong pound, Dolores.
So Martin and Dolores.
Weird, right?
Who'd have thunk it?
- We gotta...
- Oh!
Wait.
I almost forgot.
Open it.
One economy class train ticket from Boston to New York City.
Next year is going to be epic.
Next year?
We still got the summer.
Summer go to my place.

Fin.
- Richard Nixon High wasn't the worst place to spend four years.
Well for the most part.
By and large, it was your average suburban high school full of self-segregated cliques and stereotypical angst and at the top of the food chain, the rich and beautiful.
That's us.
There's me, Mindy Lipschitz.
The assault victim.
And the girl with the Home Alone look on her face.
- That's Jodi, my best friend.
We've been best friends since third grade.
I'm the one with the unfortunate eye patch.
As you can see, my school kind of sucked for us and so did Jodi's aim.
- Zombie fascist!
- Intended target, Whitney Bennett, voted most likely to be charged with war crimes.
She was 5'7" of sculpted, flawless, sociopath.
Actual target.
- Son of a...
- Principal Whitmore, tormenting students since 1979.
- So sorry!
- And that's how this whole thing started, the rock that launched a revolution.
- X-Files is on tonight.
- Can't, I have homework.
- What the F?
We get detention and Whitney does a hair flip and gets off Scot-free.
- Well if it makes you feel any better, in at least one of the infinite multiverses, she doesn't.
Hey, I know it seems like high school is the center of this universe right now.
- Do not say it gets better.
Next year you'll be in Nerdvana at MIT and I'll still be here serving quadruple bypass burgers at TGI Fridays.
- Or you could be serving an entirely new and decidedly classier set in Boston when you come to live with me.
- Great.
So in every multiverse you know of,
I'm still waiting tables.
That's awesome.
- I gotta go.
I've got family jazzercise at five.
It's gonna get physical!
- Good luck with that jazzercising!
- I am in control!
- Weirdo!
- Maniac!
- Hey Dad!
- Hey hon.
Mm mmm something smells scrum-diddly-icious.
How was school?
Legalized torture paid for by the American taxpayer.
- Did you make the appointment with the college counselor?
Jodi, you're graduating this year.
I think it's time you figured out where you're headed.
- Most likely into a menial job that doesn't pay a living wage so I can become a cog in the 21st century's version of serfdom.
- When did you start speaking like Trotsky?
Look, I just want you to be happy.
I want you to find something that you love.
Follow your dreams.
- So single 40-something postal carrier with a PEZ collection
- Hey, this PEZ collection is gonna be valuable one day and single and widow are two completely different things.
- I know.
Dad, I mean it's been five years.
You know, you're not getting any younger.
- Age is just a number.
- That closely correlates with death.
- You want me to start dating?
- I just want you to find something you love, Herb.
Follow your dreams.
- I'll find a date if you find a direction.
- One of those things is a lot easier than the other.
- It's not finding a date...
- And it's not finding a direction.
All right, so here's a new song.
I hope you enjoy it and by you, I mean me because I would rather admit that Taylor Swift's music has touched my cold, dark heart than show it to anybody.
It's called Suburbageddon.
- Bernoulli's theorem will be on test next week.
Uh hey Mindy, could you uh stick around for a nanosecond?
- Oh did my spectrofloatometer malfunction.
I knew I should have gotten...
- Hey, slow down, Sonic.
I spoke with my old roommate who is on the alumni board at MIT and she agreed to set up a special interview for you.
- Are you serious?
- As a radiation leak.
- Oh my god, this is perfect.
Okay, next step is the interview, then get in obviously, get first pick for all my classes, graduate with honors and then it will set me up for one of the more prestigious graduate programs.
- Mindy, one step at a time.
College is about more than just classes and grades.
It's about exploring, having fun.
I remember staying up all night with my friends solving proofs, cracking equations.
It was pretty wild.
But some of my best memories are just hanging out, meeting new people, living on the edge.
God I miss college.
- Well in my experience, meeting new people usually leads to relentless mockery by said people.
- Don't you think that's a little pessimistic.
Give people a chance.
They can often surprise you.
- That is a point worth considering, Mr. Samuels.
- Go forth.
Go!
The world is ready to embrace you.
- Boo loser.
- Eventually.
- Since Mr. Samuels was basically my real-life Yoda,
I knew he was right.
He'd proven it was time to give people a chance.
I think we should ask Whitney to stop torturing us.
- Did you forget to wear your gas mask in lab again?
- Whitney's a person too, right?
If we approach her like confident, mature adults, she will respect us and then we can coexist in peace.
- Of all the douche-nozzles in this school,
Whitney is the worst.
- She hasn't been that horrible.
- What the?
- Okay fine.
But it's this or suffer from abject humiliation for the rest of the year.
- So I said to her if you don't stay away from Rick,
I will call the police and say that you molested my hat and you have to register for that.
- I'm here.
- Took you long enough.
- One center cut rare, three meatball subs, extra sauce, a hard boiled egg and a Kombucha.
- I'm going to die a virgin and you don't even care.
- Shh.
- Are you guys selling band candy or something?
- Actually, no.
We were wondering if we could talk to Whitney for a second.
- Do you have an appointment?
I want to hear what Bill Nye and the lesbian have to say.
- Hello.
We know that there has been some bad blood between us throughout the years, but we are seniors now and there is no reason why we can't finish off the school year being civil to each other.
We thought that if we came and spoke to you like adults, we could come to some sort of mutually beneficial agreement.
- Wow.
I applaud your courage.
Okay.
- Wait what?
- It didn't occur to me until this exact moment that I kind of respect you.
You didn't change yourself to blend in, which is much more than can be said for the rest of these automatons.
- Well I'm glad we could come to this understanding.
- Actually, Colin's throwing a party this Saturday.
You should come.
- Thank you for coming.
Friends don't let friends drive drunk.
Ow.
The mean attractiveness of this party is statistically significant.
How do I look?
- Soccer mom goes to the Olive Garden.
I guess we should...
- Colin!
- Thank you for hosting us.
You have a lovely home.
My mom says never come to a party empty handed.
- Sweet.
- Oh.
- Have fun, baby.
Hey bro, we got next game.
- Oh my god.
Is that really how I just saw my first human penis?
- See, we are diversifying our portfolio of high school experiences already.
That contains Colin's urine.
- Hey.
MIT and what was it?
How's it going, guys?
- Well we haven't been roofied yet so.
- Wow.
Aren't you enchanting?
- This is her trying to be nice.
- I'm hoping to get time off from this conversation for good behavior.
- You're funny, Wellesley.
- Thanks, Penn State.
- I'm Dave by the way.
- We were lab partners sophomore year.
- Um Mandy.
- Mindy.
- Mindy like...
- Like Mindy.
- Like Mindy, cool.
Any reason it would be awkward for me not to know your name?
- Not unless you're an avid follower of the piccolo section in the school marching band.
- Ah I'm more of a tuba section guy myself.
- Well then I'm Jodi.
- Hi.
- There you guys are.
Welcome to the 1%.
Follow me.
- Our pleasure.
- Good luck!
- Cool, right?
Go fetch some drinks for our guests of honor, please.
- Oh that's not, not.
- Dorks, balls now.
- They want you to play pong.
- Like ping?
- No, beer.
- Oh.
- Thank you.
- Boom!
Drink.
- I think it's gone bad.
- No, that's just what beer tastes like.
- I don't lose.
- You did it!
- Yeah!
- Excuse me!
Hello everyone.
Can I have your attention please?
- Shh!
- Whitney would like to say a few words.
- As you may have noticed, we have some new additions tonight,
Jodi Shallenberger and Mindy Lipschitz.
- Shit lips!
- Not so funny after four years.
- Now, most of us walk past these two and have never bothered to get to know them.
So I put together a little video of our very own Jodi so we could all learn a bit more about her.
- Someone's ballin'.
- Who's Jodi?
Oh.
- Well any requests?
♪ Ooh eczema, I'm gonna vanquish ya ♪
Yow!
Oh you're such a good kisser.
I'd party down with you any time, Adam Scott.
- You know how there are the birds and there are the bees.
How familiar are you with male anatomy?
- Oh my god, Dad, I am 17.
- Hon, got your tampons.
- Dad!
No, I need maximum flow.
I told you, Dad!
- Oh no!
- Jodi, wait!
You're all mean!
Jodi!
- You're late.
- How epic was prank eight?
I want to be you when I grow up.
- If you're going to be in power next year, this is your new Bible, the 48 Laws of Power.
I suggest you heed law number one.
- Never outshine the master.
- Your lawnmower man is like so happy.
- Don't wave!
Mackenzie, drive.

- Hey, Jodi.
It's me, your best friend.
Um I'm at school right now and you know, it is really, really not that bad.
Oy vey.
- Oh my god, have you seen Jodi's Instagram feed?
Someone tagged a photo of her on a box of tampons.
That is really not right.
- Oh my god.
- That prank was pretty twisted, Whitney.
Even for you.
I mean, how mental do you have to be to put that much effort into messing with a couple of nerds
- All I had to do was teach myself how to hack a webcam, figure out Jodi's IP address and then trick her into responding to a spyware email I learned how to write.
- You guys are demonic.
You're like medieval to each other.
- I will not allow Big Bang Theory and her frizzy-haired lap dog to roam the halls of this school thinking that for one second they are my equal.
- Law 15, crush your enemy totally.
- Right.
- Oh Jodi, coming in.
Remember that only my opinion matters.
Hey, I brought you something.
I brought you my favorite book on Tesla, who was also totally defeated and humiliated in his lifetime and has since regained popularity and had a resurgence of respect.
Also brought some cookies.
They'll be good in an hour.
And a mint.
Yeah!
Oh.
You know, one day we are gonna look back on this and it is going to be...
- Uh just stop, Mindy.
I told you this was gonna happen.
People like Whitney don't change.
God, I knew I shouldn't have clicked on that attachment.
New Tina Fey series, piccolo players wanted.
- Okay, all right.
No, no.
No.
We're not accepting defeat.
Do we accept defeat?
No.
- I'm sure you understand the definition of winning.
This...
Not winning.
- Hey.
I am serious.
We are gonna stand up for ourselves.
- Yeah?
And how exactly are we gonna do that?
- By beating those fascists at their own game.
We're gonna be popular.
And not lame top 40 popular, awesome popular.
All of us.
All of the people they have treated like second class citizens and then copied their calculus homework.
- Popular people don't take calculus.
- I know because they are stupid dolts who are gonna go to below average universities and get mediocre grades and still end up being our bosses unless we do something about it right now.
- Just like that, we're gonna overthrow generations of ingrained high school social strata?
- Yes.
Is there anything we have ever put our minds to that we have not accomplished?
- Well we didn't get Firefly back on the air.
- Shh!
Besides getting Firefly back on the air.
- Then...
No.
- Let's do this.
Boom!
And so it was.
The revolution was born.
And Tina Fey, if you're listening,
I'd still play piccolo for you.
- Power to the peons.
The facts were simple.
There were more of us than there were of them.
So all we had to do was convince the outsiders, misfits and weirdos of the school to ban together.
Basically we were gonna unionize the outcasts.
Power to the peons.
- Unfortunately, it wasn't that simple.
- Oh!
- Well that was a lucky shot.
Gross, but lucky.
- Yeah.
- Power to the peons!
- Hi guys.
I am Claire, ambassador troop 2579.
- Welcome, Claire.
- I like where your horse head's at.
Going straight Godfather, huh?
- It's a unicorn for my spirit animal badge.
- You do realize that this is a meeting to launch a social revolution.
- Yup, I'm in.
Whatever you guys need.
- Oh great.
Well why don't you take a seat inside and we will be with you shortly.
- Yay!
We talked to pretty much every misfitoy in this school and the only thing we have to show for it is Marcia Brady.
- Hey, all revolutions have to start somewhere.
Oh my god, Sugar Jones incoming 12 o'clock.
- No eye witnesses.
- Activate shield.
- I hear you're trying to obliterate the jackhole normative power hierarchy of this pathetic excuse for a school.
- Well obliterate is kind of extreme, but yeah.
- I'm in.
- Okay, we may be small in number, but we're all here for a reason, right?
- Right.
Wait, why are we here?
- Jesus.
I say we just burn this mother down and be done with it.
- Arson sounds like a fabulous plan.
- But if we need to get more people, we could go door to door like I do with cookies.
It's an excellent way to bond with people in a place where they feel comfortable being themselves.
- Screw Girl Scout cookies, an obvious conspiracy to subjugate girls and force them into traditional gender roles by selling overpriced, unremarkable, and nutritionally-deficient baked goods.
- We suck at this.
This isn't a revolution, this is a girl band.
We need someone who can work the system,
Karl Rove good witch style.
- Wait.
- Virginia.
- As president of the History,
Young Democrats,
Multi United Nations Club, I am...
- Virginia Vanderkamp had locked up most likely to succeed in third grade.
Our junior year, Virginia launched the culmination of all her hard work, a campaign for student council president.
She had a well-oiled political machine and several key endorsements.
- Vote for me, Virginia.
Do you want a pin?
- Hey Twilight, go Kyle.
- But despite her best efforts, she lost to Kyle McDevon.
- Chipotle burritos, yeah!
- Whose campaign speech consisted of giving out free Chipotle gift cards.
- You want a burrito, Virginia?
- And spectacular abs.
- Oh yeah!
- After a crushing defeat, she went where many a depressed and disgruntled American has gone before,
France.
Needless to say, she didn't come back from summer break the same.
- What's your shirt say?
- Hell is other people.
- Next.
- Oh this girl definitely owns a pony.
- Does anyone else feel underdressed?
- Speak.
- Hi, Virginia.
This is Mindy Lipschitz, Jodi Shallenberger,
Sugar Jones and Claire the Girl Scout.
We were trying to upend the social hierarchy of our school.
- Or destroy it.
- And we could use your help.
- I'm not interested in your futile attempts to make sense of the world's chaos.
Be gone.
- We were actually thinking more along the lines of revenge.
- What?
We tried to talk to all the different groups, but nobody wanted to join the cause.
You think all the outcasts are the same, but really we're like snowflakes, snowflakes that hate each other.
Let me break it down for you.
You've got your basic overachievers, your underachievers, your emos, your goths, your bandos, your drama dorks, orchestra oddballs and gleeks.
Kids lost in space, kids who take up too much space, your steampunk, cyber punk, classic punk, kids with foreign parents, kids who are parents,
Twihards, kids who try too hard, kids who write binary, kids who reject the gender binary, gamers, stoners, loners, anarchists, activists, masochists, and atheists.
There are more strains of loser out there than the herpes virus.
Uniting them under one banner, that is no easy task.
- So we're screwed.
- I said it wasn't easy, I didn't say it was impossible.
- What is this place?
- It used to be my campaign headquarters.
Prior to that it was used by my father to house his miniature horse collection.
Prior to that it was used by my schizophrenic grandfather to interrogate imaginary communists.
He won an imaginary medal for that.
- Man, rich white people are messed up.
- When I was running for office,
I did a little research on the voters.
- So this is where the NSA stores its data.
- These files represent the entire student body.
Each one of them contains your standard class list,
GPA, activities, hobbies, psychological profile, past and current lovers, and most importantly weaknesses.
- No effing way.
- Point of weakness, Tina Fey piccolo.
Geeze am I that transparent?
- Overtly aggressive, lack of impulse control militant with anarchist undertones.
Nice.
- Latent Napoleonic tendencies.
What does yours say, Claire?
- It just says Girl Scout.
- What's in your file, Virginia?
- I don't have any weaknesses.
These three files represent the king pins of the school's underclass.
Convince them and you have a shot at this thing.
The key is figuring out what makes people tick and then exploiting it mercilessly.
- I like you, Virginia even if you are named after a slave state.
- First up, Howard Chang, leader of the young entrepreneurs.
Points of weakness, black mock turtlenecks, technology savvy women and the word billion.
- I get what you guys are going for.
I think it's very innovative, but it's just not right for us.
We're working on an app right now that's gonna blow up.
Asiavous, Facebook for Asians.
And besides, I've got to look to the future, not worry about high school.
I still have to get before I can start my first company.
- Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels.
You can quote them or disagree with them, but the only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things.
- Do you know who said that?
Apple and that is why they make billions.
- Next is Martin Vimmel, head of the Science Fiction Club.
Points of weakness, hard sci-fi, the sound of his own voice and very aggressive women.
- Okay, here's the deal.
Just because you're a science geek, doesn't mean we're your comrades in arms.
Science is about what is.
Any idiot can do that.
Science-fiction is about what could be.
- We're huge Dr. Who fans.
- Yeah, the Matt Smith years completely turned the series around.
- Completely.
- Tell you what, give me the title of one Neal Stephenson novel, just one, and I'll join your little group.
- You think skinny, anemic fanboys have a monopoly on the one fictional genre where women and people of color get to exist outside of backwards societal norms and traditional confinements?
Not to mention a genre largely premised on the idea that future dystopia is the inevitable outcome of the current system of patriarchal excess?
Idiot.
Oh and Cryptonomicon, Snow Crash, Anathem.
Should I go on?
- Louis Hammerschmidt, leader of the Fantasy Club.
Points of weakness, Elven languages, heroic aspirations and any woman.
- Whitney Bennett is the Cersei Lannister of high school.
You can play the Game of Thrones with her.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to end up like Ned Stark.
- Louis, think of it like this.
What if Frodo hadn't left the Shire and fought against the Dark Lord?
- Louis.
Thanks for the ride.
- I'm really glad I'm helping you guys with this whole thing.
I've always admired you.
- Really?
Why?
- You're just so unapologetic for who you are.
- That's been a recurring problem.
- So when did you know?
- That I rubbed people the wrong way?
- I haven't heard that one before, but yeah.
- Um you know, I guess it was pretty obvious since
I was a kid, but I really hit my stride in middle school.
- I rub people the wrong way too.
I mean, I haven't actually yet.
But I want to someday.
First I have to figure out how to tell them.
- That you're rude and obnoxious?
- That I'm gay.
- It's so great to talk to somebody who's already out.
You're like my hero.
With that sign on your back announcing that you were gay,
I could not believe how brave you were.
- Okay first of all, someone put that sign on my back as a prank and secondly, why does everyone think I'm gay?
- You do wear a lot of vests.
- Huh.
- I'm sorry, I just, I thought that...
- No, it's okay.
I'm really glad that you told me.
So...
When did you know?
- I think it finally clicked when I realized
I didn't just love Veronica Mars,
I loved Veronica Mars.
- Preach.
- I will, I will see you at school in the halls.
You know and say hi to me.
- See you later.
- See you.
- Things are happening, Herb.
Things are happening.
- Yes they are.
New York Performing Arts School.
Deal's a deal.
I have a date with Carol and you have a date with destiny.
- Find love today.
- Things are happening.
- Raise your hand if you've ever eaten lunch in a bathroom stall.
Been made fun of because of your weight, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or knowledge of the periodic table of elements.
- Well it's time we did something about it.
It's been 42 seconds and I still don't know your product, your plan or your profit point.
If you want to endlessly pontificate start a blog.
- We have a blog.
- Oh no, here comes angry black girl.
- Oh I'm not angry because I'm black.
I'm angry because I'm paying attention.
- All we're saying is that if we don't stick together, we have no chance of standing up to the evil empire.
- What you're proposing is like the Rebel Alliance.
- Star Wars, classic sci-fi.
- I'm sorry to interrupt, but I think Star Wars technically constitutes fantasy.
- Uh in what galaxy?
- It's an archetypal hero's quest.
That's fantasy.
- Um yeah, set in a technologically advanced society with space ships.
- And sword fighting.
- Light sabers are not swords.
- What about the Force?
That's magic.
- Which was scientifically explained by midichlorians.
- Are you actually citing the prequels to me right now?
- Why do we have two sci-fi nerds here?
- He's sci-fi, I'm fantasy.
It's totally different.
- Totally different.
- But neither of you get laid, right?
- This is exactly the problem.
What is a popular person?
What makes them different from us?
- Attractiveness.
- Flawless skin.
- A large number of followers.
- Wrong.
That's what they want you to think because they need you to believe that it's hard to be popular.
The only difference between them and us
So while we're sitting here tearing each other apart over who would win in a battle between Batman and Green Lantern.
- Batman.
- Green Lantern.
- They're sitting pretty and ruling our school.
- So what are you asking for, blind loyalty, that we just pretend we're all friends?
- No, not blind loyalty, real loyalty.
We all have something in common.
We've been kept on the outskirts of a school that we help make great and...
- We are the movers and the shakers.
We are the club presidents and the innovators.
We are the ones with our hands on the beating pulse of otherness that make America the best effing country in the GD world.
So I say let's stop bending over and taking it and stand together.
And so it began, our Independence Day.
At first, the changes were small, a smile here,
a random act of non-douche baggery there.
In shared struggles, former enemies forged new alliances.
- Lactards unite.
- Some of us learned the ancient art of not getting our asses kicked.
- So I'll try not to hurt you too... to design innovative solutions to age-old problems.
- What's up, turtleneck?
I lost my iPhone and I'm gonna need yours.
You've got five seconds to hand it over.
What the hell is that?
What are you gonna do, Dildo Baggins?
- Hi-yah!
- Get him!
Smells like Comic Con in here anyway.
- Yes!
- And once the outcasts became a united front, the rest of the school fell like dominoes.
Political power, check.
Never getting picked last again.
- Come on!
- Check.
- And that is why the singularity is near.
- Debate tournaments were in.
Organized sports were out.
And slowly, things began to actually change.
Dork was the new popular.
- Ow!
Every flavor of weirdo was breaking bread together.
- We should do something to celebrate how awesome we are.
- Yeah, even the goths look kind of happy.
- Guys, we just pulled off the bloodless coup of the century and it is...
- Probably just a phase or something.
Like I herd Mercury is supposedly going renegade.
- Here's the truth.
One day, I will be in a place where power isn't determined by acned suburban subliterates and that place will be Princeton.
But for now, I have to cater to these morons who apparently think pretending they're popular actually means they're popular.
What's law number five?
Much depends on our reputation.
Guard it with our life, get it?
So right now I'd say it's pretty clear that we are...
- Mmm toast.
- The thing about power is when you don't have it, someone else does.
So you say phase and I say insurrection the only response to insurrection is to crush it.
Quickly.
- Stephanie, purple is definitely your color.
Chase, good luck on that first chair open audition.
Sarah, your Blanche DuBois was transcendental.
Hey, you, me, Magic the Gathering.
Fifth period, whoo!
Oh Mr. Samules.
Methane!
I'm just goofing.
- Oh well.
Nice balls, Milton.
- Shenanigans.
- Geeze, like Pandora's box opened up and it was filled with weirdos and losers.
Oh what's that?
Yup.
- Every scientist needs an arch nemesis.
He's right though.
The school does seem different lately.
You have anything to do with that?
- I can neither prove nor disprove that hypothesis.
I can't help but thinking it is exactly the type of person who would go over like gangbusters in an MIT interview.
- Gangbusters.
I don't know, I've got it narrowed down to two.
I've got maroon and black and I'm not sure which goes better with my dickey, but my dickey kind of goes with everything and I keep thinking what would Neil deGrasse Tyson do, but then again I'm not Neil deGrasse Tyson,
but then again.
- Mindy, Mindy, stop worrying.
They'd be Darwin Award grade morons not to take you.
- I keep imagining how great it would be next year, me at MIT, you coming to live with me in Boston.
- Um Mindy, there's something I've...
- Oh oh!
Okay, I gotta go, that's my mom.
Wish me luck.
- Good luck.
- But then in ninth grade, the Young Astronomers Association selected me for the Rising Star Award, which I accepted despite the lazy pun and then in 10th grade I won second prize at the state science fair for my project anisotropic versus isotropic materials.
- Okay Mindy, it's clear that you're a really talented scientist.
Great grades, great test scores.
But what makes you tick?
What makes you special?
Like okay, when I was at MIT,
I was a member of the Hacks, right.
Learned more from pulling off those pranks than in any class I took so.
- Well as I mentioned,
I am president of the school science club and a national merit scholar and I can recite the entire periodic table of elements.
Would you like me to?
I can do it.
There's antimony, arsenic, aluminum, selenium and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium and nickel, neodymium, neptunium, germanium and iron, americium, ruthenium, uranium, europium, zirconium, lutetium, vanadium
and lanthanum and osmium and astatine and radium and gold and protactinium and indium and gallium and iodine and thorium and thulium and thallium.
There's...
- Hey.
I saw you dancing.
What's going on?
What you listening to?
- Um Bowie.
What's that, Nickelback?
- Oh yeah, huge Nickelback fan.
Love it.
Canadian icons.
- You like Carole King?
- It makes me feel like a natural woman.
Who can't relate to that, you know what I mean?
- Let's not forget that the last time I saw you, the most humiliating moment of my life.
- Yeah, okay.
First of all, I'm sorry.
I had no idea that was gonna happen.
What's going on in American Psycho Barbie's head?
No and second of all, that stuff was not humiliating.
Except in all the ways that it was humiliating.
I'm surprised you didn't change schools.
But here look, hey, positive side.
Eczema song, knocked it out the park.
- Can you just not?
- Rickets.
Do you have a song about rickets for my grandad?
He's got rickets.
- I don't, I don't get it.
- I guess you wouldn't get it, you're a young woman, very healthy.
- No.
I mean, you know, you seem like you aren't a completely heinous human being and have at least a modicum of a soul.
- That is the sweetest thing that anyone's ever said to me.
Thank you.
- How can you hang out with Adolf Whitler?
- Look, trust me, I know how awful she is.
What you think you have a copyright on teen angst?
It's high school, we're all put into a box and marginalized.
Look at me, I hang out with Colin.
I've known Colin since the second grade.
The guy is, he's an idiot.
But what am I supposed to do?
Not all of us have the guts to stage a full-scale rebellion.
- Mindy's the brains behind the operation.
- You just write the theme music?
Look um, for what it's worth,
I'm glad you didn't transfer schools.
My hand's on your shoulder.
Full contact, shoulder touching.
Pound it, blow it up.
Explosion.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Oh um by the way,
Bowie totally made weird awesome.
- Check mate.
- Killing it.
- People think pretty girls can't be smart, but it's like don't pigeon hold me.
- Uh don't you mean pigeon hole?
- Ew what's a pigeon hole?
- It's like if you hold onto a pigeon, it can't fly away.
- Yeah.
- It's like let me fly.
- Where the hell is everyone?
- Hey Mackenzie, look at that.
You like that?
- I think everyone's at the lame party.
- Really?
That's awesome.
- What the hell is your problem, hmm?
- You know what my problem is?
You're uh you're super evil.
You're like African rebel group dictator evil
So I think I'm gonna check out the lame party where I hear the hosts aren't total ass hats.
- You'll fit right in.
- I think I'm gonna go to that party too.
It sounds like there's girls there.
- Dude.
- I think someone should probably scope it out too.
You know, like do some double agent Shenans.
- Mackenzie!
- Hey, so what's in this anyway?
- My own personal secret blend of choice chemicals and a dash of genius.
I call it Lipschitz and giggles.
- You're right, I do have the vague urge to laugh.
- Whoa, looks like I picked the right party.
- Oh Dan, right?
- Dave.
- Dave, Dave like..
- Like Dave.
- Like Dave.
- So do you know anyone who can get me into the Whitney protection program?
- Oh my god.
Tell me everything.
- And for you.
Who wants Lipshots?
- So Principal Whitmore gave you two months detention for protesting the summer reading list?
I always heard it was because you threw a flash bomb into glee club.
- That was just a rumor I started.
- Well we should organize a protest.
- What do you know about protesting, Pollyanna?
- I know you think Girl Scouts are silly, but the whole point is to empower girls so we can change the world.
You know, Gloria Steinem, Hilary Clinton, and Sandra Day O'Connor were all Girl Scouts.
- Hmm maybe you're not as "puppies and unicorns" as you seem.
- I thought I would be just better at jousting,
I don't know, like 'cause of a reach thing
- 'Cause you got those long, spindly ones.
- Thank you, spindly ones, sure.
Oh whoa, there's a piano here.
You know what that means.
Will you write any new songs?
- You know what, I actually just wrote one in my head called Our Party is Way Better Than Your Party.
It's weird.
- Thank you, it's nice.
Sweet.
- Actually...
I am working on one now.
But um...
It's stupid.
- Oh I will be the judge of that.
Sit down.
- Do I have to?
- Yeah, yeah you're gonna have to play a song for me.
Sorry.
- I can't believe you're making me do this.
All right.
♪ On the outskirts going nowhere
♪ But I've heard that the truth is out there
♪ I just hope one day I can show
♪ There is more here than what they know ♪
And that's all I have.
That was great, are you kidding me?
That was awesome.
That was really good.
- I was just thinking for the chorus.
- Wow, I didn't know you played.
- I don't like to let people behind the candelabra.
It's my secret place.
So when do I get to hear the rest of your songs?
- Maybe...
Some time.
- Later, maybe later, maybe later.
- Hey, oh.
Oh hey guys.
Um I just wanted to let you know that they're reenacting the Battle of Trafalgar out on the beach.
So...
- Awesome, let's do that.
That's way better than...
Naval battle, huh?
Hmm?
- I think I speak for everyone when I say that Saturday's shindig was one of the best, nay, the best party of all time.
- Here here.
- Now, does anyone have anything to bring to the council's attention?
Upcoming events, seminar ideas?
Yes.
- Sugar and I did some research and it turns out...
- What about sabotaging the lacrosse team.
We've finally established strategic dominance.
Now is the time to exploit our advantage and those guys had it coming.
- A few tablets of Ex-Lax in the team's water coolers and their bowels will explode like krypton.
- Do you think Steve Jobs became the greatest visionary of all time by being satisfied with creating the iMac?
He changed it up and created the iPod, then the iPhone, then the iPod touch, then...
- I got it, I got it.
I guess a little explosive diarrhea never hurt anyone.
- Yes!
- Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
- Hey, want to play Settlers of Catan?
My dad's new lady friend is coming over with her kid so we can all meet each other even though it's only their second date.
- Well that sounds fun.
- All right, you guys gotta go.
You know how my parents feel about organized labor, so.
- Right.
- Oh god.
What do I do?
Is it too neat?
Is my hair too neat?
Should I mess it up?
I mean, don't the ladies like it messy?
- Oh, Herb.
Listen, you haven't dated in awhile so I feel the need to tell you that at your age, women aren't super concerned as much as they are impressed that you still have hair.
- Oh no.
- Relax.
Awkward doesn't suit you.
- Yes.
No awkward.
Okay.
Hi.
- Hi.
- You must be David, of course you are.
Who else would you be?
You wouldn't bring a date to dinner, right?
I'm Herb.
Uh uh David, this is my daughter Jodi.
Jodi, David.
Jodi, Carol, Carol, Jodi.
David, Carol, Herb, Jodi.
Everybody knows each other.
Introductions out of the way.
Come into the house please.
This is the way in.
♪ Boom Shaka laka laka
♪ Boom Shaka laka laka boom
♪ Shaka laka laka boom
- Jodi, it's Mindy.
Call me.
- I suggested hey, why not take the shorts up an inch above the knee.
They said no, but with respect they said no.
Um I also have made...
- Hey, guys.
Just give me these, give me these.
You guys are done, right?
- Not quite, but.
- Mom's done, Mom's done.
- Sure, thank you.
That's good.
- Hey, hey.
What if they get married?
- Then we almost committed stepcest.
Hey, you were the one who went in for the kiss.
- No, no way.
You were practically undressing me with your eyes.
- Undressing you?
Mister oh I don't let many people behind the candelabra.
- Fine, we'll just chalk it up to equal parts creepy.
I don't know where this goes.
- So...
Friends it is?
- Yeah, in the interest of not having our family tree go in a circle friends.
I'm sorry, I realize referencing having children with you makes it more creepy.
- Yeah, it did.
- I got an operation plan to Photoshop the cheerleaders' yearbook picture.
Can I get the green light?
- I don't care, do what you want.
- I have been looking for you all day.
Oh my god, last night was like the seventh circle of awkwardness.
- I called you.
- I know.
It was insane.
- I got waitlisted at MIT.
- Wait, wha, wha?
No, no, no, there's gotta be a mistake.
Hey, I want names.
- It doesn't matter.
- Hey, guess who's coming to dinner?
We're joking.
Hey, did you hear?
- Actually not.
- Um...
- Not a good time.
- Her dad and my mom, they're like totally dating now.
- That's crazy.
- Oh hey, side point.
I found a perfect song for your audition.
- Audition?
- Thanks Dave, I'll take it from here.
- It's just for a performing arts school.
- In Boston?
- In New York.
I was gonna tell you.
It's no big deal.
- Of course it's a big deal.
I'm sure you'll get in and it's a good thing you've got Dave to help you with your audition.
- Mindy, don't be mad.
I gotta go.
- Yep.
- Hey, we'll talk later, okay?
- Sorry.
- It's fine, let's just go.
- Mindy Lipschitz, please report to the principal's office.
- This is an all new level.
Stealing chemicals and lab equipment from the school?
- Come on, Les, Mindy is one of my best students.
She would never do that.
- Really?
Why don't you have a look-see.
- Okay, well that one is clearly Photoshopped.
- Mindy.
- Well guess what.
You're out of the science club forever.
- This must be some mistake.
- Save it, sweater vest.
Luckily, we still have students like Whitney Bennett who had the courage to bring this sick delinquency to my attention.
Get out of my office.
Mr. Samuels.
Why didn't you defend me?
- What do you want me to do, Mindy?
- You went to MIT, the greatest academic institution and you're still being bullied by an overgrown frat boy.
- Oh my god, you totally broke her.
- Law 42, strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter.
Straight back to you.
- Are you sure you want this?
- I want it.
Can anyone tell me what the exception to the rule of...
Brothers and sisters, it is time to open your eyes.
Whitney Bennett, for four years she has crafted a meticulous image as the rich girl who had it all.
Well brothers and sisters,
Whitney Bennett is not who you thought.
The mansion her family supposedly lives in, try the servants' quarters.
Her father, the hedge fund manager, these are the only hedges he's ever managed.
The mother who works in fashion, only if this constitutes working in the fashion industry.
Her older brother getting a master's in business at Wharton.
The only business he's mastered is delivering pizzas.
The truth is revealed.
The only reason Whitney was always so intent on exposing all of your weaknesses was so that you would never discover hers.
Whitney Bennett is a liar.
- Dude.
What was that?
- That was our revenge over Whitney.
- You do realize that you just did the same thing to her that she did to me.
- Exactly, it's called revenge.
I don't get what your problem is.
This is what you wanted.
We set out to change things and we did it.
We won.
- It doesn't feel like we won.
It feels like we're becoming the things that we used to hate.
- My whole life I played by the rules.
I colored in the bubbles with my number two pencils and what did it get me?
Teased, tortured, ignored, waitlisted.
Do you know what turning the other cheek gets you?
Two black eyes.
- The old Mindy...
- Was a pushover who thought she was gonna go to MIT, engineer the perfect hydrogen fuel cell and get an element named after her.
- Lipschitzium can still happen.
- If you have a problem with what you're doing, you should do something about it.
- If this is what it is...
Then I'm out.
- So we had succeeded in creating a new world order at Richard Milhous Nixon High.
Turns out power is a potent drug and with Whitney publicly humiliated and officially dethroned, the underlings of our school had now become its overlords.
- Dude, that was amazing.
- I'm registered as a lethal weapon.
- Well this sucks.
- I told you we should have just burned this mother down.
- Here here.
- Has anyone seen Whitney?
- Oh she's gone AWOL.
I never thought I'd feel bad for someone who affectionately references Stalin.
- Now we should shove his head into a toilet.
You know what I'm saying?
- Look, I never meant for things to go down like that.
- Oh come on, don't tell me you're not having a dorkgasm over this.
- Google alert, you did the same thing to me
- But your threshold for humiliation was already so high.
No wait, I, I'm, s-s-s...
- Were you trying to apologize?
- It just gets stuck in my throat.
But I know you're right, okay.
You're right.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
- I'm going to cut right to the chase.
I intend to rule this school next year.
But the only way you become the best is by working for the best.
I thought that was Whitney, but apparently I was wrong.
I won't pretend to like your fashion choices.
But you've got a lot to teach me and I'd like to offer my services as your intern for the rest of the school year.
- Prom is almost here and we still don't have a theme.
So I'd like you to rally your various factions to back my proposal for Ender's prom.
- Support my bid for prom king,
I vote for whatever theme you want.
- Wait, I'm running for prom king.
I'm the only one who knows how to wield a sword effectively.
- Whoa whoa whoa.
I thought we were letting Colin win so we could prank him.
- No, we never went over that.
- Um no, you're not gonna be king, I'm gonna be king.
- Mindy, I am willing to make you queen with a five-year no-beheading clause.
- A no beheading clause?
- As I sat there listening,
I realized how ridiculous it all was.
We had pretended we cared about coming together, but in the end people only cared about themselves.
Even best friends.
So it had all been a lie, which was fitting since when you think about it most of high school is a lie.
Everyone faking it, trying to act cooler or smarter or older or just more sure of themselves than they really are and I couldn't help but think wouldn't it be nice for once if people just told the truth.
- So you're going to drug prom?
- That makes it sound so serious.
Lipschitzium is a very mild form of truth serum in gaseous form.
Think of it like a very smart person's version of spiking the punch, okay?
- Oh I'm fine with you drugging prom.
So what changed your mind about working with me?
- You may be a duplicitous opportunist, but at least you're honest about what you want.
- Hmm.
- Thank god you're back.
Being the only hot person in this school?
The army of dorkness is multiplying faster than the Kardashians.
- Oh!
Sorry, habit.
- So are you going to prom?
- Hell no.
- Hey Whitney, can your dad mow my lawn?
- You have a message from Mom.
Make sure you drive safely to school, honey.
You'll know.
Love, Mommy.
- I'm sorry you had to see that.
You don't need a date to go to prom.
- The date, the dress, the revelry.
I don't even know where to begin with my hatred.
And anyways, Mindy and I had always planned on doing a Star Wars marathon on prom night.
13.24 hours prequels and all.
- I get it, it's just...
- What?
- I had a chat with Mackenzie.
She's apparently Mindy's intern now and she wouldn't tell me anything, but it sounds like Mindy's planning some sort of crazy prank at prom.
Guess she's not done getting her revenge.
- Why are they fighting on a hovercraft above molten lava?
- Well Herb, I'll tell you.
Obi-Wan here is just trying to be a good friend and to keep Anakin from acting like a total jackhole, but Anakin is more interested in making a stupid power play than in hanging out with his best friend.
- Hmm I don't know.
It seems to me Obi-Wan is being pretty brave, standing up for the fate of the universe and trying to help out his friend who seems to be going through maybe a rough time.
- Even if Obi-Wan ends up having to chop off his best friend's legs and his best friend ends up turning into some mouth-breathing, goth cyborg who eventually kills him?
- Yeah, even then.
Jodi.
There's one thing that I do know.
Nothing great ever happens when you're sitting on the sidelines.
- Shit.
I gotta go to prom.
Thanks, Dad.
- Jodi, I am your father.
Your founding father.
- I really hope this isn't genetic.
Dad, are there any old clothes in Mom's closet I can wear?
- Wow.
What a vision.
Just got off the phone with Carol.
Dave doesn't have a date either.
So she's gonna bring him over here so you guys can carpool.
- Dad!
- It's fine.
You're just carpooling.
It's not gonna be awkward at all.
- You guys, come on, squeeze in over here.
Grab her waist.
She's not your sister.
And...
Perfect.
All right, see ya.
All right, so I'm just gonna go.
Shh!
Okay the coast is clear, let's go.
- We are so Breaking Bad right now.
Hey Colin.
- Who came up with this theme anyway?
- The patriarchy.
- You back in?
Wanna bust a move?
- Fine, whatever.
- You gotta get up to get down.
- I think I might actually be a PC.
- Maybe my therapist is right.
I am dating my father.
- Is there any way to deny that all human suffering originates from human desire?
Unless the only way to end suffering is to end desire.
But the illogical and futile nature of desire will inevitably win out over our rational nature.
- This punch...
Is good.
- I know that everybody loves Harry, but I can certainly appreciate Zayn's brooding charm, but for my money, Liam is the unsung hero of One Direction.
- I find everything about you repulsive, yet I'm strangely drawn to you.
- That is the nicest thing a girl has ever said to me.
- I love you, man.
- Yes homo.
- I find myself incredibly attracted to you despite that pantsuit.
This is awesome.
Thank you, Adam Scott.
Hey um...
I really like you.
- I really like.
Damn it.
Um I gotta go.
I'll find you later.
- Promise?
- Hey.
- Where have you been?
- Sorry I was, I was just in the janitor's closet making out with my future stepbrother.
- Okay, we have to find Mindy.
- And before her plan goes into effect.
She is a really good chemist, you know?
Really good.
Oh my god, what is all this?
- Is she trying to poison the school?
- I wouldn't put it past her at this point.
What do you think this does?
- I don't, I don't...
- Expose the truth.
Nice.
Some best friend you are.
- I'm sorry, is the person who's building a chemical weapon questioning my integrity in this scenario?
- I figured it was about time somebody cut through all the bullshit so we could see who people really were.
- I told you you couldn't trust her.
- And now all of a sudden you're, you're,
- Yeah because between you and Whitney,
Whitney is the one who is acting less like an evil dictator.
- You are just jealous because I am the one who finally stood up to her, which is something that you've always been too scared to do.
- I'm turning you in.
- If you're not with me, you are my enemy.
- Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
I will do what I must.
- You will try.
No, no!
- Whitney, go get help.
- Eh no thanks.
Law 21.
- Play a sucker to catch a sucker.
- Emergency.
- I need to report a crime in progress.
- Okay everybody.
It is that time of the evening that you've all been waiting for.
Your very handsome principal is about to announce your prom king and queen.
- You shall not pass!
- And the prom king is...
Louis Hammerschmidt?
Wow, you guys suck at this.
- Make way or I'll have you drawn and quartered.
My fellow classmates,
I intend to rule you all with an iron but noble fist.
- No!
- And the prom queen is...
The lovely Miss Claire Stuart.
- That's you, go.
- Congratulations.
Oh wow, you look lovely.
- Thank you.
- And let's let beauty and the beast regale us with a little dance.
Watch your step.
- Seize fire!
Seize fire!
- That was exhausting.
- Nerd fight!
- No!
- Oh my god!
- Hey, do you need my help?
- No, I got this.
- Where have you been?
- In Europe, proms don't start until 11.
- Say you're sorry!
- Why couldn't you just be happy for me?
- Because you were too busy exploring your sexuality to attend to my emotional needs.
You knew how much MIT meant to me.
- You know what, I am sorry that for once in my life
I found a boy that is totally awesome and broodingly sexy.
Oh my god, Jodi, stop it.
- You think I'm totally awesome?
- Yeah.
- Cool, that's great.
- And I am really sorry that for once in your life your 10-year plan didn't go perfectly, but you know what, suck it up and deal with it like the rest of us!
- Oh ew, are you two gonna make out now?
- You know what, Whitney, shut up!
Even after all of the horrible crap that you put me through,
I still tried because I was stupid enough to feel bad for you.
- Do you think I actually care what these people think of me?
High school is over.
I just wanted you two to know before we all left that I won, that I will always win and whenever I want
I can take away that which you hold most dear and crush it and it barely took any push at all to turn you two into Cain and Abel.
Frankly, I think I did you a favor, otherwise this little horror show likely would have dragged on for another few years before you two cut your losses and moved on.
- Maybe she's right.
It was stupid to think that we would still be friends after high school.
You're gonna do your thing, I'm gonna do mine and, and in 10 years we'll see each other at the reunion and smile.
Maybe that's the way it's supposed to be.
- If that's how you really feel, then maybe we should just stop avoiding the inevitable and end this right now.
- It is how I feel.
- Well that hurts.
Not as bad as that.
Oh you gotta be kidding me.
And with that the revolution was over.
The police let me go, calling Lipschitzium a misguided but ultimately harmless prank.
- After a hefty suspension, Mindy returned to school and all the cliques returned to how they'd been before.
- Yep.
I drugged prom.
- Every scientist has one great regret.
Look at Oppenheimer.
- So I had time to do some thinking while I was in the clink.
It wasn't just an adolescent right of passage I ruined,
I destroyed all the good I did.
I had an opportunity to really change things and when it came down to it,
I was no different than Whitney Bennett.
- I'm not gonna tell you it was okay what you did.
But I understand.
It's hard feeling like you're giving your best and people don't value you.
There are always gonna be jerks.
That doesn't change after high school.
And you can spend your life trying to beat them or prove them wrong or get even with them, but that's all wasted energy.
What you need to do is figure out what and who is important to you and fight for that.
The rest doesn't matter.
- Yes, yes!
- Mr. Flemming.
- Jodi Shallenberger, is it Jodi?
Jodi Shallenberger!
Oh my god!
I couldn't.
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't let you go in there without you knowing how proud I am of you.
- I got into MIT today and it didn't mean anything because you weren't there to celebrate with me.
I don't know how things got so messed up.
Okay no, I do know.
I went totally Dr. Strangelove.
But the thing you said about us being high school friends.
You're not my high school friend.
You're my best friend.
We're the radical two.
You will always know about the face plant I got that got me this dental bridge.
You will always know I prefer odd numbers to even.
I don't know where life will take us.
Hopefully, hopefully to the 2020 Grammy's and the first human settlement on Mars.
But it doesn't matter because all I know is that I want you in my life for all of it.
I am so sorry and I'm back.
- I'm so sorry I was too busy exploring my sexuality.
- It's okay, sexuality is important.
- Oh my god.
Oh I am so glad you're here, you have no idea.
I'm totally freaking out.
- Look at me.
Remember science fair finals.
I was so nervous, I could almost puke on my bacteria cultures.
You made me do it.
- Okay.
Get yourself together, Jodi.
I think I know what we have to do.
- Oh!
Boom Shaka laka laka, boom Shaka laka laka, boom Shaka laka laka boom.

- Miss Shallenberger.
Do or do not, there is no try.
- Right.
- That's my best friend!
My best friend.
Star Wars quote, the end of it.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes!
- Shh!
- As I stand before you...
- So high school was finally over.
- And maybe it was just the Stockholm syndrome talking, but for the first time I kind of felt like
I was gonna miss the place.
- We had tried so hard to tear down the entire system that we lost sight of what our high school really was, people, people on the inside, people on the outside,
people learning who they are.
- Who they want to be.
- Who they don't want to be.
- Are you serious?
- Because no matter who you are.
- The prom king, the Fashionista, or the future disgraced senator, high school is the same.
- It's the best of times.
- It's the worst of times.
Full of wonderful people and not so wonderful people.
- And it's once in a lifetime.
- And we made it through.
We're members of society, we have the diploma.
We can prove it to everyone.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well done.
- Well done to you too.
- I'll call you, Wellesley.
- All right, Penn State.
- You guys.
- Come on.
- Hey guys.
That was classic.
- Wait.
- Hi.
Mindy, Jodi, Claire, Virginia.
Sugar, I was wondering if you would perhaps honor me.
- I'll see you this week, Martin.
- Thank you.
- Hey, the heart wants whatever pasty, bespectacled thing the heart wants and don't you look so smug because you know what our next mission is, getting you your first date.
- Yes.
- That's me.
- I'll see you this week?
- Deal.
- Bye.
- That's my driver.
- Spill it.
What are you doing next year?
- Little of this, little of that.
I'm just gonna see where the wind takes me.
- That girl's going into the CIA.
- No doubt.
- You ready, Dolores?
- Don't even.
That woman birthed me.
She can call me whatever she wants.
- No problem, Dolores.
- Hey.
- Pound it, Dolores.
- We'll see you this summer, Dolores, yeah?
- We miss you already, Dolores!
- Love you, Dolores!
Really strong pound, Dolores.
So Martin and Dolores.
- Weird, right?
- Who'd have thunk it?
- We gotta...
- Oh!
Wait.
I almost forgot.
Open it.
- One economy class train ticket from Boston to New York City.
- Next year is going to be epic.
- Next year?
We still got the summer.
Summer go to my place.

My brother is a murderer.
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr. Holmes.
Oh, do your research.
I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Merry Christmas!
I'm not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.
You know what happened to the other one.
Miss me?
'Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
'
I've only been gone four minutes.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Is that quite clear?
Don't minute any of this.
Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.
A D notice has been slapped on the entire incident.
Only those within this room, code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love, will ever know the whole truth.
As far as everyone else is concerned, going to the Prime Minister and way beyond, Charles Augustus...
- Are you tweeting?
!
- No.
Well, that's what it looks like!
Of course I'm not tweeting.
Why would I be tweeting?
- Give me that!
- What?
No!
What are you doing?
!
- Get off!
- Give it here!
- "Back on Terra firma."
- Don't read them out.
- "Free as a bird."
- God, you're such a spoilsport.
Will you take this matter seriously, Sherlock?
I am!
What makes you think I'm not taking it seriously?
"#OhWhatABeautifulMorning"
Look, not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death - my death!
And now I'm back, in a nice warm office, with my big brother and...
Are those ginger nuts?
- Oh, God...
- Love ginger nuts.
Our doctor said you were clean.
I am.
Utterly.
No need for stimulants now, remember?
I have work to do.
You're high as a kite!
Natural high, I assure you.
Totally natural.
I'm just... * ..glad to be alive!
*
What shall we do next?
What's your name?
Vivian.
- What would you do, Vivian?
- Pardon?
Well, it's a lovely day.
Go for a stroll?
Make a paper aeroplane?
Have an ice lolly?
Ice lolly, I suppose.
Ice lolly it is!
- What's your favourite?
- Well, really, I shouldn't...
- Go on.
- Do they still do Mivvies?
- Mr. Holmes...
- Yes?
- We do need to get on.
- Yes, of course.
'Do your research.
'I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Sociopath.
I see.
Who is supposed to have shot him, then?
Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger - that's who.
- That's not what happened at all.
- It is now.
Remarkable.
How did you do it?
We have some very talented people working here.
If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.
That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.
No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.
You're off the hook, Mr. Holmes.
You're home and Dr.y.
OK, cheers.
Obviously, there's unfinished business.
Moriarty.
I told you
- Moriarty's dead.
You say he filmed that video message before he died.
Yes.
You also say you know what he's going to do next.
- What does that mean?
- Perhaps that's all there is to it.
Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
No, no, he would never be that disappointing.
He's planned something, something long-term.
Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.
Posthumous revenge.
No, better than that - posthumous game.
We brought you back to deal with this.
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.
Wait?
!
Of course wait.
I'm the target - targets wait.
Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up,
I'll know when it begins.
I always know when the game is on.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because I love it.
There was once a merchant, in the famous market at Baghdad.
One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise, and he knew that the stranger was Death.
Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles, to the city of Samarra.
For there he was sure Death could not find him.
But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.
"Very well," said the merchant.
"I give in.
I am yours."
"But tell me, why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"
"Because," said Death,
"I had an appointment with you tonight... in Samarra."
If this gets any better, I'm going to get two knives.
Pays to advertise.
- So, what about Moriarty, then?
- Oh, I have a plan.
I'm going to monitor the underworld, every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
So, basically, your plan is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do?
Awesome, isn't it?
He Dr.owned, Mr. Holmes.
That's what we thought.
- But when they opened up his lungs...
- Yes?
Sand.
Superficial.
Come back!
It's the wrong thumb.
- Sherlock...
- It's never twins.
Hopkins, arrest Wilson.
Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.
- 'Wilson?
' 'Lymph nodes?
'
- Sherlock...
Yes, you may have nothing but a limbless torso, but there'll be traces of ink in the lymph nodes under the armpits.
If your mystery corpse had tattoos, the signs will be there.
- 'Bloody hell!
Is that a guess?
'
- I never guess.
- Sherlock...
- 'So, he's the killer?
The canary trainer?
'
- Of course he's the killer.
- 'Didn't see that coming.'
Hm, naturally.
Sherlock, you can't go on spinning plates like this.
That's it!
The place was spinning.
The heart medication you're taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.
Yes, I...
I think so.
Why?
Because the fingerprints on your brother's neck were your own.
- A jellyfish?
- I know.
You can't arrest a jellyfish.
- You could try.
- We did try.
Oh...
- Oh, God.
- Mary?
59 missed calls.
We're in a lot of trouble.
Ow!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Relax, it's got two syllables...
I'm a nurse, darling - I think I know what to do!
- Come on, then...
- Re!
Lax!
No, just Dr.ive, please, God, just Dr.ive!
God, Dr.ive!
Sherlock
- Mary!
That's it, Mary - re...
- Don't you start!
- Lax.
John, John...
I think you have to pull over!
- Mary, Mary...
- Pull over!
Oh, my God!
Has that come out?
They never come out when I take them.
Let's have a look.
Aw, she's so beautiful.
- Have another go.
- What about a name?
- Catherine.
- Uh, yeah, we've gone off that.
Have we?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Well, you know what I think...
- It's not a girl's name.
Molly, Mr.s H, we would love you to be godparents.
- Oh!
Really?
- If you...
That's so lovely.
And, uh... you too, Sherlock?
- You too what?
- Godfather, we'd like you to be godfather.
God is a ludicrous fiction, Dr.eamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.
Yeah, but there'll be cake.
Will you do it?
I'll get back to you.
Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.
In Christ's name.
Now, what name have you given your daughter?
Rosamund Mary.
Rosamund?
It means "Rose of the world".
Rosie for short.
Didn't you get John's text?
No.
I delete his texts.
I delete any text that begins "Hi."
No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.
Sorry.
Phone!
And now, godparents, are you ready to help the parents of this child in their duties as Christian parents?
We are.
'Sorry, I didn't catch that.
'Please repeat the question.'
As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.
To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
Hard logic versus romantic whiMs.y - that is your choice.
You fail to connect actions to their consequences.
Now, for the last time, if you want to keep the rattle, do not throw the rattle.
All right, good girl, good girl.
Good girl.
I'd better finish this, hadn't I?
- Hey.
- Afternoon.
He says you've got a good one, Greg?
Oh, yeah.
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.
God, 50!
Where does it go?
I know for a fact I was only 21 this time last week.
Yeah, well that's impossible.
That was before you met me.
- Well, no, no, there never was...
- "There never was such a time."
She's looking at me disapprovingly again.
No.
She's just jealous.
Yeah, well, I think we both are.
- Oh...
- No, no, David.
- Come on, you promised.
- No, it's...
Oh, no...
Oh, it's a Skype call.
Oh!
Then it must be Charlie.
At least he's phoning, I suppose.
Oh, look!
Hello!
'Hey, Dad.
Happy birthday.
Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?
'
No!
Picture's frozen!
'Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you.'
Why is it rubbish?
Where are you?
How is he?
Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.
David?
Come on!
OK, no, hang on a sec, I'll find somewhere quieter.
So, Charlie, where are you?
Are you there?
- 'Sorry, I'm here.
I'm just a bit...'
- Are you all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
Altitude?
'I'm in Tibet.
Didn't you see the mountains?
'
Never mind mountains.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.
- 'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?
'
- What?
'Could you just check something on my car?
'
Your car?
'To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe
I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet.
- 'Could you take a photo and send it?
'
- Uh, yes, I can do that.
All done.
Have you got it?
Charlie?
A week later...
Yeah?
Something really weird happens.
Dr.unk Dr.iver, he's totally smashed, the cops are chasing him, and he turns into the Dr.ive of the Welsborough house to try and get away.
Unfortunately...
The Dr.unk guy survived, they managed to pull him out, but when they put the fire out and examined the parked car...
Whose body?
Charlie Welsborough, the son.
- What?
- The son who was in Tibet.
DNA all checks out.
Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.
- Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
- Have you got a lab report?
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.
- The seats?
- Yes, the car seats.
Made of vinyl.
Two different types of vinyl present.
Was it his own car?
Yeah, not flash - he was a student.
- Well, that's suggestive.
- Why?
- Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
- Yeah, right?
- There's something else.
- Yes?
According to this,
Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.
What?
The body in the car, dead for a week.
Oh, this is a good one.
Is it my birthday?
You want help?
- Yes, please.
OK.
- One condition.
Take all the credit.
It gets boring if I just solve them all.
Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.
He's got a point.
Which makes me look like some kind of Prima Donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do!
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.
- Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
- Definitely a sore spot.
So you take all the glory, thanks...
- OK!
- Thanks all the same.
Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?
It's Dr.iving me nuts.
Anything you say, Giles.
Just kidding.
What's his name?
Greg.
What?
Greg.
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?
Not a clue.
It's just you normally say that at this point.
Hmm.
Well, then, let's hope you solve your little problem, Greg.
- Hear that?
- I know.
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood?
- Oh, good, great.
Yeah, amazing.
- Getting any sleep?
- Christ, no.
You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.
- Must feel very different...
- Sorry, what?
Yes, well, you know how it is.
All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.
- Are you two having a little joke?
- Never a word of thanks.
Can't even tell people's faces apart.
This is a joke, isn't it?
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever.
You're so, so clever."
- Is it about me?
- I think he needs winding.
You know, I think that really might be it.
No, don't get it.
Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect, so go easy on them, yeah?
- You know me.
- 'Hey, hello.'
Yeah.
Got them, don't worry.
Pampers, the cream you can't get from Boots.
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now?
- At the dead boy's house?
- Yeah.
'And what does he think?
Any theories?
'
Well, I texted you the details.
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.
- Hey!
- How do you know about that?
'Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.'
- They know everything!
- 'Solved it, then?
'
I'm working on it.
'Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.'
- Pig!
- Keep trying.
'So, what about it, then?
'What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it?
'And what are you going to call this one?
'
Oh, the Ghost Dr.iver.
- Don't give it a title.
- People like the titles.
- They hate the titles.
- Give the people what they want.
No, never do that - people are stupid.
Uh, some people.
'All people are stupid.
Most people.'
'Bizarre enough though, isn't it, to be him?
'
I mean, it's right up your Straße.
Mr. and Mr.s Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.
- Son.
- Son!
Mr. and Mr.s Welsborough, this is Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.
If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.
Well, I believe that I... can.
But Charlie was our whole world, Mr. Holmes.
I...
Sherlock?
Mr. Holmes?
Sorry, you were saying?
Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr. Holmes.
I...
I don't think we'll ever get over this.
No.
Shouldn't think so.
So sorry, will you excuse me a moment?
I just...
I'll...
I'll just, um...
Ahem.
- Now what's wrong?
- Not sure, I just...
By the pricking of my thumbs.
Seriously?
You?
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.
They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.
What is this?
Oh, it's a sort of shrine, I suppose, really.
Bit of a fan of Mr.s T.
A big hero of mine when I was getting started.
Right, yes.
- Who?
- What?
- Who...?
Who was this?
- Are you serious?
- Sherlock...
- It's...
It's Margaret Thatcher, the first female Prime Minister of this country.
Right.
- Prime Minister?
Right.
- Leader of the Government.
- Female?
- For God's sake!
You know perfectly well who she is.
Why are you playing for time?
It's the gap, look at the gap.
It's wrong.
Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed.
The whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.
This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been in, this picture is straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.
Something's missing from here, but only recently.
Yes, a...
- Plaster bust... - plaster bust.
- Oh, for God's sake!
It got broken.
What the hell has this got to do with Charlie?
- Rug!
- What?
Well, how could it get broken?
The only place for it to fall is the floor and there is a big thick rug.
- Does it matter?
- Mr.s Welsborough, my apologies.
- It is worth letting him do this.
- Is your friend quite mad?
No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
We found the remains out there in the porch.
- The porch where we came in?
- How anybody could hate her so much they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness...
I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.
Why didn't he smash all the others?
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.
Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.
- And if there's nothing...
- I know what happened to your son.
You do?
It's quite simple, superficial, to be blunt.
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness?
- Well, yes.
- And the porch where it was smashed,
I noticed the motion sensor was damaged,
- so I assume it's permanently lit.
- How did you notice that?
I lack the arrogance to ignore details.
I'm not the police.
So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.
Exactly.
- Why?
- Don't know.
Wouldn't be fun if I knew.
Mr. Holmes, please!
It was your 50th birthday, Mr. Welsborough, of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
- After all, he was in Tibet.
- Yes.
- No.
- No?
* Happy birthday... *
The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video.
Easily arranged.
It's a Skype call.
The trick was meant to be a surprise.
- A trick?
- Obviously.
Could you take a photo and send it?
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.
Well, good enough.
Effectively a costume.
You're joking?
No, I'm not.
All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
- Oh, my God!
- Surprise!
That's when it happened.
I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.
You said he'd felt unwell?
You all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
He died there and then.
No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained, in the Dr.iver's seat, hidden, until...
When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who'd been sitting there, quite dead, for a week.
Oh, God!
Poor kid.
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr. Welsborough, Mr.s Welsborough.
This is where it was smashed.
- That was amazing.
- What?
The car, the kid.
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?
I can't stand it, never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
What kind of a life would that be?
Besides, I have the strangest feeling...
Miss me?
- That's mine.
You two take a... bus.
- Why?
I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.
The Mall, please.
- I met her once.
- Thatcher?
Rather arrogant, I thought.
- You thought that?
!
- Ha, I know.
Why am I looking at this?
That's her, John and Mary's baby.
Oh, I see, yes.
Looks very... fully functioning.
Is that really the best you can do?
Sorry, I've never been very good with them.
- Babies?
- Humans.
Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?
Any interest in her?
Why on earth would he?
I don't know.
You tell me.
In the last year of his life,
James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over 70 assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias,
which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.
It's a pearl - get another one.
There's something important about this.
I'm sure.
Maybe it's Moriarty.
Maybe it's not.
But something's coming.
Are you having a premonition, brother mine?
The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other.
What we call premonition is just movement of the web.
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable.
As inevitable as mathematics.
Appointment In Samarra.
I'm sorry?
The merchant who can't outrun Death.
You always hated that story as a child.
Less keen on predestination back then.
I'm not sure I like it now.
You wrote your own version, as I remember.
Appointment In Sumatra.
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.
Goodnight, Mycroft.
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.
- Keep me informed.
- Of what?
Absolutely no idea.
'Ammo!
'
- Oh, hi, Stella.
- Greg.
You, uh...?
- Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...
- Right, right, right...
Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?
It's nothing.
I mean it's nothing serious.
- No, no.
- I just pop round every now and again for a chat.
Yeah, of course.
I mean he loves a really tricky case.
Yeah, he does!
So what you here for?
Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so...
The Borgia Pearl?
They still after that, are they?
Yeah.
So, how did you two first meet?
Oh, well, there was a case about, um, ten years ago.
Nobody could figure it out.
There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.
- Oh, yeah?
How did she die?
- Hypothermia.
What?
I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...
Will you two please keep it down?
!
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?
You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.
I was a carpenter.
Like me dad.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
How the hell...?
Ah... e-cigarettes.
Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.
If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.
But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last.
Anything to add, John?
- John?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.
- What is that?
- That is... me.
Well, it's a me substitute.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You know I value your little contributions.
Yeah?
It's been there since nine this morning.
- Has it?
Where were you?
- Helping Mr.s H with her sudoku.
What about my girlfriend?
- What?
- You said I had an ex...
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.
The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seeMs. you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.
I...
I thought you'd done something clever.
Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr. Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
What do you mean?
Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
- Well...
- You thought she was having an affair.
I'm afraid it's far worse than that, your wife is a spy.
- What?
- That's right.
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy, across the road from your flat.
Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy, as part of an official state visit.
As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new Dr.ug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.
This Dr.ug will render the President entirely susceptible to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty.
What?
Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III.
- Are you serious?
- No, of course not.
His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.
I don't!
- Just the bras.
- Get out.
So, what's this all about, then?
- Having fun.
- Fun?
- While I can.
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, Sherlock...
- Borgia Pearl.
Boring.
Go!
- But...
- Go!
- This had better be good.
- Oh, I think you'll like it.
That is the bust, isn't it?
The one that was broken.
No, it's another one, different owner.
Different part of town.
You were right, this is a thing.
Something's going on.
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be pleased.
- I am pleased.
- You don't look pleased.
This is my game face.
And the game is on.
Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one.
- One belonging to Mr. Mohandes Hassan.
- Identical busts?
Yeah, and this one to a Dr. Barnicot in Holborn.
Three in total.
God knows who'd want to do something like this.
Yeah, but some people have that complex, don't they?
An idee fixe.
They obsess over one thing and they can't let it go.
No, no good.
There were other images of Margaret...
Margaret...?
You know who she is.
Thatcher, present at the first break-in.
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?
Ooh!
- What?
- Blood.
Quite a bit of it, too.
Was there any injury at the crime scene?
Nah.
Then our suspect must have cut theMs.elves breaking the bust.
- Come on.
- Holborn?
Lambeth!
- Lambeth?
Why?
- To see Toby.
Ah, right.
Who?
- You'll see.
- Right, are you coming?
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.
- Who told you?
- The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.
- Have a good time.
- I will.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
- What?
- She's not the one.
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.
How do you work all that out?
She's got three chilDr.en in Rio that he doesn't know about.
Are you just making this up?
- Possibly.
- Who's Toby?
There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker, one of the world's best.
Got hiMs.elf into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago.
He hacked into the Pentagon security system, and I managed to get him off the charge.
Therefore he owes me a favour.
So, how does that help us?
- What?
- Toby the hacker?
- Toby's not the hacker.
- What?
- All right, Craig?
- All right, Sherlock?
Craig's got a dog.
So I see.
Good boy!
Hiya!
Mary?
What are you...?
No, we, we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case.
No, exactly.
So... don't wait up.
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Hey.
Mary, what are you doing here?
She's better at this than you.
- Better?
- So I texted her.
Hang on, Mary's better than me?
Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.
Of course she's better.
Yeah, OK.
Nothing personal.
What, so I'm supposed to just go home now, am I?
What do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?
- John or the dog?
- Ha-ha, that's funny!
- John.
- Well...
He's handy and loyal.
- That's hilarious.
- Is it too early for a divorce?
Oh.
Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge?
Keep up, he's fast.
- He's not moving.
- He's thinking.
He's really not moving.
Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.
You just like this dog, don't you?
- Well, I like you.
- He's still not moving.
- Fascinating.
- Oh!
Well, what do you make of it?
- They were looking for something.
- Yes, but it wasn't a burglar, they came specifically for that Thatcher bust.
Why?
Clever.
Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail,
- where would you go?
- Like hiding a tree in a forest.
Or blood in a butcher's.
Never mind, Toby, better luck next time, hmm?
This is it, though.
This is the one, I can feel it.
Not Moriarty?
It has to be him.
It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.
It's designed to beguile me, tease me and lure me in.
At last, a noose for me to put my neck into.
You should have seen the state of the front room.
- It was like The Exorcist.
- Huh.
Was Rosie's head spinning round?
- No.
Just the projectile vomiting.
- Nice!
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
- Hmm?
Noticed what?
- The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
Yeah, can't she?
I'm coming, darling.
Mummy's coming.
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here.
Have you heard of that thing?
In Germany?
You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.
Ostalgie.
People who missed the old days under the communists.
- People are weird, aren't they?
- Hmm.
According to this, there's quite a market for Cold War memorabilia.
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit?
Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.
Yes, fascinating.
Irrelevant.
Where exactly did they come from?
I've got into the records of the suppliers, Gelder and Co.
SeeMs. they're from Georgia.
Where exactly?
Tbilisi.
Batch of six.
One to Welsborough.
One to Hassan.
One to Dr. Barnicot.
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.
One to a Mr. Jack Sandeford of Reading.
Lestrade?
Another one?
- 'Yeah.'
- Harker or Sandeford?
Harker.
And it's murder this time.
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.
Defensive wounds on her face and hands, throat cut.
Sharp blade.
The same thing inside the house?
The bust?
- Two of them this time.
- Interesting.
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago.
- Limited edition of six.
- And now someone's wandering about destroying them all.
Makes no sense.
What's the point?
No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.
- Yes, it is.
- Well, it is, but it's not the point.
I've been slow, far too slow.
Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind...
Slow but lucky, very lucky.
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.
Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.
Congratulations, by the way.
- I'm sorry?
- Well, you're about to solve a big one.
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
- Yeah, until then, basically.
That's enough now, love.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.
And you need to get to bed.
Come on.
Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?
You were on the run.
Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady Dr.ying, it's clever.
Very clever.
But now you've met me and you're not so clever, are you?
Who are you?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.
Argh!
You're out of time.
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
- Who?
I know it's him.
It must be him.
You think you understand.
You understand nothing.
Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don't we just enjoy the moment?
Let me present Interpol's number one case.
Too tough for them, too boring for me.
The Black Pearl of the Borgias!
It's not possible!
How could she...?
!
Everything about who I was is on there.
The probleMs. of your past are your business.
The probleMs. of your future... are my privilege.
I don't understand.
She...
She destroyed it.
She?
You know her!
You do, don't you?
You know the bitch?
!
She betrayed me.
Betrayed us all.
Mary.
This is about Mary?
Is that what she's calling herself now, eh?
- 'Armed police, you're surrounded!
'
- Give it to me.
Give it to me!
'Come out slowly, I want to see your hands above your head.'
Nobody shoots me!
Anyone shoots, I kill this man.
'Lay down your weapon.
Do it now!
'
I'm leaving this place.
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.
'Lay down your weapon.'
You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
Tell her she's a dead woman.
She's a dead woman walking.
She's my friend.
And she's under my protection.
Who are you?
I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.
Who's Sherlock Holmes?
Not a policeman.
What do you think?
Mate in two?
Don't antagonise them, darling.
Oh, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.
Everything palls.
They'll send someone soon.
They?
Who are they?
SeeMs. to me we put an awful lot of faith in they.
Well, I've got something they would dearly love, if only we could get out of here.
I've got Ammo.
Ammo?
- Madame Ambassador.
- What took you so long?
- Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now!
Veer left!
What now?
What do we do?
We die.
Well?
He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.
- I very much doubt it.
- Why?
Because I think he used to work with Mary.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out!
We'll come back later.
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the English woman?
What would you do to a traitor?
Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.
I am an idiot, I know nothing.
Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
That was quite a text you sent me.
What's going on, Sherlock?
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,
I couldn't see what was right under my nose.
Expected a pearl.
Oh, my God, that's a...
Yes, it's an AGRA.
Memory stick, like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.
Who?
I don't know.
We...
We all had one but the others were...
Haven't you even looked at it yet?
I glanced at it but I prefer
- to hear it from you.
- Why?
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.
There were four of us, agents.
Not just agents.
Polite term.
Alex.
Gabriel.
Me.
And Ajay.
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.
We all had one.
Each containing aliases, our background, everything.
We could never be betrayed, because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.
- Who employed you?
- Anyone who paid well.
I mean, we were at the top of our game for years.
And then it all ended.
There was a coup in Georgia.
The British Embassy in Tbilisi was taken over, lots of hostages.
We got the call to go in, get them out.
There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.
- Who from?
- I don't know, just another voice on the phone.
And a codeword.
- Ammo.
- Ammo?
Like ammunition.
We went in, but then something went wrong.
Something went really wrong.
That was six years ago.
It feels like forever.
I was the only one that made it out.
No.
What?
I met someone tonight.
Same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.
What, he's alive?
Yeah, very much so.
I don't believe it, this is amazing!
I thought I was the only one,
I thought I was the only one who got out.
Where is he?
I need to see him, now!
Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?
Yeah, of course.
It was our insurance.
Above all, they mustn't fall into enemy hands.
So Ajay survived as well.
And now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide, with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why?
I don't know.
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.
Families fall out.
The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
Well, he's just trying to find me.
He survived, that's all that matters!
I heard it from his own mouth.
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."
Why would he want to kill me?
- He said you betrayed him.
- Oh, no, no, that's insane.
Well, it's what he believes.
I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.
No, Mary...
You do.
I made a vow, remember?
To look after the three of you.
Sherlock, the Dr.agon-slayer.
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
There's something I think you should read.
What is it?
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.
What are you...?
- Mary...
Oh, no!
- There you go.
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.
No.
You just look after them till I get back.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Agra?
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
It is 378km west of the state capital, Lucknow.
What are you, Wikipedia?
- Yes.
- AGRA is an acronym.
Oh, good, I love an acronym.
All the best secret societies have them.
Team of agents, the best.
But you know all that.
Of course I do.
Go on.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.
Indeed?
Well, that's news to me.
Is it?
He's already killed looking for that memory stick.
AGRA always worked for the highest bidder,
I thought that might include you?
- Me?
- Well, I mean the British government, or whatever government you're currently propping up.
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.
They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong.
And that was that, we stopped using freelancers.
- Your initiative?
- My initiative.
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.
I don't like loose ends.
Not on my watch.
There was something else.
A detail.
A codeword.
Ammo?
It's all I've got.
Little enough.
Could you do some digging as a favour?
You don't have many favours left.
Then I'm calling them all in.
And if you can find who's after her and neutralise them, what then?
You think you can go on saving her forever?
Of course.
Is that sentiment talking?
No, it's me.
Difficult to tell the difference these days.
Told you, I made a promise.
A vow.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.
Not on my watch.
'My darling, I need to tell you this because you mustn't hate me for going away.'
Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.
- Can you hear a squeaking?
- No.
Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel.
Why Planes Fail.
- Did you see it?
Oh, truly terrifying.
- Can't say I did.
Swore I would never fly again, yet hear I am!
Everything OK, madam?
No.
No, no, it's not, but then what's the use in complaining?
I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off is all.
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.
Oh, OK.
Relax.
She said relax.
Did you have a nice time in London?
It was OK, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun?
Did you lose it in the war?
'I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.
I'm not running, I promise you that,
I just need to do this in my own way.'
Oh, God!
I'm...
I-I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God!
- Everything OK, madam?
- I think I'm dying.
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.
God will smile on you.
'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,
I'm sorry, my love.'
I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.
Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of a dice.
I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
I swear I will.'
Not like this one.
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in!
I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.
Mr. Baker.
Well, that completes the set.
- No, it does not.
- Well, who else am I missing?
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.
How many more times, Mr. Sherlock?
Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.
Oh, hi, Mary.
What concept?
Happy families.
Nice trip?
- How the f...?
- Please, Mary, there is a child present.
- How did you get in here?
- Karim let me in.
Hello.
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Nice to meet you, missus.
No, I mean how did you find me?
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
No, really, though, how?
Every movement I made was entirely random, every new personality just on the roll of a dice!
Mary, no human action is ever truly random.
An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability, mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual, can reduce the number of variables considerably.
I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine a seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.
But they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.
Oh, you bastard!
- You bastard!
- I know, but your face!
"The mathematics of probability"?
- You believed that.
- "Feasible variables"?
Yes, I started to run out about then.
In the memory stick!
Yeah, that was my idea.
- AGRA?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
You said it was your initials.
In a way that was true.
In a way?
So many lies.
I'm so sorry.
And I don't just mean you.
What?
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...
You're R?
Rosamund?
Rosamund Mary.
I always liked Mary.
Yeah, me too.
I used to.
I just...
I didn't know what else to do.
You could have stayed, you could have talked to me.
That's what couples are supposed to do.
Work things through.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Mary, I may not be a very good man... but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for,
- most of the time.
- All the time.
You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.
You never judge, you never complain.
I don't deserve you, I...
All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
I will keep you safe.
But it has to be in London.
It's my city, I know the turf.
Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.
Get down!
Hello again.
- Ajay?
- Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.
Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.
I thought I was the only one who got out.
How did you find us?
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.
You found her but I found you.
So perhaps not so clever.
And now here we are.
At last.
Touche!
Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
She thought I was dead.
I might as well have been.
It was always just the four of us, always, remember?
Oh, yeah.
So why do you want to kill me?
Do you know how long they kept me prisoner?
What they did to me?
They tortured Alex to death.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.
But you?
You, where were you?
That day at the embassy, I escaped.
Ha!
But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
Where were you?
Oh, I got out.
For a while.
Long enough to hide my memory stick.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.
I was loyal, you see.
Loyal to my friends.
But they took me, tortured me.
Not for information.
Not for anything except fun.
They thought I'd give in, die, but I didn't, I lived.
And eventually, they forgot about me rotting in a cell somewhere.
Six years they kept me there.
Until one day I saw my chance.
Oh, and I made them pay.
You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.
Little whispers.
Laughter.
Gossip.
How the clever agents had been betrayed.
Brought down by you!
Me?
You know I'll kill you too.
You know I will, Ajay.
What, you think I care if I die?
I've Dr.eamed of killing you... every night for six years.
Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.
I swear to you, Ajay.
What did you hear, Ajay?
When you were a prisoner, what exactly did you hear?
What did I hear?
Ammo.
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo."
Ammo.
"Ammo.
Ammo."
We were betrayed!
- And they said it was her?
- That you betrayed us!
They said her name?
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.
No!
No!
'The English woman, that's all he heard.
Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.'
Couldn't this wait until you're back?
No, it's not over.
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed, the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.
There was only a voice on the phone.
'Remember?
And a codeword.'
"Ammo," yes, you said.
How's your Latin, brother dear?
My Latin?
Amo, amas, amat.
I love, you love, he loves.
What...?
Not "Ammo" as in ammunition, but "Amo", meaning?
You'd better be right, Sherlock.
Bloody thing!
What's going on?
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.
What?
'So many lies.
And I don't just mean you.'
- Hello.
- Ah, hello.
- I like your daisy.
- Thank you, yeah.
It's not really me, though, I think.
- No?
- No, no, it's too floral for me.
I'm more of a "knackered with weary old eyes" kind of guy.
Well, I think they're nice.
Nice eyes.
- Thank you.
- Look...
Look...
I don't normally do this,
- but, um...
- But you're going to.
Yeah.
- What's this?
- This is me.
- Thank you.
Cheers.
- Yeah.
Great.
- Bye!
- Bye.
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
Hmm?
Noticed what?
The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
- Yeah, can't she?
- Hmm.
I'm coming darling.
I'm coming.
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
-
- Come here...
It's OK.
Do you want a cuddle?
I know.
Oh, sweetheart.-
Ssh.
Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you?
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?
Oh, let's go and see Daddy!
Daddy's here.
It's OK, Rosie.
I'll take her.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I may as well get up now.
Hey, baby, it's Daddy.
Your daddy.
Come here, Rose.
Come here, darling, it's all right.
Thank you.
This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.
How many more times?
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.
And you're basing all this on a code name?
On a whispered voice on the telephone?
Come on, Mycroft.
You were the conduit for AGRA.
Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
It was my job.
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
AGRA went in.
- Yes.
- And they were betrayed.
Not by me.
Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.
I promise you,
I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.
You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.
Not one.
Not.
One.
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories?
I'd like to do those.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.
Although she does seem to enjoy them.
Well, I'll have to give that a go.
Got a lot to catch up on.
'You think you understand.
You understand nothing.'
'Code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love.'
'You'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.
'They know everything.'
'They said it was the English woman.'
'Don't minute any of this.'
'They know everything.'
- You don't make it easy, do you?
- What do you mean?
Well, being... being so perfect.
Mary, I...
I need to tell you...
Hang on.
Can you tell me later?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Great.
Well, no, we can't just go.
- Rosie.
- Yeah.
- Er, you go.
- No!
I'll come as soon as I've found someone.
Mr.s Hudson.
- Corfu till Saturday.
Molly?
- Er, yeah, I'll try.
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.
You know that's not going to happen.
If there's more to this case, you need to see it.
Yeah, OK, you win.
'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes.
'Please make your way to the exit.
Thank you.'
Your office said I'd find you here.
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.
We're like them.
Ghostly, living in the shadows.
Predatory?
Well, it depends which side you're on.
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.
Nice location for the final act, couldn't have chosen it better myself.
But then I never could resist a touch of the Dr.amatic.
I just come here to look at the fish.
I knew this would happen one day.
- It's like that old story.
- I really am a very busy man.
Would you mind cutting to the chase?
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
With good reason.
"There was once a merchant, in a famous market in Baghdad."
I really have never liked this story.
I'm just like the merchant in the story,
I thought I could out-run the inevitable.
I've always been looking over my shoulder, always expecting to see the grim figure of...
Death.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hey.
- John?
- On his way.
Let me introduce Ammo.
You were Ammo?
You were the person on the phone that time?
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
Why did you betray us?
Why does anyone do anything?
- Hmm.
- Let me guess, selling secrets?
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.
Worked very well for a few years.
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it.
But...
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.
I couldn't believe my luck!
That bought me a little time.
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
Very handy.
They were always such reliable killers.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.
Lady Smallwood gave the order.
But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.
Seemed to do the trick.
And you thought your troubles were over.
I was tired.
Tired of the mess of it all.
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.
The hostages were killed.
AGRA too.
Or so I thought.
My secret was safe.
But... apparently not.
Just a little peace.
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
A family?
Home?
Really, I understand.
So, just let me get out of here, right?
Let me just walk away.
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.
What do you say?
After what you did?
!
Mary, no!
OK.
London Aquarium.
Yes, now.
I was never a field agent.
I always thought I'd be rather good.
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
Thanks.
- For a secretary.
- What?
It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
- I didn't do this out of jealousy.
- No?
Same old Dr.udge, day in, day out.
Never getting out there where all the excitement was.
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.
Yes, your little flat.
- How do you know?
- Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?
And what are you, widowed or divorced?
Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.
That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.
- Sherlock...
- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.
A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.
- Sherlock, don't.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.
There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
That accounts for the Dr.ink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.
So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.
To prove how good you are.
To make up for the inadequacies of your...
little life.
Well, Mr.s Norbury,
I must admit this is unexpected.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.
All except Sherlock Holmes.
There's no way out.
So it would seem.
You've seen right through me, Mr. Holmes.
It's what I do.
Maybe I can still surprise you.
Now, come on, be sensible.
Hmm, no, I don't think so.
Ah!
Surprise!
Everything's fine.
It's going to be OK.
Get an ambulance!
It's all right, it's all right.
- Mary!
- John.
All right, Mary?
Mary?
Stay with me, stay with me.
- Oh, come on...
- No, don't worry.
Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
Come on, Mary.
Mary?
Oh, God.
John, I think this is it.
No, no, no, no.
It's not.
- That's...
- You made me so happy.
You gave me everything I could ever, ever have wanted...
Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.
- Look after Rosie.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.
- Promise me.
- I promise.
- No...
- Yes, I promise.
- Promise me!
- I promise, I promise.
Ssh, ssh.
Hey, Sherlock.
Yes.
I... so like you.
Did I ever say?
Yes, yes, you did.
I'm sorry for... for shooting you that time.
I'm really sorry.
- It's all right.
- I think we're even now, OK?
OK.
- Oh, I think we're...
- Mary, Mary...
- even, definitely even.
- Ssh, ssh.
You were my whole world.
Being Mary Watson... was the only life worth living.
- Mary...
- Thank you.
Mary...
Don't you dare!
You made a vow.
You swore it.
'You've been having Dr.eaMs..
A recurring Dr.eam?
'
Do you want to talk about it?
This is a two-way relationship, you know.
The whole world has come crashing down around you.
Everything's hopeless.
Irretrievable.
I know that's what you must feel... but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
That's not really my style.
I need to know what to do.
Do?
About John.
Put me through to Sherrinford, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
But nothing will ever be the same again, will it?
I'm afraid it won't.
We'll have to rally round, I expect, do our bit.
Look after little Rosie.
I'm just going to, um... look through these things.
There might be a case.
A case?
Oh, you're not up to it, are you?
Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mr..s Hudson.
Yes.
Yes, I expect you're right.
I'll make some tea, shall I?
- Mr..s Hudson?
- Yes, Sherlock?
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident...
- Yes?
- Would you just say the word Norbury to me?
Would you?
Norbury?
Just that.
I'd be very grateful.
What's this?
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.
Oh, God!
Is that...?
- Must be.
- Oh.
I knew it wouldn't end like this.
I knew Moriarty made plans.
'I thought that would get your attention.
So, this is in case...
In case the day comes.
If you are watching this, I'm probably dead.
I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows?
Nothing's certain, nothing's written.
My old life... it was full of consequences.
The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.
You need to remember that.
So...
I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
Might be the hardest case of your career.
When I'm... gone, if I'm gone...
I need you to do something for me.'
Hi.
I just wondered how things were going and... if there was anything I could do.
It's, er, it's from John.
- Right.
- You don't need to read it now.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.
He says...
John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...
Yes?
He said he'd... that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Anyone.
'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
When I'm gone, if I'm... gone...
I need you to do something for me.
Save John Watson.
Save him, Sherlock.
Save him.'
'When does the path we walk on lock around our feet?
When does the road become a river with only one destination?
'
'Death waits for us all in Samarra.
But can Samarra be avoided?
'
Go to hell, Sherlock!
- My brother is a murderer.
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.
Oh, do your research.
I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Merry Christmas!
I'm not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.
You know what happened to the other one.
Miss me?
'Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
'
I've only been gone four minutes.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Is that quite clear?
Don't minute any of this.
Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.
A D notice has been slapped on the entire incident.
Only those within this room, code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love, will ever know the whole truth.
As far as everyone else is concerned, going to the Prime Minister and way beyond, Charles Augustus...
- Are you tweeting?
!
- No.
Well, that's what it looks like!
Of course I'm not tweeting.
Why would I be tweeting?
- Give me that!
- What?
No!
What are you doing?
!
- Get off!
- Give it here!
- "Back on terra firma."
- Don't read them out.
- "Free as a bird."
- God, you're such a spoilsport.
Will you take this matter seriously, Sherlock?
I am!
What makes you think I'm not taking it seriously?
"#OhWhatABeautifulMorning"
Look, not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death - my death!
And now I'm back, in a nice warm office, with my big brother and...
Are those ginger nuts?
- Oh, God...
- Love ginger nuts.
Our doctor said you were clean.
I am.
Utterly.
No need for stimulants now, remember?
I have work to do.
You're high as a kite!
Natural high, I assure you.
Totally natural.
I'm just... ♪ ..glad to be alive!
♪
What shall we do next?
What's your name?
Vivian.
- What would you do, Vivian?
- Pardon?
Well, it's a lovely day.
Go for a stroll?
Make a paper aeroplane?
Have an ice lolly?
Ice lolly, I suppose.
Ice lolly it is!
- What's your favourite?
- Well, really, I shouldn't...
- Go on.
- Do they still do Mivvies?
- Mr Holmes...
- Yes?
- ...we do need to get on.
- Yes, of course.
'Do your research.
'I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
..sociopath.
I see.
Who is supposed to have shot him, then?
Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger - that's who.
- That's not what happened at all.
- It is now.
Remarkable.
How did you do it?
We have some very talented people working here.
If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.
That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.
No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.
You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.
You're home and dry.
OK, cheers.
Obviously, there's unfinished business.
Moriarty.
I told you
- Moriarty's dead.
You say he filmed that video message before he died.
Yes.
You also say you know what he's going to do next.
- What does that mean?
- Perhaps that's all there is to it.
Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
No, no, he would never be that disappointing.
He's planned something, something long-term.
Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.
Posthumous revenge.
No, better than that - posthumous game.
We brought you back to deal with this.
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.
Wait?
!
Of course wait.
I'm the target - targets wait.
Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up,
I'll know when it begins.
I always know when the game is on.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because I love it.
There was once a merchant, in the famous market at Baghdad.
One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise, and he knew that the stranger was Death.
Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles, to the city of Samarra.
For there he was sure Death could not find him.
But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.
"Very well," said the merchant.
"I give in.
I am yours."
"But tell me, why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"
"Because," said Death,
"I had an appointment with you tonight... ..in Samarra."
If this gets any better, I'm going to get two knives.
Pays to advertise.
- So, what about Moriarty, then?
- Oh, I have a plan.
I'm going to monitor the underworld, every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
So, basically, your plan is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do?
Awesome, isn't it?
He drowned, Mr Holmes.
That's what we thought.
- But when they opened up his lungs...
- Yes?
..sand.
Superficial.
Come back!
It's the wrong thumb.
_
Sherlock...
It's never twins.
Hopkins, arrest Wilson.
Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.
- 'Wilson?
' 'Lymph nodes?
'
- Sherlock...
Yes, you may have nothing but a limbless torso, but there'll be traces of ink in the lymph nodes under the armpits.
If your mystery corpse had tattoos, the signs will be there.
- 'Bloody hell!
Is that a guess?
'
- I never guess.
- Sherlock...
- 'So, he's the killer?
The canary trainer?
'
- Of course he's the killer.
- 'Didn't see that coming.'
Hm, naturally.
Sherlock, you can't go on spinning plates like this.
That's it!
The place was spinning.
The heart medication you're taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.
Yes, I...
I think so.
Why?
Because the fingerprints on your brother's neck were your own.
- A jellyfish?
- I know.
You can't arrest a jellyfish.
- You could try.
- We did try.
Oh...
- Oh, God.
- Mary?
59 missed calls.
We're in a lot of trouble.
Ow!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Relax, it's got two syllables...
I'm a nurse, darling - I think I know what to do!
- Come on, then...
- Re!
Lax!
No, just drive, please, God, just drive!
God, drive!
Sherlock
- Mary!
That's it, Mary - re...
- Don't you start!
- ...
lax.
John, John...
I think you have to pull over!
- Mary, Mary...
- Pull over!
Oh, my God!
Has that come out?
They never come out when I take them.
Let's have a look.
Aw, she's so beautiful.
- Have another go.
- What about a name?
- Catherine.
- Uh, yeah, we've gone off that.
Have we?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Well, you know what I think...
- It's not a girl's name.
Molly, Mrs H, we would love you to be godparents.
- Oh!
Really?
- If you...
That's so lovely.
And, uh... you too, Sherlock?
- You too what?
- Godfather, we'd like you to be godfather.
God is a ludicrous fiction, dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.
Yeah, but there'll be cake.
Will you do it?
I'll get back to you.
Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.
In Christ's name.
Now, what name have you given your daughter?
Rosamund Mary.
Rosamund?
It means "Rose of the world".
Rosie for short.
Didn't you get John's text?
No.
I delete his texts.
I delete any text that begins "Hi."
No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.
Sorry.
Phone!
And now, godparents, are you ready to help the parents of this child in their duties as Christian parents?
We are.
'Sorry, I didn't catch that.
'Please repeat the question.'
As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.
To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
Hard logic versus romantic whimsy - that is your choice.
You fail to connect actions to their consequences.
Now, for the last time, if you want to keep the rattle, do not throw the rattle.
All right, good girl, good girl.
Good girl.
I'd better finish this, hadn't I?
- Hey.
- Afternoon.
He says you've got a good one, Greg?
Oh, yeah.
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.
God, 50!
Where does it go?
I know for a fact I was only 21 this time last week.
Yeah, well that's impossible.
That was before you met me.
- Well, no, no, there never was...
- "There never was such a time."
She's looking at me disapprovingly again.
No.
She's just jealous.
Yeah, well, I think we both are.
- Oh...
- No, no, David.
- Come on, you promised.
- No, it's...
Oh, no...
Oh, it's a Skype call.
Oh!
Then it must be Charlie.
At least he's phoning, I suppose.
Oh, look!
Hello!
'Hey, Dad.
Happy birthday.
Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?
'
No!
Picture's frozen!
'Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you.'
Why is it rubbish?
Where are you?
How is he?
Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.
David?
Come on!
OK, no, hang on a sec, I'll find somewhere quieter.
So, Charlie, where are you?
Are you there?
- 'Sorry, I'm here.
I'm just a bit...'
- Are you all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
Altitude?
'I'm in Tibet.
Didn't you see the mountains?
'
Never mind mountains.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.
- 'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?
'
- What?
'Could you just check something on my car?
'
Your car?
'To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe
I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet.
- 'Could you take a photo and send it?
'
- Uh, yes, I can do that.
All done.
Have you got it?
Charlie?
A week later...
Yeah?
...something really weird happens.
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed, the cops are chasing him, and he turns into the drive of the Welsborough house to try and get away.
Unfortunately...
The drunk guy survived, they managed to pull him out, but when they put the fire out and examined the parked car...
Whose body?
Charlie Welsborough, the son.
- What?
- The son who was in Tibet.
DNA all checks out.
Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.
- Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
- Have you got a lab report?
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.
- The seats?
- Yes, the car seats.
Made of vinyl.
Two different types of vinyl present.
Was it his own car?
Yeah, not flash - he was a student.
- Well, that's suggestive.
- Why?
- Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
- Yeah, right?
- There's something else.
- Yes?
According to this,
Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.
What?
The body in the car, dead for a week.
Oh, this is a good one.
Is it my birthday?
You want help?
- Yes, please.
OK.
- One condition.
Take all the credit.
It gets boring if I just solve them all.
Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.
He's got a point.
Which makes me look like some kind of prima donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do!
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.
- Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
- Definitely a sore spot.
So you take all the glory, thanks...
- OK!
- ...thanks all the same.
Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?
It's driving me nuts.
Anything you say, Giles.
Just kidding.
What's his name?
Greg.
What?
Greg.
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?
Not a clue.
It's just you normally say that at this point.
Hmm.
Well, then, let's hope you solve your little problem, Greg.
- Hear that?
- I know.
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood?
- Oh, good, great.
Yeah, amazing.
- Getting any sleep?
- Christ, no.
You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.
- Must feel very different...
- Sorry, what?
Yes, well, you know how it is.
All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.
- Are you two having a little joke?
- Never a word of thanks.
Can't even tell people's faces apart.
This is a joke, isn't it?
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever.
You're so, so clever."
- Is it about me?
- I think he needs winding.
You know, I think that really might be it.
No, don't get it.
Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect, so go easy on them, yeah?
- You know me.
- 'Hey, hello.'
Yeah.
Got them, don't worry.
Pampers, the cream you can't get from Boots.
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now?
- At the dead boy's house?
- Yeah.
'And what does he think?
Any theories?
'
Well, I texted you the details.
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.
- Hey!
- How do you know about that?
'Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.'
- They know everything!
- 'Solved it, then?
'
I'm working on it.
'Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.'
- Pig!
- Keep trying.
'So, what about it, then?
'What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it?
'And what are you going to call this one?
'
Oh, the Ghost Driver.
- Don't give it a title.
- People like the titles.
- They hate the titles.
- Give the people what they want.
No, never do that - people are stupid.
Uh, some people.
'All people are stupid.
Most people.'
'Bizarre enough though, isn't it, to be him?
'
I mean, it's right up your strasse.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.
- Son.
- Son!
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.
If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.
Well, I believe that I can.
But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
Sherlock?
Mr Holmes?
Sorry, you were saying?
Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
I don't think we'll ever get over this.
No.
Shouldn't think so.
So sorry, will you excuse me a moment?
I just...
I'll...
I'll just, um...
Ahem.
- Now what's wrong?
- Not sure, I just...
By the pricking of my thumbs.
Seriously?
You?
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.
They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.
What is this?
Oh, it's a sort of shrine, I suppose, really.
Bit of a fan of Mrs T.
A big hero of mine when I was getting started.
Right, yes.
- Who?
- What?
- Who...?
Who was this?
- Are you serious?
- Sherlock...
- It's...
It's Margaret Thatcher, the first female Prime Minister of this country.
Right.
- Prime Minister?
Right.
- Leader of the Government.
- Female?
- For God's sake!
You know perfectly well who she is.
Why are you playing for time?
It's the gap, look at the gap.
It's wrong.
Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed.
The whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.
This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been in, this picture is straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.
- Something's missing from here, but only recently.
- Yes, a...
- Plaster bust... - plaster bust.
- Oh, for God's sake!
It got broken.
What the hell has this got to do with Charlie?
- Rug!
- What?
Well, how could it get broken?
The only place for it to fall is the floor and there is a big thick rug.
- Does it matter?
- Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.
- It is worth letting him do this.
- Is your friend quite mad?
No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
We found the remains out there in the porch.
- The porch where we came in?
- How anybody could hate her so much they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness...
I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.
Why didn't he smash all the others?
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.
Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.
- And if there's nothing...
- I know what happened to your son.
You do?
It's quite simple, superficial, to be blunt.
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness?
- Well, yes.
- And the porch where it was smashed,
I noticed the motion sensor was damaged,
- so I assume it's permanently lit.
- How did you notice that?
I lack the arrogance to ignore details.
I'm not the police.
- So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.
- Exactly.
- Why?
- Don't know.
Wouldn't be fun if I knew.
Mr Holmes, please!
It was your 50th birthday, Mr Welsborough, of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
- After all, he was in Tibet.
- Yes.
- No.
- No?
♪ Happy birthday... ♪
The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video.
Easily arranged.
It's a Skype call.
The trick was meant to be a surprise.
- A trick?
- Obviously.
Could you take a photo and send it?
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.
Well, good enough.
Effectively a costume.
You're joking?
No, I'm not.
All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
- Oh, my God!
- Surprise!
That's when it happened.
I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.
You said he'd felt unwell?
You all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
He died there and then.
No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained, in the driver's seat, hidden, until...
When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who'd been sitting there, quite dead, for a week.
Oh, God!
Poor kid.
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.
This is where it was smashed.
- That was amazing.
- What?
The car, the kid.
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?
I can't stand it, never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
What kind of a life would that be?
Besides, I have the strangest feeling...
Miss me?
- That's mine.
You two take a... bus.
- Why?
I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.
The Mall, please.
- I met her once.
- Thatcher?
Rather arrogant, I thought.
- You thought that?
!
- Ha, I know.
Why am I looking at this?
That's her, John and Mary's baby.
Oh, I see, yes.
Looks very... fully functioning.
Is that really the best you can do?
Sorry, I've never been very good with them.
- Babies?
- Humans.
Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?
Any interest in her?
Why on earth would he?
I don't know.
You tell me.
In the last year of his life,
James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over 70 assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias,
which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.
It's a pearl - get another one.
There's something important about this.
I'm sure.
Maybe it's Moriarty.
Maybe it's not.
But something's coming.
Are you having a premonition, brother mine?
The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other.
What we call premonition is just movement of the web.
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable.
As inevitable as mathematics.
Appointment In Samarra.
I'm sorry?
The merchant who can't outrun Death.
You always hated that story as a child.
Less keen on predestination back then.
I'm not sure I like it now.
You wrote your own version, as I remember.
Appointment In Sumatra.
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.
Goodnight, Mycroft.
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.
- Keep me informed.
- Of what?
Absolutely no idea.
'Ammo!
'
- Oh, hi, Stella.
- Greg.
You, uh...?
- Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...
- Right, right, right...
Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?
It's nothing.
I mean it's nothing serious.
- No, no.
- I just pop round every now and again for a chat.
Yeah, of course.
I mean he loves a really tricky case.
Yeah, he does!
So what you here for?
Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so...
The Borgia Pearl?
They still after that, are they?
Yeah.
So, how did you two first meet?
Oh, well, there was a case about, um, ten years ago.
Nobody could figure it out.
There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.
- Oh, yeah?
How did she die?
- Hypothermia.
What?
I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...
Will you two please keep it down?
!
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?
You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.
I was a carpenter.
Like me dad.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
How the hell...?
Ah... e-cigarettes.
Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.
If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.
But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last.
Anything to add, John?
- John?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.
- What is that?
- That is... me.
Well, it's a me substitute.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You know I value your little contributions.
Yeah?
It's been there since nine this morning.
- Has it?
Where were you?
- Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.
What about my girlfriend?
- What?
- You said I had an ex...
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.
The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.
I...
I thought you'd done something clever.
Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
What do you mean?
Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
- Well...
- You thought she was having an affair.
I'm afraid it's far worse than that, your wife is a spy.
- What?
- That's right.
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy, across the road from your flat.
Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy, as part of an official state visit.
As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.
This drug will render the President entirely susceptible to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty.
What?
Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III.
- Are you serious?
- No, of course not.
His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.
I don't!
- Just the bras.
- Get out.
So, what's this all about, then?
- Having fun.
- Fun?
- While I can.
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, Sherlock...
- Borgia Pearl.
Boring.
Go!
- But...
- Go!
- This had better be good.
- Oh, I think you'll like it.
That is the bust, isn't it?
The one that was broken.
No, it's another one, different owner.
Different part of town.
You were right, this is a thing.
Something's going on.
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be pleased.
- I am pleased.
- You don't look pleased.
This is my game face.
And the game is on.
Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one.
- One belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan.
- Identical busts?
Yeah, and this one to a Dr Barnicot in Holborn.
Three in total.
God knows who'd want to do something like this.
Yeah, but some people have that complex, don't they?
An idee fixe.
They obsess over one thing and they can't let it go.
No, no good.
There were other images of Margaret...
Margaret...?
You know who she is.
...Thatcher, present at the first break-in.
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?
Ooh!
- What?
- Blood.
Quite a bit of it, too.
Was there any injury at the crime scene?
Nah.
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.
- Come on.
- Holborn?
Lambeth!
- Lambeth?
Why?
- To see Toby.
Ah, right.
Who?
- You'll see.
- Right, are you coming?
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.
- Who told you?
- The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.
- Have a good time.
- I will.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
- What?
- She's not the one.
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.
How do you work all that out?
She's got three children in Rio that he doesn't know about.
Are you just making this up?
- Possibly.
- Who's Toby?
There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker, one of the world's best.
Got himself into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago.
He hacked into the Pentagon security system, and I managed to get him off the charge.
Therefore he owes me a favour.
So, how does that help us?
- What?
- Toby the hacker?
- Toby's not the hacker.
- What?
- All right, Craig?
- All right, Sherlock?
Craig's got a dog.
So I see.
Good boy!
Hiya!
Mary?
What are you...?
No, we, we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case.
No, exactly.
So... don't wait up.
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Hey.
Mary, what are you doing here?
She's better at this than you.
- Better?
- So I texted her.
Hang on, Mary's better than me?
Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.
Of course she's better.
Yeah, OK.
Nothing personal.
What, so I'm supposed to just go home now, am I?
What do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?
- John or the dog?
- Ha-ha, that's funny!
- John.
- Well...
He's handy and loyal.
- That's hilarious.
- Is it too early for a divorce?
Oh.
Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge?
Keep up, he's fast.
- He's not moving.
- He's thinking.
He's really not moving.
Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.
You just like this dog, don't you?
- Well, I like you.
- He's still not moving.
- Fascinating.
- Oh!
Well, what do you make of it?
- They were looking for something.
- Yes, but it wasn't a burglar, they came specifically for that Thatcher bust.
Why?
Clever.
Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail,
- where would you go?
- Like hiding a tree in a forest.
Or blood in a butcher's.
Never mind, Toby, better luck next time, hmm?
This is it, though.
This is the one, I can feel it.
Not Moriarty?
It has to be him.
It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.
It's designed to beguile me, tease me and lure me in.
At last, a noose for me to put my neck into.
You should have seen the state of the front room.
- It was like The Exorcist.
- Huh.
Was Rosie's head spinning round?
- No.
Just the projectile vomiting.
- Nice!
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
- Hmm?
Noticed what?
- The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
Yeah, can't she?
I'm coming, darling.
Mummy's coming.
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here.
Have you heard of that thing?
In Germany?
You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.
Ostalgie.
People who missed the old days under the communists.
- People are weird, aren't they?
- Hmm.
According to this, there's quite a market for Cold War memorabilia.
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit?
Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.
Yes, fascinating.
Irrelevant.
Where exactly did they come from?
I've got into the records of the suppliers, Gelder and Co.
Seems they're from Georgia.
Where exactly?
Tbilisi.
Batch of six.
One to Welsborough.
One to Hassan.
One to Dr Barnicot.
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.
One to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.
Lestrade?
Another one?
- 'Yeah.'
- Harker or Sandeford?
Harker.
And it's murder this time.
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.
_
_
Defensive wounds on her face and hands, throat cut.
Sharp blade.
The same thing inside the house?
The bust?
- Two of them this time.
- Interesting.
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago.
- Limited edition of six.
- And now someone's wandering about destroying them all.
Makes no sense.
What's the point?
No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.
- Yes, it is.
- Well, it is, but it's not the point.
I've been slow, far too slow.
Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind...
Slow but lucky, very lucky.
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.
Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.
Congratulations, by the way.
- I'm sorry?
- Well, you're about to solve a big one.
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
- Yeah, until then, basically.
That's enough now, love.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.
And you need to get to bed.
Come on.
Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?
You were on the run.
Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying, it's clever.
Very clever.
But now you've met me and you're not so clever, are you?
Who are you?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.
Argh!
You're out of time.
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
- Who?
I know it's him.
It must be him.
You think you understand.
You understand nothing.
Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don't we just enjoy the moment?
Let me present Interpol's number one case.
Too tough for them, too boring for me.
The Black Pearl of the Borgias!
It's not possible!
How could she...?
!
Everything about who I was is on there.
The problems of your past are your business.
The problems of your future are my privilege.
I don't understand.
She...
She destroyed it.
She?
You know her!
You do, don't you?
You know the bitch?
!
She betrayed me.
Betrayed us all.
Mary.
This is about Mary?
Is that what she's calling herself now, eh?
- 'Armed police, you're surrounded!
'
- Give it to me.
Give it to me!
'Come out slowly, I want to see your hands above your head.'
Nobody shoots me!
Anyone shoots, I kill this man.
'Lay down your weapon.
Do it now!
'
I'm leaving this place.
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.
'Lay down your weapon.'
You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
Tell her she's a dead woman.
She's a dead woman walking.
She's my friend.
And she's under my protection.
Who are you?
I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.
Who's Sherlock Holmes?
Not a policeman.
What do you think?
Mate in two?
Don't antagonise them, darling.
Oh, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.
Everything palls.
They'll send someone soon.
They?
Who are they?
Seems to me we put an awful lot of faith in they.
Well, I've got something they would dearly love, if only we could get out of here.
I've got Ammo.
Ammo?
- Madame Ambassador.
- What took you so long?
- Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now!
Veer left!
What now?
What do we do?
We die.
Well?
He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.
- I very much doubt it.
- Why?
Because I think he used to work with Mary.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out!
We'll come back later.
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the English woman?
What would you do to a traitor?
Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.
I am an idiot, I know nothing.
Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
That was quite a text you sent me.
What's going on, Sherlock?
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,
I couldn't see what was right under my nose.
Expected a pearl.
Oh, my God, that's a...
Yes, it's an AGRA.
Memory stick, like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.
Who?
I don't know.
We...
We all had one but the others were...
Haven't you even looked at it yet?
I glanced at it but I prefer
- to hear it from you.
- Why?
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.
There were four of us, agents.
Not just agents.
Polite term.
Alex.
Gabriel.
Me.
And Ajay.
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.
We all had one.
Each containing aliases, our background, everything.
We could never be betrayed, because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.
- Who employed you?
- Anyone who paid well.
I mean, we were at the top of our game for years.
And then it all ended.
There was a coup in Georgia.
The British Embassy in Tbilisi was taken over, lots of hostages.
We got the call to go in, get them out.
There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.
- Who from?
- I don't know, just another voice on the phone.
And a codeword.
- Ammo.
- Ammo?
Like ammunition.
We went in, but then something went wrong.
Something went really wrong.
That was six years ago.
It feels like forever.
I was the only one that made it out.
No.
What?
I met someone tonight.
Same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.
What, he's alive?
Yeah, very much so.
I don't believe it, this is amazing!
I thought I was the only one,
I thought I was the only one who got out.
Where is he?
I need to see him, now!
Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?
Yeah, of course.
It was our insurance.
Above all, they mustn't fall into enemy hands.
So Ajay survived as well.
And now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide, with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why?
I don't know.
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.
Families fall out.
The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
Well, he's just trying to find me.
He survived, that's all that matters!
I heard it from his own mouth.
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."
Why would he want to kill me?
- He said you betrayed him.
- Oh, no, no, that's insane.
Well, it's what he believes.
I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.
No, Mary...
You do.
I made a vow, remember?
To look after the three of you.
Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
There's something I think you should read.
What is it?
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.
What are you...?
- Mary...
Oh, no!
- There you go.
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.
No.
You just look after them till I get back.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Agra?
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
It is 378km west of the state capital, Lucknow.
What are you, Wikipedia?
- Yes.
- AGRA is an acronym.
Oh, good, I love an acronym.
All the best secret societies have them.
Team of agents, the best.
But you know all that.
Of course I do.
Go on.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.
Indeed?
Well, that's news to me.
Is it?
He's already killed looking for that memory stick.
AGRA always worked for the highest bidder,
I thought that might include you?
- Me?
- Well, I mean the British government, or whatever government you're currently propping up.
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.
They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong.
And that was that, we stopped using freelancers.
- Your initiative?
- My initiative.
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.
I don't like loose ends.
Not on my watch.
There was something else.
A detail.
A codeword.
Ammo?
It's all I've got.
Little enough.
Could you do some digging as a favour?
You don't have many favours left.
Then I'm calling them all in.
And if you can find who's after her and neutralise them, what then?
You think you can go on saving her forever?
Of course.
Is that sentiment talking?
No, it's me.
Difficult to tell the difference these days.
Told you, I made a promise.
A vow.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.
Not on my watch.
'My darling, I need to tell you this because you mustn't hate me for going away.'
Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.
- Can you hear a squeaking?
- No.
Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel.
Why Planes Fail.
- Did you see it?
Oh, truly terrifying.
- Can't say I did.
Swore I would never fly again, yet hear I am!
Everything OK, madam?
No.
No, no, it's not, but then what's the use in complaining?
I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off is all.
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.
Oh, OK.
Relax.
She said relax.
Did you have a nice time in London?
It was OK, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun?
Did you lose it in the war?
'I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.
I'm not running, I promise you that,
I just need to do this in my own way.'
Oh, God!
I'm...
I-I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God!
- Everything OK, madam?
- I think I'm dying.
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.
God will smile on you.
'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,
I'm sorry, my love.'
I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.
Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of a dice.
I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
I swear I will.'
Not like this one.
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in!
I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.
Mr Baker.
Well, that completes the set.
- No, it does not.
- Well, who else am I missing?
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?
Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.
Oh, hi, Mary.
What concept?
Happy families.
Nice trip?
- How the f...?
- Please, Mary, there is a child present.
- How did you get in here?
- Karim let me in.
Hello.
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Nice to meet you, missus.
No, I mean how did you find me?
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
No, really, though, how?
Every movement I made was entirely random, every new personality just on the roll of a dice!
Mary, no human action is ever truly random.
An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability, mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual, can reduce the number of variables considerably.
I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine a seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.
But they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.
Oh, you bastard!
- You bastard!
- I know, but your face!
"The mathematics of probability"?
- You believed that.
- "Feasible variables"?
Yes, I started to run out about then.
In the memory stick!
Yeah, that was my idea.
- AGRA?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
You said it was your initials.
In a way that was true.
In a way?
So many lies.
I'm so sorry.
And I don't just mean you.
What?
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...
You're R?
Rosamund?
Rosamund Mary.
I always liked Mary.
Yeah, me too.
I used to.
I just...
I didn't know what else to do.
You could have stayed, you could have talked to me.
That's what couples are supposed to do.
Work things through.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Mary, I may not be a very good man but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for,
- most of the time.
- All the time.
You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.
You never judge, you never complain.
I don't deserve you, I...
All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
I will keep you safe.
But it has to be in London.
It's my city, I know the turf.
Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.
Get down!
Hello again.
- Ajay?
- Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.
Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.
I thought I was the only one who got out.
How did you find us?
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.
You found her but I found you.
So perhaps not so clever.
And now here we are.
At last.
Touche!
Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
She thought I was dead.
I might as well have been.
It was always just the four of us, always, remember?
Oh, yeah.
So why do you want to kill me?
Do you know how long they kept me prisoner?
What they did to me?
They tortured Alex to death.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.
But you?
You, where were you?
That day at the embassy, I escaped.
Ha!
But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
Where were you?
Oh, I got out.
For a while.
Long enough to hide my memory stick.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.
I was loyal, you see.
Loyal to my friends.
But they took me, tortured me.
Not for information.
Not for anything except fun.
They thought I'd give in, die, but I didn't, I lived.
And eventually, they forgot about me rotting in a cell somewhere.
Six years they kept me there.
Until one day I saw my chance.
Oh, and I made them pay.
You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.
Little whispers.
Laughter.
Gossip.
How the clever agents had been betrayed.
Brought down by you!
Me?
You know I'll kill you too.
You know I will, Ajay.
What, you think I care if I die?
I've dreamed of killing you every night for six years.
Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.
I swear to you, Ajay.
What did you hear, Ajay?
When you were a prisoner, what exactly did you hear?
What did I hear?
Ammo.
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo."
We were betrayed!
- And they said it was her?
- That you betrayed us!
They said her name?
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.
No!
No!
'The English woman, that's all he heard.
Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.'
Couldn't this wait until you're back?
No, it's not over.
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed, the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.
There was only a voice on the phone.
'Remember?
And a codeword.'
"Ammo," yes, you said.
How's your Latin, brother dear?
My Latin?
Amo, amas, amat.
I love, you love, he loves.
What...?
Not "Ammo" as in ammunition, but "Amo", meaning?
You'd better be right, Sherlock.
Bloody thing!
What's going on?
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.
What?
'So many lies.
And I don't just mean you.'
- Hello.
- Ah, hello.
- I like your daisy.
- Thank you, yeah.
It's not really me, though, I think.
- No?
- No, no, it's too floral for me.
I'm more of a "knackered with weary old eyes" kind of guy.
Well, I think they're nice.
Nice eyes.
- Thank you.
- Look...
Look...
I don't normally do this,
- but, um...
- But you're going to.
Yeah.
- What's this?
- This is me.
- Thank you.
Cheers.
- Yeah.
Great.
- Bye!
- Bye.

Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
Hmm?
Noticed what?
The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
- Yeah, can't she?
- Hmm.
I'm coming darling.
I'm coming.
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
- _
- Come here...
It's OK.
_
- _
- Do you want a cuddle?
_
I know.
- Oh, sweetheart.
- _
_
Ssh.
Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you?
_
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?
Oh, let's go and see Daddy!
Daddy's here.
It's OK, Rosie.
I'll take her.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I may as well get up now.
Hey, baby, it's Daddy.
Your daddy.
Come here, Rose.
Come here, darling, it's all right.
Thank you.
_
_
This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.
How many more times?
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.
And you're basing all this on a code name?
On a whispered voice on the telephone?
Come on, Mycroft.
You were the conduit for AGRA.
Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
It was my job.
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
AGRA went in.
- Yes.
- And they were betrayed.
Not by me.
Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.
I promise you,
I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.
You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.
Not one.
Not.
One.
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories?
I'd like to do those.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.
Although she does seem to enjoy them.
Well, I'll have to give that a go.
Got a lot to catch up on.
'You think you understand.
You understand nothing.'
'Code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love.'
'You'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.
'They know everything.'
'They said it was the English woman.'
'Don't minute any of this.'
'They know everything.'
- You don't make it easy, do you?
- What do you mean?
Well, being... being so perfect.
Mary, I...
I need to tell you...
Hang on.
Can you tell me later?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Great.
Well, no, we can't just go.
- Rosie.
- Yeah.
- Er, you go.
- No!
I'll come as soon as I've found someone.
Mrs Hudson.
- Corfu till Saturday.
Molly?
- Er, yeah, I'll try.
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.
You know that's not going to happen.
If there's more to this case, you need to see it.
Yeah, OK, you win.
'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes.
'Please make your way to the exit.
Thank you.'
Your office said I'd find you here.
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.
We're like them.
Ghostly, living in the shadows.
Predatory?
Well, it depends which side you're on.
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.
Nice location for the final act, couldn't have chosen it better myself.
But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.
I just come here to look at the fish.
I knew this would happen one day.
- It's like that old story.
- I really am a very busy man.
Would you mind cutting to the chase?
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
With good reason.
"There was once a merchant, in a famous market in Baghdad."
I really have never liked this story.
I'm just like the merchant in the story,
I thought I could out-run the inevitable.
I've always been looking over my shoulder, always expecting to see the grim figure of...
Death.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hey.
- John?
- On his way.
Let me introduce Ammo.
You were Ammo?
You were the person on the phone that time?
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
Why did you betray us?
Why does anyone do anything?
- Hmm.
- Let me guess, selling secrets?
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.
Worked very well for a few years.
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it.
But...
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.
I couldn't believe my luck!
That bought me a little time.
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
Very handy.
They were always such reliable killers.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.
Lady Smallwood gave the order.
But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.
Seemed to do the trick.
And you thought your troubles were over.
I was tired.
Tired of the mess of it all.
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.
The hostages were killed.
AGRA too.
Or so I thought.
My secret was safe.
But... apparently not.
Just a little peace.
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
A family?
Home?
Really, I understand.
So, just let me get out of here, right?
Let me just walk away.
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.
What do you say?
After what you did?
!
Mary, no!
OK.
London Aquarium.
Yes, now.
I was never a field agent.
I always thought I'd be rather good.
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
Thanks.
- For a secretary.
- What?
It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
- I didn't do this out of jealousy.
- No?
Same old drudge, day in, day out.
Never getting out there where all the excitement was.
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.
Yes, your little flat.
- How do you know?
- Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?
And what are you, widowed or divorced?
Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.
That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.
- Sherlock...
- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.
A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.
- Sherlock, don't.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.
There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
That accounts for the drink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.
So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.
To prove how good you are.
To make up for the inadequacies of your...
little life.
Well, Mrs Norbury,
I must admit this is unexpected.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.
All except Sherlock Holmes.
There's no way out.
So it would seem.
You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.
It's what I do.
Maybe I can still surprise you.
Now, come on, be sensible.
Hmm, no, I don't think so.
Ah!
Surprise!
Everything's fine.
It's going to be OK.
Get an ambulance!
It's all right, it's all right.
- Mary!
- John.
All right, Mary?
Mary?
Stay with me, stay with me.
- Oh, come on...
- No, don't worry.
Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
Come on, Mary.
Mary?
Oh, God.
John, I think this is it.
No, no, no, no.
It's not.
- That's...
- You made me so happy.
You gave me everything I could ever, ever have wanted...
Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.
- Look after Rosie.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.
- Promise me.
- I promise.
- No...
- Yes, I promise.
- Promise me!
- I promise, I promise.
Ssh, ssh.
Hey, Sherlock.
Yes.
I... so like you.
Did I ever say?
Yes, yes, you did.
I'm sorry for... for shooting you that time.
I'm really sorry.
It's all right.
I think we're even now, OK?
OK.
- Oh, I think we're...
- Mary, Mary...
- ...even, definitely even.
- Ssh, ssh.
You were my whole world.
Being Mary Watson was the only life worth living.
- Mary...
- Thank you.
Mary...
Don't you dare!
You made a vow.
You swore it.
'You've been having dreams.
A recurring dream?
'
Do you want to talk about it?
This is a two-way relationship, you know.
The whole world has come crashing down around you.
Everything's hopeless.
Irretrievable.
I know that's what you must feel but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
That's not really my style.
I need to know what to do.
Do?
About John.
Put me through to Sherrinford, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
But nothing will ever be the same again, will it?
I'm afraid it won't.
We'll have to rally round, I expect, do our bit.
Look after little Rosie.
I'm just going to, um look through these things.
There might be a case.
A case?
Oh, you're not up to it, are you?
Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.
Yes.
Yes, I expect you're right.
I'll make some tea, shall I?
- Mrs Hudson?
- Yes, Sherlock?
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident...
- Yes?
- ...would you just say the word Norbury to me?
Would you?
Norbury?
Just that.
I'd be very grateful.
What's this?
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.
Oh, God!
Is that...?
- Must be.
- Oh.
I knew it wouldn't end like this.
I knew Moriarty made plans.
'I thought that would get your attention.
So, this is in case...
In case the day comes.
If you are watching this, I'm probably dead.
I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows?
Nothing's certain, nothing's written.
My old life it was full of consequences.
The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.
You need to remember that.
So I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
Might be the hardest case of your career.
When I'm... gone, if I'm gone I need you to do something for me.'
Hi.
I just wondered how things were going and if there was anything I could do.
It's, er, it's from John.
- Right.
- You don't need to read it now.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.
He says...
John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...
Yes?
He said he'd that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Anyone.
'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
When I'm gone, if I'm... gone I need you to do something for me.
Save John Watson.
Save him, Sherlock.
Save him.'
'When does the path we walk on lock around our feet?
When does the road become a river with only one destination?

'Death waits for us all in Samarra.
But can Samarra be avoided?

No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.
Oh, do your research.
I'm not a hero

Merry Christmas!

Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Is that quite clear?
Don't minute any of this.
Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.
A D notice has been slapped on the entire incident.

We have some very talented people working here.

No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.
You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.
You're home and dry.
OK, cheers.
Obviously, there's unfinished business.
Moriarty.
I told you
- Moriarty's dead.
You say he filmed that video message before he died.
Yes.
You also say you know what he's going to do next.
- What does that mean?
- Perhaps that's all there is to it.
Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
No, no, he would never be that disappointing.
He's planned something, something long-term.
Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.
Posthumous revenge.
No, better than that - posthumous game.
We brought you back to deal with this.

Wait?

Of course wait.
I'm the target - targets wait.
Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up,
I'll know when it begins.
I always know when the game is on.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because I love it.
There was once a merchant, in the famous market at Baghdad.
WATER SLOSHES One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise, and he knew that the stranger was Death.
Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles, to the city of Samarra.
For there he was sure Death could not find him.
But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.
"Very well," said the merchant. "I give in.
I am yours."
"But tell me, why did you look surprised
"when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"
"Because," said Death,
"I had an appointment with you tonight...
"..in Samarra."
If this gets any better, I'm going to get two knives.
Pays to advertise.
- So, what about Moriarty, then?
- Oh, I have a plan.
I'm going to monitor the underworld, every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
So, basically, your plan is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do?
Awesome, isn't it?
He drowned, Mr Holmes.
That's what we thought.
- But when they opened up his lungs...
- Yes?
- ..sand.
Superficial.

Yeah, but there'll be cake.
Will you do it?
I'll get back to you.
Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.
In Christ's name.
Now, what name have you given your daughter?
Rosamund Mary.
Rosamund?
It means "Rose of the world".
Rosie for short.
Didn't you get John's text?
No.
I delete his texts.
I delete any text that begins "Hi."
No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.
- MRS HUDSON CLEARS THROAT
- Sorry.
- WHISPERING:
- Phone!
And now, godparents, are you ready to help the parents of this child in their duties as Christian parents?
- BOTH:
- We are.
- SIRI:
- 'Sorry, I didn't catch that.
'Please repeat the question.'
As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.
To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
Hard logic versus romantic whimsy - that is your choice.
You fail to connect actions to their consequences.
Now, for the last time, if you want to keep the rattle, do not throw the rattle.
MESSAGE TONE
All right, good girl, good girl.
Good girl.
I'd better finish this, hadn't I?
- Hey.
- Afternoon.
He says you've got a good one, Greg?
Oh, yeah.
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.
CHEERS AND APPLAUSE
God, 50!
Where does it go?
I know for a fact I was only 21 this time last week.
Yeah, well that's impossible.
That was before you met me.
- Well, no, no, there never was...
- "There never was such a time."
She's looking at me disapprovingly again.
No.
She's just jealous.
Yeah, well, I think we both are.
- PHONE VIBRATES
- Oh...
- No, no, David.
- Come on, you promised.
- No, it's...
Oh, no...
Oh, it's a Skype call.
Oh!
Then it must be Charlie.
At least he's phoning, I suppose.
Oh, look!
Hello!
'Hey, Dad.
Happy birthday.
'Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?
'
No!
Picture's frozen!
'Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you.'
Why is it rubbish?
Where are you?
- How is he?
Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.
- No...
- MAN:
- David?
Come on!
OK, no, hang on a sec, I'll find somewhere quieter.
So, Charlie, where are you?
Are you there?
- 'Sorry, I'm here.
I'm just a bit...'
- Are you all right?
- 'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
- Altitude?
- 'I'm in Tibet.
Didn't you see the mountains?
'
- Never mind mountains.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.
- 'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?
'
- What?
- 'Could you just check something on my car?
'
- Your car?
'To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe
'I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet.
- 'Could you take a photo and send it?
'
- Uh, yes, I can do that.
All done.
Have you got it?
Charlie?
- LESTRADE:
- A week later...
Yeah?
..something really weird happens.
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed, the cops are chasing him, and he turns into the drive of the Welsborough house to try and get away.
Unfortunately...
The drunk guy survived, they managed to pull him out, but when they put the fire out and examined the parked car...
Whose body?
Charlie Welsborough, the son.
- What?
- The son who was in Tibet.
DNA all checks out.
Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.
SHERLOCK CHUCKLES
- Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
- Have you got a lab report?
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.
- The seats?
- Yes, the car seats.
Made of vinyl.
Two different types of vinyl present.
Was it his own car?
Yeah, not flash - he was a student.
- Well, that's suggestive.
- Why?
- Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
- Yeah, right?
- There's something else.
- Yes?
According to this,
Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.
What?
The body in the car, dead for a week.
Oh, this is a good one.
Is it my birthday?
You want help?
- Yes, please.
- One condition.
- OK.
Take all the credit.
It gets boring if I just solve them all.
Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.
He's got a point.
Which makes me look like some kind of prima donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do!
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.
- Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
- Definitely a sore spot.
- So you take all the glory, thanks...
- OK!
- ..thanks all the same.
Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?
It's driving me nuts.
Anything you say, Giles.
Just kidding.
HE MOUTHS:
What's his name?
- HE MOUTHS:
- Greg.
- What?
Greg.
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?
Not a clue.
It's just you normally say that at this point.
Hmm.
Well, then, let's hope you solve your little problem, Greg.
- Hear that?
- I know.
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood?
- Oh, good, great.
Yeah, amazing.
- Getting any sleep?
- Christ, no.
You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.
- Must feel very different...
- Sorry, what?
Yes, well, you know how it is.
All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.
- Are you two having a little joke?
- Never a word of thanks.
Can't even tell people's faces apart.
This is a joke, isn't it?
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever.
You're so, so clever."
- Is it about me?
- I think he needs winding.
- You know, I think that really might be it.
- No, don't get it.
Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect,
- so go easy on them, yeah?
- PHONE VIBRATES
- You know me.
MARY:
- 'Hey, hello.'
- Yeah.
- Got them, don't worry.
Pampers, the cream you can't get from Boots.
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now?
- At the dead boy's house?
- Yeah.
'And what does he think?
Any theories?
'
Well, I texted you the details.
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.
- Hey!
- How do you know about that?
'Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.'
- WHISPERING:
- They know everything!
- 'Solved it, then?
'
- I'm working on it.
- 'Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.'
- Pig!
- Keep trying.
'So, what about it, then?
'What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it?
'And what are you going to call this one?
'
Oh, the Ghost Driver.
- Don't give it a title.
- People like the titles.
- They hate the titles.
- Give the people what they want.
No, never do that - people are stupid.
Uh, SOME people.
'All people are stupid.
'Most people.'
'Bizarre enough though, isn't it, to be him?
'
I mean, it's right up your strasse.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry
- to hear about your daughter.
- Son.
- Son!
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.
If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.
Well, I believe that I... ..can.
- DISTORTED:
- But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
Sherlock?
Mr Holmes?
Sorry, you were saying?
Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
I don't think we'll ever get over this.
No.
Shouldn't think so.
So sorry, will you excuse me a moment?
I just...
I'll...
I'll just, um...
Ahem.
- Now what's wrong?
- Not sure, I just...
By the pricking of my thumbs.
Seriously?
You?
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.
They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.
What is this?
Oh, it's a sort of shrine, I suppose, really.
Bit of a fan of Mrs T.
A big hero of mine when I was getting started.
Right, yes.
- Who?
- What?
- Who...?
Who was this?
- Are you serious?
- Sherlock...
- It's...
It's Margaret Thatcher, the first female Prime Minister of this country.
Right.
- Prime Minister?
- Hmm.
Leader of the Government.
- Right.
- Female?
- For God's sake!
You know perfectly well who she is.
Why are you playing for time?
It's the gap, look at the gap.
It's wrong.
Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed.
The whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.
This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been in, this picture is straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.
- Something's missing from here, but only recently.
- Yes, a...
- Plaster bust.
- ..plaster bust.
- Oh, for God's sake!
It got broken.
What the hell has this got to do with Charlie?
- Rug!
- What?
- Well, how could it get broken?
The only place for it to fall is the floor and there is a big thick rug.
- Does it matter?
- Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.
- It is worth letting him do this.
- Is your friend quite mad?
No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
We found the remains out there in the porch.
- The porch where we came in?
- How anybody could hate her so much they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness...
I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.
Why didn't he smash all the others?
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.
Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.
- And if there's nothing...
- I know what happened to your son.
You do?
It's quite simple, superficial, to be blunt.
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness?
- Well, yes.
- And the porch where it was smashed,
I noticed the motion sensor was damaged,
- so I assume it's permanently lit.
- How did you notice that?
I lack the arrogance to ignore details
- I'm not the police.
- So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.
- Exactly.
- Why?
- Don't know.
Wouldn't be fun if I knew.
Mr Holmes, please!
It was your 50th birthday, Mr Welsborough, of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
- After all, he was in Tibet.
- Yes.
- No.
- No?
CROWD: # Happy birthday... #
The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video.
Easily arranged.
It's a Skype call.
The trick was meant to be a surprise.
- A trick?
- Obviously.
Could you take a photo and send it?
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.
Well, good enough.
Effectively a costume.
You're joking?
No, I'm not.
All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
- Oh, my God!
- Surprise!
That's when it happened.
I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.
You said he'd felt unwell?
You all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
He died there and then.
No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained, in the driver's seat, hidden, until...
When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who'd been sitting there, quite dead, for a week.
Oh, God!
Poor kid.
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.
This is where it was smashed.
- That was amazing.
- What?
- The car, the kid.
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?
I can't stand it, never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
What kind of a life would that be?
Besides, I have the strangest feeling...
Miss me?
- That's mine.
You two take a...bus.
- Why?
I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.
The Mall, please.
- I met her once.
- Thatcher?
- Rather arrogant, I thought.
- YOU thought that?
!
- Ha, I know.
Why am I looking at this?
That's her, John and Mary's baby.
Oh, I see, yes.
Looks very...fully functioning.
Is that really the best you can do?
Sorry, I've never been very good with them.
- Babies?
- Humans.
Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?
Any interest in her?
Why on earth would he?
I don't know.
You tell me.
In the last year of his life,
James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over 70 assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias,
which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.
It's a pearl - get another one.
There's something important about this.
I'm sure.
Maybe it's Moriarty.
Maybe it's not.
WATER SLOSHES
But something's coming.
Are you having a premonition, brother mine?
The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other.
What we call premonition is just movement of the web.
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable.
As inevitable as mathematics.
- Appointment In Samarra.
- I'm sorry?
The merchant who can't outrun Death.
You always hated that story as a child.
Less keen on predestination back then.
I'm not sure I like it now.
You wrote your own version, as I remember.
Appointment In Sumatra.
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.
Goodnight, Mycroft.
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.
- Keep me informed.
- Of what?
- Absolutely no idea.
'Ammo!
'
MAN SHUDDERS
- Oh, hi, Stella.
- Greg.
- You, uh...?
- Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...
- Right, right, right...
Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?
It's nothing.
I mean it's nothing serious.
- No, no.
- I just pop round every now and again for a chat.
Yeah, of course.
I mean he loves a really tricky case.
Yeah, he does!
So what you here for?
Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so...
The Borgia Pearl?
They still after that, are they?
Yeah.
So, how did you two first meet?
Oh, well, there was a case about, um, ten years ago.
Nobody could figure it out.
There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.
- Oh, yeah?
How did she die?
- Hypothermia.
What?
I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...
Will you two please keep it down?
!
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?
You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.
I was a carpenter.
Like me dad.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
How the hell...?
Ah...e-cigarettes.
Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.
If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.
But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last.
Anything to add, John?
- John?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.
- What is that?
- That is...me.
Well, it's a me substitute.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You know I value your little contributions.
Yeah?
It's been there since nine this morning.
- Has it?
Where were you?
- Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.
- What about my girlfriend?
- What?
- You said I had an ex...
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.
The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.
I...
I thought you'd done something clever.
Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?
SHERLOCK INHALES DEEPLY
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
What do you mean?
Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
- Well...
- You thought she was having an affair.
I'm afraid it's far worse than that - your wife is a spy.
- What?
- That's right.
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy, across the road from your flat.
Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy, as part of an official state visit.
As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.
This drug will render the President entirely susceptible
- to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty.
- What?
Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III.
- Are you serious?
- No, of course not.
His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.
I don't!
- Just the bras.
- Get out.
So, what's this all about, then?
- Having fun.
- Fun?
- While I can.
- Mm-hmm.
KNOCK AT DOOR
- Uh, Sherlock...
- Borgia Pearl.
Boring.
Go!
- But...
- Go!
- This had better be good.
- Oh, I think you'll like it.
That is the bust, isn't it?
The one that was broken.
No, it's another one - different owner.
Different part of town.
You were right - this is a thing.
Something's going on.
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be pleased.
- I am pleased.
- You don't look pleased.
This is my game face.
And the game is on.
Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one.
- One belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan.
- Identical busts?
Yeah, and this one to a Dr Barnicot in Holborn.
Three in total.
God knows who'd want to do something like this.
Yeah, but some people have that complex, don't they?
An idee fixe.
They obsess over one thing and they can't let it go.
No, no good.
There were other images of Margaret...
Margaret...?
You know who she is.
..Thatcher, present at the first break-in.
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?
Ooh!
- What?
- Blood.
Quite a bit of it, too.
Was there any injury at the crime scene?
Nah.
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.
- Come on.
- Holborn?
- Lambeth!
- Lambeth?
Why?
- To see Toby.
Ah, right.
Who?
- You'll see.
- Right, are you coming?
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.
- Who told you?
- The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.
- Have a good time.
- I will.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
- What?
- She's not the one.
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.
How do you work all that out?
She's got three children in Rio that he doesn't know about.
- Are you just making this up?
- Possibly.
- Who's Toby?
There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker, one of the world's best.
Got himself into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago.
He hacked into the Pentagon security system, and I managed to get him off the charge.
Therefore he owes me a favour.
- So, how does that help us?
- What?
- Toby the hacker?
- Toby's not the hacker.
- What?
- All right, Craig?
- All right, Sherlock?
Craig's got a dog.
So I see.
Good boy!
Hiya!
Mary?
What are you...?
No, we, we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case.
No, exactly.
So...don't wait up.
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Hey.
- Mary, what are you doing here?
- She's better at this than you.
- Better?
- So I texted her.
Hang on, Mary's better than me?
Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.
- Of course she's better.
- Yeah, OK.
- Nothing personal.
What, so I'm supposed to just go home now, am I?
What do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?
- John or the dog?
- Ha-ha, that's funny!
- John.
- Well...
- He's handy and loyal.
- That's hilarious.
- Hmm.
- Is it too early for a divorce?
- Oh.
- Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge?
Keep up, he's fast.
- He's not moving.
- He's thinking.
He's really not moving.
Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.
You just like this dog, don't you?
- Well, I like you.
- He's still not moving.
- Fascinating.
- Oh!
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT
Well, what do you make of it?
- They were looking for something.
- Yes, but it wasn't a burglar, they came specifically for that Thatcher bust.
Why?
DOG SNIFFS
DOG WHINES
Clever.
Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail,
- where would you go?
- Like hiding a tree in a forest.
Or blood in a butcher's.
Never mind, Toby, better luck next time, hmm?
This is it, though.
This is the one, I can feel it.
Not Moriarty?
It has to be him.
It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.
It's designed to beguile me, tease me and lure me in.
At last, a noose for me to put my neck into.
You should have seen the state of the front room.
- It was like The Exorcist.
- Huh.
Was Rosie's head spinning round?
- No.
Just the projectile vomiting.
- Nice!
- Hmm.
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
- Hmm?
Noticed what?
- The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
BABY CRIES
Yeah, can't she?
I'm coming, darling.
Mummy's coming.
- LOVINGLY:
- Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here.
Have you heard of that thing?
In Germany?
You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.
Ostalgie.
People who missed the old days under the communists.
- People are weird, aren't they?
- Hmm.
According to this, there's quite a market for Cold War memorabilia.
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit?
Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.
Yes, fascinating.
Irrelevant.
Where exactly did they come from?
I've got into the records of the suppliers
- Gelder and Co.
Seems they're from Georgia.
Where exactly?
Tbilisi.
Batch of six.
One to Welsborough.
One to Hassan.
One to Dr Barnicot.
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.
One to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.
Lestrade?
Another one?
- 'Yeah.'
- Harker or Sandeford?
Harker.
And it's murder this time.
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.
Defensive wounds on her face and hands, throat cut.
Sharp blade.
The same thing inside the house?
The bust?
- Two of them this time.
- Interesting.
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago.
- Limited edition of six.
- And now someone's wandering about destroying them all.
Makes no sense.
What's the point?
No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.
- Yes, it is.
- Well, it is, but it's not the point.
I've been slow, far too slow.
Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind...
Slow but lucky, very lucky.
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.
Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.
Congratulations, by the way.
- I'm sorry?
- Well, you're about to solve a big one.
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
- Yeah, until then, basically.
WATER SPLASHING
That's enough now, love.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.
And you need to get to bed.
Come on.
Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?
You were on the run.
Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying, it's clever.
Very clever.
But now you've met me and you're not so clever, are you?
Who are you?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.
Argh!
You're out of time.
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
- Who?
I know it's him.
It must be him.
You think you understand.
You understand nothing.
Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don't we just enjoy the moment?
Let me present Interpol's number one case.
Too tough for them, too boring for me.
The Black Pearl of the Borgias!
It's not possible!
How could she...?
!
Everything about who I was is on there.
The problems of your past are your business.
The problems of your future... ..are my privilege.
I don't understand.
She...
She destroyed it.
She?
You know her!
You do, don't you?
You know the bitch?
!
She betrayed me.
- Betrayed us all.
- Mary.
This is about Mary?
Is that what she's calling herself now, eh?
- 'Armed police, you're surrounded!
'
- Give it to me.
- YELLS:
- Give it to me!
'Come out slowly, I want to see your hands above your head.'
Nobody shoots me!
Anyone shoots, I kill this man.
'Lay down your weapon.
Do it now!
'
I'm leaving this place.
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.
'Lay down your weapon.'
You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
Tell her she's a dead woman.
She's a dead woman walking.
She's my friend.
And she's under my protection.
Who are you?
I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.
Who's Sherlock Holmes?
Not a policeman.
ALARM BLARES
What do you think?
Mate in two?
Don't antagonise them, darling.
Oh, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.
Everything palls.
They'll send someone soon.
They?
Who are THEY?
Seems to me we put an awful lot of faith in THEY.
Well, I've got something THEY would dearly love, if only we could get out of here.
I've got Ammo.
Ammo?
- MARY:
- Madame Ambassador.
- What took you so long?
- Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now!
Veer left!
SCREAMING
HE LAUGHS
What now?
What do we do?
We die.
Well?
He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.
- I very much doubt it.
- Why?
Because I think he used to work with Mary.
GUNFIRE
SHOUTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out!
We'll come back later.
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the English woman?
What would you do to a traitor?
Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.
HE CHUCKLES
I am an idiot, I know nothing.
Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
That was quite a text you sent me.
What's going on, Sherlock?
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,
I couldn't see what was right under my nose.
Expected a pearl.
Oh, my God, that's a...
Yes, it's an AGRA. memory stick, like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.
Who?
I don't know.
We...
We all had one but the others were...
Haven't you even looked at it yet?
- I glanced at it but I prefer to hear it from you.
- Why?
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.
There were four of us, agents.
Not just agents.
Polite term.
Alex.
Gabriel.
Me.
And Ajay.
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.
We all had one.
Each containing aliases, our background, everything.
We could never be betrayed, because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.
- Who employed you?
- Anyone who paid well.
I mean, we were at the top of our game for years.
And then it all ended.
There was a coup in Georgia.
The British Embassy in Tbilisi was taken over, lots of hostages.
We got the call to go in, get them out.
There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.
- Who from?
- I don't know, just another voice on the phone.
And a codeword.
- Ammo.
- Ammo?
Like ammunition.
We went in, but then something went wrong.
Something went really wrong.
GUNFIRE, SCREAMING
That was six years ago.
It feels like forever.
I was the only one that made it out.
No.
What?
I met someone tonight.
Same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.
What, he's alive?
Yeah, very much so.
I don't believe it, this is amazing!
I thought I was the only one,
I thought I was the only one who got out.
Where is he?
I need to see him, now!
Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?
Yeah, of course.
It was our insurance.
Above all, they mustn't fall into enemy hands.
So Ajay survived as well.
And now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide, with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why?
I don't know.
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
SHE LAUGHS
Sorry, no, no, because we...we were family.
Families fall out.
The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
Well, he's just trying to find me.
He survived, that's all that matters!
I heard it from his own mouth.
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."
Why would he want to kill me?
- He said you betrayed him.
- Oh, no, no, that's insane.
Well, it's what he believes.
SHE GASPS
I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.
No, Mary...
You do.
I made a vow, remember?
To look after the three of you.
Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
There's something I think you should read.
What is it?
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.
What are you...?
HE SNIFFS
- Mary...
- There you go.
- Oh, no!
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.
No.
You just look after them till I get back.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
CHILD SINGS
HE GROANS
Agra?
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
It is 378km west of the state capital, Lucknow.
What are you, Wikipedia?
- Yes.
- AGRA is an acronym.
Oh, good, I love an acronym.
All the best secret societies have them.
Team of agents, the best.
But you know all that.
Of course I do.
Go on.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.
Indeed?
Well, that's news to me.
Is it?
He's already killed looking for that memory stick.
AGRA always worked for the highest bidder,
I thought that might include you?
- Me?
- Well, I mean the British government, or whatever government you're currently propping up.
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.
They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong.
And that was that, we stopped using freelancers.
- Your initiative?
- My initiative.
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.
I don't like loose ends.
Not on my watch.
There was something else.
A detail.
A codeword.
Ammo?
It's all I've got.
Little enough.
Could you do some digging as a favour?
You don't have many favours left.
Then I'm calling them all in.
And if you can find who's after her and neutralise them, what then?
You think you can go on saving her forever?
Of course.
Is that sentiment talking?
No, it's me.
Difficult to tell the difference these days.
Told you, I made a promise.
A vow.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.
Not on my watch.
- MARY:
- 'My darling, I need to tell you this 'because you mustn't hate me for going away.'
- NEW YORK ACCENT:
- Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.
- Can you hear a squeaking?
- No.
Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel -
Why Planes Fail.
- Did you see it?
- Can't say I did.
- Oh, truly terrifying.
Swore I would never fly again, yet hear I am!
Ha.
Everything OK, madam?
No.
No, no, it's not, but then what's the use in complaining?
I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off is all.
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.
Oh, OK.
Relax.
- She said relax.
- SHE CHUCKLES
Did you have a nice time in London?
It was OK, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun?
- Did you lose it in the war?
- SHE LAUGHS
'I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.
'I'm not running, I promise you that,
'I just need to do this in my own way.'
Oh, God!
I'm...
I-I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God!
FLIGHT ATTENDANT BUTTON BEEPS
- Everything OK, madam?
- I think I'm dying.
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.
God will smile on you.
'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,
'I'm sorry, my love.'
'I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.
'Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate 'the roll of a dice.
'I need to move the target far, far away from you 'and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
'I swear I will.'
LAUGHTER
Not like this one.
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in!
I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.
Mr Baker.
Well, that completes the set.
- No, it does not.
- Well, who else am I missing?
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?
Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.
Oh, hi, Mary.
What concept?
Happy families.
Nice trip?
- How the f...?
- Please, Mary, there is a child present.
- How did you get in here?
- Karim let me in.
Hello.
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Nice to meet you, missus.
No, I mean how did you find me?
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
No, really, though, how?
Every movement I made was entirely random, every new personality just on the roll of a dice!
Mary, no human action is ever truly random.
An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability, mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual, can reduce the number of variables considerably.
I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine a seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.
But they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.
HE CHUCKLES
- JOKINGLY:
- Oh, you bastard!
- ANGRILY:
- You bastard!
- I know, but your face!
"The mathematics of probability"?
- You believed that.
- "Feasible variables"?
Yes, I started to run out about then.
In the memory stick!
Yeah, that was my idea.
- AGRA?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
You said it was your initials.
In a way that was true.
In a way?
So many lies.
I'm so sorry.
And I don't just mean you.
What?
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...
You're R?
Rosamund?
Rosamund Mary.
I always liked Mary.
Yeah, me too.
I used to.
I just...
I didn't know what else to do.
You could have stayed, you could have talked to me.
That's what couples are supposed to do.
Work things through.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Mary, I may not be a very good man... ..but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for,
- most of the time.
- All the time.
You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.
You never judge, you never complain.
I don't deserve you, I...
All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
I will keep you safe.
But it has to be in London.
It's my city, I know the turf.
Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.
Get down!
RAPID GUNFIRE
Hello again.
- Ajay?
- Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.
Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.
I thought I was the only one who got out.
How did you find us?
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.
You found her but I found you.
So perhaps not so clever.
And now here we are.
At last.
- HE CHUCKLES
- Touche!
Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
She thought I was dead.
I might as well have been.
It was always just the four of us, always, remember?
Oh, yeah.
So why do you want to kill me?
Do you know how long they kept me prisoner?
What they did to me?
They tortured Alex to death.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.
But you?
You, where were you?
That day at the embassy, I escaped.
Ha!
But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
Where were you?
Oh, I got out.
For a while.
Long enough to hide my memory stick.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.
- I - was loyal, you see.
Loyal to my friends.
But they took me, tortured me.
Not for information.
Not for anything except fun.
They thought I'd give in, die, but I didn't, I lived.
And eventually, they forgot about me rotting in a cell somewhere.
Six years they kept me there.
Until one day I saw my chance.
Oh, and I made them pay.
You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.
Little whispers.
Laughter.
Gossip.
How the clever agents had been betrayed.
Brought down by you!
- Me?
- TRAIN WHISTLES
You know I'll kill you too.
You know I will, Ajay.
What, you think I care if I die?
I've dreamed of killing you... ..every night for six years.
Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.
I swear to you, Ajay.
What did you hear, Ajay?
When you were a prisoner, what EXACTLY did you hear?
What did I hear?
Ammo.
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo.
"Ammo.
"Ammo.
Ammo."
We were betrayed!
- And they said it was her?
- That you betrayed us!
They said her name?
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.
No!
No!
'The English woman, that's all he heard.
'Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.'
Couldn't this wait until you're back?
No, it's not over.
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed, the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.
There was only a voice on the phone.
'Remember?
And a codeword.'
"Ammo," yes, you said.
How's your Latin, brother dear?
My Latin?
Amo, amas, amat.
I love, you love, he loves.
What...?
Not "Ammo" as in ammunition, but "Amo", meaning?
You'd better be right, Sherlock.
Bloody thing!
What's going on?
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.
What?
'So many lies.
And I don't just mean you.'
- Hello.
- Ah, hello.
- I like your daisy.
- Thank you, yeah.
- It's not really me, though, I think.
- No?
- No, no, it's too floral for me.
I'm more of a "knackered with weary old eyes" kind of guy.
Well, I think they're nice.
Nice eyes.
- HE LAUGHS
- Thank you.
- Look...
Look...
I don't normally do this,
- but, um...
- But you're going to.
Yeah.
- What's this?
- This is me.
- Thank you.
Cheers.
- Yeah.
Great.
- Bye!
- Bye.
HE CHUCKLES
PHONE BEEPS
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
Hmm?
Noticed what?
The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
BABY CRIES
- Yeah, can't she?
- Hmm.
I'm coming darling.
I'm coming.
PHONE BEEPS
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here...
It's OK.
Do you want a cuddle?
BABY CONTINUES TO WAIL
I know.
Oh, sweetheart.
Ssh.
Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you?
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?
Oh, let's go and see Daddy!
Daddy's here.
It's OK, Rosie.
I'll take her.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I may as well get up now.
Hey, baby, it's Daddy.
Your daddy.
Come here, Rose.
Come here, darling, it's all right.
Thank you.
This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.
How many more times?
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.
And you're basing all this on a code name?
On a whispered voice on the telephone?
Come on, Mycroft.
You were the conduit for AGRA.
Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
It was my job.
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
AGRA went in.
- Yes.
- And they were betrayed.
Not by me.
Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.
I promise you,
I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.
You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.
Not one.
Not.
One.
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories?
I'd like to do those.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.
Although she does seem to enjoy them.
Well, I'll have to give that a go.
Got a lot to catch up on.
- AJAY:
- 'You think you understand.
You understand nothing.'
- MYCROFT:
- 'Code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love.'
- MARY:
- 'You'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.
'They know everything.'
'They said it was the English woman.'
'Don't minute any of this.'
'They know everything.'
- You don't make it easy, do you?
- What do you mean?
Well, being...being so perfect.
Mary, I...
I need to tell you...
- PHONE BEEPS
- Hang on.
Can you tell me later?
- Yeah.
- Great.
- Yeah.
Well, no, we can't just go.
- Rosie.
- Yeah.
- Er, you go.
- No!
I'll come as soon as I've found someone
- Mrs Hudson.
- Corfu till Saturday.
Molly?
- Er, yeah, I'll try.
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.
You know that's not going to happen.
If there's more to this case, you need to see it.
Yeah, OK, you win.
'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes.
'Please make your way to the exit.
Thank you.'
Your office said I'd find you here.
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.
We're like them.
Ghostly, living in the shadows.
Predatory?
Well, it depends which side you're on.
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.
Nice location for the final act, couldn't have chosen it better myself.
But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.
I just come here to look at the fish.
I knew this would happen one day.
- It's like that old story.
- I really am a very busy man.
Would you mind cutting to the chase?
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
With good reason.
"There was once a merchant, in a famous market in Baghdad."
I really have never liked this story.
I'm just like the merchant in the story,
I thought I could out-run the inevitable.
I've always been looking over my shoulder,
- always expecting to see the grim figure of...
- Death.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hey.
- John?
- On his way.
Let me introduce Ammo.
You were Ammo?
You were the person on the phone that time?
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
Why did you betray us?
Why does anyone do anything?
Hmm.
Let me guess, selling secrets?
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.
Worked very well for a few years.
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it.
But...
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.
- SHE CHUCKLES
- I couldn't believe my luck!
That bought me a little time.
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
Very handy.
They were always such reliable killers.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.
Lady Smallwood gave the order.
But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.
Seemed to do the trick.
And you thought your troubles were over.
I was tired.
Tired of the mess of it all.
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.
The hostages were killed.
AGRA too.
Or so I thought.
My secret was safe.
But...apparently not.
Just a little peace.
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
A family?
Home?
Really, I understand.
So, just let me get out of here, right?
Let me just walk away.
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.
What do you say?
After what you did?
!
Mary, no!
OK.
London Aquarium.
Yes, now.
I was never a field agent.
I always thought I'd be rather good.
MARY SCOFFS
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
Thanks.
- For a secretary.
- What?
It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
- I didn't do this out of jealousy.
- No?
Same old drudge, day in, day out.
Never getting out there where all the excitement was.
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.
- Yes, your little flat.
- How do you know?
- Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?
And what are you, widowed or divorced?
Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.
That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.
- Sherlock...
- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.
A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.
- Sherlock, don't.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.
There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
That accounts for the drink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.
So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.
To prove how good you are.
To make up for the inadequacies of your...
little life.
Well, Mrs Norbury,
I must admit this is unexpected.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.
All except Sherlock Holmes.
There's no way out.
So it would seem.
You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.
It's what I do.
Maybe I can still surprise you.
Now, come on, be sensible.
Hmm, no, I don't think so.
- Ah!
- Surprise!
MARY GASPS FOR AIR
MARY GROANS
Everything's fine.
It's going to be OK.
Get an ambulance!
- It's all right, it's all right.
- Mary!
- John.
All right, Mary?
Mary?
Stay with me, stay with me.
- Oh, come on...
- No, don't worry.
Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
Come on, Mary.
Mary?
Oh, God.
John, I think this is it.
No, no, no, no.
It's not.
- That's...
- You made me so happy.
You gave me everything I could ever, ever have wanted...
Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.
- Look after Rosie.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.
- Promise me.
- I promise.
- No...
- Yes, I promise.
- Promise me!
- I promise, I promise.
Ssh, ssh.
Hey, Sherlock.
Yes.
I... so like you.
Did I ever say?
Yes, yes, you did.
I'm sorry for...for shooting you that time.
I'm really sorry.
- It's all right.
- I think we're even now, OK?
OK.
- Oh, I think we're...
- Mary, Mary...
- ..even, definitely even.
- Ssh, ssh.
- Ooh.
You were my whole world.
Being Mary Watson... ..was the only life worth living.
- Mary...
- Thank you.
Mary...

This is a two-way relationship, you know.
SHE SIGHS
The whole world has come crashing down around you.
Everything's hopeless.
Irretrievable.
I know that's what you must feel... ..but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
That's not really my style.
I need to know what to do.
Do?
About John.
BACK CRACKS, HE GROANS
Put me through to Sherrinford, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
- SOBS:
- But nothing will ever be the same again, will it?
I'm afraid it won't.
We'll have to rally round, I expect, do our bit.
Look after little Rosie.
I'm just going to, um... ..look through these things.
There might be a case.
A case?
Oh, you're not up to it, are you?
Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.
Yes.
Yes, I expect you're right.
I'll make some tea, shall I?
- Mrs Hudson?
- Yes, Sherlock?
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident...
- Yes?
- ..would you just say the word Norbury to me?
Would you?
Norbury?
Just that.
I'd be very grateful.
What's this?
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.
Oh, God!
Is that...?
- Must be.
- Oh.
I knew it wouldn't end like this.
I knew Moriarty made plans.
'I thought that would get your attention.
'So, this is in case...
'In case the day comes.
'If you are watching this, I'm probably dead.
'I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows?
'Nothing's certain, nothing's written.
'My old life... '..it was full of consequences.
'The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.
'You need to remember that.
So... '..

I just wondered how things were going and... ..if there was anything I could do.
It's, er, it's from John.
- Right.
- You don't need to read it now.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.
He says...
John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...
Yes?
He said he'd... ..that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Anyone.

My brother is a murderer.
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.
Oh, do your research.
I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Merry Christmas!
[GUNSHOT]
I'm not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.
You know what happened to the other one.
Miss me?
"Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?"
I've only been gone four minutes.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Is that quite clear?
Don't minute any of this.
Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.
A D notice has been slapped on the entire incident.
Only those within this room, code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love, will ever know the whole truth.
As far as everyone else is concerned, going to the Prime Minister
- and way beyond, Charles Augustus...
- [PHONE KEYBOARD CLICKS]
- Are you tweeting?
!
- No.
Well, that's what it looks like!
Of course I'm not tweeting.
Why would I be tweeting?
- Give me that!
- What?
No!
What are you doing?
!
- Get off!
- Give it here!
- "Back on Terra firma."
- Don't read them out.
- "Free as a bird."
- God, you're such a spoilsport.
Will you take this matter seriously, Sherlock?
I am!
What makes you think I'm not taking it seriously?
"#OhWhatABeautifulMorning"
Look, not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death - my death!
And now I'm back, in a nice warm office, with my big brother and...
Are those ginger nuts?
- Oh, God...
- Love ginger nuts.
Our doctor said you were clean.
I am.
Utterly.
No need for stimulants now, remember?
I have work to do.
You're high as a kite!
Natural high, I assure you.
Totally natural.
I'm just... ♪ ...glad to be alive!

What shall we do next?
What's your name?
Vivian.
- What would you do, Vivian?
- Pardon?
Well, it's a lovely day.
Go for a stroll?
Make a paper aeroplane?
Have an ice lolly?
Ice lolly, I suppose.
Ice lolly it is!
- What's your favourite?
- Well, really, I shouldn't...
- Go on.
- Do they still do Mivvies?
- Mr Holmes...
- Yes?
- ...we do need to get on.
- Yes, of course.
[HELICOPTER WHIRS]
Do your research.
"I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
[GUNSHOT]
- ...sociopath.
- [GUNSHOT]
- ...sociopath." - [GUNSHOT]
I see.
Who is supposed to have shot him, then?
Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger - that's who.
- That's not what happened at all.
- It is now.
Remarkable.
How did you do it?
We have some very talented people working here.
If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.
That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.
No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.
You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.
You're home and dry.
OK, cheers.
Obviously, there's unfinished business.
Moriarty.
I told you
- Moriarty's dead.
You say he filmed that video message before he died.
Yes.
You also say you know what he's going to do next.
- What does that mean?
- Perhaps that's all there is to it.
Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
No, no, he would never be that disappointing.
He's planned something, something long-term.
Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.
Posthumous revenge.
No, better than that - posthumous game.
We brought you back to deal with this.
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.
Wait?
!
Of course wait.
I'm the target - targets wait.
Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up,
I'll know when it begins.
I always know when the game is on.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because I love it.
There was once a merchant, in the famous market at Baghdad.
- [WATER SLOSHES]
- One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise, and he knew that the stranger was Death.
Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles, to the city of Samarra.
For there he was sure Death could not find him.
But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.
"Very well," said the merchant.
"I give in.
I am yours."
"But tell me, why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"
"Because," said Death,
"I had an appointment with you tonight in Samarra."
If this gets any better, I'm going to get two knives.
Pays to advertise.
- So, what about Moriarty, then?
- Oh, I have a plan.
I'm going to monitor the underworld, every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
So, basically, your plan is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do?
Awesome, isn't it?
He drowned, Mr Holmes.
That's what we thought.
- But when they opened up his lungs...
- Yes?
...sand.
- Superficial.

"The Duplicate Man How could Dennis Parkinson be in two places at the same time?
And murder one of them?"
Sherlock...
It's never twins.
Hopkins, arrest Wilson.
Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.
- "Wilson?" "Lymph nodes?"
- Sherlock...
Yes, you may have nothing but a limbless torso, but there'll be traces of ink in the lymph nodes under the armpits.
If your mystery corpse had tattoos, the signs will be there.
- "Bloody hell!
Is that a guess?"
- I never guess.
- Sherlock...
- "So, he's the killer?
The canary trainer?"
- Of course he's the killer.
- "Didn't see that coming."
Hm, naturally.
Sherlock, you can't go on spinning plates like this.
That's it!
The place was spinning.
The heart medication you're taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.
Yes, I...
I think so.
Why?
Because the fingerprints on your brother's neck were your own.

Aw, she's so beautiful.
- Have another go.
- What about a name?
- Catherine.
- Uh, yeah, we've gone off that.
Have we?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Well, you know what I think...
- BOTH:
It's not a girl's name.
Molly, Mrs H, we would love you to be godparents.
- Oh!
Really?
- If you...
That's so lovely.
And, uh... you too, Sherlock?
- You too what?
- Godfather, we'd like you to be godfather.
God is a ludicrous fiction, dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.
Yeah, but there'll be cake.

It means "Rose of the world".
Rosie for short.

No.

[MESSAGE TONE]
All right, good girl, good girl.
Good girl.
I'd better finish this, hadn't I?
- Hey.
- Afternoon.
He says you've got a good one, Greg?
Oh, yeah.
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
God, 50!
Where does it go?
I know for a fact I was only 21 this time last week.
Yeah, well that's impossible.
That was before you met me.
- Well, no, no, there never was...
- "There never was such a time."
She's looking at me disapprovingly again.
No.
She's just jealous.
Yeah, well, I think we both are.
[PHONE VIBRATES]
- Oh...
- No, no, David.
- Come on, you promised.
- No, it's...
Oh, no...
Oh, it's a Skype call.
Oh!
Then it must be Charlie.
At least he's phoning, I suppose.
Oh, look!
Hello!
"Hey, Dad.
Happy birthday.
Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?"
No!
Picture's frozen!
"Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you."
Why is it rubbish?
Where are you?
How is he?
Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.
MAN:
David?
Come on!
OK, no, hang on a sec, I'll find somewhere quieter.
So, Charlie, where are you?
Are you there?
- "Sorry, I'm here.
I'm just a bit..."
- Are you all right?
"It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude."
Altitude?
"I'm in Tibet.
Didn't you see the mountains?"
Never mind mountains.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.
- "Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?"
- What?
"Could you just check something on my car?"
Your car?
"To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe
I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet."
- "Could you take a photo and send it?"
- Uh, yes, I can do that.
All done.
Have you got it?
Charlie?
LESTRADE:
A week later...
Yeah?
...something really weird happens.
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed, the cops are chasing him, and he turns into the drive of the Welsborough house to try and get away.
Unfortunately...
The drunk guy survived, they managed to pull him out, but when they put the fire out and examined the parked car...
Whose body?
Charlie Welsborough, the son.
- What?
- The son who was in Tibet.
DNA all checks out.
Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.
[SHERLOCK CHUCKLES]
- Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
- Have you got a lab report?
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.
- The seats?
- Yes, the car seats.
Made of vinyl.
Two different types of vinyl present.
Was it his own car?
Yeah, not flash - he was a student.
- Well, that's suggestive.
- Why?
- Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
- Yeah, right?
- There's something else.
- Yes?
According to this,
Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.
What?
The body in the car, dead for a week.
Oh, this is a good one.
Is it my birthday?
You want help?
- Yes, please.
OK.
- One condition.
Take all the credit.
It gets boring if I just solve them all.
Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.
He's got a point.
Which makes me look like some kind of prima Donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do!
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.
- Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
- Definitely a sore spot.
So you take all the glory, thanks...
- OK!
- ...thanks all the same.
Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?
It's driving me nuts.
Anything you say, Giles.
Just kidding.
HE MOUTHS:
What's his name?
HE MOUTHS:
Greg.
What?
Greg.
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?
Not a clue.
It's just you normally say that at this point.
Hmm.
Well, then, let's hope you solve your little problem, Greg.
- Hear that?
- I know.
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood?
- Oh, good, great.
Yeah, amazing.
- Getting any sleep?
- Christ, no.
You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.
- Must feel very different...
- Sorry, what?
Yes, well, you know how it is.
All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.
- Are you two having a little joke?
- Never a word of thanks.
Can't even tell people's faces apart.
This is a joke, isn't it?
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever.
You're so, so clever."
- Is it about me?
- I think he needs winding.
You know, I think that really might be it.
No, don't get it.
Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect, so go easy on them, yeah?
- You know me.
- MARY: 'Hey, hello.'
Yeah.
Got them, don't worry.
Pampers, the cream you can't get from Boots.
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now?
- At the dead boy's house?
- Yeah.
'And what does he think?
Any theories?
'
Well, I texted you the details.
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.
- Hey!
- How do you know about that?
"Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up."
- WHISPERING:
They know everything!
- "Solved it, then?"
I'm working on it.
"Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down."
- Pig!
- Keep trying.
"So, what about it, then?"
"What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it?"
"And what are you going to call this one?"
Oh, the Ghost Driver.
- Don't give it a title.
- People like the titles.
- They hate the titles.
- Give the people what they want.
No, never do that - people are stupid.
Uh, some people.
"All people are stupid.
Most people."
"Bizarre enough though, isn't it, to be him?"
I mean, it's right up your strasse.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.
- Son.
- Son!
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.
If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.
Well, I believe that I can.
DISTORTED:
But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
Sherlock?
Mr Holmes?
Sorry, you were saying?
Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
I don't think we'll ever get over this.
No.
Shouldn't think so.
So sorry, will you excuse me a moment?
I just...
I'll...
I'll just, um...
Ahem.
- Now what's wrong?
- Not sure, I just...
By the pricking of my thumbs.
Seriously?
You?
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.
They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.
What is this?
Oh, it's a sort of shrine, I suppose, really.
Bit of a fan of Mrs T.
A big hero of mine when I was getting started.
Right, yes.
- Who?
- What?
- Who...?
Who was this?
- Are you serious?
- Sherlock...
- It's...
It's Margaret Thatcher, the first female Prime Minister of this country.
Right.
- Prime Minister?
Right.
- Leader of the Government.
- Female?
- For God's sake!
You know perfectly well who she is.
Why are you playing for time?
It's the gap, look at the gap.
It's wrong.
Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed.
The whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.
This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been in, this picture is straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.
- Something's missing from here, but only recently.
- Yes, a...
- Plaster bust... - plaster bust.
- Oh, for God's sake!
It got broken.
What the hell has this got to do with Charlie?
- Rug!
- What?
Well, how could it get broken?
The only place for it to fall is the floor and there is a big thick rug.
- Does it matter?
- Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.
- It is worth letting him do this.
- Is your friend quite mad?
No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
We found the remains out there in the porch.
- The porch where we came in?
- How anybody could hate her so much they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness...
I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.
Why didn't he smash all the others?
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.
Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.
- And if there's nothing...
- I know what happened to your son.
You do?
It's quite simple, superficial, to be blunt.
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness?
- Well, yes.
- And the porch where it was smashed,
I noticed the motion sensor was damaged,
- so I assume it's permanently lit.
- How did you notice that?
I lack the arrogance to ignore details.
I'm not the police.
- So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.
- Exactly.
- Why?
- Don't know.
Wouldn't be fun if I knew.
Mr Holmes, please!
It was your 50th birthday, Mr Welsborough, of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
- After all, he was in Tibet.
- Yes.
- No.
- No?
CROWD: ♪ Happy birthday... ♪
The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video.
Easily arranged.
It's a Skype call.
The trick was meant to be a surprise.
- A trick?
- Obviously.
Could you take a photo and send it?
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.
Well, good enough.
Effectively a costume.
You're joking?
No, I'm not.
All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
- Oh, my God!
- Surprise!
That's when it happened.
I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.
You said he'd felt unwell?
You all right?
"It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude."
He died there and then.
No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained, in the driver's seat, hidden, until...
When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who'd been sitting there, quite dead, for a week.
Oh, God!
Poor kid.
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.
This is where it was smashed.
- That was amazing.
- What?
The car, the kid.
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?
I can't stand it, never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
What kind of a life would that be?
Besides, I have the strangest feeling...
Miss me?
- That's mine.
You two take a... bus.
- Why?
I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.
The Mall, please.
- I met her once.
- Thatcher?
Rather arrogant, I thought.
- You thought that?
!
- Ha, I know.
Why am I looking at this?
That's her, John and Mary's baby.
Oh, I see, yes.
Looks very... fully functioning.
Is that really the best you can do?
Sorry, I've never been very good with them.
- Babies?
- Humans.
Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?
Any interest in her?
Why on earth would he?
I don't know.
You tell me.
In the last year of his life,
James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over 70 assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias,
which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.
It's a pearl... get another one.
There's something important about this.
I'm sure.
Maybe it's Moriarty.
Maybe it's not.
[WATER SLOSHES]
But something's coming.
Are you having a premonition, brother mine?
The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other.
What we call premonition is just movement of the web.
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable.
As inevitable as mathematics.
Appointment In Samarra.
I'm sorry?
The merchant who can't outrun Death.
You always hated that story as a child.
Less keen on predestination back then.
I'm not sure I like it now.
You wrote your own version, as I remember.
Appointment In Sumatra.
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.
Goodnight, Mycroft.
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.
- Keep me informed.
- Of what?
Absolutely no idea.
"Ammo!"
[MAN SHUDDERS]
- Oh, hi, Stella.
- Greg.
You, uh...?
- Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...
- Right, right, right...
Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?
It's nothing.
I mean it's nothing serious.
- No, no.
- I just pop round every now and again for a chat.
Yeah, of course.
I mean he loves a really tricky case.
Yeah, he does!
So what you here for?
Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so...
The Borgia Pearl?
They still after that, are they?
Yeah.
So, how did you two first meet?
Oh, well, there was a case about, um, ten years ago.
Nobody could figure it out.
There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.
- Oh, yeah?
How did she die?
- Hypothermia.
What?
I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...
Will you two please keep it down?
!
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?
You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.
I was a carpenter.
Like me dad.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
How the hell...?
Ah... e-cigarettes.
Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.
If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.
But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last.
Anything to add, John?
- John?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.
- What is that?
- That is... me.
Well, it's a me substitute.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You know I value your little contributions.
Yeah?
It's been there since nine this morning.
- Has it?
Where were you?
- Helping Mrs H with her Sudoku.
What about my girlfriend?
- What?
- You said I had an ex...
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.
The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.
I...
I thought you'd done something clever.
Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?
[SHERLOCK INHALES DEEPLY]
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
What do you mean?
Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
- Well...
- You thought she was having an affair.
I'm afraid it's far worse than that, your wife is a spy.
- What?
- That's right.
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy, across the road from your flat.
Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy, as part of an official state visit.
As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.
This drug will render the President entirely susceptible to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty.
What?
Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III.
- Are you serious?
- No, of course not.
His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.
I don't!
- Just the bras.
- Get out.
So, what's this all about, then?
- Having fun.
- Fun?
- While I can.
- Mm-hmm.
[KNOCK AT DOOR]
- Uh, Sherlock...
- Borgia Pearl.
Boring.
Go!
- But...
- Go!
- This had better be good.
- Oh, I think you'll like it.
That is the bust, isn't it?
The one that was broken.
No, it's another one, different owner.
Different part of town.
You were right, this is a thing.
Something's going on.
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be pleased.
- I am pleased.
- You don't look pleased.
This is my game face.
And the game is on.
Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one.
- One belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan.
- Identical busts?
Yeah, and this one to a Dr Barnicot in Holborn.
Three in total.
God knows who'd want to do something like this.
Yeah, but some people have that complex, don't they?
An idee fixe.
They obsess over one thing and they can't let it go.
No, no good.
There were other images of Margaret...
Margaret...?
You know who she is.
...Thatcher, present at the first break-in.
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?
Ooh!
- What?
- Blood.
Quite a bit of it, too.
Was there any injury at the crime scene?
Nah.
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.
- Come on.
- Holborn?
Lambeth!
- Lambeth?
Why?
- To see Toby.
Ah, right.
Who?
- You'll see.
- Right, are you coming?
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.
- Who told you?
- The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.
- Have a good time.
- I will.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
- What?
- She's not the one.
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.
How do you work all that out?
She's got three children in Rio that he doesn't know about.
Are you just making this up?
- Possibly.
- Who's Toby?
There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker, one of the world's best.
Got himself into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago.
He hacked into the Pentagon security system, and I managed to get him off the charge.
Therefore he owes me a favour.
So, how does that help us?
- What?
- Toby the hacker?
- Toby's not the hacker.
- What?
- All right, Craig?
- All right, Sherlock?
Craig's got a dog.
So I see.
Good boy!
Hiya!
Mary?
What are you...?
No, we, we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case.
No, exactly.
So... don't wait up.
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Hey.
Mary, what are you doing here?
She's better at this than you.
- Better?
- So I texted her.
Hang on, Mary's better than me?
Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.
Of course she's better.
Yeah, OK.
Nothing personal.
What, so I'm supposed to just go home now, am I?
What do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?
- John or the dog?
- Ha-ha, that's funny!
- John.
- Well...
He's handy and loyal.
- That's hilarious.
- Is it too early for a divorce?
Oh.
Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge?
Keep up, he's fast.
- He's not moving.
- He's thinking.
He's really not moving.
Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.
You just like this dog, don't you?
- Well, I like you.
- He's still not moving.
- Fascinating.
- Oh!
[SHE CLEARS HER THROAT]
Well, what do you make of it?
- They were looking for something.
- Yes, but it wasn't a burglar, they came specifically for that Thatcher bust.
Why?
[DOG SNIFFS]
[DOG WHINES]
Clever.
Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail,
- where would you go?
- Like hiding a tree in a forest.
Or blood in a butcher's.
Never mind, Toby, better luck next time, hmm?
This is it, though.
This is the one, I can feel it.
Not Moriarty?
It has to be him.
It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.
It's designed to beguile me, tease me and lure me in.
At last, a noose for me to put my neck into.
You should have seen the state of the front room.
- It was like The Exorcist.
- Huh.
Was Rosie's head spinning round?
- No.
Just the projectile vomiting.
- Nice!
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
- Hmm?
Noticed what?
- The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
[BABY CRIES]
Yeah, can't she?
I'm coming, darling.
Mummy's coming.
LOVINGLY:
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here.
Have you heard of that thing?
In Germany?
You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.
Ostalgie.
People who missed the old days under the communists.
- People are weird, aren't they?
- Hmm.
According to this, there's quite a market for Cold War memorabilia.
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit?
Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.
Yes, fascinating.
Irrelevant.
Where exactly did they come from?
I've got into the records of the suppliers, Gelder and Co.
Seems they're from Georgia.
Where exactly?
Tbilisi.
Batch of six.
One to Welsborough.
One to Hassan.
One to Dr Barnicot.
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.
One to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.
Lestrade?
Another one?
- 'Yeah.'
- Harker or Sandeford?
Harker.
And it's murder this time.
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.
_
_
Defensive wounds on her face and hands, throat cut.
Sharp blade.
The same thing inside the house?
The bust?
- Two of them this time.
- Interesting.
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago.
- Limited edition of six.
- And now someone's wandering about destroying them all.
Makes no sense.
What's the point?
No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.
- Yes, it is.
- Well, it is, but it's not the point.
I've been slow, far too slow.
Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind...
Slow but lucky, very lucky.
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.
Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.
Congratulations, by the way.
- I'm sorry?
- Well, you're about to solve a big one.
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
- Yeah, until then, basically.
[WATER SPLASHING]
That's enough now, love.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.
And you need to get to bed.
Come on.
Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?
You were on the run.
Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying, it's clever.
Very clever.
But now you've met me and you're not so clever, are you?
Who are you?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.
Argh!
You're out of time.
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
- Who?
I know it's him.
It must be him.
You think you understand.
You understand nothing.
Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don't we just enjoy the moment?
Let me present Interpol's number one case.
Too tough for them, too boring for me.
The Black Pearl of the Borgias!
It's not possible!
How could she...?
!
Everything about who I was is on there.
The problems of your past are your business.
The problems of your future are my privilege.
I don't understand.
She...
She destroyed it.
She?
You know her!
You do, don't you?
You know the bitch?
!
She betrayed me.
Betrayed us all.
Mary.
This is about Mary?
Is that what she's calling herself now, eh?
- "Armed police, you're surrounded!"
- Give it to me.
YELLS:
Give it to me!
"Come out slowly, I want to see your hands above your head."
Nobody shoots me!
Anyone shoots, I kill this man.
"Lay down your weapon.
Do it now!"
I'm leaving this place.
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.
"Lay down your weapon."
You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
Tell her she's a dead woman.
She's a dead woman walking.
She's my friend.
And she's under my protection.
Who are you?
I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.
Who's Sherlock Holmes?
Not a policeman.
[ALARM BLARES]
What do you think?
Mate in two?
Don't antagonise them, darling.
Oh, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.
Everything palls.
They'll send someone soon.
They?
Who are they?
Seems to me we put an awful lot of faith in they.
Well, I've got something they would dearly love, if only we could get out of here.
I've got Ammo.
Ammo?
- MARY:
Madame Ambassador.
- What took you so long?
- Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now!
Veer left!
[SCREAMING]
[HE LAUGHS]
What now?
What do we do?
We die.
Well?
He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.
- I very much doubt it.
- Why?
Because I think he used to work with Mary.
[GUNFIRE]
[SHOUTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE]
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out!
We'll come back later.
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the English woman?
What would you do to a traitor?
Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.
[HE CHUCKLES]
I am an idiot, I know nothing.
Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
That was quite a text you sent me.
What's going on, Sherlock?
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,
I couldn't see what was right under my nose.
Expected a pearl.
Oh, my God, that's a...
Yes, it's an AGRA.
Memory stick, like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.
Who?
I don't know.
We...
We all had one but the others were...
Haven't you even looked at it yet?
I glanced at it but I prefer
- to hear it from you.
- Why?
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.
There were four of us, agents.
Not just agents.
Polite term.
Alex.
Gabriel.
Me.
And Ajay.
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.
We all had one.
Each containing aliases, our background, everything.
We could never be betrayed, because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.
- Who employed you?
- Anyone who paid well.
I mean, we were at the top of our game for years.
And then it all ended.
There was a coup in Georgia.
The British Embassy in Tbilisi was taken over, lots of hostages.
We got the call to go in, get them out.
There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.
- Who from?
- I don't know, just another voice on the phone.
And a codeword.
- Ammo.
- Ammo?
Like ammunition.
We went in, but then something went wrong.
Something went really wrong.
[GUNFIRE, SCREAMING]
That was six years ago.
It feels like forever.
I was the only one that made it out.
No.
What?
I met someone tonight.
Same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.
What, he's alive?
Yeah, very much so.
I don't believe it, this is amazing!
I thought I was the only one,
I thought I was the only one who got out.
Where is he?
I need to see him, now!
Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?
Yeah, of course.
It was our insurance.
Above all, they mustn't fall into enemy hands.
So Ajay survived as well.
And now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide, with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why?
I don't know.
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
[SHE LAUGHS]
Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.
Families fall out.
The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
Well, he's just trying to find me.
He survived, that's all that matters!
I heard it from his own mouth.
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."
Why would he want to kill me?
- He said you betrayed him.
- Oh, no, no, that's insane.
Well, it's what he believes.
[SHE GASPS]
I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.
No, Mary...
You do.
I made a vow, remember?
To look after the three of you.
Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
There's something I think you should read.
What is it?
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.
What are you...?
[HE SNIFFS]
- Mary...
Oh, no!
- There you go.
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.
No.
You just look after them till I get back.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
[CHILD SINGS]
[HE GROANS]
Agra?
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
It is 378km west of the state capital, Lucknow.
What are you, Wikipedia?
- Yes.
- AGRA is an acronym.
Oh, good, I love an acronym.
All the best secret societies have them.
Team of agents, the best.
But you know all that.
Of course I do.
Go on.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.
Indeed?
Well, that's news to me.
Is it?
He's already killed looking for that memory stick.
AGRA always worked for the highest bidder,
I thought that might include you?
- Me?
- Well, I mean the British government, or whatever government you're currently propping up.
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.
They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong.
And that was that, we stopped using freelancers.
- Your initiative?
- My initiative.
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.
I don't like loose ends.
Not on my watch.
There was something else.
A detail.
A codeword.
Ammo?
It's all I've got.
Little enough.
Could you do some digging as a favour?
You don't have many favours left.
Then I'm calling them all in.
And if you can find who's after her and neutralise them, what then?
You think you can go on saving her forever?
Of course.
Is that sentiment talking?
No, it's me.
Difficult to tell the difference these days.
Told you, I made a promise.
A vow.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.
Not on my watch.
MARY: "My darling, I need to tell you this because you mustn't hate me for going away."
NEW YORK ACCENT:
Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.
- Can you hear a squeaking?
- No.
Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel.
Why Planes Fail.
- Did you see it?
Oh, truly terrifying.
- Can't say I did.
Swore I would never fly again, yet hear I am!
Everything OK, madam?
No.
No, no, it's not, but then what's the use in complaining?
I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off is all.
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.
Oh, OK.
Relax.
She said relax. [CHUCKLES]
Did you have a nice time in London?
It was OK, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun?
- Did you lose it in the war?
- [SHE LAUGHS]
"I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.
I'm not running, I promise you that,
I just need to do this in my own way."
Oh, God!
I'm...
I-I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God!
[FLIGHT ATTENDANT BUTTON BEEPS]
- Everything OK, madam?
- I think I'm dying.
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.
God will smile on you.
"But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,
I'm sorry, my love."
I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.
Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of a dice.
I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
"I swear I will."
[LAUGHTER]
Not like this one.
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in!
I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.
Mr Baker.
Well, that completes the set.
- No, it does not.
- Well, who else am I missing?
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?
Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.
Oh, hi, Mary.
What concept?
Happy families.
Nice trip?
- How the f...?
- Please, Mary, there is a child present.
- How did you get in here?
- Karim let me in.
Hello.
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Nice to meet you, missus.
No, I mean how did you find me?
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
No, really, though, how?
Every movement I made was entirely random, every new personality just on the roll of a dice!
Mary, no human action is ever truly random.
An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability, mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual, can reduce the number of variables considerably.
I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine a seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.
But they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.
[HE CHUCKLES]
JOKINGLY:
Oh, you bastard!
- ANGRILY:
You bastard!
- I know, but your face!
"The mathematics of probability"?
- You believed that.
- "Feasible variables"?
Yes, I started to run out about then.
In the memory stick!
Yeah, that was my idea.
- AGRA?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
You said it was your initials.
In a way that was true.
In a way?
So many lies.
I'm so sorry.
And I don't just mean you.
What?
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...
You're R?
Rosamund?
Rosamund Mary.
I always liked Mary.
Yeah, me too.
I used to.
I just...
I didn't know what else to do.
You could have stayed, you could have talked to me.
That's what couples are supposed to do.
Work things through.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Mary, I may not be a very good man but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for,
- most of the time.
- All the time.
You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.
You never judge, you never complain.
I don't deserve you, I...
All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
I will keep you safe.
But it has to be in London.
It's my city, I know the turf.
Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.
Get down!
[RAPID GUNFIRE]
Hello again.
- Ajay?
- Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.
Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.
I thought I was the only one who got out.
How did you find us?
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.
You found her but I found you.
So perhaps not so clever.
And now here we are.
At last.
[HE CHUCKLES] Touche!
Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
She thought I was dead.
I might as well have been.
It was always just the four of us, always, remember?
Oh, yeah.
So why do you want to kill me?
Do you know how long they kept me prisoner?
What they did to me?
They tortured Alex to death.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.
But you?
You, where were you?
That day at the embassy, I escaped.
Ha!
But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
Where were you?
Oh, I got out.
For a while.
Long enough to hide my memory stick.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.
I was loyal, you see.
Loyal to my friends.
But they took me, tortured me.
Not for information.
Not for anything except fun.
They thought I'd give in, die, but I didn't, I lived.
And eventually, they forgot about me rotting in a cell somewhere.
Six years they kept me there.
Until one day I saw my chance.
Oh, and I made them pay.
You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.
Little whispers.
Laughter.
Gossip.
How the clever agents had been betrayed.
Brought down by you!
- Me?
- [TRAIN WHISTLES]
You know I'll kill you too.
You know I will, Ajay.
What, you think I care if I die?
I've dreamed of killing you every night for six years.
Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.
I swear to you, Ajay.
What did you hear, Ajay?
When you were a prisoner, what exactly did you hear?
What did I hear?
Ammo.
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo."
We were betrayed!
- And they said it was her?
- That you betrayed us!
They said her name?
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.
No!
No!
"The English woman, that's all he heard.
Naturally, he assumed it was Mary."
Couldn't this wait until you're back?
No, it's not over.
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed, the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.
There was only a voice on the phone.
"Remember?
And a codeword."
"Ammo," yes, you said.
How's your Latin, brother dear?
My Latin?
Amo, amas, amat.
I love, you love, he loves.
What...?
Not "Ammo" as in ammunition, but "Amo", meaning?
You'd better be right, Sherlock.
Bloody thing!
What's going on?
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.
What?
"So many lies.
And I don't just mean you."
- Hello.
- Ah, hello.
- I like your daisy.
- Thank you, yeah.
It's not really me, though, I think.
- No?
- No, no, it's too floral for me.
I'm more of a "knackered with weary old eyes" kind of guy.
Well, I think they're nice.
Nice eyes.
- [HE LAUGHS] Thank you.
- Look...
Look...
I don't normally do this,
- but, um...
- But you're going to.
Yeah.
- What's this?
- This is me.
- Thank you.
Cheers.
- Yeah.
Great.
- Bye!
- Bye.
[HE CHUCKLES]
New Contact E
Hey
[PHONE BEEPS]
Hey
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
Hmm?
Noticed what?
The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
[BABY CRIES]
- Yeah, can't she?
- Hmm.
I'm coming darling.
I'm coming.
[PHONE BEEPS]
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
- "It's been too long."
- Come here...
It's OK.
"It's been too long." i"I know.
Sorry."
- "Miss you."
- Do you want a cuddle?
[BABY CONTINUES TO WAIL]
- "Miss you." -"You're up late."
I know.
- Oh, sweetheart.
- "Or early."
"Night owl?"
Ssh.
Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you?
"Vampire"
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?
Oh, let's go and see Daddy!
Daddy's here.
It's OK, Rosie.
I'll take her.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I may as well get up now.
Hey, baby, it's Daddy.
Your daddy.
Come here, Rose.
Come here, darling, it's all right.
Thank you.
"This isn't a good ideea.
I'm not free.
Things won't end well.
It was nice to get to know you a little."
"I'm sorry."
This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.
How many more times?
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.
And you're basing all this on a code name?
On a whispered voice on the telephone?
Come on, Mycroft.
You were the conduit for AGRA.
Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
It was my job.
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
AGRA went in.
- Yes.
- And they were betrayed.
Not by me.
Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.
I promise you,
I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.
You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.
Not one.
Not.
One.
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories?
I'd like to do those.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.
Although she does seem to enjoy them.
Well, I'll have to give that a go.
Got a lot to catch up on.
AJAY: "You think you understand.
You understand nothing."
MYCROFT: "Code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love."
MARY: "You'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up."
"They know everything."
"They said it was the English woman."
"Don't minute any of this."
"They know everything."
- You don't make it easy, do you?
- What do you mean?
Well, being... being so perfect.
Mary, I...
I need to tell you...
- [PHONE BEEPS]
- Hang on.
Can you tell me later?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Great.
Well, no, we can't just go.
- Rosie.
- Yeah.
- Er, you go.
- No!
I'll come as soon as I've found someone.
Mrs Hudson.
- Corfu till Saturday.
Molly?
- Er, yeah, I'll try.
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.
You know that's not going to happen.
If there's more to this case, you need to see it.
Yeah, OK, you win.
"Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes."
"Please make your way to the exit.
Thank you."
Your office said I'd find you here.
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.
We're like them.
Ghostly, living in the shadows.
Predatory?
Well, it depends which side you're on.
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.
Nice location for the final act, couldn't have chosen it better myself.
But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.
I just come here to look at the fish.
I knew this would happen one day.
- It's like that old story.
- I really am a very busy man.
Would you mind cutting to the chase?
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
With good reason.
"There was once a merchant, in a famous market in Baghdad."
I really have never liked this story.
I'm just like the merchant in the story,
I thought I could out-run the inevitable.
I've always been looking over my shoulder, always expecting to see the grim figure of...
Death.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hey.
- John?
- On his way.
Let me introduce Ammo.
You were Ammo?
You were the person on the phone that time?
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
Why did you betray us?
Why does anyone do anything?
- Hmm.
- Let me guess, selling secrets?
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.
Worked very well for a few years.
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it.
But...
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.
[SHE CHUCKLES] I couldn't believe my luck!
That bought me a little time.
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
Very handy.
They were always such reliable killers.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.
Lady Smallwood gave the order.
But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.
Seemed to do the trick.
And you thought your troubles were over.
I was tired.
Tired of the mess of it all.
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.
The hostages were killed.
AGRA too.
Or so I thought.
My secret was safe.
But... apparently not.
Just a little peace.
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
A family?
Home?
Really, I understand.
So, just let me get out of here, right?
Let me just walk away.
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.
What do you say?
After what you did?
!
Mary, no!
OK.
London Aquarium.
Yes, now.
I was never a field agent.
I always thought I'd be rather good.
[MARY SCOFFS]
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
Thanks.
- For a secretary.
- What?
It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
- I didn't do this out of jealousy.
- No?
Same old drudge, day in, day out.
Never getting out there where all the excitement was.
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.
Yes, your little flat.
- How do you know?
- Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?
And what are you, widowed or divorced?
Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.
That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.
- Sherlock...
- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.
A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.
- Sherlock, don't.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.
There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
That accounts for the drink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.
So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.
To prove how good you are.
To make up for the inadequacies of your...
little life.
Well, Mrs Norbury,
I must admit this is unexpected.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.
All except Sherlock Holmes.
There's no way out.
So it would seem.
You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.
It's what I do.
Maybe I can still surprise you.
Now, come on, be sensible.
Hmm, no, I don't think so.
Ah!
Surprise!
[MARY GASPS FOR AIR]
[MARY GROANS]
Everything's fine.
It's going to be OK.
Get an ambulance!
It's all right, it's all right.
- Mary!
- John.
All right, Mary?
Mary?
Stay with me, stay with me.
- Oh, come on...
- No, don't worry.
Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
Come on, Mary.
Mary?
Oh, God.
John, I think this is it.
No, no, no, no.
It's not.
- That's...
- You made me so happy.
You gave me everything I could ever, ever have wanted...
Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.
- Look after Rosie.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.
- Promise me.
- I promise.
- No...
- Yes, I promise.
- Promise me!
- I promise, I promise.
Ssh, ssh.
Hey, Sherlock.
Yes.
I... so like you.
Did I ever say?
Yes, yes, you did.
I'm sorry for... for shooting you that time.
I'm really sorry.
It's all right.
I think we're even now, OK?
OK.
- Oh, I think we're...
- Mary, Mary...
- ...even, definitely even.
- Ssh, ssh.
You were my whole world.
Being Mary Watson was the only life worth living.
- Mary...
- Thank you.
Mary...
[HE BEWAILS]
Don't you dare!
You made a vow.
You swore it.
[PHONE BEEPS REPEATEDLY]
"You've been having dreams.
A recurring dream?"
[CLOCK TICKS RHYTHMICALLY]
Do you want to talk about it?
This is a two-way relationship, you know.
[SHE SIGHS]
The whole world has come crashing down around you.
Everything's hopeless.
Irretrievable.
I know that's what you must feel but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
That's not really my style.
I need to know what to do.
Do?
About John.
[BACK CRACKS, HE GROANS]
Put me through to Sherrinford, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
SOBS:
But nothing will ever be the same again, will it?
I'm afraid it won't.
We'll have to rally round, I expect, do our bit.
Look after little Rosie.
I'm just going to, um look through these things.
There might be a case.
A case?
Oh, you're not up to it, are you?
Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.
Yes.
Yes, I expect you're right.
I'll make some tea, shall I?
- Mrs Hudson?
- Yes, Sherlock?
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident...
- Yes?
- ...would you just say the word Norbury to me?
Would you?
Norbury?
Just that.
I'd be very grateful.
What's this?
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.
Oh, God!
Is that...?
- Must be.
- Oh.
I knew it wouldn't end like this.
I knew Moriarty made plans.
"I thought that would get your attention."
So, this is in case...
In case the day comes.
If you are watching this, I'm probably dead.
I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows?
Nothing's certain, nothing's written.
My old life it was full of consequences.
The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.
You need to remember that.
So I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
Might be the hardest case of your career.
When I'm... gone, if I'm gone...
"...
I need you to do something for me."
- [BABY GURGLES]
- Hi.
I just wondered how things were going and if there was anything I could do.
It's, Er, it's from John.
- Right.
- You don't need to read it now.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.
He says...
John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...
Yes?
He said he'd that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Anyone.
[DOOR CLOSES]
"I'm giving you a case, Sherlock."
When I'm gone, if I'm... gone I need you to do something for me.
Save John Watson.
Save him, Sherlock.
"Save him."
"When does the path we walk on lock around our feet?
When does the road become a river with only one destination?"
"Death waits for us all in Samarra.
But can Samarra be avoided?"

Go to hell, Sherlock.

- My brother is a murderer.
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.
Oh, do your research.
I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Merry Christmas!
[GUNSHOT]
I'm not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.
You know what happened to the other one.
Miss me?
'Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
'
I've only been gone four minutes.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Is that quite clear?
Don't minute any of this.
Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.
A D notice has been slapped on the entire incident.
Only those within this room, code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love, will ever know the whole truth.
As far as everyone else is concerned, going to the Prime Minister
- and way beyond, Charles Augustus...
- [PHONE KEYBOARD CLICKS]
- Are you tweeting?
!
- No.
Well, that's what it looks like!
Of course I'm not tweeting.
Why would I be tweeting?
- Give me that!
- What?
No!
What are you doing?
!
- Get off!
- Give it here!
- "Back on terra firma."
- Don't read them out.
- "Free as a bird."
- God, you're such a spoilsport.
Will you take this matter seriously, Sherlock?
I am!
What makes you think I'm not taking it seriously?
"#OhWhatABeautifulMorning"
Look, not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death - my death!
And now I'm back, in a nice warm office, with my big brother and...
Are those ginger nuts?
- Oh, God...
- Love ginger nuts.
Our doctor said you were clean.
I am.
Utterly.
No need for stimulants now, remember?
I have work to do.
You're high as a kite!
Natural high, I assure you.
Totally natural.
I'm just... ♪ ..glad to be alive!
♪
What shall we do next?
What's your name?
Vivian.
- What would you do, Vivian?
- Pardon?
Well, it's a lovely day.
Go for a stroll?
Make a paper aeroplane?
Have an ice lolly?
Ice lolly, I suppose.
Ice lolly it is!
- What's your favourite?
- Well, really, I shouldn't...
- Go on.
- Do they still do Mivvies?
- Mr Holmes...
- Yes?
- ...we do need to get on.
- Yes, of course.
[HELICOPTER WHIRS]
'Do your research.
'I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
[GUNSHOT]
- ..sociopath.
- [GUNSHOT]
- ..sociopath.' - [GUNSHOT]
I see.
Who is supposed to have shot him, then?
Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger - that's who.
- That's not what happened at all.
- It is now.
Remarkable.
How did you do it?
We have some very talented people working here.
If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.
That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.
No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.
You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.
You're home and dry.
OK, cheers.
Obviously, there's unfinished business.
Moriarty.
I told you
- Moriarty's dead.
You say he filmed that video message before he died.
Yes.
You also say you know what he's going to do next.
- What does that mean?
- Perhaps that's all there is to it.
Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
No, no, he would never be that disappointing.
He's planned something, something long-term.
Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.
Posthumous revenge.
No, better than that - posthumous game.
We brought you back to deal with this.
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.
Wait?
!
Of course wait.
I'm the target - targets wait.
Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up,
I'll know when it begins.
I always know when the game is on.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because I love it.
There was once a merchant, in the famous market at Baghdad.
- [WATER SLOSHES]
- One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise, and he knew that the stranger was Death.
Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles, to the city of Samarra.
For there he was sure Death could not find him.
But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.
"Very well," said the merchant.
"I give in.
I am yours."
"But tell me, why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"
"Because," said Death,
"I had an appointment with you tonight... ..in Samarra."
If this gets any better, I'm going to get two knives.
Pays to advertise.
- So, what about Moriarty, then?
- Oh, I have a plan.
I'm going to monitor the underworld, every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
So, basically, your plan is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do?
Awesome, isn't it?
He drowned, Mr Holmes.
That's what we thought.
- But when they opened up his lungs...
- Yes?
..sand.
- Superficial.
- [PHONE WHISTLES]
Come back!
It's the wrong thumb.
[DOOR SLAMS]

Sherlock...
It's never twins.
Hopkins, arrest Wilson.
Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.
- 'Wilson?
' 'Lymph nodes?
'
- Sherlock...
Yes, you may have nothing but a limbless torso, but there'll be traces of ink in the lymph nodes under the armpits.
If your mystery corpse had tattoos, the signs will be there.
- 'Bloody hell!
Is that a guess?
'
- I never guess.
- Sherlock...
- 'So, he's the killer?
The canary trainer?
'
- Of course he's the killer.
- 'Didn't see that coming.'
Hm, naturally.
Sherlock, you can't go on spinning plates like this.
That's it!
The place was spinning.
The heart medication you're taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.
Yes, I...
I think so.
Why?
Because the fingerprints on your brother's neck were your own.
- [WATSON CHUCKLES] A jellyfish?
- I know.
You can't arrest a jellyfish.
- You could try.
- We did try.

They never come out when I take them.
Let's have a look.
Aw, she's so beautiful.
- Have another go.
- What about a name?
- Catherine.
- Uh, yeah, we've gone off that.
Have we?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Well, you know what I think...
- BOTH:
It's not a girl's name.
Molly, Mrs H, we would love you to be godparents.
- Oh!
Really?
- If you...
That's so lovely.
And, uh... you too, Sherlock?
- You too what?
- Godfather, we'd like you to be godfather.
God is a ludicrous fiction, dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.
Yeah, but there'll be cake.
Will you do it?
I'll get back to you.
Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.
In Christ's name.
Now, what name have you given your daughter?
Rosamund Mary.
Rosamund?
It means "Rose of the world".
Rosie for short.
Didn't you get John's text?
No.
I delete his texts.
I delete any text that begins "Hi."
No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.
- [MRS HUDSON CLEARS THROAT]
- Sorry.
WHISPERING:

And now, godparents, are you ready to help the parents of this child in their duties as Christian parents?
BOTH:
We are.
SIRI: 'Sorry, I didn't catch that.
'Please repeat the question.'
As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.
To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
Hard logic versus romantic whimsy - that is your choice.
You fail to connect actions to their consequences.
Now, for the last time, if you want to keep the rattle, do not throw the rattle.
[MESSAGE TONE]
All right, good girl, good girl.
Good girl.
I'd better finish this, hadn't I?
- Hey.
- Afternoon.
He says you've got a good one, Greg?
Oh, yeah.
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
God, 50!
Where does it go?
I know for a fact I was only 21 this time last week.
Yeah, well that's impossible.
That was before you met me.
- Well, no, no, there never was...
- "There never was such a time."
She's looking at me disapprovingly again.
No.
She's just jealous.
Yeah, well, I think we both are.
[PHONE VIBRATES]
- Oh...
- No, no, David.
- Come on, you promised.
- No, it's...
Oh, no...
Oh, it's a Skype call.
Oh!
Then it must be Charlie.
At least he's phoning, I suppose.
Oh, look!
Hello!
'Hey, Dad.
Happy birthday.
Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?
'
No!
Picture's frozen!
'Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you.'
Why is it rubbish?
Where are you?
How is he?
Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.
MAN:
David?
Come on!
OK, no, hang on a sec, I'll find somewhere quieter.
So, Charlie, where are you?
Are you there?
- 'Sorry, I'm here.
I'm just a bit...'
- Are you all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
Altitude?
'I'm in Tibet.
Didn't you see the mountains?
'
Never mind mountains.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.
- 'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?
'
- What?
'Could you just check something on my car?
'
Your car?
'To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe
I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet.
- 'Could you take a photo and send it?
'
- Uh, yes, I can do that.
All done.
Have you got it?
Charlie?
LESTRADE:
A week later...
Yeah?
...something really weird happens.
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed, the cops are chasing him, and he turns into the drive of the Welsborough house to try and get away.
Unfortunately...
The drunk guy survived, they managed to pull him out, but when they put the fire out and examined the parked car...
Whose body?
Charlie Welsborough, the son.
- What?
- The son who was in Tibet.
DNA all checks out.
Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.
[SHERLOCK CHUCKLES]
- Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
- Have you got a lab report?
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.
- The seats?
- Yes, the car seats.
Made of vinyl.
Two different types of vinyl present.
Was it his own car?
Yeah, not flash - he was a student.
- Well, that's suggestive.
- Why?
- Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
- Yeah, right?
- There's something else.
- Yes?
According to this,
Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.
What?
The body in the car, dead for a week.
Oh, this is a good one.
Is it my birthday?
You want help?
- Yes, please.
OK.
- One condition.
Take all the credit.
It gets boring if I just solve them all.
Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.
He's got a point.
Which makes me look like some kind of prima donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do!
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.
- Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
- Definitely a sore spot.
So you take all the glory, thanks...
- OK!
- ...thanks all the same.
Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?
It's driving me nuts.
Anything you say, Giles.
Just kidding.
HE MOUTHS:
What's his name?
HE MOUTHS:
Greg.
What?
Greg.
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?
Not a clue.
It's just you normally say that at this point.
Hmm.
Well, then, let's hope you solve your little problem, Greg.
- Hear that?
- I know.
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood?
- Oh, good, great.
Yeah, amazing.
- Getting any sleep?
- Christ, no.
You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.
- Must feel very different...
- Sorry, what?
Yes, well, you know how it is.
All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.
- Are you two having a little joke?
- Never a word of thanks.
Can't even tell people's faces apart.
This is a joke, isn't it?
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever.
You're so, so clever."
- Is it about me?
- I think he needs winding.
You know, I think that really might be it.
No, don't get it.
Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect, so go easy on them, yeah?
- You know me.
- MARY: 'Hey, hello.'
Yeah.
Got them, don't worry.
Pampers, the cream you can't get from Boots.
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now?
- At the dead boy's house?
- Yeah.
'And what does he think?
Any theories?
'
Well, I texted you the details.
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.
- Hey!
- How do you know about that?
'Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.'
- WHISPERING:
They know everything!
- 'Solved it, then?
'
I'm working on it.
'Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.'
- Pig!
- Keep trying.
'So, what about it, then?
'What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it?
'And what are you going to call this one?
'
Oh, the Ghost Driver.
- Don't give it a title.
- People like the titles.
- They hate the titles.
- Give the people what they want.
No, never do that - people are stupid.
Uh, some people.
'All people are stupid.
Most people.'
'Bizarre enough though, isn't it, to be him?
'
I mean, it's right up your strasse.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.
- Son.
- Son!
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.
If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.
Well, I believe that I can.
DISTORTED:
But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
Sherlock?
Mr Holmes?
Sorry, you were saying?
Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
I don't think we'll ever get over this.
No.
Shouldn't think so.
So sorry, will you excuse me a moment?
I just...
I'll...
I'll just, um...
Ahem.
- Now what's wrong?
- Not sure, I just...
By the pricking of my thumbs.
Seriously?
You?
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.
They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.
What is this?
Oh, it's a sort of shrine, I suppose, really.
Bit of a fan of Mrs T.
A big hero of mine when I was getting started.
Right, yes.
- Who?
- What?
- Who...?
Who was this?
- Are you serious?
- Sherlock...
- It's...
It's Margaret Thatcher, the first female Prime Minister of this country.
Right.
- Prime Minister?
Right.
- Leader of the Government.
- Female?
- For God's sake!
You know perfectly well who she is.
Why are you playing for time?
It's the gap, look at the gap.
It's wrong.
Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed.
The whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.
This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been in, this picture is straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.
- Something's missing from here, but only recently.
- Yes, a...
- Plaster bust... - plaster bust.
- Oh, for God's sake!
It got broken.
What the hell has this got to do with Charlie?
- Rug!
- What?
Well, how could it get broken?
The only place for it to fall is the floor and there is a big thick rug.
- Does it matter?
- Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.
- It is worth letting him do this.
- Is your friend quite mad?
No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
We found the remains out there in the porch.
- The porch where we came in?
- How anybody could hate her so much they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness...
I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.
Why didn't he smash all the others?
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.
Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.
- And if there's nothing...
- I know what happened to your son.
You do?
It's quite simple, superficial, to be blunt.
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness?
- Well, yes.
- And the porch where it was smashed,
I noticed the motion sensor was damaged,
- so I assume it's permanently lit.
- How did you notice that?
I lack the arrogance to ignore details.
I'm not the police.
- So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.
- Exactly.
- Why?
- Don't know.
Wouldn't be fun if I knew.
Mr Holmes, please!
It was your 50th birthday, Mr Welsborough, of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
- After all, he was in Tibet.
- Yes.
- No.
- No?
CROWD: ♪ Happy birthday... ♪
The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video.
Easily arranged.
It's a Skype call.
The trick was meant to be a surprise.
- A trick?
- Obviously.
Could you take a photo and send it?
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.
Well, good enough.
Effectively a costume.
You're joking?
No, I'm not.
All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
- Oh, my God!
- Surprise!
That's when it happened.
I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.
You said he'd felt unwell?
You all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
He died there and then.
No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained, in the driver's seat, hidden, until...
When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who'd been sitting there, quite dead, for a week.
Oh, God!
Poor kid.
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.
This is where it was smashed.
- That was amazing.
- What?
The car, the kid.
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?
I can't stand it, never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
What kind of a life would that be?
Besides, I have the strangest feeling...
Miss me?
- That's mine.
You two take a... bus.
- Why?
I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.
The Mall, please.
- I met her once.
- Thatcher?
Rather arrogant, I thought.
- You thought that?
!
- Ha, I know.
Why am I looking at this?
That's her, John and Mary's baby.
Oh, I see, yes.
Looks very... fully functioning.
Is that really the best you can do?
Sorry, I've never been very good with them.
- Babies?
- Humans.
Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?
Any interest in her?
Why on earth would he?
I don't know.
You tell me.
In the last year of his life,
James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over 70 assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias,
which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.
It's a pearl - get another one.
There's something important about this.
I'm sure.
Maybe it's Moriarty.
Maybe it's not.
[WATER SLOSHES]
But something's coming.
Are you having a premonition, brother mine?
The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other.
What we call premonition is just movement of the web.
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable.
As inevitable as mathematics.
Appointment In Samarra.
I'm sorry?
The merchant who can't outrun Death.
You always hated that story as a child.
Less keen on predestination back then.
I'm not sure I like it now.
You wrote your own version, as I remember.
Appointment In Sumatra.
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.
Goodnight, Mycroft.
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.
- Keep me informed.
- Of what?
Absolutely no idea.
'Ammo!
'
[MAN SHUDDERS]
- Oh, hi, Stella.
- Greg.
You, uh...?
- Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...
- Right, right, right...
Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?
It's nothing.
I mean it's nothing serious.
- No, no.
- I just pop round every now and again for a chat.
Yeah, of course.
I mean he loves a really tricky case.
Yeah, he does!
So what you here for?
Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so...
The Borgia Pearl?
They still after that, are they?
Yeah.
So, how did you two first meet?
Oh, well, there was a case about, um, ten years ago.
Nobody could figure it out.
There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.
- Oh, yeah?
How did she die?
- Hypothermia.
What?
I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...
Will you two please keep it down?
!
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?
You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.
I was a carpenter.
Like me dad.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
How the hell...?
Ah... e-cigarettes.
Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.
If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.
But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last.
Anything to add, John?
- John?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.
- What is that?
- That is... me.
Well, it's a me substitute.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You know I value your little contributions.
Yeah?
It's been there since nine this morning.
- Has it?
Where were you?
- Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.
What about my girlfriend?
- What?
- You said I had an ex...
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.
The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.
I...
I thought you'd done something clever.
Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?
[SHERLOCK INHALES DEEPLY]
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
What do you mean?
Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
- Well...
- You thought she was having an affair.
I'm afraid it's far worse than that, your wife is a spy.
- What?
- That's right.
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy, across the road from your flat.
Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy, as part of an official state visit.
As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.
This drug will render the President entirely susceptible to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty.
What?
Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III.
- Are you serious?
- No, of course not.
His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.
I don't!
- Just the bras.
- Get out.
So, what's this all about, then?
- Having fun.
- Fun?
- While I can.
- Mm-hmm.
[KNOCK AT DOOR]
- Uh, Sherlock...
- Borgia Pearl.
Boring.
Go!
- But...
- Go!
- This had better be good.
- Oh, I think you'll like it.
That is the bust, isn't it?
The one that was broken.
No, it's another one, different owner.
Different part of town.
You were right, this is a thing.
Something's going on.
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be pleased.
- I am pleased.
- You don't look pleased.
This is my game face.
And the game is on.
Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one.
- One belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan.
- Identical busts?
Yeah, and this one to a Dr Barnicot in Holborn.
Three in total.
God knows who'd want to do something like this.
Yeah, but some people have that complex, don't they?
An idee fixe.
They obsess over one thing and they can't let it go.
No, no good.
There were other images of Margaret...
Margaret...?
You know who she is.
...Thatcher, present at the first break-in.
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?
Ooh!
- What?
- Blood.
Quite a bit of it, too.
Was there any injury at the crime scene?
Nah.
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.
- Come on.
- Holborn?
Lambeth!
- Lambeth?
Why?
- To see Toby.
Ah, right.
Who?
- You'll see.
- Right, are you coming?
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.
- Who told you?
- The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.
- Have a good time.
- I will.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
- What?
- She's not the one.
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.
How do you work all that out?
She's got three children in Rio that he doesn't know about.
Are you just making this up?
- Possibly.
- Who's Toby?
There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker, one of the world's best.
Got himself into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago.
He hacked into the Pentagon security system, and I managed to get him off the charge.
Therefore he owes me a favour.
So, how does that help us?
- What?
- Toby the hacker?
- Toby's not the hacker.
- What?
- All right, Craig?
- All right, Sherlock?
Craig's got a dog.
So I see.
Good boy!
Hiya!
Mary?
What are you...?
No, we, we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case.
No, exactly.
So... don't wait up.
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Hey.
Mary, what are you doing here?
She's better at this than you.
- Better?
- So I texted her.
Hang on, Mary's better than me?
Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.
Of course she's better.
Yeah, OK.
Nothing personal.
What, so I'm supposed to just go home now, am I?
What do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?
- John or the dog?
- Ha-ha, that's funny!
- John.
- Well...
He's handy and loyal.
- That's hilarious.
- Is it too early for a divorce?
Oh.
Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge?
Keep up, he's fast.
- He's not moving.
- He's thinking.
He's really not moving.
Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.
You just like this dog, don't you?
- Well, I like you.
- He's still not moving.
- Fascinating.
- Oh!
[SHE CLEARS HER THROAT]
Well, what do you make of it?
- They were looking for something.
- Yes, but it wasn't a burglar, they came specifically for that Thatcher bust.
Why?
[DOG SNIFFS]
[DOG WHINES]
Clever.
Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail,
- where would you go?
- Like hiding a tree in a forest.
Or blood in a butcher's.
Never mind, Toby, better luck next time, hmm?
This is it, though.
This is the one, I can feel it.
Not Moriarty?
It has to be him.
It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.
It's designed to beguile me, tease me and lure me in.
At last, a noose for me to put my neck into.
You should have seen the state of the front room.
- It was like The Exorcist.
- Huh.
Was Rosie's head spinning round?
- No.
Just the projectile vomiting.
- Nice!
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
- Hmm?
Noticed what?
- The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
[BABY CRIES]
Yeah, can't she?
I'm coming, darling.
Mummy's coming.
LOVINGLY:
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here.
Have you heard of that thing?
In Germany?
You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.
Ostalgie.
People who missed the old days under the communists.
- People are weird, aren't they?
- Hmm.
According to this, there's quite a market for Cold War memorabilia.
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit?
Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.
Yes, fascinating.
Irrelevant.
Where exactly did they come from?
I've got into the records of the suppliers, Gelder and Co.
Seems they're from Georgia.
Where exactly?
Tbilisi.
Batch of six.
One to Welsborough.
One to Hassan.
One to Dr Barnicot.
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.
One to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.
Lestrade?
Another one?
- 'Yeah.'
- Harker or Sandeford?
Harker.
And it's murder this time.
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.
_
_
Defensive wounds on her face and hands, throat cut.
Sharp blade.
The same thing inside the house?
The bust?
- Two of them this time.
- Interesting.
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago.
- Limited edition of six.
- And now someone's wandering about destroying them all.
Makes no sense.
What's the point?
No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.
- Yes, it is.
- Well, it is, but it's not the point.
I've been slow, far too slow.
Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind...
Slow but lucky, very lucky.
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.
Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.
Congratulations, by the way.
- I'm sorry?
- Well, you're about to solve a big one.
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
- Yeah, until then, basically.
[WATER SPLASHING]
That's enough now, love.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.
And you need to get to bed.
Come on.
Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?
You were on the run.
Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying, it's clever.
Very clever.
But now you've met me and you're not so clever, are you?
Who are you?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.
Argh!
You're out of time.
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
- Who?
I know it's him.
It must be him.
You think you understand.
You understand nothing.
Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don't we just enjoy the moment?
Let me present Interpol's number one case.
Too tough for them, too boring for me.
The Black Pearl of the Borgias!
It's not possible!
How could she...?
!
Everything about who I was is on there.
The problems of your past are your business.
The problems of your future are my privilege.
I don't understand.
She...
She destroyed it.
She?
You know her!
You do, don't you?
You know the bitch?
!
She betrayed me.
Betrayed us all.
Mary.
This is about Mary?
Is that what she's calling herself now, eh?
- 'Armed police, you're surrounded!
'
- Give it to me.
YELLS:
Give it to me!
'Come out slowly, I want to see your hands above your head.'
Nobody shoots me!
Anyone shoots, I kill this man.
'Lay down your weapon.
Do it now!
'
I'm leaving this place.
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.
'Lay down your weapon.'
You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
Tell her she's a dead woman.
She's a dead woman walking.
She's my friend.
And she's under my protection.
Who are you?
I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.
Who's Sherlock Holmes?
Not a policeman.
[ALARM BLARES]
What do you think?
Mate in two?
Don't antagonise them, darling.
Oh, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.
Everything palls.
They'll send someone soon.
They?
Who are they?
Seems to me we put an awful lot of faith in they.
Well, I've got something they would dearly love, if only we could get out of here.
I've got Ammo.
Ammo?
- MARY:
Madame Ambassador.
- What took you so long?
- Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now!
Veer left!
[SCREAMING]
[HE LAUGHS]
What now?
What do we do?
We die.
Well?
He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.
- I very much doubt it.
- Why?
Because I think he used to work with Mary.
[GUNFIRE]
[SHOUTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE]
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out!
We'll come back later.
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the English woman?
What would you do to a traitor?
Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.
[HE CHUCKLES]
I am an idiot, I know nothing.
Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
That was quite a text you sent me.
What's going on, Sherlock?
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,
I couldn't see what was right under my nose.
Expected a pearl.
Oh, my God, that's a...
Yes, it's an AGRA.
Memory stick, like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.
Who?
I don't know.
We...
We all had one but the others were...
Haven't you even looked at it yet?
I glanced at it but I prefer
- to hear it from you.
- Why?
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.
There were four of us, agents.
Not just agents.
Polite term.
Alex.
Gabriel.
Me.
And Ajay.
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.
We all had one.
Each containing aliases, our background, everything.
We could never be betrayed, because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.
- Who employed you?
- Anyone who paid well.
I mean, we were at the top of our game for years.
And then it all ended.
There was a coup in Georgia.
The British Embassy in Tbilisi was taken over, lots of hostages.
We got the call to go in, get them out.
There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.
- Who from?
- I don't know, just another voice on the phone.
And a codeword.
- Ammo.
- Ammo?
Like ammunition.
We went in, but then something went wrong.
Something went really wrong.
[GUNFIRE, SCREAMING]
That was six years ago.
It feels like forever.
I was the only one that made it out.
No.
What?
I met someone tonight.
Same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.
What, he's alive?
Yeah, very much so.
I don't believe it, this is amazing!
I thought I was the only one,
I thought I was the only one who got out.
Where is he?
I need to see him, now!
Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?
Yeah, of course.
It was our insurance.
Above all, they mustn't fall into enemy hands.
So Ajay survived as well.
And now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide, with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why?
I don't know.
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
[SHE LAUGHS]
Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.
Families fall out.
The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
Well, he's just trying to find me.
He survived, that's all that matters!
I heard it from his own mouth.
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."
Why would he want to kill me?
- He said you betrayed him.
- Oh, no, no, that's insane.
Well, it's what he believes.
[SHE GASPS]
I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.
No, Mary...
You do.
I made a vow, remember?
To look after the three of you.
Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
There's something I think you should read.
What is it?
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.
What are you...?
[HE SNIFFS]
- Mary...
Oh, no!
- There you go.
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.
No.
You just look after them till I get back.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
[CHILD SINGS]
[HE GROANS]
Agra?
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
It is 378km west of the state capital, Lucknow.
What are you, Wikipedia?
- Yes.
- AGRA is an acronym.
Oh, good, I love an acronym.
All the best secret societies have them.
Team of agents, the best.
But you know all that.
Of course I do.
Go on.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.
Indeed?
Well, that's news to me.
Is it?
He's already killed looking for that memory stick.
AGRA always worked for the highest bidder,
I thought that might include you?
- Me?
- Well, I mean the British government, or whatever government you're currently propping up.
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.
They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong.
And that was that, we stopped using freelancers.
- Your initiative?
- My initiative.
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.
I don't like loose ends.
Not on my watch.
There was something else.
A detail.
A codeword.
Ammo?
It's all I've got.
Little enough.
Could you do some digging as a favour?
You don't have many favours left.
Then I'm calling them all in.
And if you can find who's after her and neutralise them, what then?
You think you can go on saving her forever?
Of course.
Is that sentiment talking?
No, it's me.
Difficult to tell the difference these days.
Told you, I made a promise.
A vow.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.
Not on my watch.
MARY: 'My darling, I need to tell you this because you mustn't hate me for going away.'
NEW YORK ACCENT:
Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.
- Can you hear a squeaking?
- No.
Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel.
Why Planes Fail.
- Did you see it?
Oh, truly terrifying.
- Can't say I did.
Swore I would never fly again, yet hear I am!
Everything OK, madam?
No.
No, no, it's not, but then what's the use in complaining?
I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off is all.
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.
Oh, OK.
Relax.
She said relax. [CHUCKLES]
Did you have a nice time in London?
It was OK, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun?
- Did you lose it in the war?
- [SHE LAUGHS]
'I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.
I'm not running, I promise you that,
I just need to do this in my own way.'
Oh, God!
I'm...
I-I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God!
[FLIGHT ATTENDANT BUTTON BEEPS]
- Everything OK, madam?
- I think I'm dying.
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.
God will smile on you.
'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,
I'm sorry, my love.'
I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.
Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of a dice.
I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
I swear I will.'
[LAUGHTER]
Not like this one.
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in!
I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.
Mr Baker.
Well, that completes the set.
- No, it does not.
- Well, who else am I missing?
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?
Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.
Oh, hi, Mary.
What concept?
Happy families.
Nice trip?
- How the f...?
- Please, Mary, there is a child present.
- How did you get in here?
- Karim let me in.
Hello.
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Nice to meet you, missus.
No, I mean how did you find me?
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
No, really, though, how?
Every movement I made was entirely random, every new personality just on the roll of a dice!
Mary, no human action is ever truly random.
An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability, mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual, can reduce the number of variables considerably.
I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine a seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.
But they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.
[HE CHUCKLES]
JOKINGLY:
Oh, you bastard!
- ANGRILY:
You bastard!
- I know, but your face!
"The mathematics of probability"?
- You believed that.
- "Feasible variables"?
Yes, I started to run out about then.
In the memory stick!
Yeah, that was my idea.
- AGRA?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
You said it was your initials.
In a way that was true.
In a way?
So many lies.
I'm so sorry.
And I don't just mean you.
What?
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...
You're R?
Rosamund?
Rosamund Mary.
I always liked Mary.
Yeah, me too.
I used to.
I just...
I didn't know what else to do.
You could have stayed, you could have talked to me.
That's what couples are supposed to do.
Work things through.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Mary, I may not be a very good man but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for,
- most of the time.
- All the time.
You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.
You never judge, you never complain.
I don't deserve you, I...
All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
I will keep you safe.
But it has to be in London.
It's my city, I know the turf.
Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.
Get down!
[RAPID GUNFIRE]
Hello again.
- Ajay?
- Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.
Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.
I thought I was the only one who got out.
How did you find us?
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.
You found her but I found you.
So perhaps not so clever.
And now here we are.
At last.
[HE CHUCKLES] Touche!
Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
She thought I was dead.
I might as well have been.
It was always just the four of us, always, remember?
Oh, yeah.
So why do you want to kill me?
Do you know how long they kept me prisoner?
What they did to me?
They tortured Alex to death.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.
But you?
You, where were you?
That day at the embassy, I escaped.
Ha!
But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
Where were you?
Oh, I got out.
For a while.
Long enough to hide my memory stick.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.
I was loyal, you see.
Loyal to my friends.
But they took me, tortured me.
Not for information.
Not for anything except fun.
They thought I'd give in, die, but I didn't, I lived.
And eventually, they forgot about me rotting in a cell somewhere.
Six years they kept me there.
Until one day I saw my chance.
Oh, and I made them pay.
You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.
Little whispers.
Laughter.
Gossip.
How the clever agents had been betrayed.
Brought down by you!
- Me?
- [TRAIN WHISTLES]
You know I'll kill you too.
You know I will, Ajay.
What, you think I care if I die?
I've dreamed of killing you every night for six years.
Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.
I swear to you, Ajay.
What did you hear, Ajay?
When you were a prisoner, what exactly did you hear?
What did I hear?
Ammo.
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo."
We were betrayed!
- And they said it was her?
- That you betrayed us!
They said her name?
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.
No!
No!
'The English woman, that's all he heard.
Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.'
Couldn't this wait until you're back?
No, it's not over.
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed, the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.
There was only a voice on the phone.
'Remember?
And a codeword.'
"Ammo," yes, you said.
How's your Latin, brother dear?
My Latin?
Amo, amas, amat.
I love, you love, he loves.
What...?
Not "Ammo" as in ammunition, but "Amo", meaning?
You'd better be right, Sherlock.
Bloody thing!
What's going on?
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.
What?
'So many lies.
And I don't just mean you.'
- Hello.
- Ah, hello.
- I like your daisy.
- Thank you, yeah.
It's not really me, though, I think.
- No?
- No, no, it's too floral for me.
I'm more of a "knackered with weary old eyes" kind of guy.
Well, I think they're nice.
Nice eyes.
- [HE LAUGHS] Thank you.
- Look...
Look...
I don't normally do this,
- but, um...
- But you're going to.
Yeah.
- What's this?
- This is me.
- Thank you.
Cheers.
- Yeah.
Great.
- Bye!
- Bye.
[HE CHUCKLES]

[PHONE BEEPS]
_
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
Hmm?
Noticed what?
The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
[BABY CRIES]
- Yeah, can't she?
- Hmm.
I'm coming darling.
I'm coming.
[PHONE BEEPS]
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
- _
- Come here...
It's OK.
_
- _
- Do you want a cuddle?
[BABY CONTINUES TO WAIL]
_
I know.
- Oh, sweetheart.
- _
_
Ssh.
Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you?
_
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?
Oh, let's go and see Daddy!
Daddy's here.
It's OK, Rosie.
I'll take her.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I may as well get up now.
Hey, baby, it's Daddy.
Your daddy.
Come here, Rose.
Come here, darling, it's all right.
Thank you.
_
_
This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.
How many more times?
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.
And you're basing all this on a code name?
On a whispered voice on the telephone?
Come on, Mycroft.
You were the conduit for AGRA.
Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
It was my job.
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
AGRA went in.
- Yes.
- And they were betrayed.
Not by me.
Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.
I promise you,
I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.
You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.
Not one.
Not.
One.
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories?
I'd like to do those.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.
Although she does seem to enjoy them.
Well, I'll have to give that a go.
Got a lot to catch up on.
AJAY: 'You think you understand.
You understand nothing.'
MYCROFT: 'Code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love.'
MARY: 'You'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.
'They know everything.'
'They said it was the English woman.'
'Don't minute any of this.'
'They know everything.'
- You don't make it easy, do you?
- What do you mean?
Well, being... being so perfect.
Mary, I...
I need to tell you...
- [PHONE BEEPS]
- Hang on.
Can you tell me later?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Great.
Well, no, we can't just go.
- Rosie.
- Yeah.
- Er, you go.
- No!
I'll come as soon as I've found someone.
Mrs Hudson.
- Corfu till Saturday.
Molly?
- Er, yeah, I'll try.
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.
You know that's not going to happen.
If there's more to this case, you need to see it.
Yeah, OK, you win.
'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes.
'Please make your way to the exit.
Thank you.'
Your office said I'd find you here.
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.
We're like them.
Ghostly, living in the shadows.
Predatory?
Well, it depends which side you're on.
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.
Nice location for the final act, couldn't have chosen it better myself.
But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.
I just come here to look at the fish.
I knew this would happen one day.
- It's like that old story.
- I really am a very busy man.
Would you mind cutting to the chase?
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
With good reason.
"There was once a merchant, in a famous market in Baghdad."
I really have never liked this story.
I'm just like the merchant in the story,
I thought I could out-run the inevitable.
I've always been looking over my shoulder, always expecting to see the grim figure of...
Death.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hey.
- John?
- On his way.
Let me introduce Ammo.
You were Ammo?
You were the person on the phone that time?
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
Why did you betray us?
Why does anyone do anything?
- Hmm.
- Let me guess, selling secrets?
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.
Worked very well for a few years.
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it.
But...
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.
[SHE CHUCKLES] I couldn't believe my luck!
That bought me a little time.
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
Very handy.
They were always such reliable killers.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.
Lady Smallwood gave the order.
But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.
Seemed to do the trick.
And you thought your troubles were over.
I was tired.
Tired of the mess of it all.
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.
The hostages were killed.
AGRA too.
Or so I thought.
My secret was safe.
But... apparently not.
Just a little peace.
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
A family?
Home?
Really, I understand.
So, just let me get out of here, right?
Let me just walk away.
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.
What do you say?
After what you did?
!
Mary, no!
OK.
London Aquarium.
Yes, now.
I was never a field agent.
I always thought I'd be rather good.
[MARY SCOFFS]
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
Thanks.
- For a secretary.
- What?
It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
- I didn't do this out of jealousy.
- No?
Same old drudge, day in, day out.
Never getting out there where all the excitement was.
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.
Yes, your little flat.
- How do you know?
- Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?
And what are you, widowed or divorced?
Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.
That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.
- Sherlock...
- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.
A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.
- Sherlock, don't.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.
There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
That accounts for the drink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.
So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.
To prove how good you are.
To make up for the inadequacies of your...
little life.
Well, Mrs Norbury,
I must admit this is unexpected.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.
All except Sherlock Holmes.
There's no way out.
So it would seem.
You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.
It's what I do.
Maybe I can still surprise you.
Now, come on, be sensible.
Hmm, no, I don't think so.
Ah!
Surprise!
[MARY GASPS FOR AIR]
[MARY GROANS]
Everything's fine.
It's going to be OK.
Get an ambulance!
It's all right, it's all right.
- Mary!
- John.
All right, Mary?
Mary?
Stay with me, stay with me.
- Oh, come on...
- No, don't worry.
Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
Come on, Mary.
Mary?
Oh, God.
John, I think this is it.
No, no, no, no.
It's not.
- That's...
- You made me so happy.
You gave me everything I could ever, ever have wanted...
Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.
- Look after Rosie.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.
- Promise me.
- I promise.
- No...
- Yes, I promise.
- Promise me!
- I promise, I promise.
Ssh, ssh.
Hey, Sherlock.
Yes.
I... so like you.
Did I ever say?
Yes, yes, you did.
I'm sorry for... for shooting you that time.
I'm really sorry.
It's all right.
I think we're even now, OK?
OK.
- Oh, I think we're...
- Mary, Mary...
- ...even, definitely even.
- Ssh, ssh.
You were my whole world.
Being Mary Watson was the only life worth living.
- Mary...
- Thank you.
Mary...
[HE BEWAILS]
Don't you dare!
You made a vow.
You swore it.
[PHONE BEEPS REPEATEDLY]
'You've been having dreams.
A recurring dream?
'
[CLOCK TICKS RHYTHMICALLY]
Do you want to talk about it?
This is a two-way relationship, you know.
[SHE SIGHS]
The whole world has come crashing down around you.
Everything's hopeless.
Irretrievable.
I know that's what you must feel but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
That's not really my style.
I need to know what to do.
Do?
About John.
[BACK CRACKS, HE GROANS]
Put me through to Sherrinford, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
SOBS:
But nothing will ever be the same again, will it?
I'm afraid it won't.
We'll have to rally round, I expect, do our bit.
Look after little Rosie.
I'm just going to, um look through these things.
There might be a case.
A case?
Oh, you're not up to it, are you?
Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.
Yes.
Yes, I expect you're right.
I'll make some tea, shall I?
- Mrs Hudson?
- Yes, Sherlock?
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident...
- Yes?
- ...would you just say the word Norbury to me?
Would you?
Norbury?
Just that.
I'd be very grateful.
What's this?
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.
Oh, God!
Is that...?
- Must be.
- Oh.
I knew it wouldn't end like this.
I knew Moriarty made plans.
'I thought that would get your attention.
So, this is in case...
In case the day comes.
If you are watching this, I'm probably dead.
I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows?
Nothing's certain, nothing's written.
My old life it was full of consequences.
The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.
You need to remember that.
So I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
Might be the hardest case of your career.
When I'm... gone, if I'm gone I need you to do something for me.'
- [BABY GURGLES]
- Hi.
I just wondered how things were going and if there was anything I could do.
It's, er, it's from John.
- Right.
- You don't need to read it now.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.
He says...
John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...
Yes?
He said he'd that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Anyone.
[DOOR CLOSES]
'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
When I'm gone, if I'm... gone I need you to do something for me.
Save John Watson.
Save him, Sherlock.
Save him.'
'When does the path we walk on lock around our feet?
When does the road become a river with only one destination?
'
'Death waits for us all in Samarra.
But can Samarra be avoided?
'
Go to hell, Sherlock!
- _
- My brother is a murderer.
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.
Oh, do your research.
I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Merry Christmas!
I'm not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.
You know what happened to the other one.
Miss me?
'Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
'
I've only been gone four minutes.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Is that quite clear?
Don't minute any of this.
Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.
A D notice has been slapped on the entire incident.
Only those within this room, code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love, will ever know the whole truth.
As far as everyone else is concerned, going to the Prime Minister and way beyond, Charles Augustus...
- Are you tweeting?
!
- No.
Well, that's what it looks like!
Of course I'm not tweeting.
Why would I be tweeting?
- Give me that!
- What?
No!
What are you doing?
!
- Get off!
- Give it here!
- "Back on terra firma."
- Don't read them out.
- "Free as a bird."
- God, you're such a spoilsport.
Will you take this matter seriously, Sherlock?
I am!
What makes you think I'm not taking it seriously?
"#OhWhatABeautifulMorning"
Look, not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death - my death!
And now I'm back, in a nice warm office, with my big brother and...
Are those ginger nuts?
- Oh, God...
- Love ginger nuts.
Our doctor said you were clean.
I am.
Utterly.
No need for stimulants now, remember?
I have work to do.
You're high as a kite!
Natural high, I assure you.
Totally natural.
I'm just... ♪ ..glad to be alive!
♪
What shall we do next?
What's your name?
Vivian.
- What would you do, Vivian?
- Pardon?
Well, it's a lovely day.
Go for a stroll?
Make a paper aeroplane?
Have an ice lolly?
Ice lolly, I suppose.
Ice lolly it is!
- What's your favourite?
- Well, really, I shouldn't...
- Go on.
- Do they still do Mivvies?
- Mr Holmes...
- Yes?
- ...we do need to get on.
- Yes, of course.
'Do your research.
'I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
..sociopath.
I see.
Who is supposed to have shot him, then?
Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger - that's who.
- That's not what happened at all.
- It is now.
Remarkable.
How did you do it?
We have some very talented people working here.
If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.
That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.
No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.
You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.
You're home and dry.
OK, cheers.
Obviously, there's unfinished business.
Moriarty.
I told you
- Moriarty's dead.
You say he filmed that video message before he died.
Yes.
You also say you know what he's going to do next.
- What does that mean?
- Perhaps that's all there is to it.
Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
No, no, he would never be that disappointing.
He's planned something, something long-term.
Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.
Posthumous revenge.
No, better than that - posthumous game.
We brought you back to deal with this.
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.
Wait?
!
Of course wait.
I'm the target - targets wait.
Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up,
I'll know when it begins.
I always know when the game is on.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because I love it.
There was once a merchant, in the famous market at Baghdad.
One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise, and he knew that the stranger was Death.
Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles, to the city of Samarra.
For there he was sure Death could not find him.
But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.
"Very well," said the merchant.
"I give in.
I am yours."
"But tell me, why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"
"Because," said Death,
"I had an appointment with you tonight... ..in Samarra."
If this gets any better, I'm going to get two knives.
Pays to advertise.
- So, what about Moriarty, then?
- Oh, I have a plan.
I'm going to monitor the underworld, every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
So, basically, your plan is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do?
Awesome, isn't it?
He drowned, Mr Holmes.
That's what we thought.
- But when they opened up his lungs...
- Yes?
..sand.
Superficial.
Come back!
It's the wrong thumb.
_
Sherlock...
It's never twins.
Hopkins, arrest Wilson.
Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.
- 'Wilson?
' 'Lymph nodes?
'
- Sherlock...
Yes, you may have nothing but a limbless torso, but there'll be traces of ink in the lymph nodes under the armpits.
If your mystery corpse had tattoos, the signs will be there.
- 'Bloody hell!
Is that a guess?
'
- I never guess.
- Sherlock...
- 'So, he's the killer?
The canary trainer?
'
- Of course he's the killer.
- 'Didn't see that coming.'
Hm, naturally.
Sherlock, you can't go on spinning plates like this.
That's it!
The place was spinning.
The heart medication you're taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.
Yes, I...
I think so.
Why?
Because the fingerprints on your brother's neck were your own.
- A jellyfish?
- I know.
You can't arrest a jellyfish.
- You could try.
- We did try.
Oh...
- Oh, God.
- Mary?
59 missed calls.
We're in a lot of trouble.
Ow!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Relax, it's got two syllables...
I'm a nurse, darling - I think I know what to do!
- Come on, then...
- Re!
Lax!
No, just drive, please, God, just drive!
God, drive!
Sherlock
- Mary!
That's it, Mary - re...
- Don't you start!
- ...
lax.
John, John...
I think you have to pull over!
- Mary, Mary...
- Pull over!
Oh, my God!
Has that come out?
They never come out when I take them.
Let's have a look.
Aw, she's so beautiful.
- Have another go.
- What about a name?
- Catherine.
- Uh, yeah, we've gone off that.
Have we?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Well, you know what I think...
- It's not a girl's name.
Molly, Mrs H, we would love you to be godparents.
- Oh!
Really?
- If you...
That's so lovely.
And, uh... you too, Sherlock?
- You too what?
- Godfather, we'd like you to be godfather.
God is a ludicrous fiction, dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.
Yeah, but there'll be cake.
Will you do it?
I'll get back to you.
Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.
In Christ's name.
Now, what name have you given your daughter?
Rosamund Mary.
Rosamund?
It means "Rose of the world".
Rosie for short.
Didn't you get John's text?
No.
I delete his texts.
I delete any text that begins "Hi."
No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.
Sorry.
Phone!
And now, godparents, are you ready to help the parents of this child in their duties as Christian parents?
We are.
'Sorry, I didn't catch that.
'Please repeat the question.'
As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.
To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
Hard logic versus romantic whimsy - that is your choice.
You fail to connect actions to their consequences.
Now, for the last time, if you want to keep the rattle, do not throw the rattle.
All right, good girl, good girl.
Good girl.
I'd better finish this, hadn't I?
- Hey.
- Afternoon.
He says you've got a good one, Greg?
Oh, yeah.
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.
God, 50!
Where does it go?
I know for a fact I was only 21 this time last week.
Yeah, well that's impossible.
That was before you met me.
- Well, no, no, there never was...
- "There never was such a time."
She's looking at me disapprovingly again.
No.
She's just jealous.
Yeah, well, I think we both are.
- Oh...
- No, no, David.
- Come on, you promised.
- No, it's...
Oh, no...
Oh, it's a Skype call.
Oh!
Then it must be Charlie.
At least he's phoning, I suppose.
Oh, look!
Hello!
'Hey, Dad.
Happy birthday.
Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?
'
No!
Picture's frozen!
'Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you.'
Why is it rubbish?
Where are you?
How is he?
Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.
David?
Come on!
OK, no, hang on a sec, I'll find somewhere quieter.
So, Charlie, where are you?
Are you there?
- 'Sorry, I'm here.
I'm just a bit...'
- Are you all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
Altitude?
'I'm in Tibet.
Didn't you see the mountains?
'
Never mind mountains.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.
- 'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?
'
- What?
'Could you just check something on my car?
'
Your car?
'To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe
I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet.
- 'Could you take a photo and send it?
'
- Uh, yes, I can do that.
All done.
Have you got it?
Charlie?
A week later...
Yeah?
...something really weird happens.
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed, the cops are chasing him, and he turns into the drive of the Welsborough house to try and get away.
Unfortunately...
The drunk guy survived, they managed to pull him out, but when they put the fire out and examined the parked car...
Whose body?
Charlie Welsborough, the son.
- What?
- The son who was in Tibet.
DNA all checks out.
Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.
- Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
- Have you got a lab report?
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.
- The seats?
- Yes, the car seats.
Made of vinyl.
Two different types of vinyl present.
Was it his own car?
Yeah, not flash - he was a student.
- Well, that's suggestive.
- Why?
- Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
- Yeah, right?
- There's something else.
- Yes?
According to this,
Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.
What?
The body in the car, dead for a week.
Oh, this is a good one.
Is it my birthday?
You want help?
- Yes, please.
OK.
- One condition.
Take all the credit.
It gets boring if I just solve them all.
Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.
He's got a point.
Which makes me look like some kind of prima donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do!
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.
- Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
- Definitely a sore spot.
So you take all the glory, thanks...
- OK!
- ...thanks all the same.
Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?
It's driving me nuts.
Anything you say, Giles.
Just kidding.
What's his name?
Greg.
What?
Greg.
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?
Not a clue.
It's just you normally say that at this point.
Hmm.
Well, then, let's hope you solve your little problem, Greg.
- Hear that?
- I know.
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood?
- Oh, good, great.
Yeah, amazing.
- Getting any sleep?
- Christ, no.
You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.
- Must feel very different...
- Sorry, what?
Yes, well, you know how it is.
All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.
- Are you two having a little joke?
- Never a word of thanks.
Can't even tell people's faces apart.
This is a joke, isn't it?
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever.
You're so, so clever."
- Is it about me?
- I think he needs winding.
You know, I think that really might be it.
No, don't get it.
Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect, so go easy on them, yeah?
- You know me.
- 'Hey, hello.'
Yeah.
Got them, don't worry.
Pampers, the cream you can't get from Boots.
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now?
- At the dead boy's house?
- Yeah.
'And what does he think?
Any theories?
'
Well, I texted you the details.
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.
- Hey!
- How do you know about that?
'Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.'
- They know everything!
- 'Solved it, then?
'
I'm working on it.
'Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.'
- Pig!
- Keep trying.
'So, what about it, then?
'What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it?
'And what are you going to call this one?
'
Oh, the Ghost Driver.
- Don't give it a title.
- People like the titles.
- They hate the titles.
- Give the people what they want.
No, never do that - people are stupid.
Uh, some people.
'All people are stupid.
Most people.'
'Bizarre enough though, isn't it, to be him?
'
I mean, it's right up your strasse.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.
- Son.
- Son!
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.
If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.
Well, I believe that I can.
But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
Sherlock?
Mr Holmes?
Sorry, you were saying?
Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
I don't think we'll ever get over this.
No.
Shouldn't think so.
So sorry, will you excuse me a moment?
I just...
I'll...
I'll just, um...
Ahem.
- Now what's wrong?
- Not sure, I just...
By the pricking of my thumbs.
Seriously?
You?
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.
They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.
What is this?
Oh, it's a sort of shrine, I suppose, really.
Bit of a fan of Mrs T.
A big hero of mine when I was getting started.
Right, yes.
- Who?
- What?
- Who...?
Who was this?
- Are you serious?
- Sherlock...
- It's...
It's Margaret Thatcher, the first female Prime Minister of this country.
Right.
- Prime Minister?
Right.
- Leader of the Government.
- Female?
- For God's sake!
You know perfectly well who she is.
Why are you playing for time?
It's the gap, look at the gap.
It's wrong.
Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed.
The whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.
This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been in, this picture is straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.
- Something's missing from here, but only recently.
- Yes, a...
- Plaster bust... - plaster bust.
- Oh, for God's sake!
It got broken.
What the hell has this got to do with Charlie?
- Rug!
- What?
Well, how could it get broken?
The only place for it to fall is the floor and there is a big thick rug.
- Does it matter?
- Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.
- It is worth letting him do this.
- Is your friend quite mad?
No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
We found the remains out there in the porch.
- The porch where we came in?
- How anybody could hate her so much they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness...
I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.
Why didn't he smash all the others?
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.
Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.
- And if there's nothing...
- I know what happened to your son.
You do?
It's quite simple, superficial, to be blunt.
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness?
- Well, yes.
- And the porch where it was smashed,
I noticed the motion sensor was damaged,
- so I assume it's permanently lit.
- How did you notice that?
I lack the arrogance to ignore details.
I'm not the police.
- So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.
- Exactly.
- Why?
- Don't know.
Wouldn't be fun if I knew.
Mr Holmes, please!
It was your 50th birthday, Mr Welsborough, of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
- After all, he was in Tibet.
- Yes.
- No.
- No?
♪ Happy birthday... ♪
The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video.
Easily arranged.
It's a Skype call.
The trick was meant to be a surprise.
- A trick?
- Obviously.
Could you take a photo and send it?
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.
Well, good enough.
Effectively a costume.
You're joking?
No, I'm not.
All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
- Oh, my God!
- Surprise!
That's when it happened.
I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.
You said he'd felt unwell?
You all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
He died there and then.
No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained, in the driver's seat, hidden, until...
When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who'd been sitting there, quite dead, for a week.
Oh, God!
Poor kid.
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.
This is where it was smashed.
- That was amazing.
- What?
The car, the kid.
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?
I can't stand it, never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
What kind of a life would that be?
Besides, I have the strangest feeling...
Miss me?
- That's mine.
You two take a... bus.
- Why?
I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.
The Mall, please.
- I met her once.
- Thatcher?
Rather arrogant, I thought.
- You thought that?
!
- Ha, I know.
Why am I looking at this?
That's her, John and Mary's baby.
Oh, I see, yes.
Looks very... fully functioning.
Is that really the best you can do?
Sorry, I've never been very good with them.
- Babies?
- Humans.
Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?
Any interest in her?
Why on earth would he?
I don't know.
You tell me.
In the last year of his life,
James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over 70 assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias,
which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.
It's a pearl - get another one.
There's something important about this.
I'm sure.
Maybe it's Moriarty.
Maybe it's not.
But something's coming.
Are you having a premonition, brother mine?
The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other.
What we call premonition is just movement of the web.
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable.
As inevitable as mathematics.
Appointment In Samarra.
I'm sorry?
The merchant who can't outrun Death.
You always hated that story as a child.
Less keen on predestination back then.
I'm not sure I like it now.
You wrote your own version, as I remember.
Appointment In Sumatra.
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.
Goodnight, Mycroft.
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.
- Keep me informed.
- Of what?
Absolutely no idea.
'Ammo!
'
- Oh, hi, Stella.
- Greg.
You, uh...?
- Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...
- Right, right, right...
Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?
It's nothing.
I mean it's nothing serious.
- No, no.
- I just pop round every now and again for a chat.
Yeah, of course.
I mean he loves a really tricky case.
Yeah, he does!
So what you here for?
Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so...
The Borgia Pearl?
They still after that, are they?
Yeah.
So, how did you two first meet?
Oh, well, there was a case about, um, ten years ago.
Nobody could figure it out.
There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.
- Oh, yeah?
How did she die?
- Hypothermia.
What?
I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...
Will you two please keep it down?
!
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?
You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.
I was a carpenter.
Like me dad.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
How the hell...?
Ah... e-cigarettes.
Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.
If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.
But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last.
Anything to add, John?
- John?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.
- What is that?
- That is... me.
Well, it's a me substitute.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You know I value your little contributions.
Yeah?
It's been there since nine this morning.
- Has it?
Where were you?
- Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.
What about my girlfriend?
- What?
- You said I had an ex...
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.
The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.
I...
I thought you'd done something clever.
Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
What do you mean?
Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
- Well...
- You thought she was having an affair.
I'm afraid it's far worse than that, your wife is a spy.
- What?
- That's right.
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy, across the road from your flat.
Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy, as part of an official state visit.
As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.
This drug will render the President entirely susceptible to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty.
What?
Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III.
- Are you serious?
- No, of course not.
His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.
I don't!
- Just the bras.
- Get out.
So, what's this all about, then?
- Having fun.
- Fun?
- While I can.
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, Sherlock...
- Borgia Pearl.
Boring.
Go!
- But...
- Go!
- This had better be good.
- Oh, I think you'll like it.
That is the bust, isn't it?
The one that was broken.
No, it's another one, different owner.
Different part of town.
You were right, this is a thing.
Something's going on.
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be pleased.
- I am pleased.
- You don't look pleased.
This is my game face.
And the game is on.
Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one.
- One belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan.
- Identical busts?
Yeah, and this one to a Dr Barnicot in Holborn.
Three in total.
God knows who'd want to do something like this.
Yeah, but some people have that complex, don't they?
An idee fixe.
They obsess over one thing and they can't let it go.
No, no good.
There were other images of Margaret...
Margaret...?
You know who she is.
...Thatcher, present at the first break-in.
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?
Ooh!
- What?
- Blood.
Quite a bit of it, too.
Was there any injury at the crime scene?
Nah.
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.
- Come on.
- Holborn?
Lambeth!
- Lambeth?
Why?
- To see Toby.
Ah, right.
Who?
- You'll see.
- Right, are you coming?
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.
- Who told you?
- The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.
- Have a good time.
- I will.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
- What?
- She's not the one.
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.
How do you work all that out?
She's got three children in Rio that he doesn't know about.
Are you just making this up?
- Possibly.
- Who's Toby?
There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker, one of the world's best.
Got himself into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago.
He hacked into the Pentagon security system, and I managed to get him off the charge.
Therefore he owes me a favour.
So, how does that help us?
- What?
- Toby the hacker?
- Toby's not the hacker.
- What?
- All right, Craig?
- All right, Sherlock?
Craig's got a dog.
So I see.
Good boy!
Hiya!
Mary?
What are you...?
No, we, we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case.
No, exactly.
So... don't wait up.
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Hey.
Mary, what are you doing here?
She's better at this than you.
- Better?
- So I texted her.
Hang on, Mary's better than me?
Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.
Of course she's better.
Yeah, OK.
Nothing personal.
What, so I'm supposed to just go home now, am I?
What do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?
- John or the dog?
- Ha-ha, that's funny!
- John.
- Well...
He's handy and loyal.
- That's hilarious.
- Is it too early for a divorce?
Oh.
Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge?
Keep up, he's fast.
- He's not moving.
- He's thinking.
He's really not moving.
Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.
You just like this dog, don't you?
- Well, I like you.
- He's still not moving.
- Fascinating.
- Oh!
Well, what do you make of it?
- They were looking for something.
- Yes, but it wasn't a burglar, they came specifically for that Thatcher bust.
Why?
Clever.
Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail,
- where would you go?
- Like hiding a tree in a forest.
Or blood in a butcher's.
Never mind, Toby, better luck next time, hmm?
This is it, though.
This is the one, I can feel it.
Not Moriarty?
It has to be him.
It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.
It's designed to beguile me, tease me and lure me in.
At last, a noose for me to put my neck into.
You should have seen the state of the front room.
- It was like The Exorcist.
- Huh.
Was Rosie's head spinning round?
- No.
Just the projectile vomiting.
- Nice!
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
- Hmm?
Noticed what?
- The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
Yeah, can't she?
I'm coming, darling.
Mummy's coming.
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here.
Have you heard of that thing?
In Germany?
You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.
Ostalgie.
People who missed the old days under the communists.
- People are weird, aren't they?
- Hmm.
According to this, there's quite a market for Cold War memorabilia.
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit?
Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.
Yes, fascinating.
Irrelevant.
Where exactly did they come from?
I've got into the records of the suppliers, Gelder and Co.
Seems they're from Georgia.
Where exactly?
Tbilisi.
Batch of six.
One to Welsborough.
One to Hassan.
One to Dr Barnicot.
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.
One to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.
Lestrade?
Another one?
- 'Yeah.'
- Harker or Sandeford?
Harker.
And it's murder this time.
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.
_
_
Defensive wounds on her face and hands, throat cut.
Sharp blade.
The same thing inside the house?
The bust?
- Two of them this time.
- Interesting.
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago.
- Limited edition of six.
- And now someone's wandering about destroying them all.
Makes no sense.
What's the point?
No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.
- Yes, it is.
- Well, it is, but it's not the point.
I've been slow, far too slow.
Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind...
Slow but lucky, very lucky.
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.
Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.
Congratulations, by the way.
- I'm sorry?
- Well, you're about to solve a big one.
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
- Yeah, until then, basically.
That's enough now, love.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.
And you need to get to bed.
Come on.
Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?
You were on the run.
Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying, it's clever.
Very clever.
But now you've met me and you're not so clever, are you?
Who are you?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.
Argh!
You're out of time.
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
- Who?
I know it's him.
It must be him.
You think you understand.
You understand nothing.
Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don't we just enjoy the moment?
Let me present Interpol's number one case.
Too tough for them, too boring for me.
The Black Pearl of the Borgias!
It's not possible!
How could she...?
!
Everything about who I was is on there.
The problems of your past are your business.
The problems of your future are my privilege.
I don't understand.
She...
She destroyed it.
She?
You know her!
You do, don't you?
You know the bitch?
!
She betrayed me.
Betrayed us all.
Mary.
This is about Mary?
Is that what she's calling herself now, eh?
- 'Armed police, you're surrounded!
'
- Give it to me.
Give it to me!
'Come out slowly, I want to see your hands above your head.'
Nobody shoots me!
Anyone shoots, I kill this man.
'Lay down your weapon.
Do it now!
'
I'm leaving this place.
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.
'Lay down your weapon.'
You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
Tell her she's a dead woman.
She's a dead woman walking.
She's my friend.
And she's under my protection.
Who are you?
I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.
Who's Sherlock Holmes?
Not a policeman.
What do you think?
Mate in two?
Don't antagonise them, darling.
Oh, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.
Everything palls.
They'll send someone soon.
They?
Who are they?
Seems to me we put an awful lot of faith in they.
Well, I've got something they would dearly love, if only we could get out of here.
I've got Ammo.
Ammo?
- Madame Ambassador.
- What took you so long?
- Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now!
Veer left!
What now?
What do we do?
We die.
Well?
He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.
- I very much doubt it.
- Why?
Because I think he used to work with Mary.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out!
We'll come back later.
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the English woman?
What would you do to a traitor?
Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.
I am an idiot, I know nothing.
Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
That was quite a text you sent me.
What's going on, Sherlock?
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,
I couldn't see what was right under my nose.
Expected a pearl.
Oh, my God, that's a...
Yes, it's an AGRA.
Memory stick, like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.
Who?
I don't know.
We...
We all had one but the others were...
Haven't you even looked at it yet?
I glanced at it but I prefer
- to hear it from you.
- Why?
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.
There were four of us, agents.
Not just agents.
Polite term.
Alex.
Gabriel.
Me.
And Ajay.
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.
We all had one.
Each containing aliases, our background, everything.
We could never be betrayed, because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.
- Who employed you?
- Anyone who paid well.
I mean, we were at the top of our game for years.
And then it all ended.
There was a coup in Georgia.
The British Embassy in Tbilisi was taken over, lots of hostages.
We got the call to go in, get them out.
There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.
- Who from?
- I don't know, just another voice on the phone.
And a codeword.
- Ammo.
- Ammo?
Like ammunition.
We went in, but then something went wrong.
Something went really wrong.
That was six years ago.
It feels like forever.
I was the only one that made it out.
No.
What?
I met someone tonight.
Same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.
What, he's alive?
Yeah, very much so.
I don't believe it, this is amazing!
I thought I was the only one,
I thought I was the only one who got out.
Where is he?
I need to see him, now!
Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?
Yeah, of course.
It was our insurance.
Above all, they mustn't fall into enemy hands.
So Ajay survived as well.
And now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide, with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why?
I don't know.
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.
Families fall out.
The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
Well, he's just trying to find me.
He survived, that's all that matters!
I heard it from his own mouth.
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."
Why would he want to kill me?
- He said you betrayed him.
- Oh, no, no, that's insane.
Well, it's what he believes.
I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.
No, Mary...
You do.
I made a vow, remember?
To look after the three of you.
Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
There's something I think you should read.
What is it?
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.
What are you...?
- Mary...
Oh, no!
- There you go.
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.
No.
You just look after them till I get back.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Agra?
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
It is 378km west of the state capital, Lucknow.
What are you, Wikipedia?
- Yes.
- AGRA is an acronym.
Oh, good, I love an acronym.
All the best secret societies have them.
Team of agents, the best.
But you know all that.
Of course I do.
Go on.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.
Indeed?
Well, that's news to me.
Is it?
He's already killed looking for that memory stick.
AGRA always worked for the highest bidder,
I thought that might include you?
- Me?
- Well, I mean the British government, or whatever government you're currently propping up.
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.
They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong.
And that was that, we stopped using freelancers.
- Your initiative?
- My initiative.
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.
I don't like loose ends.
Not on my watch.
There was something else.
A detail.
A codeword.
Ammo?
It's all I've got.
Little enough.
Could you do some digging as a favour?
You don't have many favours left.
Then I'm calling them all in.
And if you can find who's after her and neutralise them, what then?
You think you can go on saving her forever?
Of course.
Is that sentiment talking?
No, it's me.
Difficult to tell the difference these days.
Told you, I made a promise.
A vow.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.
Not on my watch.
'My darling, I need to tell you this because you mustn't hate me for going away.'
Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.
- Can you hear a squeaking?
- No.
Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel.
Why Planes Fail.
- Did you see it?
Oh, truly terrifying.
- Can't say I did.
Swore I would never fly again, yet hear I am!
Everything OK, madam?
No.
No, no, it's not, but then what's the use in complaining?
I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off is all.
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.
Oh, OK.
Relax.
She said relax.
Did you have a nice time in London?
It was OK, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun?
Did you lose it in the war?
'I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.
I'm not running, I promise you that,
I just need to do this in my own way.'
Oh, God!
I'm...
I-I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God!
- Everything OK, madam?
- I think I'm dying.
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.
God will smile on you.
'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,
I'm sorry, my love.'
I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.
Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of a dice.
I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
I swear I will.'
Not like this one.
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in!
I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.
Mr Baker.
Well, that completes the set.
- No, it does not.
- Well, who else am I missing?
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?
Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.
Oh, hi, Mary.
What concept?
Happy families.
Nice trip?
- How the f...?
- Please, Mary, there is a child present.
- How did you get in here?
- Karim let me in.
Hello.
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Nice to meet you, missus.
No, I mean how did you find me?
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
No, really, though, how?
Every movement I made was entirely random, every new personality just on the roll of a dice!
Mary, no human action is ever truly random.
An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability, mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual, can reduce the number of variables considerably.
I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine a seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.
But they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.
Oh, you bastard!
- You bastard!
- I know, but your face!
"The mathematics of probability"?
- You believed that.
- "Feasible variables"?
Yes, I started to run out about then.
In the memory stick!
Yeah, that was my idea.
- AGRA?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
You said it was your initials.
In a way that was true.
In a way?
So many lies.
I'm so sorry.
And I don't just mean you.
What?
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...
You're R?
Rosamund?
Rosamund Mary.
I always liked Mary.
Yeah, me too.
I used to.
I just...
I didn't know what else to do.
You could have stayed, you could have talked to me.
That's what couples are supposed to do.
Work things through.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Mary, I may not be a very good man but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for,
- most of the time.
- All the time.
You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.
You never judge, you never complain.
I don't deserve you, I...
All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
I will keep you safe.
But it has to be in London.
It's my city, I know the turf.
Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.
Get down!
Hello again.
- Ajay?
- Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.
Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.
I thought I was the only one who got out.
How did you find us?
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.
You found her but I found you.
So perhaps not so clever.
And now here we are.
At last.
Touche!
Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
She thought I was dead.
I might as well have been.
It was always just the four of us, always, remember?
Oh, yeah.
So why do you want to kill me?
Do you know how long they kept me prisoner?
What they did to me?
They tortured Alex to death.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.
But you?
You, where were you?
That day at the embassy, I escaped.
Ha!
But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
Where were you?
Oh, I got out.
For a while.
Long enough to hide my memory stick.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.
I was loyal, you see.
Loyal to my friends.
But they took me, tortured me.
Not for information.
Not for anything except fun.
They thought I'd give in, die, but I didn't, I lived.
And eventually, they forgot about me rotting in a cell somewhere.
Six years they kept me there.
Until one day I saw my chance.
Oh, and I made them pay.
You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.
Little whispers.
Laughter.
Gossip.
How the clever agents had been betrayed.
Brought down by you!
Me?
You know I'll kill you too.
You know I will, Ajay.
What, you think I care if I die?
I've dreamed of killing you every night for six years.
Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.
I swear to you, Ajay.
What did you hear, Ajay?
When you were a prisoner, what exactly did you hear?
What did I hear?
Ammo.
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo."
We were betrayed!
- And they said it was her?
- That you betrayed us!
They said her name?
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.
No!
No!
'The English woman, that's all he heard.
Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.'
Couldn't this wait until you're back?
No, it's not over.
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed, the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.
There was only a voice on the phone.
'Remember?
And a codeword.'
"Ammo," yes, you said.
How's your Latin, brother dear?
My Latin?
Amo, amas, amat.
I love, you love, he loves.
What...?
Not "Ammo" as in ammunition, but "Amo", meaning?
You'd better be right, Sherlock.
Bloody thing!
What's going on?
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.
What?
'So many lies.
And I don't just mean you.'
- Hello.
- Ah, hello.
- I like your daisy.
- Thank you, yeah.
It's not really me, though, I think.
- No?
- No, no, it's too floral for me.
I'm more of a "knackered with weary old eyes" kind of guy.
Well, I think they're nice.
Nice eyes.
- Thank you.
- Look...
Look...
I don't normally do this,
- but, um...
- But you're going to.
Yeah.
- What's this?
- This is me.
- Thank you.
Cheers.
- Yeah.
Great.
- Bye!
- Bye.

Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
Hmm?
Noticed what?
The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
- Yeah, can't she?
- Hmm.
I'm coming darling.
I'm coming.
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
- _
- Come here...
It's OK.
_
- _
- Do you want a cuddle?
_
I know.
- Oh, sweetheart.
- _
_
Ssh.
Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you?
_
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?
Oh, let's go and see Daddy!
Daddy's here.
It's OK, Rosie.
I'll take her.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I may as well get up now.
Hey, baby, it's Daddy.
Your daddy.
Come here, Rose.
Come here, darling, it's all right.
Thank you.
_
_
This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.
How many more times?
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.
And you're basing all this on a code name?
On a whispered voice on the telephone?
Come on, Mycroft.
You were the conduit for AGRA.
Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
It was my job.
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
AGRA went in.
- Yes.
- And they were betrayed.
Not by me.
Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.
I promise you,
I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.
You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.
Not one.
Not.
One.
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories?
I'd like to do those.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.
Although she does seem to enjoy them.
Well, I'll have to give that a go.
Got a lot to catch up on.
'You think you understand.
You understand nothing.'
'Code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love.'
'You'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.
'They know everything.'
'They said it was the English woman.'
'Don't minute any of this.'
'They know everything.'
- You don't make it easy, do you?
- What do you mean?
Well, being... being so perfect.
Mary, I...
I need to tell you...
Hang on.
Can you tell me later?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Great.
Well, no, we can't just go.
- Rosie.
- Yeah.
- Er, you go.
- No!
I'll come as soon as I've found someone.
Mrs Hudson.
- Corfu till Saturday.
Molly?
- Er, yeah, I'll try.
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.
You know that's not going to happen.
If there's more to this case, you need to see it.
Yeah, OK, you win.
'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes.
'Please make your way to the exit.
Thank you.'
Your office said I'd find you here.
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.
We're like them.
Ghostly, living in the shadows.
Predatory?
Well, it depends which side you're on.
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.
Nice location for the final act, couldn't have chosen it better myself.
But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.
I just come here to look at the fish.
I knew this would happen one day.
- It's like that old story.
- I really am a very busy man.
Would you mind cutting to the chase?
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
With good reason.
"There was once a merchant, in a famous market in Baghdad."
I really have never liked this story.
I'm just like the merchant in the story,
I thought I could out-run the inevitable.
I've always been looking over my shoulder, always expecting to see the grim figure of...
Death.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hey.
- John?
- On his way.
Let me introduce Ammo.
You were Ammo?
You were the person on the phone that time?
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
Why did you betray us?
Why does anyone do anything?
- Hmm.
- Let me guess, selling secrets?
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.
Worked very well for a few years.
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it.
But...
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.
I couldn't believe my luck!
That bought me a little time.
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
Very handy.
They were always such reliable killers.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.
Lady Smallwood gave the order.
But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.
Seemed to do the trick.
And you thought your troubles were over.
I was tired.
Tired of the mess of it all.
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.
The hostages were killed.
AGRA too.
Or so I thought.
My secret was safe.
But... apparently not.
Just a little peace.
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
A family?
Home?
Really, I understand.
So, just let me get out of here, right?
Let me just walk away.
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.
What do you say?
After what you did?
!
Mary, no!
OK.
London Aquarium.
Yes, now.
I was never a field agent.
I always thought I'd be rather good.
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
Thanks.
- For a secretary.
- What?
It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
- I didn't do this out of jealousy.
- No?
Same old drudge, day in, day out.
Never getting out there where all the excitement was.
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.
Yes, your little flat.
- How do you know?
- Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?
And what are you, widowed or divorced?
Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.
That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.
- Sherlock...
- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.
A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.
- Sherlock, don't.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.
There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
That accounts for the drink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.
So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.
To prove how good you are.
To make up for the inadequacies of your...
little life.
Well, Mrs Norbury,
I must admit this is unexpected.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.
All except Sherlock Holmes.
There's no way out.
So it would seem.
You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.
It's what I do.
Maybe I can still surprise you.
Now, come on, be sensible.
Hmm, no, I don't think so.
Ah!
Surprise!
Everything's fine.
It's going to be OK.
Get an ambulance!
It's all right, it's all right.
- Mary!
- John.
All right, Mary?
Mary?
Stay with me, stay with me.
- Oh, come on...
- No, don't worry.
Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
Come on, Mary.
Mary?
Oh, God.
John, I think this is it.
No, no, no, no.
It's not.
- That's...
- You made me so happy.
You gave me everything I could ever, ever have wanted...
Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.
- Look after Rosie.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.
- Promise me.
- I promise.
- No...
- Yes, I promise.
- Promise me!
- I promise, I promise.
Ssh, ssh.
Hey, Sherlock.
Yes.
I... so like you.
Did I ever say?
Yes, yes, you did.
I'm sorry for... for shooting you that time.
I'm really sorry.
It's all right.
I think we're even now, OK?
OK.
- Oh, I think we're...
- Mary, Mary...
- ...even, definitely even.
- Ssh, ssh.
You were my whole world.
Being Mary Watson was the only life worth living.
- Mary...
- Thank you.
Mary...
Don't you dare!
You made a vow.
You swore it.
'You've been having dreams.
A recurring dream?
'
Do you want to talk about it?
This is a two-way relationship, you know.
The whole world has come crashing down around you.
Everything's hopeless.
Irretrievable.
I know that's what you must feel but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
That's not really my style.
I need to know what to do.
Do?
About John.
Put me through to Sherrinford, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
But nothing will ever be the same again, will it?
I'm afraid it won't.
We'll have to rally round, I expect, do our bit.
Look after little Rosie.
I'm just going to, um look through these things.
There might be a case.
A case?
Oh, you're not up to it, are you?
Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.
Yes.
Yes, I expect you're right.
I'll make some tea, shall I?
- Mrs Hudson?
- Yes, Sherlock?
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident...
- Yes?
- ...would you just say the word Norbury to me?
Would you?
Norbury?
Just that.
I'd be very grateful.
What's this?
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.
Oh, God!
Is that...?
- Must be.
- Oh.
I knew it wouldn't end like this.
I knew Moriarty made plans.
'I thought that would get your attention.
So, this is in case...
In case the day comes.
If you are watching this, I'm probably dead.
I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows?
Nothing's certain, nothing's written.
My old life it was full of consequences.
The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.
You need to remember that.
So I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
Might be the hardest case of your career.
When I'm... gone, if I'm gone I need you to do something for me.'
Hi.
I just wondered how things were going and if there was anything I could do.
It's, er, it's from John.
- Right.
- You don't need to read it now.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.
He says...
John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...
Yes?
He said he'd that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Anyone.
'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
When I'm gone, if I'm... gone I need you to do something for me.
Save John Watson.
Save him, Sherlock.
Save him.'
'When does the path we walk on lock around our feet?
When does the road become a river with only one destination?
'
'Death waits for us all in Samarra.
But can Samarra be avoided?
'
Go to hell, Sherlock!
- _
- My brother is a murderer.
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.
Oh, do your research.
I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Merry Christmas!

I'm not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.
You know what happened to the other one.
Miss me?
'Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?

I've only been gone four minutes.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Is that quite clear?
Don't minute any of this.
Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.
A D notice has been slapped on the entire incident.
Only those within this room, code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love, will ever know the whole truth.
As far as everyone else is concerned, going to the Prime Minister

Look, not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death - my death!

I see.
Who is supposed to have shot him, then?
Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger - that's who.
- That's not what happened at all.
- It is now.
Remarkable.
How did you do it?
We have some very talented people working here.
If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.
That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.
No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.
You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.
You're home and dry.
OK, cheers.
Obviously, there's unfinished business.
Moriarty.
I told you
- Moriarty's dead.
You say he filmed that video message before he died.
Yes.
You also say you know what he's going to do next.
- What does that mean?
- Perhaps that's all there is to it.
Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
No, no, he would never be that disappointing.
He's planned something, something long-term.
Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.
Posthumous revenge.
No, better than that - posthumous game.
We brought you back to deal with this.
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.
Wait?
!
Of course wait.
I'm the target - targets wait.
Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up,
I'll know when it begins.
I always know when the game is on.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because I love it.
There was once a merchant, in the famous market at Baghdad.
- [WATER SLOSHES]
- One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise, and he knew that the stranger was Death.
Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles, to the city of Samarra.
For there he was sure Death could not find him.
But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.
"Very well," said the merchant.
"I give in.
I am yours."
"But tell me, why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"
"Because," said Death,
"I had an appointment with you tonight... ..in Samarra."
If this gets any better, I'm going to get two knives.
Pays to advertise.
- So, what about Moriarty, then?
- Oh, I have a plan.
I'm going to monitor the underworld, every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
So, basically, your plan is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do?
Awesome, isn't it?
He drowned, Mr Holmes.
That's what we thought.
- But when they opened up his lungs...
- Yes?
..sand.
- Superficial.

Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.
- 'Wilson?
' 'Lymph nodes?
'
- Sherlock...
Yes, you may have nothing but a limbless torso, but there'll be traces of ink in the lymph nodes under the armpits.
If your mystery corpse had tattoos, the signs will be there.
- 'Bloody hell!
Is that a guess?
'
- I never guess.
- Sherlock...
- 'So, he's the killer?
The canary trainer?
'
- Of course he's the killer.
- 'Didn't see that coming.'
Hm, naturally.
Sherlock, you can't go on spinning plates like this.
That's it!
The place was spinning.
The heart medication you're taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.
Yes, I...
I think so.
Why?
Because the fingerprints on your brother's neck were your own.
- [WATSON CHUCKLES] A jellyfish?
- I know.
You can't arrest a jellyfish.
- You could try.
- We did try.
- [PHONE REPEATEDLY VIBRATES]
- Oh...
- Oh, God.
- Mary?
59 missed calls.
We're in a lot of trouble.
[MARY SCREAMS]
Ow!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Relax, it's got two syllables...
I'm a nurse, darling - I think I know what to do!
- Come on, then...
- Re!
Lax!
No, just drive, please, God, just drive!
God, drive!
- [SHE SCREAMS]
- Sherlock
- Mary!
- That's it, Mary - re...
- [PHONE KEYBOARD CLICKS]
- Don't you start!
- ...
lax.
John, John...
I think you have to pull over!
- Mary, Mary...
- Pull over!
- Oh, my God!
- [MARY SCREAMS]
Has that come out?
They never come out when I take them.
Let's have a look.
Aw, she's so beautiful.
- Have another go.
- What about a name?
- Catherine.
- Uh, yeah, we've gone off that.
Have we?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Well, you know what I think...
- BOTH:
It's not a girl's name.
Molly, Mrs H, we would love you to be godparents.
- Oh!
Really?
- If you...
That's so lovely.
And, uh... you too, Sherlock?
- You too what?
- Godfather, we'd like you to be godfather.
God is a ludicrous fiction, dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.
Yeah, but there'll be cake.
Will you do it?
I'll get back to you.
Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.
In Christ's name.
Now, what name have you given your daughter?
Rosamund Mary.
Rosamund?
It means "Rose of the world".
Rosie for short.
Didn't you get John's text?
No.
I delete his texts.
I delete any text that begins "Hi."
No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.
- [MRS HUDSON CLEARS THROAT]
- Sorry.
WHISPERING:
Phone!
And now, godparents, are you ready to help the parents of this child in their duties as Christian parents?
BOTH:
We are.
SIRI: 'Sorry, I didn't catch that.
'Please repeat the question.'
As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.
To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
Hard logic versus romantic whimsy - that is your choice.
You fail to connect actions to their consequences.
Now, for the last time, if you want to keep the rattle, do not throw the rattle.
[MESSAGE TONE]
All right, good girl, good girl.
Good girl.
I'd better finish this, hadn't I?
- Hey.
- Afternoon.
He says you've got a good one, Greg?
Oh, yeah.
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
God, 50!
Where does it go?
I know for a fact I was only 21 this time last week.
Yeah, well that's impossible.
That was before you met me.
- Well, no, no, there never was...
- "There never was such a time."
She's looking at me disapprovingly again.
No.
She's just jealous.
Yeah, well, I think we both are.
[PHONE VIBRATES]
- Oh...
- No, no, David.
- Come on, you promised.
- No, it's...
Oh, no...
Oh, it's a Skype call.
Oh!
Then it must be Charlie.
At least he's phoning, I suppose.
Oh, look!
Hello!
'Hey, Dad.
Happy birthday.
Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?
'
No!
Picture's frozen!
'Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you.'
Why is it rubbish?
Where are you?
How is he?
Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.
MAN:
David?
Come on!
OK, no, hang on a sec, I'll find somewhere quieter.
So, Charlie, where are you?
Are you there?
- 'Sorry, I'm here.
I'm just a bit...'
- Are you all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
Altitude?
'I'm in Tibet.
Didn't you see the mountains?
'
Never mind mountains.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.
- 'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?
'
- What?
'Could you just check something on my car?
'
Your car?
'To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe
I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet.
- 'Could you take a photo and send it?
'
- Uh, yes, I can do that.
All done.
Have you got it?
Charlie?
LESTRADE:
A week later...
Yeah?
...something really weird happens.
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed, the cops are chasing him, and he turns into the drive of the Welsborough house to try and get away.
Unfortunately...
The drunk guy survived, they managed to pull him out, but when they put the fire out and examined the parked car...
Whose body?
Charlie Welsborough, the son.
- What?
- The son who was in Tibet.
DNA all checks out.
Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.
[SHERLOCK CHUCKLES]
- Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
- Have you got a lab report?
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.
- The seats?
- Yes, the car seats.
Made of vinyl.
Two different types of vinyl present.
Was it his own car?
Yeah, not flash - he was a student.
- Well, that's suggestive.
- Why?
- Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
- Yeah, right?
- There's something else.
- Yes?
According to this,
Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.
What?
The body in the car, dead for a week.
Oh, this is a good one.
Is it my birthday?
You want help?
- Yes, please.
OK.
- One condition.
Take all the credit.
It gets boring if I just solve them all.
Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.
He's got a point.
Which makes me look like some kind of prima donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do!
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.
- Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
- Definitely a sore spot.
So you take all the glory, thanks...
- OK!
- ...thanks all the same.
Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?
It's driving me nuts.
Anything you say, Giles.
Just kidding.
HE MOUTHS:
What's his name?
HE MOUTHS:
Greg.
What?
Greg.
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?
Not a clue.
It's just you normally say that at this point.
Hmm.
Well, then, let's hope you solve your little problem, Greg.
- Hear that?
- I know.
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood?
- Oh, good, great.
Yeah, amazing.
- Getting any sleep?
- Christ, no.
You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.
- Must feel very different...
- Sorry, what?
Yes, well, you know how it is.
All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.
- Are you two having a little joke?
- Never a word of thanks.
Can't even tell people's faces apart.
This is a joke, isn't it?
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever.
You're so, so clever."
- Is it about me?
- I think he needs winding.
You know, I think that really might be it.
No, don't get it.
Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect, so go easy on them, yeah?
- You know me.
- MARY: 'Hey, hello.'
Yeah.
Got them, don't worry.
Pampers, the cream you can't get from Boots.
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now?
- At the dead boy's house?
- Yeah.
'And what does he think?
Any theories?
'
Well, I texted you the details.
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.
- Hey!
- How do you know about that?
'Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.'
- WHISPERING:
They know everything!
- 'Solved it, then?
'
I'm working on it.
'Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.'
- Pig!
- Keep trying.
'So, what about it, then?
'What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it?
'And what are you going to call this one?
'
Oh, the Ghost Driver.
- Don't give it a title.
- People like the titles.
- They hate the titles.
- Give the people what they want.
No, never do that - people are stupid.
Uh, some people.
'All people are stupid.
Most people.'
'Bizarre enough though, isn't it, to be him?
'
I mean, it's right up your strasse.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.
- Son.
- Son!
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.
If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.
Well, I believe that I can.
DISTORTED:
But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
Sherlock?
Mr Holmes?
Sorry, you were saying?
Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
I don't think we'll ever get over this.
No.
Shouldn't think so.
So sorry, will you excuse me a moment?
I just...
I'll...
I'll just, um...
Ahem.
- Now what's wrong?
- Not sure, I just...
By the pricking of my thumbs.
Seriously?
You?
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.
They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.
What is this?
Oh, it's a sort of shrine, I suppose, really.
Bit of a fan of Mrs T.
A big hero of mine when I was getting started.
Right, yes.
- Who?
- What?
- Who...?
Who was this?
- Are you serious?
- Sherlock...
- It's...
It's Margaret Thatcher, the first female Prime Minister of this country.
Right.
- Prime Minister?
Right.
- Leader of the Government.
- Female?
- For God's sake!
You know perfectly well who she is.
Why are you playing for time?
It's the gap, look at the gap.
It's wrong.
Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed.
The whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.
This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been in, this picture is straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.
- Something's missing from here, but only recently.
- Yes, a...
- Plaster bust... - plaster bust.
- Oh, for God's sake!
It got broken.
What the hell has this got to do with Charlie?
- Rug!
- What?
Well, how could it get broken?
The only place for it to fall is the floor and there is a big thick rug.
- Does it matter?
- Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.
- It is worth letting him do this.
- Is your friend quite mad?
No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
We found the remains out there in the porch.
- The porch where we came in?
- How anybody could hate her so much they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness...
I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.
Why didn't he smash all the others?
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.
Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.
- And if there's nothing...
- I know what happened to your son.
You do?
It's quite simple, superficial, to be blunt.
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness?
- Well, yes.
- And the porch where it was smashed,
I noticed the motion sensor was damaged,
- so I assume it's permanently lit.
- How did you notice that?
I lack the arrogance to ignore details.
I'm not the police.
- So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.
- Exactly.
- Why?
- Don't know.
Wouldn't be fun if I knew.
Mr Holmes, please!
It was your 50th birthday, Mr Welsborough, of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
- After all, he was in Tibet.
- Yes.
- No.
- No?
CROWD: ♪ Happy birthday... ♪
The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video.
Easily arranged.
It's a Skype call.
The trick was meant to be a surprise.
- A trick?
- Obviously.
Could you take a photo and send it?
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.
Well, good enough.
Effectively a costume.
You're joking?
No, I'm not.
All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
- Oh, my God!
- Surprise!
That's when it happened.
I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.
You said he'd felt unwell?
You all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
He died there and then.
No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained, in the driver's seat, hidden, until...
When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who'd been sitting there, quite dead, for a week.
Oh, God!
Poor kid.
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.
This is where it was smashed.
- That was amazing.
- What?
The car, the kid.
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?
I can't stand it, never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
What kind of a life would that be?
Besides, I have the strangest feeling...
Miss me?
- That's mine.
You two take a... bus.
- Why?
I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.
The Mall, please.
- I met her once.
- Thatcher?
Rather arrogant, I thought.
- You thought that?
!
- Ha, I know.
Why am I looking at this?
That's her, John and Mary's baby.
Oh, I see, yes.
Looks very... fully functioning.
Is that really the best you can do?
Sorry, I've never been very good with them.
- Babies?
- Humans.
Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?
Any interest in her?
Why on earth would he?
I don't know.
You tell me.
In the last year of his life,
James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over 70 assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias,
which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.
It's a pearl - get another one.
There's something important about this.
I'm sure.
Maybe it's Moriarty.
Maybe it's not.
[WATER SLOSHES]
But something's coming.
Are you having a premonition, brother mine?
The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other.
What we call premonition is just movement of the web.
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable.
As inevitable as mathematics.
Appointment In Samarra.
I'm sorry?
The merchant who can't outrun Death.
You always hated that story as a child.
Less keen on predestination back then.
I'm not sure I like it now.
You wrote your own version, as I remember.
Appointment In Sumatra.
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.
Goodnight, Mycroft.
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.
- Keep me informed.
- Of what?
Absolutely no idea.
'Ammo!
'
[MAN SHUDDERS]
- Oh, hi, Stella.
- Greg.
You, uh...?
- Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...
- Right, right, right...
Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?
It's nothing.
I mean it's nothing serious.
- No, no.
- I just pop round every now and again for a chat.
Yeah, of course.
I mean he loves a really tricky case.
Yeah, he does!
So what you here for?
Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so...
The Borgia Pearl?
They still after that, are they?
Yeah.
So, how did you two first meet?
Oh, well, there was a case about, um, ten years ago.
Nobody could figure it out.
There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.
- Oh, yeah?
How did she die?
- Hypothermia.
What?
I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...
Will you two please keep it down?
!
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?
You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.
I was a carpenter.
Like me dad.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
How the hell...?
Ah... e-cigarettes.
Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.
If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.
But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last.
Anything to add, John?
- John?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.
- What is that?
- That is... me.
Well, it's a me substitute.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You know I value your little contributions.
Yeah?
It's been there since nine this morning.
- Has it?
Where were you?
- Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.
What about my girlfriend?
- What?
- You said I had an ex...
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.
The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.
I...
I thought you'd done something clever.
Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?
[SHERLOCK INHALES DEEPLY]
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
What do you mean?
Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
- Well...
- You thought she was having an affair.
I'm afraid it's far worse than that, your wife is a spy.
- What?
- That's right.
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy, across the road from your flat.
Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy, as part of an official state visit.
As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.
This drug will render the President entirely susceptible to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty.
What?
Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III.
- Are you serious?
- No, of course not.
His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.
I don't!
- Just the bras.
- Get out.
So, what's this all about, then?
- Having fun.
- Fun?
- While I can.
- Mm-hmm.
[KNOCK AT DOOR]
- Uh, Sherlock...
- Borgia Pearl.
Boring.
Go!
- But...
- Go!
- This had better be good.
- Oh, I think you'll like it.
That is the bust, isn't it?
The one that was broken.
No, it's another one, different owner.
Different part of town.
You were right, this is a thing.
Something's going on.
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be pleased.
- I am pleased.
- You don't look pleased.
This is my game face.
And the game is on.
Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one.
- One belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan.
- Identical busts?
Yeah, and this one to a Dr Barnicot in Holborn.
Three in total.
God knows who'd want to do something like this.
Yeah, but some people have that complex, don't they?
An idee fixe.
They obsess over one thing and they can't let it go.
No, no good.
There were other images of Margaret...
Margaret...?
You know who she is.
...Thatcher, present at the first break-in.
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?
Ooh!
- What?
- Blood.
Quite a bit of it, too.
Was there any injury at the crime scene?
Nah.
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.
- Come on.
- Holborn?
Lambeth!
- Lambeth?
Why?
- To see Toby.
Ah, right.
Who?
- You'll see.
- Right, are you coming?
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.
- Who told you?
- The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.
- Have a good time.
- I will.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
- What?
- She's not the one.
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.
How do you work all that out?
She's got three children in Rio that he doesn't know about.
Are you just making this up?
- Possibly.
- Who's Toby?
There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker, one of the world's best.
Got himself into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago.
He hacked into the Pentagon security system, and I managed to get him off the charge.
Therefore he owes me a favour.
So, how does that help us?
- What?
- Toby the hacker?
- Toby's not the hacker.
- What?
- All right, Craig?
- All right, Sherlock?
Craig's got a dog.
So I see.
Good boy!
Hiya!
Mary?
What are you...?
No, we, we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case.
No, exactly.
So... don't wait up.
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Hey.
Mary, what are you doing here?
She's better at this than you.
- Better?
- So I texted her.
Hang on, Mary's better than me?
Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.
Of course she's better.
Yeah, OK.
Nothing personal.
What, so I'm supposed to just go home now, am I?
What do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?
- John or the dog?
- Ha-ha, that's funny!
- John.
- Well...
He's handy and loyal.
- That's hilarious.
- Is it too early for a divorce?
Oh.
Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge?
Keep up, he's fast.
- He's not moving.
- He's thinking.
He's really not moving.
Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.
You just like this dog, don't you?
- Well, I like you.
- He's still not moving.
- Fascinating.
- Oh!
[SHE CLEARS HER THROAT]
Well, what do you make of it?
- They were looking for something.
- Yes, but it wasn't a burglar, they came specifically for that Thatcher bust.
Why?
[DOG SNIFFS]
[DOG WHINES]
Clever.
Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail,
- where would you go?
- Like hiding a tree in a forest.
Or blood in a butcher's.
Never mind, Toby, better luck next time, hmm?
This is it, though.
This is the one, I can feel it.
Not Moriarty?
It has to be him.
It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.
It's designed to beguile me, tease me and lure me in.
At last, a noose for me to put my neck into.
You should have seen the state of the front room.
- It was like The Exorcist.
- Huh.
Was Rosie's head spinning round?
- No.
Just the projectile vomiting.
- Nice!
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
- Hmm?
Noticed what?
- The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
[BABY CRIES]
Yeah, can't she?
I'm coming, darling.
Mummy's coming.
LOVINGLY:
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here.
Have you heard of that thing?
In Germany?
You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.
Ostalgie.
People who missed the old days under the communists.
- People are weird, aren't they?
- Hmm.
According to this, there's quite a market for Cold War memorabilia.
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit?
Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.
Yes, fascinating.
Irrelevant.
Where exactly did they come from?
I've got into the records of the suppliers, Gelder and Co.
Seems they're from Georgia.
Where exactly?
Tbilisi.
Batch of six.
One to Welsborough.
One to Hassan.
One to Dr Barnicot.
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.
One to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.
Lestrade?
Another one?
- 'Yeah.'
- Harker or Sandeford?
Harker.
And it's murder this time.
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.
_
_
Defensive wounds on her face and hands, throat cut.
Sharp blade.
The same thing inside the house?
The bust?
- Two of them this time.
- Interesting.
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago.
- Limited edition of six.
- And now someone's wandering about destroying them all.
Makes no sense.
What's the point?
No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.
- Yes, it is.
- Well, it is, but it's not the point.
I've been slow, far too slow.
Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind...
Slow but lucky, very lucky.
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.
Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.
Congratulations, by the way.
- I'm sorry?
- Well, you're about to solve a big one.
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
- Yeah, until then, basically.
[WATER SPLASHING]
That's enough now, love.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.
And you need to get to bed.
Come on.
Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?
You were on the run.
Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying, it's clever.
Very clever.
But now you've met me and you're not so clever, are you?
Who are you?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.
Argh!
You're out of time.
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
- Who?
I know it's him.
It must be him.
You think you understand.
You understand nothing.
Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don't we just enjoy the moment?
Let me present Interpol's number one case.
Too tough for them, too boring for me.
The Black Pearl of the Borgias!
It's not possible!
How could she...?
!
Everything about who I was is on there.
The problems of your past are your business.
The problems of your future are my privilege.
I don't understand.
She...
She destroyed it.
She?
You know her!
You do, don't you?
You know the bitch?
!
She betrayed me.
Betrayed us all.
Mary.
This is about Mary?
Is that what she's calling herself now, eh?
- 'Armed police, you're surrounded!
'
- Give it to me.
YELLS:
Give it to me!
'Come out slowly, I want to see your hands above your head.'
Nobody shoots me!
Anyone shoots, I kill this man.
'Lay down your weapon.
Do it now!
'
I'm leaving this place.
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.
'Lay down your weapon.'
You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
Tell her she's a dead woman.
She's a dead woman walking.
She's my friend.
And she's under my protection.
Who are you?
I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.
Who's Sherlock Holmes?
Not a policeman.
[ALARM BLARES]
What do you think?
Mate in two?
Don't antagonise them, darling.
Oh, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.
Everything palls.
They'll send someone soon.
They?
Who are they?
Seems to me we put an awful lot of faith in they.
Well, I've got something they would dearly love, if only we could get out of here.
I've got Ammo.
Ammo?
- MARY:
Madame Ambassador.
- What took you so long?
- Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now!
Veer left!
[SCREAMING]
[HE LAUGHS]
What now?
What do we do?
We die.
Well?
He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.
- I very much doubt it.
- Why?
Because I think he used to work with Mary.
[GUNFIRE]
[SHOUTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE]
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out!
We'll come back later.
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the English woman?
What would you do to a traitor?
Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.
[HE CHUCKLES]
I am an idiot, I know nothing.
Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
That was quite a text you sent me.
What's going on, Sherlock?
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,
I couldn't see what was right under my nose.
Expected a pearl.
Oh, my God, that's a...
Yes, it's an AGRA.
Memory stick, like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.
Who?
I don't know.
We...
We all had one but the others were...
Haven't you even looked at it yet?
I glanced at it but I prefer
- to hear it from you.
- Why?
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.
There were four of us, agents.
Not just agents.
Polite term.
Alex.
Gabriel.
Me.
And Ajay.
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.
We all had one.
Each containing aliases, our background, everything.
We could never be betrayed, because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.
- Who employed you?
- Anyone who paid well.
I mean, we were at the top of our game for years.
And then it all ended.
There was a coup in Georgia.
The British Embassy in Tbilisi was taken over, lots of hostages.
We got the call to go in, get them out.
There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.
- Who from?
- I don't know, just another voice on the phone.
And a codeword.
- Ammo.
- Ammo?
Like ammunition.
We went in, but then something went wrong.
Something went really wrong.
[GUNFIRE, SCREAMING]
That was six years ago.
It feels like forever.
I was the only one that made it out.
No.
What?
I met someone tonight.
Same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.
What, he's alive?
Yeah, very much so.
I don't believe it, this is amazing!
I thought I was the only one,
I thought I was the only one who got out.
Where is he?
I need to see him, now!
Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?
Yeah, of course.
It was our insurance.
Above all, they mustn't fall into enemy hands.
So Ajay survived as well.
And now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide, with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why?
I don't know.
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
[SHE LAUGHS]
Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.
Families fall out.
The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
Well, he's just trying to find me.
He survived, that's all that matters!
I heard it from his own mouth.
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."
Why would he want to kill me?
- He said you betrayed him.
- Oh, no, no, that's insane.
Well, it's what he believes.
[SHE GASPS]
I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.
No, Mary...
You do.
I made a vow, remember?
To look after the three of you.
Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
There's something I think you should read.
What is it?
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.
What are you...?
[HE SNIFFS]
- Mary...
Oh, no!
- There you go.
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.
No.
You just look after them till I get back.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
[CHILD SINGS]
[HE GROANS]
Agra?
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
It is 378km west of the state capital, Lucknow.
What are you, Wikipedia?
- Yes.
- AGRA is an acronym.
Oh, good, I love an acronym.
All the best secret societies have them.
Team of agents, the best.
But you know all that.
Of course I do.
Go on.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.
Indeed?
Well, that's news to me.
Is it?
He's already killed looking for that memory stick.
AGRA always worked for the highest bidder,
I thought that might include you?
- Me?
- Well, I mean the British government, or whatever government you're currently propping up.
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.
They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong.
And that was that, we stopped using freelancers.
- Your initiative?
- My initiative.
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.
I don't like loose ends.
Not on my watch.
There was something else.
A detail.
A codeword.
Ammo?
It's all I've got.
Little enough.
Could you do some digging as a favour?
You don't have many favours left.
Then I'm calling them all in.
And if you can find who's after her and neutralise them, what then?
You think you can go on saving her forever?
Of course.
Is that sentiment talking?
No, it's me.
Difficult to tell the difference these days.
Told you, I made a promise.
A vow.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.
Not on my watch.
MARY: 'My darling, I need to tell you this because you mustn't hate me for going away.'
NEW YORK ACCENT:
Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.
- Can you hear a squeaking?
- No.
Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel.
Why Planes Fail.
- Did you see it?
Oh, truly terrifying.
- Can't say I did.
Swore I would never fly again, yet hear I am!
Everything OK, madam?
No.
No, no, it's not, but then what's the use in complaining?
I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off is all.
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.
Oh, OK.
Relax.
She said relax. [CHUCKLES]
Did you have a nice time in London?
It was OK, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun?
- Did you lose it in the war?
- [SHE LAUGHS]
'I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.
I'm not running, I promise you that,
I just need to do this in my own way.'
Oh, God!
I'm...
I-I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God!
[FLIGHT ATTENDANT BUTTON BEEPS]
- Everything OK, madam?
- I think I'm dying.
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.
God will smile on you.
'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,
I'm sorry, my love.'
I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.
Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of a dice.
I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
I swear I will.'
[LAUGHTER]
Not like this one.
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in!
I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.
Mr Baker.
Well, that completes the set.
- No, it does not.
- Well, who else am I missing?
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?
Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.
Oh, hi, Mary.
What concept?
Happy families.
Nice trip?
- How the f...?
- Please, Mary, there is a child present.
- How did you get in here?
- Karim let me in.
Hello.
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Nice to meet you, missus.
No, I mean how did you find me?
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
No, really, though, how?
Every movement I made was entirely random, every new personality just on the roll of a dice!
Mary, no human action is ever truly random.
An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability, mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual, can reduce the number of variables considerably.
I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine a seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.
But they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.
[HE CHUCKLES]
JOKINGLY:
Oh, you bastard!
- ANGRILY:
You bastard!
- I know, but your face!
"The mathematics of probability"?
- You believed that.
- "Feasible variables"?
Yes, I started to run out about then.
In the memory stick!
Yeah, that was my idea.
- AGRA?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
You said it was your initials.
In a way that was true.
In a way?
So many lies.
I'm so sorry.
And I don't just mean you.
What?
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...
You're R?
Rosamund?
Rosamund Mary.
I always liked Mary.
Yeah, me too.
I used to.
I just...
I didn't know what else to do.
You could have stayed, you could have talked to me.
That's what couples are supposed to do.
Work things through.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Mary, I may not be a very good man but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for,
- most of the time.
- All the time.
You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.
You never judge, you never complain.
I don't deserve you, I...
All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
I will keep you safe.
But it has to be in London.
It's my city, I know the turf.
Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.
Get down!
[RAPID GUNFIRE]
Hello again.
- Ajay?
- Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.
Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.
I thought I was the only one who got out.
How did you find us?
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.
You found her but I found you.
So perhaps not so clever.
And now here we are.
At last.
[HE CHUCKLES] Touche!
Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
She thought I was dead.
I might as well have been.
It was always just the four of us, always, remember?
Oh, yeah.
So why do you want to kill me?
Do you know how long they kept me prisoner?
What they did to me?
They tortured Alex to death.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.
But you?
You, where were you?
That day at the embassy, I escaped.
Ha!
But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
Where were you?
Oh, I got out.
For a while.
Long enough to hide my memory stick.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.
I was loyal, you see.
Loyal to my friends.
But they took me, tortured me.
Not for information.
Not for anything except fun.
They thought I'd give in, die, but I didn't, I lived.
And eventually, they forgot about me rotting in a cell somewhere.
Six years they kept me there.
Until one day I saw my chance.
Oh, and I made them pay.
You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.
Little whispers.
Laughter.
Gossip.
How the clever agents had been betrayed.
Brought down by you!
- Me?
- [TRAIN WHISTLES]
You know I'll kill you too.
You know I will, Ajay.
What, you think I care if I die?
I've dreamed of killing you every night for six years.
Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.
I swear to you, Ajay.
What did you hear, Ajay?
When you were a prisoner, what exactly did you hear?
What did I hear?
Ammo.
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo."
We were betrayed!
- And they said it was her?
- That you betrayed us!
They said her name?
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.
No!
No!
'The English woman, that's all he heard.
Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.'
Couldn't this wait until you're back?
No, it's not over.
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed, the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.
There was only a voice on the phone.
'Remember?
And a codeword.'
"Ammo," yes, you said.
How's your Latin, brother dear?
My Latin?
Amo, amas, amat.
I love, you love, he loves.
What...?
Not "Ammo" as in ammunition, but "Amo", meaning?
You'd better be right, Sherlock.
Bloody thing!
What's going on?
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.
What?
'So many lies.
And I don't just mean you.'
- Hello.
- Ah, hello.
- I like your daisy.
- Thank you, yeah.
It's not really me, though, I think.
- No?
- No, no, it's too floral for me.
I'm more of a "knackered with weary old eyes" kind of guy.
Well, I think they're nice.
Nice eyes.
- [HE LAUGHS] Thank you.
- Look...
Look...
I don't normally do this,
- but, um...
- But you're going to.
Yeah.
- What's this?
- This is me.
- Thank you.
Cheers.
- Yeah.
Great.
- Bye!
- Bye.
[HE CHUCKLES]

[PHONE BEEPS]
_
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
Hmm?
Noticed what?
The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
[BABY CRIES]
- Yeah, can't she?
- Hmm.
I'm coming darling.
I'm coming.
[PHONE BEEPS]
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
- _
- Come here...
It's OK.
_
- _
- Do you want a cuddle?
[BABY CONTINUES TO WAIL]
_
I know.
- Oh, sweetheart.
- _
_
Ssh.
Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you?
_
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?
Oh, let's go and see Daddy!
Daddy's here.
It's OK, Rosie.
I'll take her.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I may as well get up now.
Hey, baby, it's Daddy.
Your daddy.
Come here, Rose.
Come here, darling, it's all right.
Thank you.
_
_
This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.
How many more times?
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.
And you're basing all this on a code name?
On a whispered voice on the telephone?
Come on, Mycroft.
You were the conduit for AGRA.
Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
It was my job.
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
AGRA went in.
- Yes.
- And they were betrayed.
Not by me.
Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.
I promise you,
I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.
You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.
Not one.
Not.
One.
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories?
I'd like to do those.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.
Although she does seem to enjoy them.
Well, I'll have to give that a go.
Got a lot to catch up on.
AJAY: 'You think you understand.
You understand nothing.'
MYCROFT: 'Code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love.'
MARY: 'You'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.
'They know everything.'
'They said it was the English woman.'
'Don't minute any of this.'
'They know everything.'
- You don't make it easy, do you?
- What do you mean?
Well, being... being so perfect.
Mary, I...
I need to tell you...
- [PHONE BEEPS]
- Hang on.
Can you tell me later?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Great.
Well, no, we can't just go.
- Rosie.
- Yeah.
- Er, you go.
- No!
I'll come as soon as I've found someone.
Mrs Hudson.
- Corfu till Saturday.
Molly?
- Er, yeah, I'll try.
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.
You know that's not going to happen.
If there's more to this case, you need to see it.
Yeah, OK, you win.
'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes.
'Please make your way to the exit.
Thank you.'
Your office said I'd find you here.
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.
We're like them.
Ghostly, living in the shadows.
Predatory?
Well, it depends which side you're on.
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.
Nice location for the final act, couldn't have chosen it better myself.
But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.
I just come here to look at the fish.
I knew this would happen one day.
- It's like that old story.
- I really am a very busy man.
Would you mind cutting to the chase?
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
With good reason.
"There was once a merchant, in a famous market in Baghdad."
I really have never liked this story.
I'm just like the merchant in the story,
I thought I could out-run the inevitable.
I've always been looking over my shoulder, always expecting to see the grim figure of...
Death.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hey.
- John?
- On his way.
Let me introduce Ammo.
You were Ammo?
You were the person on the phone that time?
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
Why did you betray us?
Why does anyone do anything?
- Hmm.
- Let me guess, selling secrets?
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.
Worked very well for a few years.
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it.
But...
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.
[SHE CHUCKLES] I couldn't believe my luck!
That bought me a little time.
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
Very handy.
They were always such reliable killers.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.
Lady Smallwood gave the order.
But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.
Seemed to do the trick.
And you thought your troubles were over.
I was tired.
Tired of the mess of it all.
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.
The hostages were killed.
AGRA too.
Or so I thought.
My secret was safe.
But... apparently not.
Just a little peace.
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
A family?
Home?
Really, I understand.
So, just let me get out of here, right?
Let me just walk away.
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.
What do you say?
After what you did?
!
Mary, no!
OK.
London Aquarium.
Yes, now.
I was never a field agent.
I always thought I'd be rather good.
[MARY SCOFFS]
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
Thanks.
- For a secretary.
- What?
It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
- I didn't do this out of jealousy.
- No?
Same old drudge, day in, day out.
Never getting out there where all the excitement was.
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.
Yes, your little flat.
- How do you know?
- Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?
And what are you, widowed or divorced?
Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.
That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.
- Sherlock...
- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.
A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.
- Sherlock, don't.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.
There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
That accounts for the drink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.
So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.
To prove how good you are.
To make up for the inadequacies of your...
little life.
Well, Mrs Norbury,
I must admit this is unexpected.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.
All except Sherlock Holmes.
There's no way out.
So it would seem.
You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.
It's what I do.
Maybe I can still surprise you.
Now, come on, be sensible.
Hmm, no, I don't think so.
Ah!
Surprise!
[MARY GASPS FOR AIR]
[MARY GROANS]
Everything's fine.
It's going to be OK.
Get an ambulance!
It's all right, it's all right.
- Mary!
- John.
All right, Mary?
Mary?
Stay with me, stay with me.
- Oh, come on...
- No, don't worry.
Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
Come on, Mary.
Mary?
Oh, God.
John, I think this is it.
No, no, no, no.
It's not.
- That's...
- You made me so happy.
You gave me everything I could ever, ever have wanted...
Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.
- Look after Rosie.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.
- Promise me.
- I promise.
- No...
- Yes, I promise.
- Promise me!
- I promise, I promise.
Ssh, ssh.
Hey, Sherlock.
Yes.
I... so like you.
Did I ever say?
Yes, yes, you did.
I'm sorry for... for shooting you that time.
I'm really sorry.
It's all right.
I think we're even now, OK?
OK.
- Oh, I think we're...
- Mary, Mary...
- ...even, definitely even.
- Ssh, ssh.
You were my whole world.
Being Mary Watson was the only life worth living.
- Mary...
- Thank you.
Mary...
[HE BEWAILS]
Don't you dare!
You made a vow.
You swore it.
[PHONE BEEPS REPEATEDLY]
'You've been having dreams.
A recurring dream?
'
[CLOCK TICKS RHYTHMICALLY]
Do you want to talk about it?
This is a two-way relationship, you know.
[SHE SIGHS]
The whole world has come crashing down around you.
Everything's hopeless.
Irretrievable.
I know that's what you must feel but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
That's not really my style.
I need to know what to do.
Do?
About John.
[BACK CRACKS, HE GROANS]
Put me through to Sherrinford, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
SOBS:
But nothing will ever be the same again, will it?
I'm afraid it won't.
We'll have to rally round, I expect, do our bit.
Look after little Rosie.
I'm just going to, um look through these things.
There might be a case.
A case?
Oh, you're not up to it, are you?
Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.
Yes.
Yes, I expect you're right.
I'll make some tea, shall I?
- Mrs Hudson?
- Yes, Sherlock?
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident...
- Yes?
- ...would you just say the word Norbury to me?
Would you?
Norbury?
Just that.
I'd be very grateful.
What's this?
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.
Oh, God!
Is that...?
- Must be.
- Oh.
I knew it wouldn't end like this.
I knew Moriarty made plans.
'I thought that would get your attention.
So, this is in case...
In case the day comes.
If you are watching this, I'm probably dead.
I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows?
Nothing's certain, nothing's written.
My old life it was full of consequences.
The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.
You need to remember that.
So I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
Might be the hardest case of your career.
When I'm... gone, if I'm gone I need you to do something for me.'
- [BABY GURGLES]
- Hi.
I just wondered how things were going and if there was anything I could do.
It's, er, it's from John.
- Right.
- You don't need to read it now.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.
He says...
John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...
Yes?
He said he'd that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Anyone.
[DOOR CLOSES]
'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
When I'm gone, if I'm... gone I need you to do something for me.
Save John Watson.
Save him, Sherlock.
Save him.'
'When does the path we walk on lock around our feet?
When does the road become a river with only one destination?
'
'Death waits for us all in Samarra.
But can Samarra be avoided?
'
Go to hell, Sherlock!
My brother is a murderer.
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.
Oh, do your research.
I'm not a hero
- I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Merry Christmas!
I'm not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.
You know what happened to the other one.
Miss me?
'Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
'
I've only been gone four minutes.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Is that quite clear?
Don't minute any of this.
Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.
A D notice has been slapped on the entire incident.
Only those within this room, code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love, will ever know the whole truth.
As far as everyone else is concerned, going to the Prime Minister and way beyond, Charles Augustus...
- Are you tweeting?
!
- No.
- Well, that's what it looks like!
- Of course I'm not tweeting.
- Why would I be tweeting?
- Give me that!
- What?
No!
- What are you doing?
!
Get off!
- Give it here!
- "Back on terra firma."
- Don't read them out.
- "Free as a bird."
- God, you're such a spoilsport.
- Will you take this matter seriously, Sherlock?
- I am!
What makes you think I'm not taking it seriously?
"#OhWhatABeautifulMorning"
Look, not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death - my death!
And now I'm back, in a nice warm office, with my big brother and...
Are those ginger nuts?
- Oh, God...
- LOVE ginger nuts.
Our doctor said you were clean.
I am.
Utterly.
No need for stimulants now, remember?
I have work to do.
You're high as a kite!
Natural high, I assure you.
Totally natural.
I'm just... #.. glad to be alive!
#
What shall we do next?
What's your name?
Vivian.
- What would you do, Vivian?
- Pardon?
Well, it's a lovely day.
Go for a stroll?
Make a paper aeroplane?
Have an ice lolly?
Ice lolly, I suppose.
Ice lolly it is!
- What's your favourite?
- Well, really, I shouldn't...
- Go on.
- Do they still do Mivvies?
- Mr Holmes...
- Yes?
- .. we do need to get on.
- Yes, of course.
'Do your research.
'I'm not a hero
- I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
'.. sociopath.
I see.
Who is supposed to have shot him, then?
Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger - that's who.
- That's not what happened at all.
- It is now.
Remarkable.
How did you do it?
We have some very talented people working here.
If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.
That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.
No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.
You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.
You're home and dry.
OK, cheers.
Obviously, there's unfinished business.
Moriarty.
I told you
- Moriarty's dead.
You say he filmed that video message before he died.
Yes.
You also say you know what he's going to do next.
- What does that mean?
- Perhaps that's all there is to it.
Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
No, no, he would never be that disappointing.
He's planned something, something long-term.
Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.
Posthumous revenge.
No, better than that - posthumous game.
We brought you back to deal with this.
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.
Wait?
!
Of course wait.
I'm the target - targets wait.
Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up,
I'll know when it begins.
I always know when the game is on.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because I love it.
There was once a merchant, in the famous market at Baghdad.
One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise, and he knew that the stranger was Death.
Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles, to the city of Samarra.
For there he was sure Death could not find him.
But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.
"Very well," said the merchant.
"I give in.
I am yours."
"But tell me, why did you look surprised
"when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"
"Because," said Death,
"I had an appointment with you tonight...
".. in Samarra."
If this gets any better, I'm going to get two knives.
Pays to advertise.
- So, what about Moriarty, then?
- Oh, I have a plan.
I'm going to monitor the underworld, every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
So, basically, your plan is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do?
Awesome, isn't it?
He drowned, Mr Holmes.
That's what we thought.
But when they opened up his lungs...
- Yes?
- .. sand.
Superficial.
Come back!
It's the wrong thumb.
- Sherlock...
- It's never twins.
Hopkins, arrest Wilson.
Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.
- 'Wilson?
' - 'Lymph nodes?
'
Sherlock...
Yes, you may have nothing but a limbless torso, but there'll be traces of ink in the lymph nodes under the armpits.
If your mystery corpse had tattoos, the signs will be there.
- 'Bloody hell!
Is that a guess?
'
- I never guess.
- Sherlock...
- 'So, he's the killer?
The canary trainer?
'
- Of course he's the killer.
- 'Didn't see that coming.'
Hm, naturally.
Sherlock, you can't go on spinning plates like this.
That's it!
The place was spinning.
The heart medication you're taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.
Yes, I...
I think so.
Why?
Because the fingerprints on your brother's neck were your own.
- A jellyfish?
- I know.
You can't arrest a jellyfish.
- You could try.
- We did try.
- Oh, God.
- Mary?
- 59 missed calls.
We're in a lot of trouble.
Ow!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Relax, it's got two syllables...
I'm a nurse, darling
- I think I know what to do!
- Come on, then...
- Re!
- Lax!
No, just drive, please, God, just drive!
God, drive!
- Sherlock
- Mary!
That's it, Mary - re...
- Don't you start!
- ..
lax.
John, John...
I think you have to pull over!
- Mary, Mary...
- Pull over!
Oh, my God!
Has that come out?
- They never come out when I take them.
- Let's have a look.
Aw, she's so beautiful.
- Have another go.
- What about a name?
- Catherine.
- Uh, yeah, we've gone off that.
- Have we?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Well, you know what I think...
- It's not a girl's name.
Molly, Mrs H, we would love you to be godparents.
- Oh!
- If you...
- Really?
- That's so lovely.
And, uh... you too, Sherlock?
- You too what?
- Godfather, we'd like you to be godfather.
God is a ludicrous fiction, dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.
Yeah, but there'll be cake.
Will you do it?
I'll get back to you.
Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.
In Christ's name.
Now, what name have you given your daughter?
Rosamund Mary.
Rosamund?
It means "Rose of the world".
Rosie for short.
Didn't you get John's text?
No.
I delete his texts.
I delete any text that begins "Hi."
No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.
Sorry.
Phone!
And now, godparents, are you ready to help the parents of this child in their duties as Christian parents?
We are.
'Sorry, I didn't catch that.
'Please repeat the question.'
As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.
To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
Hard logic versus romantic whimsy - that is your choice.
You fail to connect actions to their consequences.
Now, for the last time, if you want to keep the rattle, do not throw the rattle.
All right, good girl, good girl.
Good girl.
I'd better finish this, hadn't I?
- Hey.
- Afternoon.
He says you've got a good one, Greg?
Oh, yeah.
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.
God, 50!
Where does it go?
I know for a fact I was only 21 this time last week.
Yeah, well that's impossible.
That was before you met me.
- Well, no, no, there never was...
- "There never was such a time."
She's looking at me disapprovingly again.
No.
She's just jealous.
Yeah, well, I think we both are.
- Oh...
- No, no, David.
- Come on, you promised.
- No, it's...
Oh, no...
Oh, it's a Skype call.
Oh!
Then it must be Charlie.
At least he's phoning, I suppose.
Oh, look!
Hello!
'Hey, Dad.
Happy birthday.
'Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?
'
No!
Picture's frozen!
'Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you.'
Why is it rubbish?
Where are you?
- How is he?
Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.
- No...
David?
Come on!
OK, no, hang on a sec, I'll find somewhere quieter.
So, Charlie, where are you?
Are you there?
- 'Sorry, I'm here.
I'm just a bit...'
- Are you all right?
- 'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
- Altitude?
- 'I'm in Tibet.
Didn't you see the mountains?
'
- Never mind mountains.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.
- 'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?
'
- What?
- 'Could you just check something on my car?
'
- Your car?
'To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe
'I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet.
- 'Could you take a photo and send it?
'
- Uh, yes, I can do that.
All done.
Have you got it?
Charlie?
A week later...
Yeah?
.. something really weird happens.
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed, the cops are chasing him, and he turns into the drive of the Welsborough house to try and get away.
Unfortunately...
The drunk guy survived, they managed to pull him out, but when they put the fire out and examined the parked car...
Whose body?
Charlie Welsborough, the son.
- What?
- The son who was in Tibet.
DNA all checks out.
Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.
- Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
- Have you got a lab report?
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.
- The seats?
- Yes, the car seats.
Made of vinyl.
Two different types of vinyl present.
Was it his own car?
Yeah, not flash - he was a student.
- Well, that's suggestive.
- Why?
- Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
- Yeah, right?
- There's something else.
- Yes?
According to this,
Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.
What?
The body in the car, dead for a week.
Oh, this is a good one.
Is it my birthday?
You want help?
- Yes, please. - One condition.
- OK.
Take all the credit.
It gets boring if I just solve them all.
Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.
He's got a point.
Which makes me look like some kind of prima donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do!
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.
- Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
- Definitely a sore spot.
- So you take all the glory, thanks...
- OK!
-.. thanks all the same.
Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?
It's driving me nuts.
Anything you say, Giles.
Just kidding.
What's his name?
- Greg.
- What?
Greg.
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?
Not a clue.
It's just you normally say that at this point.
Hmm.
Well, then, let's hope you solve your little problem, Greg.
- Hear that?
- I know.
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood?
- Oh, good, great.
Yeah, amazing.
- Getting any sleep?
- Christ, no.
You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.
- Must feel very different...
- Sorry, what?
Yes, well, you know how it is.
All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.
- Are you two having a little joke?
- Never a word of thanks.
Can't even tell people's faces apart.
This is a joke, isn't it?
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever.
You're so, so clever."
- Is it about me?
- I think he needs winding.
- You know, I think that really might be it.
- No, don't get it.
Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect, so go easy on them, yeah?
- You know me.
- 'Hey, hello.'
- Yeah.
- Got them, don't worry.
Pampers, the cream you can't get from Boots.
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now?
- At the dead boy's house?
- Yeah.
'And what does he think?
Any theories?
'
Well, I texted you the details.
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.
- Hey!
- How do you know about that?
'Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.'
- They know everything!
- 'Solved it, then?
'
- I'm working on it.
- 'Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.'
- Pig!
- Keep trying.
'So, what about it, then?
'What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it?
'And what are you going to call this one?
'
Oh, the Ghost Driver.
- Don't give it a title.
- People like the titles.
- They hate the titles.
- Give the people what they want.
No, never do that - people are stupid.
Uh, SOME people.
'All people are stupid.
'Most people.'
'Bizarre enough though, isn't it, to be him?
'
I mean, it's right up your strasse.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry
- to hear about your daughter.
- Son.
- Son!
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.
If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.
Well, I believe that I... .. can.
But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
Sherlock?
Mr Holmes?
Sorry, you were saying?
Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
I don't think we'll ever get over this.
No.
Shouldn't think so.
So sorry, will you excuse me a moment?
I just...
I'll...
I'll just, um...
Ahem.
- Now what's wrong?
- Not sure, I just...
By the pricking of my thumbs.
Seriously?
You?
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.
They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.
What is this?
Oh, it's a sort of shrine, I suppose, really.
Bit of a fan of Mrs T.
A big hero of mine when I was getting started.
Right, yes.
- Who?
- What?
- Who...?
Who was this?
- Are you serious?
- Sherlock...
- It's...
It's Margaret Thatcher, the first female Prime Minister of this country.
Right.
- Prime Minister?
- Hmm.
Leader of the Government.
- Right.
Female?
For God's sake!
You know perfectly well who she is.
Why are you playing for time?
It's the gap, look at the gap.
It's wrong.
Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed.
The whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.
This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been in, this picture is straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.
- Something's missing from here, but only recently.
- Yes, a...
- Plaster bust.
- .. plaster bust.
Oh, for God's sake!
It got broken.
What the hell has this got to do with Charlie?
- Rug!
- What?
- Well, how could it get broken?
The only place for it to fall is the floor and there is a big thick rug.
- Does it matter?
- Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.
- It is worth letting him do this.
- Is your friend quite mad?
No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
We found the remains out there in the porch.
- The porch where we came in?
- How anybody could hate her so much they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness...
I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.
Why didn't he smash all the others?
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.
Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.
- And if there's nothing...
- I know what happened to your son.
You do?
It's quite simple, superficial, to be blunt.
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness?
- Well, yes.
- And the porch where it was smashed,
I noticed the motion sensor was damaged,
- so I assume it's permanently lit.
- How did you notice that?
I lack the arrogance to ignore details
- I'm not the police.
- So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.
- Exactly.
- Why?
- Don't know.
Wouldn't be fun if I knew.
Mr Holmes, please!
It was your 50th birthday, Mr Welsborough, of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
- After all, he was in Tibet.
- Yes.
- No.
- No?
# Happy birthday... #
The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video.
Easily arranged.
It's a Skype call.
The trick was meant to be a surprise.
- A trick?
- Obviously.
Could you take a photo and send it?
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.
Well, good enough.
Effectively a costume.
You're joking?
No, I'm not.
All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
- Oh, my God!
- Surprise!
That's when it happened.
I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.
You said he'd felt unwell?
You all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
He died there and then.
No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained, in the driver's seat, hidden, until...
When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who'd been sitting there, quite dead, for a week.
Oh, God!
Poor kid.
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.
This is where it was smashed.
That was amazing.
- What?
- The car, the kid.
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?
I can't stand it, never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
What kind of a life would that be?
Besides, I have the strangest feeling...
Miss me?
- That's mine.
You two take a... bus.
- Why?
I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.
The Mall, please.
- I met her once.
- Thatcher?
- Rather arrogant, I thought.
- YOU thought that?
!
- Ha, I know.
Why am I looking at this?
That's her, John and Mary's baby.
Oh, I see, yes.
Looks very... fully functioning.
Is that really the best you can do?
Sorry, I've never been very good with them.
- Babies?
- Humans.
Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?
Any interest in her?
Why on earth would he?
I don't know.
You tell me.
In the last year of his life,
James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over 70 assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias,
which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.
It's a pearl - get another one.
There's something important about this.
I'm sure.
Maybe it's Moriarty.
Maybe it's not.
But something's coming.
Are you having a premonition, brother mine?
The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other.
What we call premonition is just movement of the web.
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable.
As inevitable as mathematics.
- Appointment In Samarra.
- I'm sorry?
The merchant who can't outrun Death.
You always hated that story as a child.
Less keen on predestination back then.
I'm not sure I like it now.
You wrote your own version, as I remember.
Appointment In Sumatra.
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.
Goodnight, Mycroft.
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.
- Keep me informed.
- Of what?
- Absolutely no idea.
'Ammo!
'
- Oh, hi, Stella.
- Greg.
- You, uh...?
- Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...
- Right, right, right...
Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?
It's nothing.
I mean it's nothing serious.
No, no.
I just pop round every now and again for a chat.
Yeah, of course.
I mean he loves a really tricky case.
Yeah, he does!
So what you here for?
Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so...
The Borgia Pearl?
They still after that, are they?
Yeah.
So, how did you two first meet?
Oh, well, there was a case about, um, ten years ago.
Nobody could figure it out.
There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.
- Oh, yeah?
How did she die?
- Hypothermia.
What?
I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...
Will you two please keep it down?
!
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?
You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left hard manual work does that.
I was a carpenter.
Like me dad.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
How the hell...?
Ah... e-cigarettes.
Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.
If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.
But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last.
Anything to add, John?
- John?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.
- What is that?
- That is... me.
Well, it's a me substitute.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You know I value your little contributions.
Yeah?
It's been there since nine this morning.
- Has it?
Where were you?
- Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.
- What about my girlfriend?
- What?
- You said I had an ex...
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.
The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.
I...
I thought you'd done something clever.
Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
What do you mean?
Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
- Well...
- You thought she was having an affair.
I'm afraid it's far worse than that - your wife is a spy.
What?
That's right.
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy, across the road from your flat.
Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy, as part of an official state visit.
As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.
This drug will render the President entirely susceptible ...to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty.
What?
Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III.
- Are you serious?
- No, of course not.
His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.
I don't!
- Just the bras.
- Get out.
So, what's this all about, then?
- Having fun.
- Fun?
While I can.
- Uh, Sherlock...
- Borgia Pearl.
Boring.
Go!
- But...
- Go!
- This had better be good.
- Oh, I think you'll like it.
That is the bust, isn't it?
The one that was broken.
No, it's another one - different owner.
Different part of town.
You were right - this is a thing.
Something's going on.
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be pleased.
- I am pleased.
- You don't look pleased.
This is my game face.
And the game is on.
Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one.
- One belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan.
- Identical busts?
Yeah, and this one to a Dr Barnicot in Holborn.
Three in total.
God knows who'd want to do something like this.
Yeah, but some people have that complex, don't they?
An idee fixe.
They obsess over one thing and they can't let it go.
No, no good.
There were other images of Margaret...
Margaret...?
You know who she is.
.. Thatcher, present at the first break-in.
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?
Ooh!
- What?
- Blood.
Quite a bit of it, too.
Was there any injury at the crime scene?
Nah.
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.
Come on.
- Holborn?
- Lambeth!
- Lambeth?
Why?
- To see Toby.
Ah, right.
Who?
- You'll see.
- Right, are you coming?
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.
- Who told you?
- The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.
- Have a good time.
- I will.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
- What?
- She's not the one.
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.
How do you work all that out?
She's got three children in Rio that he doesn't know about.
- Are you just making this up?
- Possibly.
- Who's Toby?
There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker, one of the world's best.
Got himself into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago.
He hacked into the Pentagon security system, and I managed to get him off the charge.
Therefore he owes me a favour.
- So, how does that help us?
- What?
- Toby the hacker?
- Toby's not the hacker.
- What?
- All right, Craig?
- All right, Sherlock?
Craig's got a dog.
So I see.
Good boy!
Hiya!
Mary?
What are you...?
No, we, we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case.
No, exactly.
So... don't wait up.
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Hey.
Mary, what are you doing here?
- She's better at this than you.
- Better?
- So I texted her.
Hang on, Mary's better than me?
Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.
- Of course she's better.
- Yeah, OK.
Nothing personal.
What, so I'm supposed to just go home now, am I?
What do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?
John or the dog?
- Ha-ha, that's funny!
- John.
- Well...
- He's handy and loyal.
- That's hilarious.
- Is it too early for a divorce?
Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge?
Keep up, he's fast.
- He's not moving.
- He's thinking.
He's really not moving.
Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.
You just like this dog, don't you?
- Well, I like you.
- He's still not moving.
- Fascinating.
- Oh!
Well, what do you make of it?
- They were looking for something.
- Yes, but it wasn't a burglar, they came specifically for that Thatcher bust.
Why?
Clever.
Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail,
- where would you go?
- Like hiding a tree in a forest.
Or blood in a butcher's.
Never mind, Toby, better luck next time, hmm?
This is it, though.
This is the one, I can feel it.
Not Moriarty?
It has to be him.
It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.
It's designed to beguile me, tease me and lure me in.
At last, a noose for me to put my neck into.
You should have seen the state of the front room.
- It was like The Exorcist.
- Huh.
Was Rosie's head spinning round?
- No.
Just the projectile vomiting.
- Nice!
- Hmm.
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
- Hmm?
Noticed what?
- The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
Yeah, can't she?
I'm coming, darling.
Mummy's coming.
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here.
Have you heard of that thing?
In Germany?
You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.
Ostalgie.
People who missed the old days under the communists.
- People are weird, aren't they?
- Hmm.
According to this, there's quite a market for Cold War memorabilia.
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit?
Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.
Yes, fascinating.
Irrelevant.
Where exactly did they come from?
I've got into the records of the suppliers
- Gelder and Co.
Seems they're from Georgia.
Where exactly?
Tbilisi.
Batch of six.
One to Welsborough.
One to Hassan.
One to Dr Barnicot.
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.
One to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.
Lestrade?
Another one?
- 'Yeah.'
- Harker or Sandeford?
Harker.
And it's murder this time.
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.
Defensive wounds on her face and hands, throat cut.
Sharp blade.
The same thing inside the house?
The bust?
- Two of them this time.
- Interesting.
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago.
- Limited edition of six.
- And now someone's wandering about destroying them all.
Makes no sense.
What's the point?
No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.
- Yes, it is.
- Well, it is, but it's not the point.
I've been slow, far too slow.
Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind...
Slow but lucky, very lucky.
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.
Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.
Congratulations, by the way.
- I'm sorry?
- Well, you're about to solve a big one.
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
- Yeah, until then, basically.
That's enough now, love.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.
And you need to get to bed.
Come on.
Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?
You were on the run.
Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying, it's clever.
Very clever.
But now you've met me and you're not so clever, are you?
Who are you?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.
Argh!
You're out of time.
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
- Who?
I know it's him.
It must be him.
You think you understand.
You understand nothing.
Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don't we just enjoy the moment?
Let me present Interpol's number one case.
Too tough for them, too boring for me.
The Black Pearl of the Borgias!
It's not possible!
How could she...?
!
Everything about who I was is on there.
The problems of your past are your business.
The problems of your future... .. are my privilege.
I don't understand.
She...
She destroyed it.
She?
You know her!
You do, don't you?
You know the bitch?
!
She betrayed me.
- Betrayed us all.
- Mary.
This is about Mary?
Is that what she's calling herself now, eh?
- 'Armed police, you're surrounded!
'
- Give it to me.
Give it to me!
'Come out slowly, I want to see your hands above your head.'
Nobody shoots me!
Anyone shoots, I kill this man.
'Lay down your weapon.
Do it now!
'
I'm leaving this place.
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.
'Lay down your weapon.'
You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
Tell her she's a dead woman.
She's a dead woman walking.
She's my friend.
And she's under my protection.
Who are you?
I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.
Who's Sherlock Holmes?
Not a policeman.
What do you think?
Mate in two?
Don't antagonise them, darling.
Oh, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.
Everything palls.
They'll send someone soon.
They?
Who are THEY?
Seems to me we put an awful lot of faith in THEY.
Well, I've got something THEY would dearly love, if only we could get out of here.
I've got Ammo.
Ammo?
- Madame Ambassador.
- What took you so long?
- Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now!
Veer left!
What now?
What do we do?
We die.
Well?
He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.
- I very much doubt it.
- Why?
Because I think he used to work with Mary.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out!
We'll come back later.
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the English woman?
What would you do to a traitor?
Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.
I am an idiot, I know nothing.
Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
That was quite a text you sent me.
What's going on, Sherlock?
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,
I couldn't see what was right under my nose.
Expected a pearl.
Oh, my God, that's a...
Yes, it's an AGRA. memory stick, like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.
Who?
I don't know.
We...
We all had one but the others were...
Haven't you even looked at it yet?
I glanced at it but I prefer to hear it from you.
- Why?
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.
There were four of us, agents.
Not just agents.
Polite term.
Alex.
Gabriel.
Me.
And Ajay.
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.
We all had one.
Each containing aliases, our background, everything.
We could never be betrayed, because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.
- Who employed you?
- Anyone who paid well.
I mean, we were at the top of our game for years.
And then it all ended.
There was a coup in Georgia.
The British Embassy in Tbilisi was taken over, lots of hostages.
We got the call to go in, get them out.
There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.
- Who from?
I don't know, just another voice on the phone.
And a codeword.
- Ammo.
- Ammo?
Like ammunition.
We went in, but then something went wrong.
Something went really wrong.
That was six years ago.
It feels like forever.
I was the only one that made it out.
No.
What?
I met someone tonight.
Same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.
What, he's alive?
Yeah, very much so.
I don't believe it, this is amazing!
I thought I was the only one,
I thought I was the only one who got out.
Where is he?
I need to see him, now!
Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?
Yeah, of course.
It was our insurance.
Above all, they mustn't fall into enemy hands.
So Ajay survived as well.
And now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide, with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why?
I don't know.
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
SHE LAUGHS
Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.
Families fall out.
The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
Well, he's just trying to find me.
He survived, that's all that matters!
I heard it from his own mouth.
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."
Why would he want to kill me?
- He said you betrayed him.
- Oh, no, no, that's insane.
Well, it's what he believes.
I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.
No, Mary...
You do.
I made a vow, remember?
To look after the three of you.
Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
There's something I think you should read.
What is it?
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.
What are you...?
Mary...
- There you go.
- Oh, no!
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.
No.
You just look after them till I get back.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Agra?
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
It is 378km west of the state capital, Lucknow.
What are you, Wikipedia?
- Yes.
- AGRA is an acronym.
Oh, good, I love an acronym.
All the best secret societies have them.
Team of agents, the best.
But you know all that.
Of course I do.
Go on.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.
Indeed?
Well, that's news to me.
Is it?
He's already killed looking for that memory stick.
AGRA always worked for the highest bidder,
I thought that might include you?
- Me?
- Well, I mean the British government, or whatever government you're currently propping up.
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.
They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong.
And that was that, we stopped using freelancers.
- Your initiative?
- My initiative.
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.
I don't like loose ends.
Not on my watch.
There was something else.
A detail.
A codeword.
Ammo?
It's all I've got.
Little enough.
Could you do some digging as a favour?
You don't have many favours left.
Then I'm calling them all in.
And if you can find who's after her and neutralise them, what then?
You think you can go on saving her forever?
Of course.
Is that sentiment talking?
No, it's me.
Difficult to tell the difference these days.
Told you, I made a promise.
A vow.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.
Not on my watch.
- MARY:
- 'My darling, I need to tell you this 'because you mustn't hate me for going away.'
Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.
- Can you hear a squeaking?
- No.
Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel...
Why Planes Fail.
- Did you see it?
- Can't say I did.
- Oh, truly terrifying.
Swore I would never fly again, yet hear I am!
Ha.
Everything OK, madam?
No.
No, no, it's not, but then what's the use in complaining?
I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off is all.
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.
Oh, OK.
Relax.
She said relax.
Did you have a nice time in London?
It was OK, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun?
- Did you lose it in the war?
- SHE LAUGHS
'I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.
'I'm not running, I promise you that,
'I just need to do this in my own way.'
Oh, God!
I'm...
I-I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God!
- Everything OK, madam?
- I think I'm dying.
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.
God will smile on you.
'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,
'I'm sorry, my love.'
'I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.
'Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate 'the roll of a dice.
'I need to move the target far, far away from you 'and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
'I swear I will.'
Not like this one.
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in!
I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.
Mr Baker.
Well, that completes the set.
- No, it does not.
- Well, who else am I missing?
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?
Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.
Oh, hi, Mary.
What concept?
Happy families.
Nice trip?
- How the f...?
- Please, Mary, there is a child present.
- How did you get in here?
- Karim let me in.
Hello.
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Nice to meet you, missus.
No, I mean how did you find me?
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
No, really, though, how?
Every movement I made was entirely random, every new personality just on the roll of a dice!
Mary, no human action is ever truly random.
An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability, mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual, can reduce the number of variables considerably.
I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine a seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.
But they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.
Oh, you bastard!
- You bastard!
- I know, but your face!
"The mathematics of probability"?
- You believed that.
- "Feasible variables"?
Yes, I started to run out about then.
In the memory stick!
Yeah, that was my idea.
- AGRA?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
You said it was your initials.
In a way that was true.
In a way?
So many lies.
I'm so sorry.
And I don't just mean you.
What?
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...
You're R?
Rosamund?
Rosamund Mary.
I always liked Mary.
Yeah, me too.
I used to.
I just...
I didn't know what else to do.
You could have stayed, you could have talked to me.
That's what couples are supposed to do.
Work things through.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Mary, I may not be a very good man... .. but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for,
- most of the time.
- All the time.
You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.
You never judge, you never complain.
I don't deserve you, I...
All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
I will keep you safe.
But it has to be in London.
It's my city, I know the turf.
Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.
Get down!
Hello again.
- Ajay?
- Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.
Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.
I thought I was the only one who got out.
How did you find us?
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.
You found her but I found you.
So perhaps not so clever.
And now here we are.
At last.
Touche!
Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
She thought I was dead.
I might as well have been.
It was always just the four of us, always, remember?
Oh, yeah.
So why do you want to kill me?
Do you know how long they kept me prisoner?
What they did to me?
They tortured Alex to death.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.
But you?
You, where were you?
That day at the embassy, I escaped.
Ha!
But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
Where were you?
Oh, I got out.
For a while.
Long enough to hide my memory stick.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.
I was loyal, you see.
Loyal to my friends.
But they took me, tortured me.
Not for information.
Not for anything except fun.
They thought I'd give in, die, but I didn't, I lived.
And eventually, they forgot about me rotting in a cell somewhere.
Six years they kept me there.
Until one day I saw my chance.
Oh, and I made them pay.
You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.
Little whispers.
Laughter.
Gossip.
How the clever agents had been betrayed.
Brought down by you!
Me?
You know I'll kill you too.
You know I will, Ajay.
What, you think I care if I die?
I've dreamed of killing you... .. every night for six years.
Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.
I swear to you, Ajay.
What did you hear, Ajay?
When you were a prisoner, what EXACTLY did you hear?
What did I hear?
Ammo.
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo.
"Ammo.
"Ammo.
Ammo."
We were betrayed!
- And they said it was her?
- That you betrayed us!
They said her name?
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.
No!
No!
'The English woman, that's all he heard.
'Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.'
Couldn't this wait until you're back?
No, it's not over.
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed, the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.
There was only a voice on the phone.
'Remember?
And a codeword.'
"Ammo," yes, you said.
How's your Latin, brother dear?
My Latin?
Amo, amas, amat.
I love, you love, he loves.
What...?
Not "Ammo" as in ammunition, but "Amo", meaning?
You'd better be right, Sherlock.
Bloody thing!
What's going on?
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.
What?
'So many lies.
And I don't just mean you.'
- Hello.
- Ah, hello.
- I like your daisy.
- Thank you, yeah.
- It's not really me, though, I think.
- No?
- No, no, it's too floral for me.
I'm more of a "knackered with weary old eyes" kind of guy.
Well, I think they're nice.
Nice eyes.
- Thank you.
- Look...
Look...
I don't normally do this,
- but, um...
- But you're going to.
Yeah.
- What's this?
- This is me.
- Thank you.
Cheers.
- Yeah.
Great.
- Bye!
- Bye.
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
Hmm?
Noticed what?
The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
- Yeah, can't she?
- Hmm.
I'm coming darling.
I'm coming.
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here...
It's OK.
Do you want a cuddle?
I know.
Oh, sweetheart.
Ssh.
Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you?
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?
Oh, let's go and see Daddy!
Daddy's here.
It's OK, Rosie.
I'll take her.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I may as well get up now.
Hey, baby, it's Daddy.
Your daddy.
Come here, Rose.
Come here, darling, it's all right.
Thank you.
This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.
How many more times?
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.
And you're basing all this on a code name?
On a whispered voice on the telephone?
Come on, Mycroft.
You were the conduit for AGRA.
Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
It was my job.
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
AGRA went in.
- Yes.
- And they were betrayed.
Not by me.
Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.
I promise you,
I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.
You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.
Not one.
Not.
One.
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories?
I'd like to do those.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.
Although she does seem to enjoy them.
Well, I'll have to give that a go.
Got a lot to catch up on.
'You think you understand.
You understand nothing.'
'Code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love.'
'You'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.
'They know everything.'
'They said it was the English woman.'
'Don't minute any of this.'
'They know everything.'
- You don't make it easy, do you?
- What do you mean?
Well, being... being so perfect.
Mary, I...
I need to tell you...
Hang on.
Can you tell me later?
- Yeah. - Great.
- Yeah.
Well, no, we can't just go.
- Rosie.
- Yeah.
- Er, you go.
- No!
I'll come as soon as I've found someone
- Mrs Hudson.
- Corfu till Saturday.
Molly?
- Er, yeah, I'll try.
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.
You know that's not going to happen.
If there's more to this case, you need to see it.
Yeah, OK, you win.
'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes.
'Please make your way to the exit.
Thank you.'
Your office said I'd find you here.
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.
We're like them.
Ghostly, living in the shadows.
Predatory?
Well, it depends which side you're on.
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.
Nice location for the final act, couldn't have chosen it better myself.
But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.
I just come here to look at the fish.
I knew this would happen one day.
- It's like that old story.
- I really am a very busy man.
Would you mind cutting to the chase?
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
With good reason.
"There was once a merchant, in a famous market in Baghdad."
I really have never liked this story.
I'm just like the merchant in the story,
I thought I could out-run the inevitable.
I've always been looking over my shoulder,
- always expecting to see the grim figure of...
- Death.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hey.
- John?
- On his way.
Let me introduce Ammo.
You were Ammo?
You were the person on the phone that time?
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
Why did you betray us?
Why does anyone do anything?
Hmm.
Let me guess, selling secrets?
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.
Worked very well for a few years.
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it.
But...
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.
I couldn't believe my luck!
That bought me a little time.
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
Very handy.
They were always such reliable killers.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.
Lady Smallwood gave the order.
But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.
Seemed to do the trick.
And you thought your troubles were over.
I was tired.
Tired of the mess of it all.
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.
The hostages were killed.
AGRA too.
Or so I thought.
My secret was safe.
But... apparently not.
Just a little peace.
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
A family?
Home?
Really, I understand.
So, just let me get out of here, right?
Let me just walk away.
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.
What do you say?
After what you did?
!
Mary, no!
OK.
London Aquarium.
Yes, now.
I was never a field agent.
I always thought I'd be rather good.
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
Thanks.
- For a secretary.
- What?
It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
- I didn't do this out of jealousy.
- No?
Same old drudge, day in, day out.
Never getting out there where all the excitement was.
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.
- Yes, your little flat.
- How do you know?
- Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?
And what are you, widowed or divorced?
Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.
That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.
- Sherlock...
- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.
A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.
- Sherlock, don't.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.
There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
That accounts for the drink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.
So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.
To prove how good you are.
To make up for the inadequacies of your...
little life.
Well, Mrs Norbury,
I must admit this is unexpected.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.
All except Sherlock Holmes.
There's no way out.
So it would seem.
You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.
It's what I do.
Maybe I can still surprise you.
Now, come on, be sensible.
Hmm, no, I don't think so.
- Ah!
- Surprise!
Everything's fine.
It's going to be OK.
Get an ambulance!
- It's all right, it's all right.
- Mary!
- John.
All right, Mary?
Mary?
Stay with me, stay with me.
- Oh, come on...
- No, don't worry.
Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
Come on, Mary.
Mary?
Oh, God.
John, I think this is it.
No, no, no, no.
It's not.
- That's...
- You made me so happy.
You gave me everything I could ever, ever have wanted...
Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.
- Look after Rosie.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.
- Promise me.
- I promise.
- No...
- Yes, I promise.
- Promise me!
- I promise, I promise.
Ssh, ssh.
Hey, Sherlock.
Yes.
I... so like you.
Did I ever say?
Yes, yes, you did.
I'm sorry for... for shooting you that time.
I'm really sorry.
- It's all right.
- I think we're even now, OK?
OK.
- Oh, I think we're...
- Mary, Mary...
- .. even, definitely even.
- Ssh, ssh.
- Ooh.
You were my whole world.
Being Mary Watson... .. was the only life worth living.
- Mary...
- Thank you.
Mary...
Don't you dare!
You made a vow.
You swore it.
'You've been having dreams.
A recurring dream?
'
Do you want to talk about it?
This is a two-way relationship, you know.
The whole world has come crashing down around you.
Everything's hopeless.
Irretrievable.
I know that's what you must feel... .. but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
That's not really my style.
I need to know what to do.
Do?
About John.
Put me through to Sherrinford, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
But nothing will ever be the same again, will it?
I'm afraid it won't.
We'll have to rally round, I expect, do our bit.
Look after little Rosie.
I'm just going to, um... .. look through these things.
There might be a case.
A case?
Oh, you're not up to it, are you?
Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.
Yes.
Yes, I expect you're right.
I'll make some tea, shall I?
- Mrs Hudson?
- Yes, Sherlock?
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident...
Yes?
.. would you just say the word Norbury to me?
Would you?
Norbury?
Just that.
I'd be very grateful.
What's this?
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.
Oh, God!
Is that...?
- Must be.
- Oh.
I knew it wouldn't end like this.
I knew Moriarty made plans.
'I thought that would get your attention.
'So, this is in case...
'In case the day comes.
'If you are watching this, I'm probably dead.
'I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows?
'Nothing's certain, nothing's written.
'My old life... '.. it was full of consequences.
'The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.
'You need to remember that.
So... '..
I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
'Might be the hardest case of your career.
'When I'm... gone, if I'm gone... '..
I need you to do something for me.'
Hi.
I just wondered how things were going and... .. if there was anything I could do.
It's, er, it's from John.
- Right.
- You don't need to read it now.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.
He says...
John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...
Yes?
He said he'd... .. that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Anyone.
'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
'When I'm gone, if I'm... gone... '..
I need you to do something for me.
'Save John Watson.
'Save him, Sherlock.
'Save him.'
'When does the path we walk on lock around our feet?
'When does the road become a river with only one destination?
'
'Death waits for us all in Samarra.
'But can Samarra be avoided?
'
'Go to hell, Sherlock.'
- _
- My brother is a murderer.
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.
Oh, do your research.
I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Merry Christmas!
[GUNSHOT]
I'm not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.
You know what happened to the other one.
Miss me?
'Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
'
I've only been gone four minutes.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Is that quite clear?
Don't minute any of this.
Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.
A D notice has been slapped on the entire incident.
Only those within this room, code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love, will ever know the whole truth.
As far as everyone else is concerned, going to the Prime Minister
- and way beyond, Charles Augustus...
- [PHONE KEYBOARD CLICKS]
- Are you tweeting?
!
- No.
- Well, that's what it looks like!
- Of course I'm not tweeting.
Why would I be tweeting?
- Give me that!
- What?
No!
What are you doing?
!
- Get off!
- Give it here!
- "Back on terra firma."
- Don't read them out.
- "Free as a bird."
- God, you're such a spoilsport.
Will you take this matter seriously, Sherlock?
I am!
What makes you think I'm not taking it seriously?
"#OhWhatABeautifulMorning"
Look, not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death - my death!
And now I'm back, in a nice warm office, with my big brother and...
Are those ginger nuts?
- Oh, God...
- Love ginger nuts.
Our doctor said you were clean.
I am.
Utterly.
No need for stimulants now, remember?
I have work to do.
You're high as a kite!
Natural high, I assure you.
Totally natural.
I'm just... ♪ ..glad to be alive!
♪
What shall we do next?
What's your name?
Vivian.
- What would you do, Vivian?
- Pardon?
Well, it's a lovely day.
Go for a stroll?
Make a paper aeroplane?
Have an ice lolly?
Ice lolly, I suppose.
Ice lolly it is!
- What's your favourite?
- Well, really, I shouldn't...
- Go on.
- Do they still do Mivvies?
- Mr Holmes...
- Yes?
- ...we do need to get on.
- Yes, of course.
[HELICOPTER WHIRS]
'Do your research.
'I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
[GUNSHOT]
- ..sociopath.
- [GUNSHOT]
- ..sociopath.' - [GUNSHOT]
I see.
Who is supposed to have shot him, then?
Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger - that's who.
- That's not what happened at all.
- It is now.
Remarkable.
How did you do it?
We have some very talented people working here.
If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.
That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.
No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.
You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.
You're home and dry.
OK, cheers.
Obviously, there's unfinished business.
Moriarty.
I told you
- Moriarty's dead.
You say he filmed that video message before he died.
Yes.
You also say you know what he's going to do next.
- What does that mean?
- Perhaps that's all there is to it.
Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
No, no, he would never be that disappointing.
He's planned something, something long-term.
Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.
Posthumous revenge.
No, better than that - posthumous game.
We brought you back to deal with this.
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.
Wait?
!
Of course wait.
I'm the target - targets wait.
Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up,
I'll know when it begins.
I always know when the game is on.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because I love it.
There was once a merchant, in the famous market at Baghdad.
- [WATER SLOSHES]
- One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise, and he knew that the stranger was Death.
Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles, to the city of Samarra.
For there he was sure Death could not find him.
But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.
"Very well," said the merchant.
"I give in.
I am yours."
"But tell me, why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"
"Because," said Death,
"I had an appointment with you tonight... ..in Samarra."
If this gets any better, I'm going to get two knives.
Pays to advertise.
- So, what about Moriarty, then?
- Oh, I have a plan.
I'm going to monitor the underworld, every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
So, basically, your plan is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do?
Awesome, isn't it?
He drowned, Mr Holmes.
That's what we thought.
- But when they opened up his lungs...
- Yes?
..sand.
- Superficial.
- [PHONE WHISTLES]
Come back!
It's the wrong thumb.
[DOOR SLAMS]

- Sherlock...
- It's never twins.
Hopkins, arrest Wilson.
Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.
- 'Wilson?
' 'Lymph nodes?
'
- Sherlock...
Yes, you may have nothing but a limbless torso, but there'll be traces of ink in the lymph nodes under the armpits.
If your mystery corpse had tattoos, the signs will be there.
- 'Bloody hell!
Is that a guess?
'
- I never guess.
- Sherlock...
- 'So, he's the killer?
The canary trainer?
'
- Of course he's the killer.
- 'Didn't see that coming.'
Hm, naturally.
Sherlock, you can't go on spinning plates like this.
That's it!
The place was spinning.
The heart medication you're taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.
Yes, I...
I think so.
Why?
Because the fingerprints on your brother's neck were your own.
- [WATSON CHUCKLES] A jellyfish?
- I know.
You can't arrest a jellyfish.
- You could try.
- We did try.
- [PHONE REPEATEDLY VIBRATES]

We're in a lot of trouble.

Oh, my God!
Relax, it's got two syllables...

- Oh, my God!

Has that come out?
They never come out when I take them.
Let's have a look.
Aw, she's so beautiful.
- Have another go.
- What about a name?
- Catherine.
- Uh, yeah, we've gone off that.
Have we?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Well, you know what I think...
- BOTH:
It's not a girl's name.
Molly, Mrs H, we would love you to be godparents.
- Oh!
Really?
- If you...
That's so lovely.
And, uh... you too, Sherlock?
- You too what?
- Godfather, we'd like you to be godfather.
God is a ludicrous fiction, dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.
Yeah, but there'll be cake.
Will you do it?
I'll get back to you.
Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.
In Christ's name.
Now, what name have you given your daughter?
Rosamund Mary.
Rosamund?
It means "Rose of the world".
Rosie for short.
Didn't you get John's text?
No.
I delete his texts.
I delete any text that begins "Hi."
No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.
- [MRS HUDSON CLEARS THROAT]
- Sorry.
WHISPERING:
Phone!
And now, godparents, are you ready to help the parents of this child in their duties as Christian parents?
BOTH:
We are.
SIRI: 'Sorry, I didn't catch that.
'Please repeat the question.'
As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.
To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
Hard logic versus romantic whimsy - that is your choice.
You fail to connect actions to their consequences.
Now, for the last time, if you want to keep the rattle, do not throw the rattle.
[MESSAGE TONE]
All right, good girl, good girl.
Good girl.
I'd better finish this, hadn't I?
- Hey.
- Afternoon.
He says you've got a good one, Greg?
Oh, yeah.
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
God, 50!
Where does it go?
I know for a fact I was only 21 this time last week.
Yeah, well that's impossible.
That was before you met me.
- Well, no, no, there never was...
- "There never was such a time."
She's looking at me disapprovingly again.
No.
She's just jealous.
Yeah, well, I think we both are.
[PHONE VIBRATES]
- Oh...
- No, no, David.
- Come on, you promised.
- No, it's...
Oh, no...
Oh, it's a Skype call.
Oh!
Then it must be Charlie.
At least he's phoning, I suppose.
Oh, look!
Hello!
'Hey, Dad.
Happy birthday.
Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?
'
No!
Picture's frozen!
'Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you.'
Why is it rubbish?
Where are you?
How is he?
Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.
MAN:
David?
Come on!
OK, no, hang on a sec, I'll find somewhere quieter.
So, Charlie, where are you?
Are you there?
- 'Sorry, I'm here.
I'm just a bit...'
- Are you all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
Altitude?
'I'm in Tibet.
Didn't you see the mountains?
'
Never mind mountains.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.
- 'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?
'
- What?
'Could you just check something on my car?
'
Your car?
'To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe
I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet.
- 'Could you take a photo and send it?
'
- Uh, yes, I can do that.
All done.
Have you got it?
Charlie?
LESTRADE:
A week later...
Yeah?
...something really weird happens.
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed, the cops are chasing him, and he turns into the drive of the Welsborough house to try and get away.
Unfortunately...
The drunk guy survived, they managed to pull him out, but when they put the fire out and examined the parked car...
Whose body?
Charlie Welsborough, the son.
- What?
- The son who was in Tibet.
DNA all checks out.
Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.
[SHERLOCK CHUCKLES]
- Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
- Have you got a lab report?
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.
- The seats?
- Yes, the car seats.
Made of vinyl.
Two different types of vinyl present.
Was it his own car?
Yeah, not flash - he was a student.
- Well, that's suggestive.
- Why?
- Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
- Yeah, right?
- There's something else.
- Yes?
According to this,
Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.
What?
The body in the car, dead for a week.
Oh, this is a good one.
Is it my birthday?
You want help?
- Yes, please.
OK.
- One condition.
Take all the credit.
It gets boring if I just solve them all.
Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.
He's got a point.
Which makes me look like some kind of prima donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do!
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.
- Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
- Definitely a sore spot.
So you take all the glory, thanks...
- OK!
- ...thanks all the same.
Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?
It's driving me nuts.
Anything you say, Giles.
Just kidding.
HE MOUTHS:
What's his name?
HE MOUTHS:
Greg.
What?
Greg.
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?
Not a clue.
It's just you normally say that at this point.
Hmm.
Well, then, let's hope you solve your little problem, Greg.
- Hear that?
- I know.
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood?
- Oh, good, great.
Yeah, amazing.
- Getting any sleep?
- Christ, no.
You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.
- Must feel very different...
- Sorry, what?
Yes, well, you know how it is.
All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.
- Are you two having a little joke?
- Never a word of thanks.
Can't even tell people's faces apart.
This is a joke, isn't it?
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever.
You're so, so clever."
- Is it about me?
- I think he needs winding.
You know, I think that really might be it.
No, don't get it.
Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect, so go easy on them, yeah?
- You know me.
- MARY: 'Hey, hello.'
Yeah.
Got them, don't worry.
Pampers, the cream you can't get from Boots.
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now?
- At the dead boy's house?
- Yeah.
'And what does he think?
Any theories?
'
Well, I texted you the details.
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.
- Hey!
- How do you know about that?
'Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.'
- WHISPERING:
They know everything!
- 'Solved it, then?
'
I'm working on it.
'Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.'
- Pig!
- Keep trying.
'So, what about it, then?
'What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it?
'And what are you going to call this one?
'
Oh, the Ghost Driver.
- Don't give it a title.
- People like the titles.
- They hate the titles.
- Give the people what they want.
No, never do that - people are stupid.
Uh, some people.
'All people are stupid.
Most people.'
'Bizarre enough though, isn't it, to be him?
'
I mean, it's right up your strasse.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.
- Son.
- Son!
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.
If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.
Well, I believe that I can.
DISTORTED:
But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
Sherlock?
Mr Holmes?
Sorry, you were saying?
Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
I don't think we'll ever get over this.
No.
Shouldn't think so.
So sorry, will you excuse me a moment?
I just...
I'll...
I'll just, um...
Ahem.
- Now what's wrong?
- Not sure, I just...
By the pricking of my thumbs.
Seriously?
You?
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.
They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.
What is this?
Oh, it's a sort of shrine, I suppose, really.
Bit of a fan of Mrs T.
A big hero of mine when I was getting started.
Right, yes.
- Who?
- What?
- Who...?
Who was this?
- Are you serious?
- Sherlock...
- It's...
It's Margaret Thatcher, the first female Prime Minister of this country.
Right.
- Prime Minister?
Right.
- Leader of the Government.
- Female?
- For God's sake!
You know perfectly well who she is.
Why are you playing for time?
It's the gap, look at the gap.
It's wrong.
Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed.
The whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.
This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been in, this picture is straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.
- Something's missing from here, but only recently.
- Yes, a...
- Plaster bust... - plaster bust.
- Oh, for God's sake!
It got broken.
What the hell has this got to do with Charlie?
- Rug!
- What?
Well, how could it get broken?
The only place for it to fall is the floor and there is a big thick rug.
- Does it matter?
- Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.
- It is worth letting him do this.
- Is your friend quite mad?
No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
We found the remains out there in the porch.
- The porch where we came in?
- How anybody could hate her so much they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness...
I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.
Why didn't he smash all the others?
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.
Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.
- And if there's nothing...
- I know what happened to your son.
You do?
It's quite simple, superficial, to be blunt.
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness?
- Well, yes.
- And the porch where it was smashed,
I noticed the motion sensor was damaged,
- so I assume it's permanently lit.
- How did you notice that?
I lack the arrogance to ignore details.
I'm not the police.
- So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.
- Exactly.
- Why?
- Don't know.
Wouldn't be fun if I knew.
Mr Holmes, please!
It was your 50th birthday, Mr Welsborough, of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
- After all, he was in Tibet.
- Yes.
- No.
- No?
CROWD: ♪ Happy birthday... ♪
The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video.
Easily arranged.
It's a Skype call.
The trick was meant to be a surprise.
- A trick?
- Obviously.
Could you take a photo and send it?
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.
Well, good enough.
Effectively a costume.
You're joking?
No, I'm not.
All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
- Oh, my God!
- Surprise!
That's when it happened.
I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.
You said he'd felt unwell?
You all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
He died there and then.
No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained, in the driver's seat, hidden, until...
When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who'd been sitting there, quite dead, for a week.
Oh, God!
Poor kid.
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.
This is where it was smashed.
- That was amazing.
- What?
The car, the kid.
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?
I can't stand it, never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
What kind of a life would that be?
Besides, I have the strangest feeling...
Miss me?
- That's mine.
You two take a... bus.
- Why?
I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.
The Mall, please.
- I met her once.
- Thatcher?
Rather arrogant, I thought.
- You thought that?
!
- Ha, I know.
Why am I looking at this?
That's her, John and Mary's baby.
Oh, I see, yes.
Looks very... fully functioning.
Is that really the best you can do?
Sorry, I've never been very good with them.
- Babies?
- Humans.
Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?
Any interest in her?
Why on earth would he?
I don't know.
You tell me.
In the last year of his life,
James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over 70 assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias,
which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.
It's a pearl - get another one.
There's something important about this.
I'm sure.
Maybe it's Moriarty.
Maybe it's not.
[WATER SLOSHES]
But something's coming.
Are you having a premonition, brother mine?
The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other.
What we call premonition is just movement of the web.
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable.
As inevitable as mathematics.
- Appointment In Samarra.
- I'm sorry?
The merchant who can't outrun Death.
You always hated that story as a child.
Less keen on predestination back then.
I'm not sure I like it now.
You wrote your own version, as I remember.
Appointment In Sumatra.
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.
Goodnight, Mycroft.
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.
- Keep me informed.
- Of what?
Absolutely no idea.
'Ammo!
'
[MAN SHUDDERS]
- Oh, hi, Stella.
- Greg.
You, uh...?
- Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...
- Right, right, right...
Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?
It's nothing.
I mean it's nothing serious.
- No, no.
- I just pop round every now and again for a chat.
Yeah, of course.
I mean he loves a really tricky case.
Yeah, he does!
So what you here for?
Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so...
The Borgia Pearl?
They still after that, are they?
Yeah.
So, how did you two first meet?
Oh, well, there was a case about, um, ten years ago.
Nobody could figure it out.
There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.
- Oh, yeah?
How did she die?
- Hypothermia.
What?
I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...
Will you two please keep it down?
!
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?
You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.
I was a carpenter.
Like me dad.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
How the hell...?
Ah... e-cigarettes.
Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.
If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.
But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last.
Anything to add, John?
- John?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.
- What is that?
- That is... me.
Well, it's a me substitute.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You know I value your little contributions.
Yeah?
It's been there since nine this morning.
- Has it?
Where were you?
- Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.
What about my girlfriend?
- What?
- You said I had an ex...
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.
The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.
I...
I thought you'd done something clever.
Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?
[SHERLOCK INHALES DEEPLY]
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
What do you mean?
Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
- Well...
- You thought she was having an affair.
I'm afraid it's far worse than that, your wife is a spy.
- What?
- That's right.
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy, across the road from your flat.
Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy, as part of an official state visit.
As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.
This drug will render the President entirely susceptible to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty.
What?
Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III.
- Are you serious?
- No, of course not.
His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.
I don't!
- Just the bras.
- Get out.
So, what's this all about, then?
- Having fun.
- Fun?
- While I can.
- Mm-hmm.
[KNOCK AT DOOR]
- Uh, Sherlock...
- Borgia Pearl.
Boring.
Go!
- But...
- Go!
- This had better be good.
- Oh, I think you'll like it.
That is the bust, isn't it?
The one that was broken.
No, it's another one, different owner.
Different part of town.
You were right, this is a thing.
Something's going on.
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be pleased.
- I am pleased.
- You don't look pleased.
This is my game face.
And the game is on.
Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one.
- One belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan.
- Identical busts?
Yeah, and this one to a Dr Barnicot in Holborn.
Three in total.
God knows who'd want to do something like this.
Yeah, but some people have that complex, don't they?
An idee fixe.
They obsess over one thing and they can't let it go.
No, no good.
There were other images of Margaret...
Margaret...?
You know who she is.
...Thatcher, present at the first break-in.
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?
Ooh!
- What?
- Blood.
Quite a bit of it, too.
Was there any injury at the crime scene?
Nah.
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.
- Come on.
- Holborn?
Lambeth!
- Lambeth?
Why?
- To see Toby.
Ah, right.
Who?
- You'll see.
- Right, are you coming?
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.
- Who told you?
- The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.
- Have a good time.
- I will.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
- What?
- She's not the one.
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.
How do you work all that out?
She's got three children in Rio that he doesn't know about.
Are you just making this up?
- Possibly.
- Who's Toby?
There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker, one of the world's best.
Got himself into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago.
He hacked into the Pentagon security system, and I managed to get him off the charge.
Therefore he owes me a favour.
So, how does that help us?
- What?
- Toby the hacker?
- Toby's not the hacker.
- What?
- All right, Craig?
- All right, Sherlock?
Craig's got a dog.
So I see.
Good boy!
Hiya!
Mary?
What are you...?
No, we, we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case.
No, exactly.
So... don't wait up.
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Hey.
Mary, what are you doing here?
She's better at this than you.
- Better?
- So I texted her.
Hang on, Mary's better than me?
Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.
Of course she's better.
Yeah, OK.
Nothing personal.
What, so I'm supposed to just go home now, am I?
What do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?
- John or the dog?
- Ha-ha, that's funny!
- John.
- Well...
He's handy and loyal.
- That's hilarious.
- Is it too early for a divorce?
Oh.
Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge?
Keep up, he's fast.
- He's not moving.
- He's thinking.
He's really not moving.
Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.
You just like this dog, don't you?
- Well, I like you.
- He's still not moving.
- Fascinating.
- Oh!
[SHE CLEARS HER THROAT]
Well, what do you make of it?
- They were looking for something.
- Yes, but it wasn't a burglar, they came specifically for that Thatcher bust.
Why?
[DOG SNIFFS]
[DOG WHINES]
Clever.
Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail,
- where would you go?
- Like hiding a tree in a forest.
Or blood in a butcher's.
Never mind, Toby, better luck next time, hmm?
This is it, though.
This is the one, I can feel it.
Not Moriarty?
It has to be him.
It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.
It's designed to beguile me, tease me and lure me in.
At last, a noose for me to put my neck into.
You should have seen the state of the front room.
- It was like The Exorcist.
- Huh.
Was Rosie's head spinning round?
- No.
Just the projectile vomiting.
- Nice!
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
- Hmm?
Noticed what?
- The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
[BABY CRIES]
Yeah, can't she?
I'm coming, darling.
Mummy's coming.
LOVINGLY:
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here.
Have you heard of that thing?
In Germany?
You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.
Ostalgie.
People who missed the old days under the communists.
- People are weird, aren't they?
- Hmm.
According to this, there's quite a market for Cold War memorabilia.
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit?
Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.
Yes, fascinating.
Irrelevant.
Where exactly did they come from?
I've got into the records of the suppliers, Gelder and Co.
Seems they're from Georgia.
Where exactly?
Tbilisi.
Batch of six.
One to Welsborough.
One to Hassan.
One to Dr Barnicot.
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.
One to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.
Lestrade?
Another one?
- 'Yeah.'
- Harker or Sandeford?
Harker.
And it's murder this time.
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.
_
_
Defensive wounds on her face and hands, throat cut.
Sharp blade.
The same thing inside the house?
The bust?
- Two of them this time.
- Interesting.
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago.
- Limited edition of six.
- And now someone's wandering about destroying them all.
Makes no sense.
What's the point?
No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.
- Yes, it is.
- Well, it is, but it's not the point.
I've been slow, far too slow.
Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind...
Slow but lucky, very lucky.
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.
Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.
Congratulations, by the way.
- I'm sorry?
- Well, you're about to solve a big one.
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
- Yeah, until then, basically.
[WATER SPLASHING]
That's enough now, love.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.
And you need to get to bed.
Come on.
Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?
You were on the run.
Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying, it's clever.
Very clever.
But now you've met me and you're not so clever, are you?
Who are you?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.
Argh!
You're out of time.
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
- Who?
I know it's him.
It must be him.
You think you understand.
You understand nothing.
Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don't we just enjoy the moment?
Let me present Interpol's number one case.
Too tough for them, too boring for me.
The Black Pearl of the Borgias!
It's not possible!
How could she...?
!
Everything about who I was is on there.
The problems of your past are your business.
The problems of your future are my privilege.
I don't understand.
She...
She destroyed it.
She?
You know her!
You do, don't you?
You know the bitch?
!
She betrayed me.
Betrayed us all.
Mary.
This is about Mary?
Is that what she's calling herself now, eh?
- 'Armed police, you're surrounded!
'
- Give it to me.
YELLS:
Give it to me!
'Come out slowly, I want to see your hands above your head.'
Nobody shoots me!
Anyone shoots, I kill this man.
'Lay down your weapon.
Do it now!
'
I'm leaving this place.
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.
'Lay down your weapon.'
You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
Tell her she's a dead woman.
She's a dead woman walking.
She's my friend.
And she's under my protection.
Who are you?
I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.
Who's Sherlock Holmes?
Not a policeman.
[ALARM BLARES]
What do you think?
Mate in two?
Don't antagonise them, darling.
Oh, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.
Everything palls.
They'll send someone soon.
They?
Who are they?
Seems to me we put an awful lot of faith in they.
Well, I've got something they would dearly love, if only we could get out of here.
I've got Ammo.
Ammo?
- MARY:
Madame Ambassador.
- What took you so long?
- Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now!
Veer left!
[SCREAMING]
[HE LAUGHS]
What now?
What do we do?
We die.
Well?
He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.
- I very much doubt it.
- Why?
Because I think he used to work with Mary.
[GUNFIRE]
[SHOUTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE]
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out!
We'll come back later.
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the English woman?
What would you do to a traitor?
Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.
[HE CHUCKLES]
I am an idiot, I know nothing.
Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
That was quite a text you sent me.
What's going on, Sherlock?
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,
I couldn't see what was right under my nose.
Expected a pearl.
Oh, my God, that's a...
Yes, it's an AGRA.
Memory stick, like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.
Who?
I don't know.
We...
We all had one but the others were...
Haven't you even looked at it yet?
I glanced at it but I prefer
- to hear it from you.
- Why?
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.
There were four of us, agents.
Not just agents.
Polite term.
Alex.
Gabriel.
Me.
And Ajay.
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.
We all had one.
Each containing aliases, our background, everything.
We could never be betrayed, because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.
- Who employed you?
- Anyone who paid well.
I mean, we were at the top of our game for years.
And then it all ended.
There was a coup in Georgia.
The British Embassy in Tbilisi was taken over, lots of hostages.
We got the call to go in, get them out.
There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.
- Who from?
- I don't know, just another voice on the phone.
And a codeword.
- Ammo.
- Ammo?
Like ammunition.
We went in, but then something went wrong.
Something went really wrong.
[GUNFIRE, SCREAMING]
That was six years ago.
It feels like forever.
I was the only one that made it out.
No.
What?
I met someone tonight.
Same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.
What, he's alive?
Yeah, very much so.
I don't believe it, this is amazing!
I thought I was the only one,
I thought I was the only one who got out.
Where is he?
I need to see him, now!
Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?
Yeah, of course.
It was our insurance.
Above all, they mustn't fall into enemy hands.
So Ajay survived as well.
And now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide, with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why?
I don't know.
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
[SHE LAUGHS]
Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.
Families fall out.
The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
Well, he's just trying to find me.
He survived, that's all that matters!
I heard it from his own mouth.
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."
Why would he want to kill me?
- He said you betrayed him.
- Oh, no, no, that's insane.
Well, it's what he believes.
[SHE GASPS]
I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.
No, Mary...
You do.
I made a vow, remember?
To look after the three of you.
Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
There's something I think you should read.
What is it?
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.
What are you...?
[HE SNIFFS]
- Mary...
Oh, no!
- There you go.
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.
No.
You just look after them till I get back.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
[CHILD SINGS]
[HE GROANS]
Agra?
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
It is 378km west of the state capital, Lucknow.
What are you, Wikipedia?
- Yes.
- AGRA is an acronym.
Oh, good, I love an acronym.
All the best secret societies have them.
Team of agents, the best.
But you know all that.
Of course I do.
Go on.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.
Indeed?
Well, that's news to me.
Is it?
He's already killed looking for that memory stick.
AGRA always worked for the highest bidder,
I thought that might include you?
- Me?
- Well, I mean the British government, or whatever government you're currently propping up.
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.
They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong.
And that was that, we stopped using freelancers.
- Your initiative?
- My initiative.
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.
I don't like loose ends.
Not on my watch.
There was something else.
A detail.
A codeword.
Ammo?
It's all I've got.
Little enough.
Could you do some digging as a favour?
You don't have many favours left.
Then I'm calling them all in.
And if you can find who's after her and neutralise them, what then?
You think you can go on saving her forever?
Of course.
Is that sentiment talking?
No, it's me.
Difficult to tell the difference these days.
Told you, I made a promise.
A vow.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.
Not on my watch.
MARY: 'My darling, I need to tell you this because you mustn't hate me for going away.'
NEW YORK ACCENT:
Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.
- Can you hear a squeaking?
- No.
Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel.
Why Planes Fail.
- Did you see it?
Oh, truly terrifying.
- Can't say I did.
Swore I would never fly again, yet hear I am!
Everything OK, madam?
No.
No, no, it's not, but then what's the use in complaining?
I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off is all.
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.
Oh, OK.
Relax.
She said relax. [CHUCKLES]
Did you have a nice time in London?
It was OK, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun?
- Did you lose it in the war?
- [SHE LAUGHS]
'I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.
I'm not running, I promise you that,
I just need to do this in my own way.'
Oh, God!
I'm...
I-I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God!
[FLIGHT ATTENDANT BUTTON BEEPS]
- Everything OK, madam?
- I think I'm dying.
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.
God will smile on you.
'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,
I'm sorry, my love.'
I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.
Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of a dice.
I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
I swear I will.'
[LAUGHTER]
Not like this one.
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in!
I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.
Mr Baker.
Well, that completes the set.
- No, it does not.
- Well, who else am I missing?
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?
Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.
Oh, hi, Mary.
What concept?
Happy families.
Nice trip?
- How the f...?
- Please, Mary, there is a child present.
- How did you get in here?
- Karim let me in.
Hello.
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Nice to meet you, missus.
No, I mean how did you find me?
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
No, really, though, how?
Every movement I made was entirely random, every new personality just on the roll of a dice!
Mary, no human action is ever truly random.
An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability, mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual, can reduce the number of variables considerably.
I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine a seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.
But they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.
[HE CHUCKLES]
JOKINGLY:
Oh, you bastard!
- ANGRILY:
You bastard!
- I know, but your face!
"The mathematics of probability"?
- You believed that.
- "Feasible variables"?
Yes, I started to run out about then.
In the memory stick!
Yeah, that was my idea.
- AGRA?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
You said it was your initials.
In a way that was true.
In a way?
So many lies.
I'm so sorry.
And I don't just mean you.
What?
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...
You're R?
Rosamund?
Rosamund Mary.
I always liked Mary.
Yeah, me too.
I used to.
I just...
I didn't know what else to do.
You could have stayed, you could have talked to me.
That's what couples are supposed to do.
Work things through.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Mary, I may not be a very good man but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for,
- most of the time.
- All the time.
You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.
You never judge, you never complain.
I don't deserve you, I...
All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
I will keep you safe.
But it has to be in London.
It's my city, I know the turf.
Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.
Get down!
[RAPID GUNFIRE]
Hello again.
- Ajay?
- Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.
Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.
I thought I was the only one who got out.
How did you find us?
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.
You found her but I found you.
So perhaps not so clever.
And now here we are.
At last.
[HE CHUCKLES] Touche!
Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
She thought I was dead.
I might as well have been.
It was always just the four of us, always, remember?
Oh, yeah.
So why do you want to kill me?
Do you know how long they kept me prisoner?
What they did to me?
They tortured Alex to death.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.
But you?
You, where were you?
That day at the embassy, I escaped.
Ha!
But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
Where were you?
Oh, I got out.
For a while.
Long enough to hide my memory stick.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.
I was loyal, you see.
Loyal to my friends.
But they took me, tortured me.
Not for information.
Not for anything except fun.
They thought I'd give in, die, but I didn't, I lived.
And eventually, they forgot about me rotting in a cell somewhere.
Six years they kept me there.
Until one day I saw my chance.
Oh, and I made them pay.
You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.
Little whispers.
Laughter.
Gossip.
How the clever agents had been betrayed.
Brought down by you!
- Me?
- [TRAIN WHISTLES]
You know I'll kill you too.
You know I will, Ajay.
What, you think I care if I die?
I've dreamed of killing you every night for six years.
Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.
I swear to you, Ajay.
What did you hear, Ajay?
When you were a prisoner, what exactly did you hear?
What did I hear?
Ammo.
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo."
We were betrayed!
- And they said it was her?
- That you betrayed us!
They said her name?
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.
No!
No!
'The English woman, that's all he heard.
Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.'
Couldn't this wait until you're back?
No, it's not over.
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed, the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.
There was only a voice on the phone.
'Remember?
And a codeword.'
"Ammo," yes, you said.
How's your Latin, brother dear?
My Latin?
Amo, amas, amat.
I love, you love, he loves.
What...?
Not "Ammo" as in ammunition, but "Amo", meaning?
You'd better be right, Sherlock.
Bloody thing!
What's going on?
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.
What?
'So many lies.
And I don't just mean you.'
- Hello.
- Ah, hello.
- I like your daisy.
- Thank you, yeah.
It's not really me, though, I think.
- No?
- No, no, it's too floral for me.
I'm more of a "knackered with weary old eyes" kind of guy.
Well, I think they're nice.
Nice eyes.
- [HE LAUGHS] Thank you.
- Look...
Look...
I don't normally do this,
- but, um...
- But you're going to.
Yeah.
- What's this?
- This is me.
- Thank you.
Cheers.
- Yeah.
Great.
- Bye!
- Bye.
[HE CHUCKLES]

[PHONE BEEPS]
_
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
Hmm?
Noticed what?
The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
[BABY CRIES]
- Yeah, can't she?
- Hmm.
I'm coming darling.
I'm coming.
[PHONE BEEPS]
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
- _
- Come here...
It's OK.
_
- _
- Do you want a cuddle?
[BABY CONTINUES TO WAIL]
_
I know.
- Oh, sweetheart.
- _
_
Ssh.
Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you?
_
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?
Oh, let's go and see Daddy!
Daddy's here.
It's OK, Rosie.
I'll take her.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I may as well get up now.
Hey, baby, it's Daddy.
Your daddy.
Come here, Rose.
Come here, darling, it's all right.
Thank you.
_
_
This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.
How many more times?
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.
And you're basing all this on a code name?
On a whispered voice on the telephone?
Come on, Mycroft.
You were the conduit for AGRA.
Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
It was my job.
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
AGRA went in.
- Yes.
- And they were betrayed.
Not by me.
Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.
I promise you,
I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.
You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.
Not one.
Not.
One.
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories?
I'd like to do those.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.
Although she does seem to enjoy them.
Well, I'll have to give that a go.
Got a lot to catch up on.
AJAY: 'You think you understand.
You understand nothing.'
MYCROFT: 'Code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love.'
MARY: 'You'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.
'They know everything.'
'They said it was the English woman.'
'Don't minute any of this.'
'They know everything.'
- You don't make it easy, do you?
- What do you mean?
Well, being... being so perfect.
Mary, I...
I need to tell you...
- [PHONE BEEPS]
- Hang on.
Can you tell me later?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Great.
Well, no, we can't just go.
- Rosie.
- Yeah.
- Er, you go.
- No!
I'll come as soon as I've found someone.
Mrs Hudson.
- Corfu till Saturday.
Molly?
- Er, yeah, I'll try.
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.
You know that's not going to happen.
If there's more to this case, you need to see it.
Yeah, OK, you win.
'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes.
'Please make your way to the exit.
Thank you.'
Your office said I'd find you here.
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.
We're like them.
Ghostly, living in the shadows.
Predatory?
Well, it depends which side you're on.
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.
Nice location for the final act, couldn't have chosen it better myself.
But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.
I just come here to look at the fish.
I knew this would happen one day.
- It's like that old story.
- I really am a very busy man.
Would you mind cutting to the chase?
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
With good reason.
"There was once a merchant, in a famous market in Baghdad."
I really have never liked this story.
I'm just like the merchant in the story,
I thought I could out-run the inevitable.
I've always been looking over my shoulder, always expecting to see the grim figure of...
Death.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hey.
- John?
- On his way.
Let me introduce Ammo.
You were Ammo?
You were the person on the phone that time?
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
Why did you betray us?
Why does anyone do anything?
- Hmm.
- Let me guess, selling secrets?
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.
Worked very well for a few years.
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it.
But...
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.
[SHE CHUCKLES] I couldn't believe my luck!
That bought me a little time.
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
Very handy.
They were always such reliable killers.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.
Lady Smallwood gave the order.
But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.
Seemed to do the trick.
And you thought your troubles were over.
I was tired.
Tired of the mess of it all.
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.
The hostages were killed.
AGRA too.
Or so I thought.
My secret was safe.
But... apparently not.
Just a little peace.
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
A family?
Home?
Really, I understand.
So, just let me get out of here, right?
Let me just walk away.
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.
What do you say?
After what you did?
!
Mary, no!
OK.
London Aquarium.
Yes, now.
I was never a field agent.
I always thought I'd be rather good.
[MARY SCOFFS]
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
Thanks.
- For a secretary.
- What?
It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
- I didn't do this out of jealousy.
- No?
Same old drudge, day in, day out.
Never getting out there where all the excitement was.
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.
Yes, your little flat.
- How do you know?
- Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?
And what are you, widowed or divorced?
Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.
That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.
- Sherlock...
- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.
A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.
- Sherlock, don't.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.
There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
That accounts for the drink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.
So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.
To prove how good you are.
To make up for the inadequacies of your...
little life.
Well, Mrs Norbury,
I must admit this is unexpected.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.
All except Sherlock Holmes.
There's no way out.
So it would seem.
You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.
It's what I do.
Maybe I can still surprise you.
Now, come on, be sensible.
Hmm, no, I don't think so.
Ah!
Surprise!
[MARY GASPS FOR AIR]
[MARY GROANS]
Everything's fine.
It's going to be OK.
Get an ambulance!
It's all right, it's all right.
- Mary!
- John.
All right, Mary?
Mary?
Stay with me, stay with me.
- Oh, come on...
- No, don't worry.
Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
Come on, Mary.
Mary?
Oh, God.
John, I think this is it.
No, no, no, no.
It's not.
- That's...
- You made me so happy.
You gave me everything I could ever, ever have wanted...
Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.
- Look after Rosie.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.
- Promise me.
- I promise.
- No...
- Yes, I promise.
- Promise me!
- I promise, I promise.
Ssh, ssh.
Hey, Sherlock.
Yes.
I... so like you.
Did I ever say?
Yes, yes, you did.
I'm sorry for... for shooting you that time.
I'm really sorry.
- It's all right.
- I think we're even now, OK?
OK.
- Oh, I think we're...
- Mary, Mary...
- ...even, definitely even.
- Ssh, ssh.
You were my whole world.
Being Mary Watson was the only life worth living.
- Mary...
- Thank you.
Mary...
[HE BEWAILS]
Don't you dare!
You made a vow.
You swore it.
[PHONE BEEPS REPEATEDLY]
'You've been having dreams.
A recurring dream?
'
[CLOCK TICKS RHYTHMICALLY]
Do you want to talk about it?
This is a two-way relationship, you know.
[SHE SIGHS]
The whole world has come crashing down around you.
Everything's hopeless.
Irretrievable.
I know that's what you must feel but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
That's not really my style.
I need to know what to do.
Do?
About John.
[BACK CRACKS, HE GROANS]
Put me through to Sherrinford, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
SOBS:
But nothing will ever be the same again, will it?
I'm afraid it won't.
We'll have to rally round, I expect, do our bit.
Look after little Rosie.
I'm just going to, um look through these things.
There might be a case.
A case?
Oh, you're not up to it, are you?
Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.
Yes.
Yes, I expect you're right.
I'll make some tea, shall I?
- Mrs Hudson?
- Yes, Sherlock?
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident...
- Yes?
- ...would you just say the word Norbury to me?
Would you?
Norbury?
Just that.
I'd be very grateful.
What's this?
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.
Oh, God!
Is that...?
- Must be.
- Oh.
I knew it wouldn't end like this.
I knew Moriarty made plans.
'I thought that would get your attention.
So, this is in case...
In case the day comes.
If you are watching this, I'm probably dead.
I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows?
Nothing's certain, nothing's written.
My old life it was full of consequences.
The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.
You need to remember that.
So I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
Might be the hardest case of your career.
When I'm... gone, if I'm gone I need you to do something for me.'
- [BABY GURGLES]
- Hi.
I just wondered how things were going and if there was anything I could do.
It's, er, it's from John.
- Right.
- You don't need to read it now.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.
He says...
John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...
Yes?
He said he'd that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Anyone.
[DOOR CLOSES]
'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
When I'm gone, if I'm... gone I need you to do something for me.
Save John Watson.
Save him, Sherlock.
Save him.'
'When does the path we walk on lock around our feet?
When does the road become a river with only one destination?
'
'Death waits for us all in Samarra.
But can Samarra be avoided?
'
Go to hell, Sherlock!
- _
- My brother is a murderer.
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.
Oh, do your research.
I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Merry Christmas!
I'm not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.
You know what happened to the other one.
Miss me?
'Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
'
I've only been gone four minutes.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Is that quite clear?
Don't minute any of this.
Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.
A D notice has been slapped on the entire incident.
Only those within this room, code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love, will ever know the whole truth.
As far as everyone else is concerned, going to the Prime Minister and way beyond, Charles Augustus...
- Are you tweeting?
!
- No.
- Well, that's what it looks like!
- Of course I'm not tweeting.
Why would I be tweeting?
- Give me that!
- What?
No!
What are you doing?
!
- Get off!
- Give it here!
- "Back on terra firma."
- Don't read them out.
- "Free as a bird."
- God, you're such a spoilsport.
Will you take this matter seriously, Sherlock?
I am!
What makes you think I'm not taking it seriously?
"#OhWhatABeautifulMorning"
Look, not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death - my death!
And now I'm back, in a nice warm office, with my big brother and...
Are those ginger nuts?
- Oh, God...
- Love ginger nuts.
Our doctor said you were clean.
I am.
Utterly.
No need for stimulants now, remember?
I have work to do.
You're high as a kite!
Natural high, I assure you.
Totally natural.
I'm just... ♪ ..glad to be alive!
♪
What shall we do next?
What's your name?
Vivian.
- What would you do, Vivian?
- Pardon?
Well, it's a lovely day.
Go for a stroll?
Make a paper aeroplane?
Have an ice lolly?
Ice lolly, I suppose.
Ice lolly it is!
- What's your favourite?
- Well, really, I shouldn't...
- Go on.
- Do they still do Mivvies?
- Mr Holmes...
- Yes?
- ...we do need to get on.
- Yes, of course.
'Do your research.
'I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
..sociopath.
I see.
Who is supposed to have shot him, then?
Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger - that's who.
- That's not what happened at all.
- It is now.
Remarkable.
How did you do it?
We have some very talented people working here.
If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.
That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.
No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.
You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.
You're home and dry.
OK, cheers.
Obviously, there's unfinished business.
Moriarty.
I told you
- Moriarty's dead.
You say he filmed that video message before he died.
Yes.
You also say you know what he's going to do next.
- What does that mean?
- Perhaps that's all there is to it.
Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
No, no, he would never be that disappointing.
He's planned something, something long-term.
Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.
Posthumous revenge.
No, better than that - posthumous game.
We brought you back to deal with this.
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.
Wait?
!
Of course wait.
I'm the target - targets wait.
Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up,
I'll know when it begins.
I always know when the game is on.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because I love it.
There was once a merchant, in the famous market at Baghdad.
One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise, and he knew that the stranger was Death.
Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles, to the city of Samarra.
For there he was sure Death could not find him.
But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.
"Very well," said the merchant.
"I give in.
I am yours."
"But tell me, why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"
"Because," said Death,
"I had an appointment with you tonight... ..in Samarra."
If this gets any better, I'm going to get two knives.
Pays to advertise.
- So, what about Moriarty, then?
- Oh, I have a plan.
I'm going to monitor the underworld, every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
So, basically, your plan is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do?
Awesome, isn't it?
He drowned, Mr Holmes.
That's what we thought.
- But when they opened up his lungs...
- Yes?
..sand.
Superficial.
Come back!
It's the wrong thumb.
_
- Sherlock...
- It's never twins.
Hopkins, arrest Wilson.
Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.
- 'Wilson?
' 'Lymph nodes?
'
- Sherlock...
Yes, you may have nothing but a limbless torso, but there'll be traces of ink in the lymph nodes under the armpits.
If your mystery corpse had tattoos, the signs will be there.
- 'Bloody hell!
Is that a guess?
'
- I never guess.
- Sherlock...
- 'So, he's the killer?
The canary trainer?
'
- Of course he's the killer.
- 'Didn't see that coming.'
Hm, naturally.
Sherlock, you can't go on spinning plates like this.
That's it!
The place was spinning.
The heart medication you're taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.
Yes, I...
I think so.
Why?
Because the fingerprints on your brother's neck were your own.
- A jellyfish?
- I know.
You can't arrest a jellyfish.
- You could try.
- We did try.
Oh...
- Oh, God.
- Mary?
59 missed calls.
We're in a lot of trouble.
Ow!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Relax, it's got two syllables...
I'm a nurse, darling - I think I know what to do!
- Come on, then...
- Re!
Lax!
No, just drive, please, God, just drive!
God, drive!
Sherlock
- Mary!
That's it, Mary - re...
- Don't you start!
- ...
lax.
John, John...
I think you have to pull over!
- Mary, Mary...
- Pull over!
Oh, my God!
Has that come out?
They never come out when I take them.
Let's have a look.
Aw, she's so beautiful.
- Have another go.
- What about a name?
- Catherine.
- Uh, yeah, we've gone off that.
Have we?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Well, you know what I think...
- It's not a girl's name.
Molly, Mrs H, we would love you to be godparents.
- Oh!
Really?
- If you...
That's so lovely.
And, uh... you too, Sherlock?
- You too what?
- Godfather, we'd like you to be godfather.
God is a ludicrous fiction, dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.
Yeah, but there'll be cake.
Will you do it?
I'll get back to you.
Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.
In Christ's name.
Now, what name have you given your daughter?
Rosamund Mary.
Rosamund?
It means "Rose of the world".
Rosie for short.
Didn't you get John's text?
No.
I delete his texts.
I delete any text that begins "Hi."
No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.
Sorry.
Phone!
And now, godparents, are you ready to help the parents of this child in their duties as Christian parents?
We are.
'Sorry, I didn't catch that.
'Please repeat the question.'
As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.
To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
Hard logic versus romantic whimsy - that is your choice.
You fail to connect actions to their consequences.
Now, for the last time, if you want to keep the rattle, do not throw the rattle.
All right, good girl, good girl.
Good girl.
I'd better finish this, hadn't I?
- Hey.
- Afternoon.
He says you've got a good one, Greg?
Oh, yeah.
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.
God, 50!
Where does it go?
I know for a fact I was only 21 this time last week.
Yeah, well that's impossible.
That was before you met me.
- Well, no, no, there never was...
- "There never was such a time."
She's looking at me disapprovingly again.
No.
She's just jealous.
Yeah, well, I think we both are.
- Oh...
- No, no, David.
- Come on, you promised.
- No, it's...
Oh, no...
Oh, it's a Skype call.
Oh!
Then it must be Charlie.
At least he's phoning, I suppose.
Oh, look!
Hello!
'Hey, Dad.
Happy birthday.
Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?
'
No!
Picture's frozen!
'Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you.'
Why is it rubbish?
Where are you?
How is he?
Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.
David?
Come on!
OK, no, hang on a sec, I'll find somewhere quieter.
So, Charlie, where are you?
Are you there?
- 'Sorry, I'm here.
I'm just a bit...'
- Are you all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
Altitude?
'I'm in Tibet.
Didn't you see the mountains?
'
Never mind mountains.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.
- 'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?
'
- What?
'Could you just check something on my car?
'
Your car?
'To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe
I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet.
- 'Could you take a photo and send it?
'
- Uh, yes, I can do that.
All done.
Have you got it?
Charlie?
A week later...
Yeah?
...something really weird happens.
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed, the cops are chasing him, and he turns into the drive of the Welsborough house to try and get away.
Unfortunately...
The drunk guy survived, they managed to pull him out, but when they put the fire out and examined the parked car...
Whose body?
Charlie Welsborough, the son.
- What?
- The son who was in Tibet.
DNA all checks out.
Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.
- Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
- Have you got a lab report?
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.
- The seats?
- Yes, the car seats.
Made of vinyl.
Two different types of vinyl present.
Was it his own car?
Yeah, not flash - he was a student.
- Well, that's suggestive.
- Why?
- Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
- Yeah, right?
- There's something else.
- Yes?
According to this,
Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.
What?
The body in the car, dead for a week.
Oh, this is a good one.
Is it my birthday?
You want help?
- Yes, please.
OK.
- One condition.
Take all the credit.
It gets boring if I just solve them all.
Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.
He's got a point.
Which makes me look like some kind of prima donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do!
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.
- Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
- Definitely a sore spot.
So you take all the glory, thanks...
- OK!
- ...thanks all the same.
Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?
It's driving me nuts.
Anything you say, Giles.
Just kidding.
What's his name?
Greg.
What?
Greg.
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?
Not a clue.
It's just you normally say that at this point.
Hmm.
Well, then, let's hope you solve your little problem, Greg.
- Hear that?
- I know.
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood?
- Oh, good, great.
Yeah, amazing.
- Getting any sleep?
- Christ, no.
You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.
- Must feel very different...
- Sorry, what?
Yes, well, you know how it is.
All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.
- Are you two having a little joke?
- Never a word of thanks.
Can't even tell people's faces apart.
This is a joke, isn't it?
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever.
You're so, so clever."
- Is it about me?
- I think he needs winding.
You know, I think that really might be it.
No, don't get it.
Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect, so go easy on them, yeah?
- You know me.
- 'Hey, hello.'
Yeah.
Got them, don't worry.
Pampers, the cream you can't get from Boots.
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now?
- At the dead boy's house?
- Yeah.
'And what does he think?
Any theories?
'
Well, I texted you the details.
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.
- Hey!
- How do you know about that?
'Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.'
- They know everything!
- 'Solved it, then?
'
I'm working on it.
'Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.'
- Pig!
- Keep trying.
'So, what about it, then?
'What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it?
'And what are you going to call this one?
'
Oh, the Ghost Driver.
- Don't give it a title.
- People like the titles.
- They hate the titles.
- Give the people what they want.
No, never do that - people are stupid.
Uh, some people.
'All people are stupid.
Most people.'
'Bizarre enough though, isn't it, to be him?
'
I mean, it's right up your strasse.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.
- Son.
- Son!
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.
If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.
Well, I believe that I can.
But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
Sherlock?
Mr Holmes?
Sorry, you were saying?
Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
I don't think we'll ever get over this.
No.
Shouldn't think so.
So sorry, will you excuse me a moment?
I just...
I'll...
I'll just, um...
Ahem.
- Now what's wrong?
- Not sure, I just...
By the pricking of my thumbs.
Seriously?
You?
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.
They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.
What is this?
Oh, it's a sort of shrine, I suppose, really.
Bit of a fan of Mrs T.
A big hero of mine when I was getting started.
Right, yes.
- Who?
- What?
- Who...?
Who was this?
- Are you serious?
- Sherlock...
- It's...
It's Margaret Thatcher, the first female Prime Minister of this country.
Right.
- Prime Minister?
Right.
- Leader of the Government.
- Female?
- For God's sake!
You know perfectly well who she is.
Why are you playing for time?
It's the gap, look at the gap.
It's wrong.
Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed.
The whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.
This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been in, this picture is straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.
- Something's missing from here, but only recently.
- Yes, a...
- Plaster bust... - plaster bust.
- Oh, for God's sake!
It got broken.
What the hell has this got to do with Charlie?
- Rug!
- What?
Well, how could it get broken?
The only place for it to fall is the floor and there is a big thick rug.
- Does it matter?
- Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.
- It is worth letting him do this.
- Is your friend quite mad?
No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
We found the remains out there in the porch.
- The porch where we came in?
- How anybody could hate her so much they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness...
I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.
Why didn't he smash all the others?
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.
Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.
- And if there's nothing...
- I know what happened to your son.
You do?
It's quite simple, superficial, to be blunt.
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness?
- Well, yes.
- And the porch where it was smashed,
I noticed the motion sensor was damaged,
- so I assume it's permanently lit.
- How did you notice that?
I lack the arrogance to ignore details.
I'm not the police.
- So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.
- Exactly.
- Why?
- Don't know.
Wouldn't be fun if I knew.
Mr Holmes, please!
It was your 50th birthday, Mr Welsborough, of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
- After all, he was in Tibet.
- Yes.
- No.
- No?
♪ Happy birthday... ♪
The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video.
Easily arranged.
It's a Skype call.
The trick was meant to be a surprise.
- A trick?
- Obviously.
Could you take a photo and send it?
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.
Well, good enough.
Effectively a costume.
You're joking?
No, I'm not.
All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
- Oh, my God!
- Surprise!
That's when it happened.
I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.
You said he'd felt unwell?
You all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
He died there and then.
No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained, in the driver's seat, hidden, until...
When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who'd been sitting there, quite dead, for a week.
Oh, God!
Poor kid.
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.
This is where it was smashed.
- That was amazing.
- What?
The car, the kid.
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?
I can't stand it, never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
What kind of a life would that be?
Besides, I have the strangest feeling...
Miss me?
- That's mine.
You two take a... bus.
- Why?
I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.
The Mall, please.
- I met her once.
- Thatcher?
Rather arrogant, I thought.
- You thought that?
!
- Ha, I know.
Why am I looking at this?
That's her, John and Mary's baby.
Oh, I see, yes.
Looks very... fully functioning.
Is that really the best you can do?
Sorry, I've never been very good with them.
- Babies?
- Humans.
Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?
Any interest in her?
Why on earth would he?
I don't know.
You tell me.
In the last year of his life,
James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over 70 assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias,
which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.
It's a pearl - get another one.
There's something important about this.
I'm sure.
Maybe it's Moriarty.
Maybe it's not.
But something's coming.
Are you having a premonition, brother mine?
The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other.
What we call premonition is just movement of the web.
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable.
As inevitable as mathematics.
- Appointment In Samarra.
- I'm sorry?
The merchant who can't outrun Death.
You always hated that story as a child.
Less keen on predestination back then.
I'm not sure I like it now.
You wrote your own version, as I remember.
Appointment In Sumatra.
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.
Goodnight, Mycroft.
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.
- Keep me informed.
- Of what?
Absolutely no idea.
'Ammo!
'
- Oh, hi, Stella.
- Greg.
You, uh...?
- Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...
- Right, right, right...
Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?
It's nothing.
I mean it's nothing serious.
- No, no.
- I just pop round every now and again for a chat.
Yeah, of course.
I mean he loves a really tricky case.
Yeah, he does!
So what you here for?
Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so...
The Borgia Pearl?
They still after that, are they?
Yeah.
So, how did you two first meet?
Oh, well, there was a case about, um, ten years ago.
Nobody could figure it out.
There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.
- Oh, yeah?
How did she die?
- Hypothermia.
What?
I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...
Will you two please keep it down?
!
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?
You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.
I was a carpenter.
Like me dad.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
How the hell...?
Ah... e-cigarettes.
Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.
If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.
But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last.
Anything to add, John?
- John?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.
- What is that?
- That is... me.
Well, it's a me substitute.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You know I value your little contributions.
Yeah?
It's been there since nine this morning.
- Has it?
Where were you?
- Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.
What about my girlfriend?
- What?
- You said I had an ex...
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.
The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.
I...
I thought you'd done something clever.
Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
What do you mean?
Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
- Well...
- You thought she was having an affair.
I'm afraid it's far worse than that, your wife is a spy.
- What?
- That's right.
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy, across the road from your flat.
Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy, as part of an official state visit.
As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.
This drug will render the President entirely susceptible to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty.
What?
Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III.
- Are you serious?
- No, of course not.
His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.
I don't!
- Just the bras.
- Get out.
So, what's this all about, then?
- Having fun.
- Fun?
- While I can.
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, Sherlock...
- Borgia Pearl.
Boring.
Go!
- But...
- Go!
- This had better be good.
- Oh, I think you'll like it.
That is the bust, isn't it?
The one that was broken.
No, it's another one, different owner.
Different part of town.
You were right, this is a thing.
Something's going on.
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be pleased.
- I am pleased.
- You don't look pleased.
This is my game face.
And the game is on.
Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one.
- One belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan.
- Identical busts?
Yeah, and this one to a Dr Barnicot in Holborn.
Three in total.
God knows who'd want to do something like this.
Yeah, but some people have that complex, don't they?
An idee fixe.
They obsess over one thing and they can't let it go.
No, no good.
There were other images of Margaret...
Margaret...?
You know who she is.
...Thatcher, present at the first break-in.
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?
Ooh!
- What?
- Blood.
Quite a bit of it, too.
Was there any injury at the crime scene?
Nah.
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.
- Come on.
- Holborn?
Lambeth!
- Lambeth?
Why?
- To see Toby.
Ah, right.
Who?
- You'll see.
- Right, are you coming?
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.
- Who told you?
- The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.
- Have a good time.
- I will.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
- What?
- She's not the one.
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.
How do you work all that out?
She's got three children in Rio that he doesn't know about.
Are you just making this up?
- Possibly.
- Who's Toby?
There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker, one of the world's best.
Got himself into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago.
He hacked into the Pentagon security system, and I managed to get him off the charge.
Therefore he owes me a favour.
So, how does that help us?
- What?
- Toby the hacker?
- Toby's not the hacker.
- What?
- All right, Craig?
- All right, Sherlock?
Craig's got a dog.
So I see.
Good boy!
Hiya!
Mary?
What are you...?
No, we, we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case.
No, exactly.
So... don't wait up.
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Hey.
Mary, what are you doing here?
She's better at this than you.
- Better?
- So I texted her.
Hang on, Mary's better than me?
Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.
Of course she's better.
Yeah, OK.
Nothing personal.
What, so I'm supposed to just go home now, am I?
What do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?
- John or the dog?
- Ha-ha, that's funny!
- John.
- Well...
He's handy and loyal.
- That's hilarious.
- Is it too early for a divorce?
Oh.
Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge?
Keep up, he's fast.
- He's not moving.
- He's thinking.
He's really not moving.
Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.
You just like this dog, don't you?
- Well, I like you.
- He's still not moving.
- Fascinating.
- Oh!
Well, what do you make of it?
- They were looking for something.
- Yes, but it wasn't a burglar, they came specifically for that Thatcher bust.
Why?
Clever.
Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail,
- where would you go?
- Like hiding a tree in a forest.
Or blood in a butcher's.
Never mind, Toby, better luck next time, hmm?
This is it, though.
This is the one, I can feel it.
Not Moriarty?
It has to be him.
It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.
It's designed to beguile me, tease me and lure me in.
At last, a noose for me to put my neck into.
You should have seen the state of the front room.
- It was like The Exorcist.
- Huh.
Was Rosie's head spinning round?
- No.
Just the projectile vomiting.
- Nice!
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
- Hmm?
Noticed what?
- The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
Yeah, can't she?
I'm coming, darling.
Mummy's coming.
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here.
Have you heard of that thing?
In Germany?
You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.
Ostalgie.
People who missed the old days under the communists.
- People are weird, aren't they?
- Hmm.
According to this, there's quite a market for Cold War memorabilia.
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit?
Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.
Yes, fascinating.
Irrelevant.
Where exactly did they come from?
I've got into the records of the suppliers, Gelder and Co.
Seems they're from Georgia.
Where exactly?
Tbilisi.
Batch of six.
One to Welsborough.
One to Hassan.
One to Dr Barnicot.
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.
One to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.
Lestrade?
Another one?
- 'Yeah.'
- Harker or Sandeford?
Harker.
And it's murder this time.
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.
_
_
Defensive wounds on her face and hands, throat cut.
Sharp blade.
The same thing inside the house?
The bust?
- Two of them this time.
- Interesting.
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago.
- Limited edition of six.
- And now someone's wandering about destroying them all.
Makes no sense.
What's the point?
No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.
- Yes, it is.
- Well, it is, but it's not the point.
I've been slow, far too slow.
Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind...
Slow but lucky, very lucky.
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.
Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.
Congratulations, by the way.
- I'm sorry?
- Well, you're about to solve a big one.
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
- Yeah, until then, basically.
That's enough now, love.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.
And you need to get to bed.
Come on.
Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?
You were on the run.
Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying, it's clever.
Very clever.
But now you've met me and you're not so clever, are you?
Who are you?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.
Argh!
You're out of time.
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
- Who?
I know it's him.
It must be him.
You think you understand.
You understand nothing.
Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don't we just enjoy the moment?
Let me present Interpol's number one case.
Too tough for them, too boring for me.
The Black Pearl of the Borgias!
It's not possible!
How could she...?
!
Everything about who I was is on there.
The problems of your past are your business.
The problems of your future are my privilege.
I don't understand.
She...
She destroyed it.
She?
You know her!
You do, don't you?
You know the bitch?
!
She betrayed me.
Betrayed us all.
Mary.
This is about Mary?
Is that what she's calling herself now, eh?
- 'Armed police, you're surrounded!
'
- Give it to me.
Give it to me!
'Come out slowly, I want to see your hands above your head.'
Nobody shoots me!
Anyone shoots, I kill this man.
'Lay down your weapon.
Do it now!
'
I'm leaving this place.
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.
'Lay down your weapon.'
You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
Tell her she's a dead woman.
She's a dead woman walking.
She's my friend.
And she's under my protection.
Who are you?
I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.
Who's Sherlock Holmes?
Not a policeman.
What do you think?
Mate in two?
Don't antagonise them, darling.
Oh, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.
Everything palls.
They'll send someone soon.
They?
Who are they?
Seems to me we put an awful lot of faith in they.
Well, I've got something they would dearly love, if only we could get out of here.
I've got Ammo.
Ammo?
- Madame Ambassador.
- What took you so long?
- Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now!
Veer left!
What now?
What do we do?
We die.
Well?
He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.
- I very much doubt it.
- Why?
Because I think he used to work with Mary.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out!
We'll come back later.
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the English woman?
What would you do to a traitor?
Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.
I am an idiot, I know nothing.
Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
That was quite a text you sent me.
What's going on, Sherlock?
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,
I couldn't see what was right under my nose.
Expected a pearl.
Oh, my God, that's a...
Yes, it's an AGRA.
Memory stick, like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.
Who?
I don't know.
We...
We all had one but the others were...
Haven't you even looked at it yet?
I glanced at it but I prefer
- to hear it from you.
- Why?
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.
There were four of us, agents.
Not just agents.
Polite term.
Alex.
Gabriel.
Me.
And Ajay.
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.
We all had one.
Each containing aliases, our background, everything.
We could never be betrayed, because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.
- Who employed you?
- Anyone who paid well.
I mean, we were at the top of our game for years.
And then it all ended.
There was a coup in Georgia.
The British Embassy in Tbilisi was taken over, lots of hostages.
We got the call to go in, get them out.
There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.
- Who from?
- I don't know, just another voice on the phone.
And a codeword.
- Ammo.
- Ammo?
Like ammunition.
We went in, but then something went wrong.
Something went really wrong.
That was six years ago.
It feels like forever.
I was the only one that made it out.
No.
What?
I met someone tonight.
Same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.
What, he's alive?
Yeah, very much so.
I don't believe it, this is amazing!
I thought I was the only one,
I thought I was the only one who got out.
Where is he?
I need to see him, now!
Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?
Yeah, of course.
It was our insurance.
Above all, they mustn't fall into enemy hands.
So Ajay survived as well.
And now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide, with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why?
I don't know.
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.
Families fall out.
The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
Well, he's just trying to find me.
He survived, that's all that matters!
I heard it from his own mouth.
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."
Why would he want to kill me?
- He said you betrayed him.
- Oh, no, no, that's insane.
Well, it's what he believes.
I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.
No, Mary...
You do.
I made a vow, remember?
To look after the three of you.
Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
There's something I think you should read.
What is it?
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.
What are you...?
- Mary...
Oh, no!
- There you go.
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.
No.
You just look after them till I get back.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Agra?
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
It is 378km west of the state capital, Lucknow.
What are you, Wikipedia?
- Yes.
- AGRA is an acronym.
Oh, good, I love an acronym.
All the best secret societies have them.
Team of agents, the best.
But you know all that.
Of course I do.
Go on.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.
Indeed?
Well, that's news to me.
Is it?
He's already killed looking for that memory stick.
AGRA always worked for the highest bidder,
I thought that might include you?
- Me?
- Well, I mean the British government, or whatever government you're currently propping up.
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.
They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong.
And that was that, we stopped using freelancers.
- Your initiative?
- My initiative.
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.
I don't like loose ends.
Not on my watch.
There was something else.
A detail.
A codeword.
Ammo?
It's all I've got.
Little enough.
Could you do some digging as a favour?
You don't have many favours left.
Then I'm calling them all in.
And if you can find who's after her and neutralise them, what then?
You think you can go on saving her forever?
Of course.
Is that sentiment talking?
No, it's me.
Difficult to tell the difference these days.
Told you, I made a promise.
A vow.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.
Not on my watch.
'My darling, I need to tell you this because you mustn't hate me for going away.'
Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.
- Can you hear a squeaking?
- No.
Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel.
Why Planes Fail.
- Did you see it?
Oh, truly terrifying.
- Can't say I did.
Swore I would never fly again, yet hear I am!
Everything OK, madam?
No.
No, no, it's not, but then what's the use in complaining?
I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off is all.
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.
Oh, OK.
Relax.
She said relax.
Did you have a nice time in London?
It was OK, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun?
Did you lose it in the war?
'I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.
I'm not running, I promise you that,
I just need to do this in my own way.'
Oh, God!
I'm...
I-I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God!
- Everything OK, madam?
- I think I'm dying.
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.
God will smile on you.
'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,
I'm sorry, my love.'
I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.
Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of a dice.
I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
I swear I will.'
Not like this one.
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in!
I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.
Mr Baker.
Well, that completes the set.
- No, it does not.
- Well, who else am I missing?
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?
Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.
Oh, hi, Mary.
What concept?
Happy families.
Nice trip?
- How the f...?
- Please, Mary, there is a child present.
- How did you get in here?
- Karim let me in.
Hello.
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Nice to meet you, missus.
No, I mean how did you find me?
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
No, really, though, how?
Every movement I made was entirely random, every new personality just on the roll of a dice!
Mary, no human action is ever truly random.
An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability, mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual, can reduce the number of variables considerably.
I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine a seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.
But they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.
Oh, you bastard!
- You bastard!
- I know, but your face!
"The mathematics of probability"?
- You believed that.
- "Feasible variables"?
Yes, I started to run out about then.
In the memory stick!
Yeah, that was my idea.
- AGRA?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
You said it was your initials.
In a way that was true.
In a way?
So many lies.
I'm so sorry.
And I don't just mean you.
What?
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...
You're R?
Rosamund?
Rosamund Mary.
I always liked Mary.
Yeah, me too.
I used to.
I just...
I didn't know what else to do.
You could have stayed, you could have talked to me.
That's what couples are supposed to do.
Work things through.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Mary, I may not be a very good man but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for,
- most of the time.
- All the time.
You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.
You never judge, you never complain.
I don't deserve you, I...
All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
I will keep you safe.
But it has to be in London.
It's my city, I know the turf.
Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.
Get down!
Hello again.
- Ajay?
- Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.
Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.
I thought I was the only one who got out.
How did you find us?
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.
You found her but I found you.
So perhaps not so clever.
And now here we are.
At last.
Touche!
Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
She thought I was dead.
I might as well have been.
It was always just the four of us, always, remember?
Oh, yeah.
So why do you want to kill me?
Do you know how long they kept me prisoner?
What they did to me?
They tortured Alex to death.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.
But you?
You, where were you?
That day at the embassy, I escaped.
Ha!
But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
Where were you?
Oh, I got out.
For a while.
Long enough to hide my memory stick.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.
I was loyal, you see.
Loyal to my friends.
But they took me, tortured me.
Not for information.
Not for anything except fun.
They thought I'd give in, die, but I didn't, I lived.
And eventually, they forgot about me rotting in a cell somewhere.
Six years they kept me there.
Until one day I saw my chance.
Oh, and I made them pay.
You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.
Little whispers.
Laughter.
Gossip.
How the clever agents had been betrayed.
Brought down by you!
Me?
You know I'll kill you too.
You know I will, Ajay.
What, you think I care if I die?
I've dreamed of killing you every night for six years.
Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.
I swear to you, Ajay.
What did you hear, Ajay?
When you were a prisoner, what exactly did you hear?
What did I hear?
Ammo.
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo."
We were betrayed!
- And they said it was her?
- That you betrayed us!
They said her name?
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.
No!
No!
'The English woman, that's all he heard.
Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.'
Couldn't this wait until you're back?
No, it's not over.
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed, the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.
There was only a voice on the phone.
'Remember?
And a codeword.'
"Ammo," yes, you said.
How's your Latin, brother dear?
My Latin?
Amo, amas, amat.
I love, you love, he loves.
What...?
Not "Ammo" as in ammunition, but "Amo", meaning?
You'd better be right, Sherlock.
Bloody thing!
What's going on?
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.
What?
'So many lies.
And I don't just mean you.'
- Hello.
- Ah, hello.
- I like your daisy.
- Thank you, yeah.
It's not really me, though, I think.
- No?
- No, no, it's too floral for me.
I'm more of a "knackered with weary old eyes" kind of guy.
Well, I think they're nice.
Nice eyes.
- Thank you.
- Look...
Look...
I don't normally do this,
- but, um...
- But you're going to.
Yeah.
- What's this?
- This is me.
- Thank you.
Cheers.
- Yeah.
Great.
- Bye!
- Bye.

_

Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
Hmm?
Noticed what?
The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
- Yeah, can't she?
- Hmm.
I'm coming darling.
I'm coming.
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
- _
- Come here...
It's OK.
_
- _
- Do you want a cuddle?
_
I know.
- Oh, sweetheart.
- _
_
Ssh.
Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you?
_
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?
Oh, let's go and see Daddy!
Daddy's here.
It's OK, Rosie.
I'll take her.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I may as well get up now.
Hey, baby, it's Daddy.
Your daddy.
Come here, Rose.
Come here, darling, it's all right.
Thank you.
_
_
This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.
How many more times?
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.
And you're basing all this on a code name?
On a whispered voice on the telephone?
Come on, Mycroft.
You were the conduit for AGRA.
Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
It was my job.
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
AGRA went in.
- Yes.
- And they were betrayed.
Not by me.
Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.
I promise you,
I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.
You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.
Not one.
Not.
One.
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories?
I'd like to do those.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.
Although she does seem to enjoy them.
Well, I'll have to give that a go.
Got a lot to catch up on.
'You think you understand.
You understand nothing.'
'Code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love.'
'You'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.
'They know everything.'
'They said it was the English woman.'
'Don't minute any of this.'
'They know everything.'
- You don't make it easy, do you?
- What do you mean?
Well, being... being so perfect.
Mary, I...
I need to tell you...
Hang on.
Can you tell me later?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Great.
Well, no, we can't just go.
- Rosie.
- Yeah.
- Er, you go.
- No!
I'll come as soon as I've found someone.
Mrs Hudson.
- Corfu till Saturday.
Molly?
- Er, yeah, I'll try.
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.
You know that's not going to happen.
If there's more to this case, you need to see it.
Yeah, OK, you win.
'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes.
'Please make your way to the exit.
Thank you.'
Your office said I'd find you here.
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.
We're like them.
Ghostly, living in the shadows.
Predatory?
Well, it depends which side you're on.
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.
Nice location for the final act, couldn't have chosen it better myself.
But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.
I just come here to look at the fish.
I knew this would happen one day.
- It's like that old story.
- I really am a very busy man.
Would you mind cutting to the chase?
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
With good reason.
"There was once a merchant, in a famous market in Baghdad."
I really have never liked this story.
I'm just like the merchant in the story,
I thought I could out-run the inevitable.
I've always been looking over my shoulder, always expecting to see the grim figure of...
Death.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hey.
- John?
- On his way.
Let me introduce Ammo.
You were Ammo?
You were the person on the phone that time?
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
Why did you betray us?
Why does anyone do anything?
- Hmm.
- Let me guess, selling secrets?
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.
Worked very well for a few years.
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it.
But...
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.
I couldn't believe my luck!
That bought me a little time.
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
Very handy.
They were always such reliable killers.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.
Lady Smallwood gave the order.
But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.
Seemed to do the trick.
And you thought your troubles were over.
I was tired.
Tired of the mess of it all.
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.
The hostages were killed.
AGRA too.
Or so I thought.
My secret was safe.
But... apparently not.
Just a little peace.
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
A family?
Home?
Really, I understand.
So, just let me get out of here, right?
Let me just walk away.
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.
What do you say?
After what you did?
!
Mary, no!
OK.
London Aquarium.
Yes, now.
I was never a field agent.
I always thought I'd be rather good.
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
Thanks.
- For a secretary.
- What?
It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
- I didn't do this out of jealousy.
- No?
Same old drudge, day in, day out.
Never getting out there where all the excitement was.
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.
Yes, your little flat.
- How do you know?
- Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?
And what are you, widowed or divorced?
Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.
That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.
- Sherlock...
- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.
A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.
- Sherlock, don't.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.
There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
That accounts for the drink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.
So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.
To prove how good you are.
To make up for the inadequacies of your...
little life.
Well, Mrs Norbury,
I must admit this is unexpected.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.
All except Sherlock Holmes.
There's no way out.
So it would seem.
You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.
It's what I do.
Maybe I can still surprise you.
Now, come on, be sensible.
Hmm, no, I don't think so.
Ah!
Surprise!
Everything's fine.
It's going to be OK.
Get an ambulance!
It's all right, it's all right.
- Mary!
- John.
All right, Mary?
Mary?
Stay with me, stay with me.
- Oh, come on...
- No, don't worry.
Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
Come on, Mary.
Mary?
Oh, God.
John, I think this is it.
No, no, no, no.
It's not.
- That's...
- You made me so happy.
You gave me everything I could ever, ever have wanted...
Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.
- Look after Rosie.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.
- Promise me.
- I promise.
- No...
- Yes, I promise.
- Promise me!
- I promise, I promise.
Ssh, ssh.
Hey, Sherlock.
Yes.
I... so like you.
Did I ever say?
Yes, yes, you did.
I'm sorry for... for shooting you that time.
I'm really sorry.
- It's all right.
- I think we're even now, OK?
OK.
- Oh, I think we're...
- Mary, Mary...
- ...even, definitely even.
- Ssh, ssh.
You were my whole world.
Being Mary Watson was the only life worth living.
- Mary...
- Thank you.
Mary...
Don't you dare!
You made a vow.
You swore it.
'You've been having dreams.
A recurring dream?
'
Do you want to talk about it?
This is a two-way relationship, you know.
The whole world has come crashing down around you.
Everything's hopeless.
Irretrievable.
I know that's what you must feel but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
That's not really my style.
I need to know what to do.
Do?
About John.
Put me through to Sherrinford, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
But nothing will ever be the same again, will it?
I'm afraid it won't.
We'll have to rally round, I expect, do our bit.
Look after little Rosie.
I'm just going to, um look through these things.
There might be a case.
A case?
Oh, you're not up to it, are you?
Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.
Yes.
Yes, I expect you're right.
I'll make some tea, shall I?
- Mrs Hudson?
- Yes, Sherlock?
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident...
- Yes?
- ...would you just say the word Norbury to me?
Would you?
Norbury?
Just that.
I'd be very grateful.
What's this?
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.
Oh, God!
Is that...?
- Must be.
- Oh.
I knew it wouldn't end like this.
I knew Moriarty made plans.
'I thought that would get your attention.
So, this is in case...
In case the day comes.
If you are watching this, I'm probably dead.
I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows?
Nothing's certain, nothing's written.
My old life it was full of consequences.
The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.
You need to remember that.
So I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
Might be the hardest case of your career.
When I'm... gone, if I'm gone I need you to do something for me.'
Hi.
I just wondered how things were going and if there was anything I could do.
It's, er, it's from John.
- Right.
- You don't need to read it now.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.
He says...
John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...
Yes?
He said he'd that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Anyone.
'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
When I'm gone, if I'm... gone I need you to do something for me.
Save John Watson.
Save him, Sherlock.
Save him.'
'When does the path we walk on lock around our feet?
When does the road become a river with only one destination?
'
'Death waits for us all in Samarra.
But can Samarra be avoided?
'
Go to hell, Sherlock!
- My brother is a murderer.
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.
Oh, do your research.
I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Merry Christmas!
[GUNSHOT]
I'm not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.
You know what happened to the other one.
Miss me?
'Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
'
I've only been gone four minutes.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Is that quite clear?
Don't minute any of this.
Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.
A D notice has been slapped on the entire incident.
Only those within this room, code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love, will ever know the whole truth.
As far as everyone else is concerned, going to the Prime Minister
- and way beyond, Charles Augustus...
- [PHONE KEYBOARD CLICKS]
- Are you tweeting?
!
- No.
Well, that's what it looks like!
Of course I'm not tweeting.
Why would I be tweeting?
- Give me that!
- What?
No!
What are you doing?
!
- Get off!
- Give it here!
- "Back on terra firma."
- Don't read them out.
- "Free as a bird."
- God, you're such a spoilsport.
Will you take this matter seriously, Sherlock?
I am!
What makes you think I'm not taking it seriously?
"#OhWhatABeautifulMorning"
Look, not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death - my death!
And now I'm back, in a nice warm office, with my big brother and...
Are those ginger nuts?
- Oh, God...
- Love ginger nuts.
Our doctor said you were clean.
I am.
Utterly.
No need for stimulants now, remember?
I have work to do.
You're high as a kite!
Natural high, I assure you.
Totally natural.
I'm just... ?
..glad to be alive!
?
What shall we do next?
What's your name?
Vivian.
- What would you do, Vivian?
- Pardon?
Well, it's a lovely day.
Go for a stroll?
Make a paper aeroplane?
Have an ice lolly?
Ice lolly, I suppose.
Ice lolly it is!
- What's your favourite?
- Well, really, I shouldn't...
- Go on.
- Do they still do Mivvies?
- Mr Holmes...
- Yes?
- ...we do need to get on.
- Yes, of course.
[HELICOPTER WHIRS]
'Do your research.
'I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
[GUNSHOT]
- ..sociopath.
- [GUNSHOT]
- ..sociopath.' - [GUNSHOT]
I see.
Who is supposed to have shot him, then?
Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger - that's who.
- That's not what happened at all.
- It is now.
Remarkable.
How did you do it?
We have some very talented people working here.
If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.
That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.
No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.
You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.
You're home and dry.
OK, cheers.
Obviously, there's unfinished business.
Moriarty.
I told you
- Moriarty's dead.
You say he filmed that video message before he died.
Yes.
You also say you know what he's going to do next.
- What does that mean?
- Perhaps that's all there is to it.
Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
No, no, he would never be that disappointing.
He's planned something, something long-term.
Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.
Posthumous revenge.
No, better than that - posthumous game.
We brought you back to deal with this.
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.
Wait?
!
Of course wait.
I'm the target - targets wait.
Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up,
I'll know when it begins.
I always know when the game is on.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because I love it.
There was once a merchant, in the famous market at Baghdad.
- [WATER SLOSHES]
- One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise, and he knew that the stranger was Death.
Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles, to the city of Samarra.
For there he was sure Death could not find him.
But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.
"Very well," said the merchant.
"I give in.
I am yours."
"But tell me, why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"
"Because," said Death,
"I had an appointment with you tonight... ..in Samarra."
If this gets any better, I'm going to get two knives.
Pays to advertise.
- So, what about Moriarty, then?
- Oh, I have a plan.
I'm going to monitor the underworld, every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
So, basically, your plan is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do?
Awesome, isn't it?
He drowned, Mr Holmes.
That's what we thought.
- But when they opened up his lungs...
- Yes?
..sand.
- Superficial.
- [PHONE WHISTLES]
Come back!
It's the wrong thumb.
[DOOR SLAMS]
_
Sherlock...
It's never twins.
Hopkins, arrest Wilson.
Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.
- 'Wilson?
' 'Lymph nodes?
'
- Sherlock...
Yes, you may have nothing but a limbless torso, but there'll be traces of ink in the lymph nodes under the armpits.
If your mystery corpse had tattoos, the signs will be there.
- 'Bloody hell!
Is that a guess?
'
- I never guess.
- Sherlock...
- 'So, he's the killer?
The canary trainer?
'
- Of course he's the killer.
- 'Didn't see that coming.'
Hm, naturally.
Sherlock, you can't go on spinning plates like this.
That's it!
The place was spinning.
The heart medication you're taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.
Yes, I...
I think so.
Why?
Because the fingerprints on your brother's neck were your own.
- [WATSON CHUCKLES] A jellyfish?
- I know.
You can't arrest a jellyfish.
- You could try.
- We did try.
- [PHONE REPEATEDLY VIBRATES]
- Oh...
- Oh, God.
- Mary?
59 missed calls.
We're in a lot of trouble.
[MARY SCREAMS]
Ow!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Relax, it's got two syllables...
I'm a nurse, darling - I think I know what to do!
- Come on, then...
- Re!
Lax!
No, just drive, please, God, just drive!
God, drive!
- [SHE SCREAMS]
- Sherlock
- Mary!
- That's it, Mary - re...
- [PHONE KEYBOARD CLICKS]
- Don't you start!
- ...
lax.
John, John...
I think you have to pull over!
- Mary, Mary...
- Pull over!
- Oh, my God!
- [MARY SCREAMS]
Has that come out?
They never come out when I take them.
Let's have a look.
Aw, she's so beautiful.
- Have another go.
- What about a name?
- Catherine.
- Uh, yeah, we've gone off that.
Have we?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Well, you know what I think...
- BOTH:
It's not a girl's name.
Molly, Mrs H, we would love you to be godparents.
- Oh!
Really?
- If you...
That's so lovely.
And, uh... you too, Sherlock?
- You too what?
- Godfather, we'd like you to be godfather.
God is a ludicrous fiction, dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.
Yeah, but there'll be cake.
Will you do it?
I'll get back to you.
Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.
In Christ's name.
Now, what name have you given your daughter?
Rosamund Mary.
Rosamund?
It means "Rose of the world".
Rosie for short.
Didn't you get John's text?
No.
I delete his texts.
I delete any text that begins "Hi."
No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.
- [MRS HUDSON CLEARS THROAT]
- Sorry.
WHISPERING:
Phone!
And now, godparents, are you ready to help the parents of this child in their duties as Christian parents?
BOTH:
We are.
SIRI: 'Sorry, I didn't catch that.
'Please repeat the question.'
As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.
To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
Hard logic versus romantic whimsy - that is your choice.
You fail to connect actions to their consequences.
Now, for the last time, if you want to keep the rattle, do not throw the rattle.
[MESSAGE TONE]
All right, good girl, good girl.
Good girl.
I'd better finish this, hadn't I?
- Hey.
- Afternoon.
He says you've got a good one, Greg?
Oh, yeah.
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
God, 50!
Where does it go?
I know for a fact I was only 21 this time last week.
Yeah, well that's impossible.
That was before you met me.
- Well, no, no, there never was...
- "There never was such a time."
She's looking at me disapprovingly again.
No.
She's just jealous.
Yeah, well, I think we both are.
[PHONE VIBRATES]
- Oh...
- No, no, David.
- Come on, you promised.
- No, it's...
Oh, no...
Oh, it's a Skype call.
Oh!
Then it must be Charlie.
At least he's phoning, I suppose.
Oh, look!
Hello!
'Hey, Dad.
Happy birthday.
Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?
'
No!
Picture's frozen!
'Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you.'
Why is it rubbish?
Where are you?
How is he?
Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.
MAN:
David?
Come on!
OK, no, hang on a sec, I'll find somewhere quieter.
So, Charlie, where are you?
Are you there?
- 'Sorry, I'm here.
I'm just a bit...'
- Are you all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
Altitude?
'I'm in Tibet.
Didn't you see the mountains?
'
Never mind mountains.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.
- 'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?
'
- What?
'Could you just check something on my car?
'
Your car?
'To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe
I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet.
- 'Could you take a photo and send it?
'
- Uh, yes, I can do that.
All done.
Have you got it?
Charlie?
LESTRADE:
A week later...
Yeah?
...something really weird happens.
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed, the cops are chasing him, and he turns into the drive of the Welsborough house to try and get away.
Unfortunately...
The drunk guy survived, they managed to pull him out, but when they put the fire out and examined the parked car...
Whose body?
Charlie Welsborough, the son.
- What?
- The son who was in Tibet.
DNA all checks out.
Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.
[SHERLOCK CHUCKLES]
- Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
- Have you got a lab report?
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.
- The seats?
- Yes, the car seats.
Made of vinyl.
Two different types of vinyl present.
Was it his own car?
Yeah, not flash - he was a student.
- Well, that's suggestive.
- Why?
- Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
- Yeah, right?
- There's something else.
- Yes?
According to this,
Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.
What?
The body in the car, dead for a week.
Oh, this is a good one.
Is it my birthday?
You want help?
- Yes, please.
OK.
- One condition.
Take all the credit.
It gets boring if I just solve them all.
Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.
He's got a point.
Which makes me look like some kind of prima donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do!
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.
- Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
- Definitely a sore spot.
So you take all the glory, thanks...
- OK!
- ...thanks all the same.
Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?
It's driving me nuts.
Anything you say, Giles.
Just kidding.
HE MOUTHS:
What's his name?
HE MOUTHS:
Greg.
What?
Greg.
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?
Not a clue.
It's just you normally say that at this point.
Hmm.
Well, then, let's hope you solve your little problem, Greg.
- Hear that?
- I know.
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood?
- Oh, good, great.
Yeah, amazing.
- Getting any sleep?
- Christ, no.
You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.
- Must feel very different...
- Sorry, what?
Yes, well, you know how it is.
All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.
- Are you two having a little joke?
- Never a word of thanks.
Can't even tell people's faces apart.
This is a joke, isn't it?
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever.
You're so, so clever."
- Is it about me?
- I think he needs winding.
You know, I think that really might be it.
No, don't get it.
Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect, so go easy on them, yeah?
- You know me.
- MARY: 'Hey, hello.'
Yeah.
Got them, don't worry.
Pampers, the cream you can't get from Boots.
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now?
- At the dead boy's house?
- Yeah.
'And what does he think?
Any theories?
'
Well, I texted you the details.
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.
- Hey!
- How do you know about that?
'Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.'
- WHISPERING:
They know everything!
- 'Solved it, then?
'
I'm working on it.
'Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.'
- Pig!
- Keep trying.
'So, what about it, then?
'What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it?
'And what are you going to call this one?
'
Oh, the Ghost Driver.
- Don't give it a title.
- People like the titles.
- They hate the titles.
- Give the people what they want.
No, never do that - people are stupid.
Uh, some people.
'All people are stupid.
Most people.'
'Bizarre enough though, isn't it, to be him?
'
I mean, it's right up your strasse.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.
- Son.
- Son!
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.
If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.
Well, I believe that I can.
DISTORTED:
But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
Sherlock?
Mr Holmes?
Sorry, you were saying?
Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
I don't think we'll ever get over this.
No.
Shouldn't think so.
So sorry, will you excuse me a moment?
I just...
I'll...
I'll just, um...
Ahem.
- Now what's wrong?
- Not sure, I just...
By the pricking of my thumbs.
Seriously?
You?
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.
They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.
What is this?
Oh, it's a sort of shrine, I suppose, really.
Bit of a fan of Mrs T.
A big hero of mine when I was getting started.
Right, yes.
- Who?
- What?
- Who...?
Who was this?
- Are you serious?
- Sherlock...
- It's...
It's Margaret Thatcher, the first female Prime Minister of this country.
Right.
- Prime Minister?
Right.
- Leader of the Government.
- Female?
- For God's sake!
You know perfectly well who she is.
Why are you playing for time?
It's the gap, look at the gap.
It's wrong.
Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed.
The whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.
This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been in, this picture is straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.
- Something's missing from here, but only recently.
- Yes, a...
- Plaster bust... - plaster bust.
- Oh, for God's sake!
It got broken.
What the hell has this got to do with Charlie?
- Rug!
- What?
Well, how could it get broken?
The only place for it to fall is the floor and there is a big thick rug.
- Does it matter?
- Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.
- It is worth letting him do this.
- Is your friend quite mad?
No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
We found the remains out there in the porch.
- The porch where we came in?
- How anybody could hate her so much they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness...
I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.
Why didn't he smash all the others?
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.
Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.
- And if there's nothing...
- I know what happened to your son.
You do?
It's quite simple, superficial, to be blunt.
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness?
- Well, yes.
- And the porch where it was smashed,
I noticed the motion sensor was damaged,
- so I assume it's permanently lit.
- How did you notice that?
I lack the arrogance to ignore details.
I'm not the police.
- So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.
- Exactly.
- Why?
- Don't know.
Wouldn't be fun if I knew.
Mr Holmes, please!
It was your 50th birthday, Mr Welsborough, of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
- After all, he was in Tibet.
- Yes.
- No.
- No?
CROWD: ?
Happy birthday... ?
The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video.
Easily arranged.
It's a Skype call.
The trick was meant to be a surprise.
- A trick?
- Obviously.
Could you take a photo and send it?
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.
Well, good enough.
Effectively a costume.
You're joking?
No, I'm not.
All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
- Oh, my God!
- Surprise!
That's when it happened.
I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.
You said he'd felt unwell?
You all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
He died there and then.
No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained, in the driver's seat, hidden, until...
When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who'd been sitting there, quite dead, for a week.
Oh, God!
Poor kid.
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.
This is where it was smashed.
- That was amazing.
- What?
The car, the kid.
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?
I can't stand it, never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
What kind of a life would that be?
Besides, I have the strangest feeling...
Miss me?
- That's mine.
You two take a... bus.
- Why?
I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.
The Mall, please.
- I met her once.
- Thatcher?
Rather arrogant, I thought.
- You thought that?
!
- Ha, I know.
Why am I looking at this?
That's her, John and Mary's baby.
Oh, I see, yes.
Looks very... fully functioning.
Is that really the best you can do?
Sorry, I've never been very good with them.
- Babies?
- Humans.
Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?
Any interest in her?
Why on earth would he?
I don't know.
You tell me.
In the last year of his life,
James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over 70 assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias,
which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.
It's a pearl - get another one.
There's something important about this.
I'm sure.
Maybe it's Moriarty.
Maybe it's not.
[WATER SLOSHES]
But something's coming.
Are you having a premonition, brother mine?
The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other.
What we call premonition is just movement of the web.
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable.
As inevitable as mathematics.
Appointment In Samarra.
I'm sorry?
The merchant who can't outrun Death.
You always hated that story as a child.
Less keen on predestination back then.
I'm not sure I like it now.
You wrote your own version, as I remember.
Appointment In Sumatra.
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.
Goodnight, Mycroft.
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.
- Keep me informed.
- Of what?
Absolutely no idea.
'Ammo!
'
[MAN SHUDDERS]
- Oh, hi, Stella.
- Greg.
You, uh...?
- Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...
- Right, right, right...
Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?
It's nothing.
I mean it's nothing serious.
- No, no.
- I just pop round every now and again for a chat.
Yeah, of course.
I mean he loves a really tricky case.
Yeah, he does!
So what you here for?
Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so...
The Borgia Pearl?
They still after that, are they?
Yeah.
So, how did you two first meet?
Oh, well, there was a case about, um, ten years ago.
Nobody could figure it out.
There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.
- Oh, yeah?
How did she die?
- Hypothermia.
What?
I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...
Will you two please keep it down?
!
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?
You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.
I was a carpenter.
Like me dad.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
How the hell...?
Ah... e-cigarettes.
Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.
If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.
But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last.
Anything to add, John?
- John?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.
- What is that?
- That is... me.
Well, it's a me substitute.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You know I value your little contributions.
Yeah?
It's been there since nine this morning.
- Has it?
Where were you?
- Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.
What about my girlfriend?
- What?
- You said I had an ex...
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.
The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.
I...
I thought you'd done something clever.
Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?
[SHERLOCK INHALES DEEPLY]
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
What do you mean?
Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
- Well...
- You thought she was having an affair.
I'm afraid it's far worse than that, your wife is a spy.
- What?
- That's right.
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy, across the road from your flat.
Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy, as part of an official state visit.
As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.
This drug will render the President entirely susceptible to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty.
What?
Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III.
- Are you serious?
- No, of course not.
His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.
I don't!
- Just the bras.
- Get out.
So, what's this all about, then?
- Having fun.
- Fun?
- While I can.
- Mm-hmm.
[KNOCK AT DOOR]
- Uh, Sherlock...
- Borgia Pearl.
Boring.
Go!
- But...
- Go!
- This had better be good.
- Oh, I think you'll like it.
That is the bust, isn't it?
The one that was broken.
No, it's another one, different owner.
Different part of town.
You were right, this is a thing.
Something's going on.
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be pleased.
- I am pleased.
- You don't look pleased.
This is my game face.
And the game is on.
Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one.
- One belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan.
- Identical busts?
Yeah, and this one to a Dr Barnicot in Holborn.
Three in total.
God knows who'd want to do something like this.
Yeah, but some people have that complex, don't they?
An idee fixe.
They obsess over one thing and they can't let it go.
No, no good.
There were other images of Margaret...
Margaret...?
You know who she is.
...Thatcher, present at the first break-in.
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?
Ooh!
- What?
- Blood.
Quite a bit of it, too.
Was there any injury at the crime scene?
Nah.
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.
- Come on.
- Holborn?
Lambeth!
- Lambeth?
Why?
- To see Toby.
Ah, right.
Who?
- You'll see.
- Right, are you coming?
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.
- Who told you?
- The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.
- Have a good time.
- I will.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
- What?
- She's not the one.
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.
How do you work all that out?
She's got three children in Rio that he doesn't know about.
Are you just making this up?
- Possibly.
- Who's Toby?
There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker, one of the world's best.
Got himself into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago.
He hacked into the Pentagon security system, and I managed to get him off the charge.
Therefore he owes me a favour.
So, how does that help us?
- What?
- Toby the hacker?
- Toby's not the hacker.
- What?
- All right, Craig?
- All right, Sherlock?
Craig's got a dog.
So I see.
Good boy!
Hiya!
Mary?
What are you...?
No, we, we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case.
No, exactly.
So... don't wait up.
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Hey.
Mary, what are you doing here?
She's better at this than you.
- Better?
- So I texted her.
Hang on, Mary's better than me?
Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.
Of course she's better.
Yeah, OK.
Nothing personal.
What, so I'm supposed to just go home now, am I?
What do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?
- John or the dog?
- Ha-ha, that's funny!
- John.
- Well...
He's handy and loyal.
- That's hilarious.
- Is it too early for a divorce?
Oh.
Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge?
Keep up, he's fast.
- He's not moving.
- He's thinking.
He's really not moving.
Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.
You just like this dog, don't you?
- Well, I like you.
- He's still not moving.
- Fascinating.
- Oh!
[SHE CLEARS HER THROAT]
Well, what do you make of it?
- They were looking for something.
- Yes, but it wasn't a burglar, they came specifically for that Thatcher bust.
Why?
[DOG SNIFFS]
[DOG WHINES]
Clever.
Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail,
- where would you go?
- Like hiding a tree in a forest.
Or blood in a butcher's.
Never mind, Toby, better luck next time, hmm?
This is it, though.
This is the one, I can feel it.
Not Moriarty?
It has to be him.
It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.
It's designed to beguile me, tease me and lure me in.
At last, a noose for me to put my neck into.
You should have seen the state of the front room.
- It was like The Exorcist.
- Huh.
Was Rosie's head spinning round?
- No.
Just the projectile vomiting.
- Nice!
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
- Hmm?
Noticed what?
- The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
[BABY CRIES]
Yeah, can't she?
I'm coming, darling.
Mummy's coming.
LOVINGLY:
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here.
Have you heard of that thing?
In Germany?
You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.
Ostalgie.
People who missed the old days under the communists.
- People are weird, aren't they?
- Hmm.
According to this, there's quite a market for Cold War memorabilia.
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit?
Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.
Yes, fascinating.
Irrelevant.
Where exactly did they come from?
I've got into the records of the suppliers, Gelder and Co.
Seems they're from Georgia.
Where exactly?
Tbilisi.
Batch of six.
One to Welsborough.
One to Hassan.
One to Dr Barnicot.
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.
One to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.
Lestrade?
Another one?
- 'Yeah.'
- Harker or Sandeford?
Harker.
And it's murder this time.
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.
_
_
Defensive wounds on her face and hands, throat cut.
Sharp blade.
The same thing inside the house?
The bust?
- Two of them this time.
- Interesting.
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago.
- Limited edition of six.
- And now someone's wandering about destroying them all.
Makes no sense.
What's the point?
No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.
- Yes, it is.
- Well, it is, but it's not the point.
I've been slow, far too slow.
Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind...
Slow but lucky, very lucky.
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.
Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.
Congratulations, by the way.
- I'm sorry?
- Well, you're about to solve a big one.
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
- Yeah, until then, basically.
[WATER SPLASHING]
That's enough now, love.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.
And you need to get to bed.
Come on.
Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?
You were on the run.
Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying, it's clever.
Very clever.
But now you've met me and you're not so clever, are you?
Who are you?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.
Argh!
You're out of time.
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
- Who?
I know it's him.
It must be him.
You think you understand.
You understand nothing.
Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don't we just enjoy the moment?
Let me present Interpol's number one case.
Too tough for them, too boring for me.
The Black Pearl of the Borgias!
It's not possible!
How could she...?
!
Everything about who I was is on there.
The problems of your past are your business.
The problems of your future are my privilege.
I don't understand.
She...
She destroyed it.
She?
You know her!
You do, don't you?
You know the bitch?
!
She betrayed me.
Betrayed us all.
Mary.
This is about Mary?
Is that what she's calling herself now, eh?
- 'Armed police, you're surrounded!
'
- Give it to me.
YELLS:
Give it to me!
'Come out slowly, I want to see your hands above your head.'
Nobody shoots me!
Anyone shoots, I kill this man.
'Lay down your weapon.
Do it now!
'
I'm leaving this place.
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.
'Lay down your weapon.'
You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
Tell her she's a dead woman.
She's a dead woman walking.
She's my friend.
And she's under my protection.
Who are you?
I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.
Who's Sherlock Holmes?
Not a policeman.
[ALARM BLARES]
What do you think?
Mate in two?
Don't antagonise them, darling.
Oh, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.
Everything palls.
They'll send someone soon.
They?
Who are they?
Seems to me we put an awful lot of faith in they.
Well, I've got something they would dearly love, if only we could get out of here.
I've got Ammo.
Ammo?
- MARY:
Madame Ambassador.
- What took you so long?
- Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now!
Veer left!
[SCREAMING]
[HE LAUGHS]
What now?
What do we do?
We die.
Well?
He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.
- I very much doubt it.
- Why?
Because I think he used to work with Mary.
[GUNFIRE]
[SHOUTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE]
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out!
We'll come back later.
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the English woman?
What would you do to a traitor?
Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.
[HE CHUCKLES]
I am an idiot, I know nothing.
Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
That was quite a text you sent me.
What's going on, Sherlock?
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,
I couldn't see what was right under my nose.
Expected a pearl.
Oh, my God, that's a...
Yes, it's an AGRA.
Memory stick, like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.
Who?
I don't know.
We...
We all had one but the others were...
Haven't you even looked at it yet?
I glanced at it but I prefer
- to hear it from you.
- Why?
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.
There were four of us, agents.
Not just agents.
Polite term.
Alex.
Gabriel.
Me.
And Ajay.
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.
We all had one.
Each containing aliases, our background, everything.
We could never be betrayed, because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.
- Who employed you?
- Anyone who paid well.
I mean, we were at the top of our game for years.
And then it all ended.
There was a coup in Georgia.
The British Embassy in Tbilisi was taken over, lots of hostages.
We got the call to go in, get them out.
There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.
- Who from?
- I don't know, just another voice on the phone.
And a codeword.
- Ammo.
- Ammo?
Like ammunition.
We went in, but then something went wrong.
Something went really wrong.
[GUNFIRE, SCREAMING]
That was six years ago.
It feels like forever.
I was the only one that made it out.
No.
What?
I met someone tonight.
Same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.
What, he's alive?
Yeah, very much so.
I don't believe it, this is amazing!
I thought I was the only one,
I thought I was the only one who got out.
Where is he?
I need to see him, now!
Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?
Yeah, of course.
It was our insurance.
Above all, they mustn't fall into enemy hands.
So Ajay survived as well.
And now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide, with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why?
I don't know.
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
[SHE LAUGHS]
Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.
Families fall out.
The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
Well, he's just trying to find me.
He survived, that's all that matters!
I heard it from his own mouth.
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."
Why would he want to kill me?
- He said you betrayed him.
- Oh, no, no, that's insane.
Well, it's what he believes.
[SHE GASPS]
I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.
No, Mary...
You do.
I made a vow, remember?
To look after the three of you.
Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
There's something I think you should read.
What is it?
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.
What are you...?
[HE SNIFFS]
- Mary...
Oh, no!
- There you go.
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.
No.
You just look after them till I get back.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
[CHILD SINGS]
[HE GROANS]
Agra?
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
It is 378km west of the state capital, Lucknow.
What are you, Wikipedia?
- Yes.
- AGRA is an acronym.
Oh, good, I love an acronym.
All the best secret societies have them.
Team of agents, the best.
But you know all that.
Of course I do.
Go on.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.
Indeed?
Well, that's news to me.
Is it?
He's already killed looking for that memory stick.
AGRA always worked for the highest bidder,
I thought that might include you?
- Me?
- Well, I mean the British government, or whatever government you're currently propping up.
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.
They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong.
And that was that, we stopped using freelancers.
- Your initiative?
- My initiative.
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.
I don't like loose ends.
Not on my watch.
There was something else.
A detail.
A codeword.
Ammo?
It's all I've got.
Little enough.
Could you do some digging as a favour?
You don't have many favours left.
Then I'm calling them all in.
And if you can find who's after her and neutralise them, what then?
You think you can go on saving her forever?
Of course.
Is that sentiment talking?
No, it's me.
Difficult to tell the difference these days.
Told you, I made a promise.
A vow.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.
Not on my watch.
MARY: 'My darling, I need to tell you this because you mustn't hate me for going away.'
NEW YORK ACCENT:
Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.
- Can you hear a squeaking?
- No.
Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel.
Why Planes Fail.
- Did you see it?
Oh, truly terrifying.
- Can't say I did.
Swore I would never fly again, yet hear I am!
Everything OK, madam?
No.
No, no, it's not, but then what's the use in complaining?
I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off is all.
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.
Oh, OK.
Relax.
She said relax. [CHUCKLES]
Did you have a nice time in London?
It was OK, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun?
- Did you lose it in the war?
- [SHE LAUGHS]
'I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.
I'm not running, I promise you that,
I just need to do this in my own way.'
Oh, God!
I'm...
I-I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God!
[FLIGHT ATTENDANT BUTTON BEEPS]
- Everything OK, madam?
- I think I'm dying.
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.
God will smile on you.
'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,
I'm sorry, my love.'
I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.
Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of a dice.
I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
I swear I will.'
[LAUGHTER]
Not like this one.
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in!
I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.
Mr Baker.
Well, that completes the set.
- No, it does not.
- Well, who else am I missing?
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?
Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.
Oh, hi, Mary.
What concept?
Happy families.
Nice trip?
- How the f...?
- Please, Mary, there is a child present.
- How did you get in here?
- Karim let me in.
Hello.
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Nice to meet you, missus.
No, I mean how did you find me?
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
No, really, though, how?
Every movement I made was entirely random, every new personality just on the roll of a dice!
Mary, no human action is ever truly random.
An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability, mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual, can reduce the number of variables considerably.
I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine a seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.
But they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.
[HE CHUCKLES]
JOKINGLY:
Oh, you bastard!
- ANGRILY:
You bastard!
- I know, but your face!
"The mathematics of probability"?
- You believed that.
- "Feasible variables"?
Yes, I started to run out about then.
In the memory stick!
Yeah, that was my idea.
- AGRA?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
You said it was your initials.
In a way that was true.
In a way?
So many lies.
I'm so sorry.
And I don't just mean you.
What?
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...
You're R?
Rosamund?
Rosamund Mary.
I always liked Mary.
Yeah, me too.
I used to.
I just...
I didn't know what else to do.
You could have stayed, you could have talked to me.
That's what couples are supposed to do.
Work things through.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Mary, I may not be a very good man but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for,
- most of the time.
- All the time.
You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.
You never judge, you never complain.
I don't deserve you, I...
All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
I will keep you safe.
But it has to be in London.
It's my city, I know the turf.
Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.
Get down!
[RAPID GUNFIRE]
Hello again.
- Ajay?
- Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.
Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.
I thought I was the only one who got out.
How did you find us?
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.
You found her but I found you.
So perhaps not so clever.
And now here we are.
At last.
[HE CHUCKLES] Touche!
Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
She thought I was dead.
I might as well have been.
It was always just the four of us, always, remember?
Oh, yeah.
So why do you want to kill me?
Do you know how long they kept me prisoner?
What they did to me?
They tortured Alex to death.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.
But you?
You, where were you?
That day at the embassy, I escaped.
Ha!
But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
Where were you?
Oh, I got out.
For a while.
Long enough to hide my memory stick.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.
I was loyal, you see.
Loyal to my friends.
But they took me, tortured me.
Not for information.
Not for anything except fun.
They thought I'd give in, die, but I didn't, I lived.
And eventually, they forgot about me rotting in a cell somewhere.
Six years they kept me there.
Until one day I saw my chance.
Oh, and I made them pay.
You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.
Little whispers.
Laughter.
Gossip.
How the clever agents had been betrayed.
Brought down by you!
- Me?
- [TRAIN WHISTLES]
You know I'll kill you too.
You know I will, Ajay.
What, you think I care if I die?
I've dreamed of killing you every night for six years.
Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.
I swear to you, Ajay.
What did you hear, Ajay?
When you were a prisoner, what exactly did you hear?
What did I hear?
Ammo.
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo."
We were betrayed!
- And they said it was her?
- That you betrayed us!
They said her name?
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.
No!
No!
'The English woman, that's all he heard.
Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.'
Couldn't this wait until you're back?
No, it's not over.
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed, the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.
There was only a voice on the phone.
'Remember?
And a codeword.'
"Ammo," yes, you said.
How's your Latin, brother dear?
My Latin?
Amo, amas, amat.
I love, you love, he loves.
What...?
Not "Ammo" as in ammunition, but "Amo", meaning?
You'd better be right, Sherlock.
Bloody thing!
What's going on?
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.
What?
'So many lies.
And I don't just mean you.'
- Hello.
- Ah, hello.
- I like your daisy.
- Thank you, yeah.
It's not really me, though, I think.
- No?
- No, no, it's too floral for me.
I'm more of a "knackered with weary old eyes" kind of guy.
Well, I think they're nice.
Nice eyes.
- [HE LAUGHS] Thank you.
- Look...
Look...
I don't normally do this,
- but, um...
- But you're going to.
Yeah.
- What's this?
- This is me.
- Thank you.
Cheers.
- Yeah.
Great.
- Bye!
- Bye.
[HE CHUCKLES]

[PHONE BEEPS]
_
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
Hmm?
Noticed what?
The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
[BABY CRIES]
- Yeah, can't she?
- Hmm.
I'm coming darling.
I'm coming.
[PHONE BEEPS]
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
- _
- Come here...
It's OK.
_
- _
- Do you want a cuddle?
[BABY CONTINUES TO WAIL]
_
I know.
- Oh, sweetheart.
- _
_
Ssh.
Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you?
_
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?
Oh, let's go and see Daddy!
Daddy's here.
It's OK, Rosie.
I'll take her.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I may as well get up now.
Hey, baby, it's Daddy.
Your daddy.
Come here, Rose.
Come here, darling, it's all right.
Thank you.
_
_
This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.
How many more times?
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.
And you're basing all this on a code name?
On a whispered voice on the telephone?
Come on, Mycroft.
You were the conduit for AGRA.
Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
It was my job.
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
AGRA went in.
- Yes.
- And they were betrayed.
Not by me.
Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.
I promise you,
I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.
You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.
Not one.
Not.
One.
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories?
I'd like to do those.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.
Although she does seem to enjoy them.
Well, I'll have to give that a go.
Got a lot to catch up on.
AJAY: 'You think you understand.
You understand nothing.'
MYCROFT: 'Code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love.'
MARY: 'You'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.
'They know everything.'
'They said it was the English woman.'
'Don't minute any of this.'
'They know everything.'
- You don't make it easy, do you?
- What do you mean?
Well, being... being so perfect.
Mary, I...
I need to tell you...
- [PHONE BEEPS]
- Hang on.
Can you tell me later?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Great.
Well, no, we can't just go.
- Rosie.
- Yeah.
- Er, you go.
- No!
I'll come as soon as I've found someone.
Mrs Hudson.
- Corfu till Saturday.
Molly?
- Er, yeah, I'll try.
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.
You know that's not going to happen.
If there's more to this case, you need to see it.
Yeah, OK, you win.
'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes.
'Please make your way to the exit.
Thank you.'
Your office said I'd find you here.
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.
We're like them.
Ghostly, living in the shadows.
Predatory?
Well, it depends which side you're on.
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.
Nice location for the final act, couldn't have chosen it better myself.
But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.
I just come here to look at the fish.
I knew this would happen one day.
- It's like that old story.
- I really am a very busy man.
Would you mind cutting to the chase?
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
With good reason.
"There was once a merchant, in a famous market in Baghdad."
I really have never liked this story.
I'm just like the merchant in the story,
I thought I could out-run the inevitable.
I've always been looking over my shoulder, always expecting to see the grim figure of...
Death.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hey.
- John?
- On his way.
Let me introduce Ammo.
You were Ammo?
You were the person on the phone that time?
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
Why did you betray us?
Why does anyone do anything?
- Hmm.
- Let me guess, selling secrets?
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.
Worked very well for a few years.
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it.
But...
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.
[SHE CHUCKLES] I couldn't believe my luck!
That bought me a little time.
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
Very handy.
They were always such reliable killers.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.
Lady Smallwood gave the order.
But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.
Seemed to do the trick.
And you thought your troubles were over.
I was tired.
Tired of the mess of it all.
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.
The hostages were killed.
AGRA too.
Or so I thought.
My secret was safe.
But... apparently not.
Just a little peace.
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
A family?
Home?
Really, I understand.
So, just let me get out of here, right?
Let me just walk away.
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.
What do you say?
After what you did?
!
Mary, no!
OK.
London Aquarium.
Yes, now.
I was never a field agent.
I always thought I'd be rather good.
[MARY SCOFFS]
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
Thanks.
- For a secretary.
- What?
It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
- I didn't do this out of jealousy.
- No?
Same old drudge, day in, day out.
Never getting out there where all the excitement was.
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.
Yes, your little flat.
- How do you know?
- Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?
And what are you, widowed or divorced?
Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.
That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.
- Sherlock...
- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.
A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.
- Sherlock, don't.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.
There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
That accounts for the drink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.
So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.
To prove how good you are.
To make up for the inadequacies of your...
little life.
Well, Mrs Norbury,
I must admit this is unexpected.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.
All except Sherlock Holmes.
There's no way out.
So it would seem.
You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.
It's what I do.
Maybe I can still surprise you.
Now, come on, be sensible.
Hmm, no, I don't think so.
Ah!
Surprise!
[MARY GASPS FOR AIR]
[MARY GROANS]
Everything's fine.
It's going to be OK.
Get an ambulance!
It's all right, it's all right.
- Mary!
- John.
All right, Mary?
Mary?
Stay with me, stay with me.
- Oh, come on...
- No, don't worry.
Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
Come on, Mary.
Mary?
Oh, God.
John, I think this is it.
No, no, no, no.
It's not.
- That's...
- You made me so happy.
You gave me everything I could ever, ever have wanted...
Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.
- Look after Rosie.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.
- Promise me.
- I promise.
- No...
- Yes, I promise.
- Promise me!
- I promise, I promise.
Ssh, ssh.
Hey, Sherlock.
Yes.
I... so like you.
Did I ever say?
Yes, yes, you did.
I'm sorry for... for shooting you that time.
I'm really sorry.
It's all right.
I think we're even now, OK?
OK.
- Oh, I think we're...
- Mary, Mary...
- ...even, definitely even.
- Ssh, ssh.
You were my whole world.
Being Mary Watson was the only life worth living.
- Mary...
- Thank you.
Mary...
[HE BEWAILS]
Don't you dare!
You made a vow.
You swore it.
[PHONE BEEPS REPEATEDLY]
'You've been having dreams.
A recurring dream?
'
[CLOCK TICKS RHYTHMICALLY]
Do you want to talk about it?
This is a two-way relationship, you know.
[SHE SIGHS]
The whole world has come crashing down around you.
Everything's hopeless.
Irretrievable.
I know that's what you must feel but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
That's not really my style.
I need to know what to do.
Do?
About John.
[BACK CRACKS, HE GROANS]
Put me through to Sherrinford, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
SOBS:
But nothing will ever be the same again, will it?
I'm afraid it won't.
We'll have to rally round, I expect, do our bit.
Look after little Rosie.
I'm just going to, um look through these things.
There might be a case.
A case?
Oh, you're not up to it, are you?
Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.
Yes.
Yes, I expect you're right.
I'll make some tea, shall I?
- Mrs Hudson?
- Yes, Sherlock?
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident...
- Yes?
- ...would you just say the word Norbury to me?
Would you?
Norbury?
Just that.
I'd be very grateful.
What's this?
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.
Oh, God!
Is that...?
- Must be.
- Oh.
I knew it wouldn't end like this.
I knew Moriarty made plans.
'I thought that would get your attention.
So, this is in case...
In case the day comes.
If you are watching this, I'm probably dead.
I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows?
Nothing's certain, nothing's written.
My old life it was full of consequences.
The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.
You need to remember that.
So I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
Might be the hardest case of your career.
When I'm... gone, if I'm gone I need you to do something for me.'
- [BABY GURGLES]
- Hi.
I just wondered how things were going and if there was anything I could do.
It's, er, it's from John.
- Right.
- You don't need to read it now.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.
He says...
John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...
Yes?
He said he'd that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Anyone.
[DOOR CLOSES]
'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
When I'm gone, if I'm... gone I need you to do something for me.
Save John Watson.
Save him, Sherlock.
Save him.'
'When does the path we walk on lock around our feet?
When does the road become a river with only one destination?
'
'Death waits for us all in Samarra.
But can Samarra be avoided?
'
Go to hell, Sherlock!
- _
- My brother is a murderer.
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.
Oh, do your research.
I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Merry Christmas!
[GUNSHOT]
I'm not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.
You know what happened to the other one.
Miss me?
'Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
'
I've only been gone four minutes.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Is that quite clear?
Don't minute any of this.
Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.
A D notice has been slapped on the entire incident.
Only those within this room, code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love, will ever know the whole truth.
As far as everyone else is concerned, going to the Prime Minister
- and way beyond, Charles Augustus...
- [PHONE KEYBOARD CLICKS]
- Are you tweeting?
!
- No.
Well, that's what it looks like!
Of course I'm not tweeting.
Why would I be tweeting?
- Give me that!
- What?
No!
What are you doing?
!
- Get off!
- Give it here!
- "Back on terra firma."
- Don't read them out.
- "Free as a bird."
- God, you're such a spoilsport.
Will you take this matter seriously, Sherlock?
I am!
What makes you think I'm not taking it seriously?
"#OhWhatABeautifulMorning"
Look, not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death - my death!
And now I'm back, in a nice warm office, with my big brother and...
Are those ginger nuts?
- Oh, God...
- Love ginger nuts.
Our doctor said you were clean.
I am.
Utterly.
No need for stimulants now, remember?
I have work to do.
You're high as a kite!
Natural high, I assure you.
Totally natural.
I'm just... ♪ ..glad to be alive!
♪
What shall we do next?
What's your name?
Vivian.
- What would you do, Vivian?
- Pardon?
Well, it's a lovely day.
Go for a stroll?
Make a paper aeroplane?
Have an ice lolly?
Ice lolly, I suppose.
Ice lolly it is!
- What's your favourite?
- Well, really, I shouldn't...
- Go on.
- Do they still do Mivvies?
- Mr Holmes...
- Yes?
- ...we do need to get on.
- Yes, of course.
[HELICOPTER WHIRS]
'Do your research.
'I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
[GUNSHOT]
- ..sociopath.
- [GUNSHOT]
- ..sociopath.' - [GUNSHOT]
I see.
Who is supposed to have shot him, then?
Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger - that's who.
- That's not what happened at all.
- It is now.
Remarkable.
How did you do it?
We have some very talented people working here.
If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.
That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.
No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.
You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.
You're home and dry.
OK, cheers.
Obviously, there's unfinished business.
Moriarty.
I told you
- Moriarty's dead.
You say he filmed that video message before he died.
Yes.
You also say you know what he's going to do next.
- What does that mean?
- Perhaps that's all there is to it.
Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
No, no, he would never be that disappointing.
He's planned something, something long-term.
Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.
Posthumous revenge.
No, better than that - posthumous game.
We brought you back to deal with this.
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.
Wait?
!
Of course wait.
I'm the target - targets wait.
Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up,
I'll know when it begins.
I always know when the game is on.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because I love it.
There was once a merchant, in the famous market at Baghdad.
- [WATER SLOSHES]
- One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise, and he knew that the stranger was Death.
Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles, to the city of Samarra.
For there he was sure Death could not find him.
But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.
"Very well," said the merchant.
"I give in.
I am yours."
"But tell me, why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"
"Because," said Death,
"I had an appointment with you tonight... ..in Samarra."
If this gets any better, I'm going to get two knives.
Pays to advertise.
- So, what about Moriarty, then?
- Oh, I have a plan.
I'm going to monitor the underworld, every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
So, basically, your plan is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do?
Awesome, isn't it?
He drowned, Mr Holmes.
That's what we thought.
- But when they opened up his lungs...
- Yes?
..sand.
- Superficial.
- [PHONE WHISTLES]
Come back!
It's the wrong thumb.

Sherlock...
It's never twins.
Hopkins, arrest Wilson.
Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.
- 'Wilson?
' 'Lymph nodes?
'
- Sherlock...
Yes, you may have nothing but a limbless torso, but there'll be traces of ink in the lymph nodes under the armpits.
If your mystery corpse had tattoos, the signs will be there.
- 'Bloody hell!
Is that a guess?
'
- I never guess.
- Sherlock...
- 'So, he's the killer?
The canary trainer?
'
- Of course he's the killer.
- 'Didn't see that coming.'
Hm, naturally.
Sherlock, you can't go on spinning plates like this.
That's it!
The place was spinning.
The heart medication you're taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.
Yes, I...
I think so.
Why?
Because the fingerprints on your brother's neck were your own.
- [WATSON CHUCKLES] A jellyfish?
- I know.
You can't arrest a jellyfish.
- You could try.
- We did try.
- [PHONE REPEATEDLY VIBRATES]

Ow!

Oh, my God!
Relax, it's got two syllables...
I'm a nurse, darling - I think I know what to do!

Has that come out?
They never come out when I take them.
Let's have a look.
Aw, she's so beautiful.
- Have another go.
- What about a name?
- Catherine.
- Uh, yeah, we've gone off that.
Have we?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Well, you know what I think...
- BOTH:
It's not a girl's name.
Molly, Mrs H, we would love you to be godparents.
- Oh!
Really?
- If you...
That's so lovely.
And, uh... you too, Sherlock?
- You too what?
- Godfather, we'd like you to be godfather.
God is a ludicrous fiction, dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.
Yeah, but there'll be cake.
Will you do it?
I'll get back to you.
Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.
In Christ's name.
Now, what name have you given your daughter?
Rosamund Mary.
Rosamund?
It means "Rose of the world".
Rosie for short.
Didn't you get John's text?
No.
I delete his texts.
I delete any text that begins "Hi."
No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.
- [MRS HUDSON CLEARS THROAT]
- Sorry.
WHISPERING:
Phone!
And now, godparents, are you ready to help the parents of this child in their duties as Christian parents?
BOTH:
We are.
SIRI: 'Sorry, I didn't catch that.
'Please repeat the question.'
As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.
To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
Hard logic versus romantic whimsy - that is your choice.
You fail to connect actions to their consequences.
Now, for the last time, if you want to keep the rattle, do not throw the rattle.
[MESSAGE TONE]
All right, good girl, good girl.
Good girl.
I'd better finish this, hadn't I?
- Hey.
- Afternoon.
He says you've got a good one, Greg?
Oh, yeah.
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
God, 50!
Where does it go?
I know for a fact I was only 21 this time last week.
Yeah, well that's impossible.
That was before you met me.
- Well, no, no, there never was...
- "There never was such a time."
She's looking at me disapprovingly again.
No.
She's just jealous.
Yeah, well, I think we both are.
[PHONE VIBRATES]
- Oh...
- No, no, David.
- Come on, you promised.
- No, it's...
Oh, no...
Oh, it's a Skype call.
Oh!
Then it must be Charlie.
At least he's phoning, I suppose.
Oh, look!
Hello!
'Hey, Dad.
Happy birthday.
Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?
'
No!
Picture's frozen!
'Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you.'
Why is it rubbish?
Where are you?
How is he?
Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.
MAN:
David?
Come on!
OK, no, hang on a sec, I'll find somewhere quieter.
So, Charlie, where are you?
Are you there?
- 'Sorry, I'm here.
I'm just a bit...'
- Are you all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
Altitude?
'I'm in Tibet.
Didn't you see the mountains?
'
Never mind mountains.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.
- 'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?
'
- What?
'Could you just check something on my car?
'
Your car?
'To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe
I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet.
- 'Could you take a photo and send it?
'
- Uh, yes, I can do that.
All done.
Have you got it?
Charlie?
LESTRADE:
A week later...
Yeah?
...something really weird happens.
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed, the cops are chasing him, and he turns into the drive of the Welsborough house to try and get away.
Unfortunately...
The drunk guy survived, they managed to pull him out, but when they put the fire out and examined the parked car...
Whose body?
Charlie Welsborough, the son.
- What?
- The son who was in Tibet.
DNA all checks out.
Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.
[SHERLOCK CHUCKLES]
- Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
- Have you got a lab report?
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.
- The seats?
- Yes, the car seats.
Made of vinyl.
Two different types of vinyl present.
Was it his own car?
Yeah, not flash - he was a student.
- Well, that's suggestive.
- Why?
- Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
- Yeah, right?
- There's something else.
- Yes?
According to this,
Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.
What?
The body in the car, dead for a week.
Oh, this is a good one.
Is it my birthday?
You want help?
- Yes, please.
OK.
- One condition.
Take all the credit.
It gets boring if I just solve them all.
Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.
He's got a point.
Which makes me look like some kind of prima donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do!
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.
- Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
- Definitely a sore spot.
So you take all the glory, thanks...
- OK!
- ...thanks all the same.
Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?
It's driving me nuts.
Anything you say, Giles.
Just kidding.
HE MOUTHS:
What's his name?
HE MOUTHS:
Greg.
What?
Greg.
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?
Not a clue.
It's just you normally say that at this point.
Hmm.
Well, then, let's hope you solve your little problem, Greg.
- Hear that?
- I know.
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood?
- Oh, good, great.
Yeah, amazing.
- Getting any sleep?
- Christ, no.
You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.
- Must feel very different...
- Sorry, what?
Yes, well, you know how it is.
All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.
- Are you two having a little joke?
- Never a word of thanks.
Can't even tell people's faces apart.
This is a joke, isn't it?
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever.
You're so, so clever."
- Is it about me?
- I think he needs winding.
You know, I think that really might be it.
No, don't get it.
Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect, so go easy on them, yeah?
- You know me.
- MARY: 'Hey, hello.'
Yeah.
Got them, don't worry.
Pampers, the cream you can't get from Boots.
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now?
- At the dead boy's house?
- Yeah.
'And what does he think?
Any theories?
'
Well, I texted you the details.
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.
- Hey!
- How do you know about that?
'Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.'
- WHISPERING:
They know everything!
- 'Solved it, then?
'
I'm working on it.
'Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.'
- Pig!
- Keep trying.
'So, what about it, then?
'What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it?
'And what are you going to call this one?
'
Oh, the Ghost Driver.
- Don't give it a title.
- People like the titles.
- They hate the titles.
- Give the people what they want.
No, never do that - people are stupid.
Uh, some people.
'All people are stupid.
Most people.'
'Bizarre enough though, isn't it, to be him?
'
I mean, it's right up your strasse.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.
- Son.
- Son!
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.
If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.
Well, I believe that I can.
DISTORTED:
But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
Sherlock?
Mr Holmes?
Sorry, you were saying?
Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
I don't think we'll ever get over this.
No.
Shouldn't think so.
So sorry, will you excuse me a moment?
I just...
I'll...
I'll just, um...
Ahem.
- Now what's wrong?
- Not sure, I just...
By the pricking of my thumbs.
Seriously?
You?
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.
They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.
What is this?
Oh, it's a sort of shrine, I suppose, really.
Bit of a fan of Mrs T.
A big hero of mine when I was getting started.
Right, yes.
- Who?
- What?
- Who...?
Who was this?
- Are you serious?
- Sherlock...
- It's...
It's Margaret Thatcher, the first female Prime Minister of this country.
Right.
- Prime Minister?
Right.
- Leader of the Government.
- Female?
- For God's sake!
You know perfectly well who she is.
Why are you playing for time?
It's the gap, look at the gap.
It's wrong.
Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed.
The whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.
This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been in, this picture is straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.
- Something's missing from here, but only recently.
- Yes, a...
- Plaster bust... - plaster bust.
- Oh, for God's sake!
It got broken.
What the hell has this got to do with Charlie?
- Rug!
- What?
Well, how could it get broken?
The only place for it to fall is the floor and there is a big thick rug.
- Does it matter?
- Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.
- It is worth letting him do this.
- Is your friend quite mad?
No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
We found the remains out there in the porch.
- The porch where we came in?
- How anybody could hate her so much they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness...
I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.
Why didn't he smash all the others?
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.
Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.
- And if there's nothing...
- I know what happened to your son.
You do?
It's quite simple, superficial, to be blunt.
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness?
- Well, yes.
- And the porch where it was smashed,
I noticed the motion sensor was damaged,
- so I assume it's permanently lit.
- How did you notice that?
I lack the arrogance to ignore details.
I'm not the police.
- So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.
- Exactly.
- Why?
- Don't know.
Wouldn't be fun if I knew.
Mr Holmes, please!
It was your 50th birthday, Mr Welsborough, of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
- After all, he was in Tibet.
- Yes.
- No.
- No?
CROWD: ♪ Happy birthday... ♪
The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video.
Easily arranged.
It's a Skype call.
The trick was meant to be a surprise.
- A trick?
- Obviously.
Could you take a photo and send it?
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.
Well, good enough.
Effectively a costume.
You're joking?
No, I'm not.
All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
- Oh, my God!
- Surprise!
That's when it happened.
I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.
You said he'd felt unwell?
You all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
He died there and then.
No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained, in the driver's seat, hidden, until...
When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who'd been sitting there, quite dead, for a week.
Oh, God!
Poor kid.
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.
This is where it was smashed.
- That was amazing.
- What?
The car, the kid.
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?
I can't stand it, never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
What kind of a life would that be?
Besides, I have the strangest feeling...
Miss me?
- That's mine.
You two take a... bus.
- Why?
I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.
The Mall, please.
- I met her once.
- Thatcher?
Rather arrogant, I thought.
- You thought that?
!
- Ha, I know.
Why am I looking at this?
That's her, John and Mary's baby.
Oh, I see, yes.
Looks very... fully functioning.
Is that really the best you can do?
Sorry, I've never been very good with them.
- Babies?
- Humans.
Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?
Any interest in her?
Why on earth would he?
I don't know.
You tell me.
In the last year of his life,
James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over 70 assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias,
which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.
It's a pearl - get another one.
There's something important about this.
I'm sure.
Maybe it's Moriarty.
Maybe it's not.
[WATER SLOSHES]
But something's coming.
Are you having a premonition, brother mine?
The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other.
What we call premonition is just movement of the web.
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable.
As inevitable as mathematics.
Appointment In Samarra.
I'm sorry?
The merchant who can't outrun Death.
You always hated that story as a child.
Less keen on predestination back then.
I'm not sure I like it now.
You wrote your own version, as I remember.
Appointment In Sumatra.
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.
Goodnight, Mycroft.
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.
- Keep me informed.
- Of what?
Absolutely no idea.
'Ammo!
'
[MAN SHUDDERS]
- Oh, hi, Stella.
- Greg.
You, uh...?
- Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...
- Right, right, right...
Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?
It's nothing.
I mean it's nothing serious.
- No, no.
- I just pop round every now and again for a chat.
Yeah, of course.
I mean he loves a really tricky case.
Yeah, he does!
So what you here for?
Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so...
The Borgia Pearl?
They still after that, are they?
Yeah.
So, how did you two first meet?
Oh, well, there was a case about, um, ten years ago.
Nobody could figure it out.
There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.
- Oh, yeah?
How did she die?
- Hypothermia.
What?
I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...
Will you two please keep it down?
!
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?
You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.
I was a carpenter.
Like me dad.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
How the hell...?
Ah... e-cigarettes.
Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.
If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.
But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last.
Anything to add, John?
- John?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.
- What is that?
- That is... me.
Well, it's a me substitute.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You know I value your little contributions.
Yeah?
It's been there since nine this morning.
- Has it?
Where were you?
- Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.
What about my girlfriend?
- What?
- You said I had an ex...
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.
The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.
I...
I thought you'd done something clever.
Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?
[SHERLOCK INHALES DEEPLY]
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
What do you mean?
Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
- Well...
- You thought she was having an affair.
I'm afraid it's far worse than that, your wife is a spy.
- What?
- That's right.
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy, across the road from your flat.
Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy, as part of an official state visit.
As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.
This drug will render the President entirely susceptible to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty.
What?
Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III.
- Are you serious?
- No, of course not.
His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.
I don't!
- Just the bras.
- Get out.
So, what's this all about, then?
- Having fun.
- Fun?
- While I can.
- Mm-hmm.
[KNOCK AT DOOR]
- Uh, Sherlock...
- Borgia Pearl.
Boring.
Go!
- But...
- Go!
- This had better be good.
- Oh, I think you'll like it.
That is the bust, isn't it?
The one that was broken.
No, it's another one, different owner.
Different part of town.
You were right, this is a thing.
Something's going on.
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be pleased.
- I am pleased.
- You don't look pleased.
This is my game face.
And the game is on.
Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one.
- One belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan.
- Identical busts?
Yeah, and this one to a Dr Barnicot in Holborn.
Three in total.
God knows who'd want to do something like this.
Yeah, but some people have that complex, don't they?
An idee fixe.
They obsess over one thing and they can't let it go.
No, no good.
There were other images of Margaret...
Margaret...?
You know who she is.
...Thatcher, present at the first break-in.
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?
Ooh!
- What?
- Blood.
Quite a bit of it, too.
Was there any injury at the crime scene?
Nah.
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.
- Come on.
- Holborn?
Lambeth!
- Lambeth?
Why?
- To see Toby.
Ah, right.
Who?
- You'll see.
- Right, are you coming?
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.
- Who told you?
- The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.
- Have a good time.
- I will.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
- What?
- She's not the one.
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.
How do you work all that out?
She's got three children in Rio that he doesn't know about.
Are you just making this up?
- Possibly.
- Who's Toby?
There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker, one of the world's best.
Got himself into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago.
He hacked into the Pentagon security system, and I managed to get him off the charge.
Therefore he owes me a favour.
So, how does that help us?
- What?
- Toby the hacker?
- Toby's not the hacker.
- What?
- All right, Craig?
- All right, Sherlock?
Craig's got a dog.
So I see.
Good boy!
Hiya!
Mary?
What are you...?
No, we, we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case.
No, exactly.
So... don't wait up.
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Hey.
Mary, what are you doing here?
She's better at this than you.
- Better?
- So I texted her.
Hang on, Mary's better than me?
Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.
Of course she's better.
Yeah, OK.
Nothing personal.
What, so I'm supposed to just go home now, am I?
What do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?
- John or the dog?
- Ha-ha, that's funny!
- John.
- Well...
He's handy and loyal.
- That's hilarious.
- Is it too early for a divorce?
Oh.
Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge?
Keep up, he's fast.
- He's not moving.
- He's thinking.
He's really not moving.
Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.
You just like this dog, don't you?
- Well, I like you.
- He's still not moving.
- Fascinating.
- Oh!
[SHE CLEARS HER THROAT]
Well, what do you make of it?
- They were looking for something.
- Yes, but it wasn't a burglar, they came specifically for that Thatcher bust.
Why?
[DOG SNIFFS]
[DOG WHINES]
Clever.
Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail,
- where would you go?
- Like hiding a tree in a forest.
Or blood in a butcher's.
Never mind, Toby, better luck next time, hmm?
This is it, though.
This is the one, I can feel it.
Not Moriarty?
It has to be him.
It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.
It's designed to beguile me, tease me and lure me in.
At last, a noose for me to put my neck into.
You should have seen the state of the front room.
- It was like The Exorcist.
- Huh.
Was Rosie's head spinning round?
- No.
Just the projectile vomiting.
- Nice!
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
- Hmm?
Noticed what?
- The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
[BABY CRIES]
Yeah, can't she?
I'm coming, darling.
Mummy's coming.
LOVINGLY:
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here.
Have you heard of that thing?
In Germany?
You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.
Ostalgie.
People who missed the old days under the communists.
- People are weird, aren't they?
- Hmm.
According to this, there's quite a market for Cold War memorabilia.
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit?
Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.
Yes, fascinating.
Irrelevant.
Where exactly did they come from?
I've got into the records of the suppliers, Gelder and Co.
Seems they're from Georgia.
Where exactly?
Tbilisi.
Batch of six.
One to Welsborough.
One to Hassan.
One to Dr Barnicot.
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.
One to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.
Lestrade?
Another one?
- 'Yeah.'
- Harker or Sandeford?
Harker.
And it's murder this time.
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.
_
_
Defensive wounds on her face and hands, throat cut.
Sharp blade.
The same thing inside the house?
The bust?
- Two of them this time.
- Interesting.
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago.
- Limited edition of six.
- And now someone's wandering about destroying them all.
Makes no sense.
What's the point?
No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.
- Yes, it is.
- Well, it is, but it's not the point.
I've been slow, far too slow.
Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind...
Slow but lucky, very lucky.
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.
Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.
Congratulations, by the way.
- I'm sorry?
- Well, you're about to solve a big one.
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
- Yeah, until then, basically.
[WATER SPLASHING]
That's enough now, love.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.
And you need to get to bed.
Come on.
Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?
You were on the run.
Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying, it's clever.
Very clever.
But now you've met me and you're not so clever, are you?
Who are you?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.
Argh!
You're out of time.
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
- Who?
I know it's him.
It must be him.
You think you understand.
You understand nothing.
Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don't we just enjoy the moment?
Let me present Interpol's number one case.
Too tough for them, too boring for me.
The Black Pearl of the Borgias!
It's not possible!
How could she...?
!
Everything about who I was is on there.
The problems of your past are your business.
The problems of your future are my privilege.
I don't understand.
She...
She destroyed it.
She?
You know her!
You do, don't you?
You know the bitch?
!
She betrayed me.
Betrayed us all.
Mary.
This is about Mary?
Is that what she's calling herself now, eh?
- 'Armed police, you're surrounded!
'
- Give it to me.
YELLS:
Give it to me!
'Come out slowly, I want to see your hands above your head.'
Nobody shoots me!
Anyone shoots, I kill this man.
'Lay down your weapon.
Do it now!
'
I'm leaving this place.
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.
'Lay down your weapon.'
You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
Tell her she's a dead woman.
She's a dead woman walking.
She's my friend.
And she's under my protection.
Who are you?
I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.
Who's Sherlock Holmes?
Not a policeman.
[ALARM BLARES]
What do you think?
Mate in two?
Don't antagonise them, darling.
Oh, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.
Everything palls.
They'll send someone soon.
They?
Who are they?
Seems to me we put an awful lot of faith in they.
Well, I've got something they would dearly love, if only we could get out of here.
I've got Ammo.
Ammo?
- MARY:
Madame Ambassador.
- What took you so long?
- Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now!
Veer left!
[SCREAMING]
[HE LAUGHS]
What now?
What do we do?
We die.
Well?
He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.
- I very much doubt it.
- Why?
Because I think he used to work with Mary.
[GUNFIRE]
[SHOUTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE]
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out!
We'll come back later.
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the English woman?
What would you do to a traitor?
Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.
[HE CHUCKLES]
I am an idiot, I know nothing.
Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
That was quite a text you sent me.
What's going on, Sherlock?
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,
I couldn't see what was right under my nose.
Expected a pearl.
Oh, my God, that's a...
Yes, it's an AGRA.
Memory stick, like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.
Who?
I don't know.
We...
We all had one but the others were...
Haven't you even looked at it yet?
I glanced at it but I prefer
- to hear it from you.
- Why?
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.
There were four of us, agents.
Not just agents.
Polite term.
Alex.
Gabriel.
Me.
And Ajay.
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.
We all had one.
Each containing aliases, our background, everything.
We could never be betrayed, because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.
- Who employed you?
- Anyone who paid well.
I mean, we were at the top of our game for years.
And then it all ended.
There was a coup in Georgia.
The British Embassy in Tbilisi was taken over, lots of hostages.
We got the call to go in, get them out.
There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.
- Who from?
- I don't know, just another voice on the phone.
And a codeword.
- Ammo.
- Ammo?
Like ammunition.
We went in, but then something went wrong.
Something went really wrong.
[GUNFIRE, SCREAMING]
That was six years ago.
It feels like forever.
I was the only one that made it out.
No.
What?
I met someone tonight.
Same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.
What, he's alive?
Yeah, very much so.
I don't believe it, this is amazing!
I thought I was the only one,
I thought I was the only one who got out.
Where is he?
I need to see him, now!
Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?
Yeah, of course.
It was our insurance.
Above all, they mustn't fall into enemy hands.
So Ajay survived as well.
And now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide, with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why?
I don't know.
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
[SHE LAUGHS]
Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.
Families fall out.
The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
Well, he's just trying to find me.
He survived, that's all that matters!
I heard it from his own mouth.
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."
Why would he want to kill me?
- He said you betrayed him.
- Oh, no, no, that's insane.
Well, it's what he believes.
[SHE GASPS]
I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.
No, Mary...
You do.
I made a vow, remember?
To look after the three of you.
Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
There's something I think you should read.
What is it?
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.
What are you...?
[HE SNIFFS]
- Mary...
Oh, no!
- There you go.
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.
No.
You just look after them till I get back.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
[CHILD SINGS]
[HE GROANS]
Agra?
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
It is 378km west of the state capital, Lucknow.
What are you, Wikipedia?
- Yes.
- AGRA is an acronym.
Oh, good, I love an acronym.
All the best secret societies have them.
Team of agents, the best.
But you know all that.
Of course I do.
Go on.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.
Indeed?
Well, that's news to me.
Is it?
He's already killed looking for that memory stick.
AGRA always worked for the highest bidder,
I thought that might include you?
- Me?
- Well, I mean the British government, or whatever government you're currently propping up.
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.
They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong.
And that was that, we stopped using freelancers.
- Your initiative?
- My initiative.
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.
I don't like loose ends.
Not on my watch.
There was something else.
A detail.
A codeword.
Ammo?
It's all I've got.
Little enough.
Could you do some digging as a favour?
You don't have many favours left.
Then I'm calling them all in.
And if you can find who's after her and neutralise them, what then?
You think you can go on saving her forever?
Of course.
Is that sentiment talking?
No, it's me.
Difficult to tell the difference these days.
Told you, I made a promise.
A vow.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.
Not on my watch.
MARY: 'My darling, I need to tell you this because you mustn't hate me for going away.'
NEW YORK ACCENT:
Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.
- Can you hear a squeaking?
- No.
Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel.
Why Planes Fail.
- Did you see it?
Oh, truly terrifying.
- Can't say I did.
Swore I would never fly again, yet hear I am!
Everything OK, madam?
No.
No, no, it's not, but then what's the use in complaining?
I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off is all.
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.
Oh, OK.
Relax.
She said relax. [CHUCKLES]
Did you have a nice time in London?
It was OK, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun?
- Did you lose it in the war?
- [SHE LAUGHS]
'I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.
I'm not running, I promise you that,
I just need to do this in my own way.'
Oh, God!
I'm...
I-I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God!
[FLIGHT ATTENDANT BUTTON BEEPS]
- Everything OK, madam?
- I think I'm dying.
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.
God will smile on you.
'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,
I'm sorry, my love.'
I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.
Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of a dice.
I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
I swear I will.'
[LAUGHTER]
Not like this one.
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in!
I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.
Mr Baker.
Well, that completes the set.
- No, it does not.
- Well, who else am I missing?
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?
Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.
Oh, hi, Mary.
What concept?
Happy families.
Nice trip?
- How the f...?
- Please, Mary, there is a child present.
- How did you get in here?
- Karim let me in.
Hello.
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Nice to meet you, missus.
No, I mean how did you find me?
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
No, really, though, how?
Every movement I made was entirely random, every new personality just on the roll of a dice!
Mary, no human action is ever truly random.
An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability, mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual, can reduce the number of variables considerably.
I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine a seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.
But they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.
[HE CHUCKLES]
JOKINGLY:
Oh, you bastard!
- ANGRILY:
You bastard!
- I know, but your face!
"The mathematics of probability"?
- You believed that.
- "Feasible variables"?
Yes, I started to run out about then.
In the memory stick!
Yeah, that was my idea.
- AGRA?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
You said it was your initials.
In a way that was true.
In a way?
So many lies.
I'm so sorry.
And I don't just mean you.
What?
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...
You're R?
Rosamund?
Rosamund Mary.
I always liked Mary.
Yeah, me too.
I used to.
I just...
I didn't know what else to do.
You could have stayed, you could have talked to me.
That's what couples are supposed to do.
Work things through.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Mary, I may not be a very good man but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for,
- most of the time.
- All the time.
You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.
You never judge, you never complain.
I don't deserve you, I...
All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
I will keep you safe.
But it has to be in London.
It's my city, I know the turf.
Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.
Get down!
[RAPID GUNFIRE]
Hello again.
- Ajay?
- Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.
Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.
I thought I was the only one who got out.
How did you find us?
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.
You found her but I found you.
So perhaps not so clever.
And now here we are.
At last.
[HE CHUCKLES] Touche!
Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
She thought I was dead.
I might as well have been.
It was always just the four of us, always, remember?
Oh, yeah.
So why do you want to kill me?
Do you know how long they kept me prisoner?
What they did to me?
They tortured Alex to death.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.
But you?
You, where were you?
That day at the embassy, I escaped.
Ha!
But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
Where were you?
Oh, I got out.
For a while.
Long enough to hide my memory stick.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.
I was loyal, you see.
Loyal to my friends.
But they took me, tortured me.
Not for information.
Not for anything except fun.
They thought I'd give in, die, but I didn't, I lived.
And eventually, they forgot about me rotting in a cell somewhere.
Six years they kept me there.
Until one day I saw my chance.
Oh, and I made them pay.
You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.
Little whispers.
Laughter.
Gossip.
How the clever agents had been betrayed.
Brought down by you!
- Me?
- [TRAIN WHISTLES]
You know I'll kill you too.
You know I will, Ajay.
What, you think I care if I die?
I've dreamed of killing you every night for six years.
Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.
I swear to you, Ajay.
What did you hear, Ajay?
When you were a prisoner, what exactly did you hear?
What did I hear?
Ammo.
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo."
We were betrayed!
- And they said it was her?
- That you betrayed us!
They said her name?
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.
No!
No!
'The English woman, that's all he heard.
Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.'
Couldn't this wait until you're back?
No, it's not over.
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed, the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.
There was only a voice on the phone.
'Remember?
And a codeword.'
"Ammo," yes, you said.
How's your Latin, brother dear?
My Latin?
Amo, amas, amat.
I love, you love, he loves.
What...?
Not "Ammo" as in ammunition, but "Amo", meaning?
You'd better be right, Sherlock.
Bloody thing!
What's going on?
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.
What?
'So many lies.
And I don't just mean you.'
- Hello.
- Ah, hello.
- I like your daisy.
- Thank you, yeah.
It's not really me, though, I think.
- No?
- No, no, it's too floral for me.
I'm more of a "knackered with weary old eyes" kind of guy.
Well, I think they're nice.
Nice eyes.
- [HE LAUGHS] Thank you.
- Look...
Look...
I don't normally do this,
- but, um...
- But you're going to.
Yeah.
- What's this?
- This is me.
- Thank you.
Cheers.
- Yeah.
Great.
- Bye!
- Bye.
[HE CHUCKLES]

[PHONE BEEPS]
_
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
Hmm?
Noticed what?
The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
[BABY CRIES]
- Yeah, can't she?
- Hmm.
I'm coming darling.
I'm coming.
[PHONE BEEPS]
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
- _
- Come here...
It's OK.
_
- _
- Do you want a cuddle?
[BABY CONTINUES TO WAIL]
_
I know.
- Oh, sweetheart.
- _
_
Ssh.
Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you?
_
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?
Oh, let's go and see Daddy!
Daddy's here.
It's OK, Rosie.
I'll take her.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I may as well get up now.
Hey, baby, it's Daddy.
Your daddy.
Come here, Rose.
Come here, darling, it's all right.
Thank you.
_
_
This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.
How many more times?
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.
And you're basing all this on a code name?
On a whispered voice on the telephone?
Come on, Mycroft.
You were the conduit for AGRA.
Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
It was my job.
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
AGRA went in.
- Yes.
- And they were betrayed.
Not by me.
Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.
I promise you,
I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.
You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.
Not one.
Not.
One.
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories?
I'd like to do those.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.
Although she does seem to enjoy them.
Well, I'll have to give that a go.
Got a lot to catch up on.
AJAY: 'You think you understand.
You understand nothing.'
MYCROFT: 'Code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love.'
MARY: 'You'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.
'They know everything.'
'They said it was the English woman.'
'Don't minute any of this.'
'They know everything.'
- You don't make it easy, do you?
- What do you mean?
Well, being... being so perfect.
Mary, I...
I need to tell you...
- [PHONE BEEPS]
- Hang on.
Can you tell me later?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Great.
Well, no, we can't just go.
- Rosie.
- Yeah.
- Er, you go.
- No!
I'll come as soon as I've found someone.
Mrs Hudson.
- Corfu till Saturday.
Molly?
- Er, yeah, I'll try.
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.
You know that's not going to happen.
If there's more to this case, you need to see it.
Yeah, OK, you win.
'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes.
'Please make your way to the exit.
Thank you.'
Your office said I'd find you here.
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.
We're like them.
Ghostly, living in the shadows.
Predatory?
Well, it depends which side you're on.
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.
Nice location for the final act, couldn't have chosen it better myself.
But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.
I just come here to look at the fish.
I knew this would happen one day.
- It's like that old story.
- I really am a very busy man.
Would you mind cutting to the chase?
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
With good reason.
"There was once a merchant, in a famous market in Baghdad."
I really have never liked this story.
I'm just like the merchant in the story,
I thought I could out-run the inevitable.
I've always been looking over my shoulder, always expecting to see the grim figure of...
Death.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hey.
- John?
- On his way.
Let me introduce Ammo.
You were Ammo?
You were the person on the phone that time?
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
Why did you betray us?
Why does anyone do anything?
- Hmm.
- Let me guess, selling secrets?
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.
Worked very well for a few years.
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it.
But...
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.
[SHE CHUCKLES] I couldn't believe my luck!
That bought me a little time.
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
Very handy.
They were always such reliable killers.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.
Lady Smallwood gave the order.
But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.
Seemed to do the trick.
And you thought your troubles were over.
I was tired.
Tired of the mess of it all.
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.
The hostages were killed.
AGRA too.
Or so I thought.
My secret was safe.
But... apparently not.
Just a little peace.
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
A family?
Home?
Really, I understand.
So, just let me get out of here, right?
Let me just walk away.
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.
What do you say?
After what you did?
!
Mary, no!
OK.
London Aquarium.
Yes, now.
I was never a field agent.
I always thought I'd be rather good.
[MARY SCOFFS]
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
Thanks.
- For a secretary.
- What?
It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
- I didn't do this out of jealousy.
- No?
Same old drudge, day in, day out.
Never getting out there where all the excitement was.
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.
Yes, your little flat.
- How do you know?
- Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?
And what are you, widowed or divorced?
Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.
That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.
- Sherlock...
- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.
A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.
- Sherlock, don't.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.
There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
That accounts for the drink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.
So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.
To prove how good you are.
To make up for the inadequacies of your...
little life.
Well, Mrs Norbury,
I must admit this is unexpected.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.
All except Sherlock Holmes.
There's no way out.
So it would seem.
You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.
It's what I do.
Maybe I can still surprise you.
Now, come on, be sensible.
Hmm, no, I don't think so.
Ah!
Surprise!
[MARY GASPS FOR AIR]
[MARY GROANS]
Everything's fine.
It's going to be OK.
Get an ambulance!
It's all right, it's all right.
- Mary!
- John.
All right, Mary?
Mary?
Stay with me, stay with me.
- Oh, come on...
- No, don't worry.
Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
Come on, Mary.
Mary?
Oh, God.
John, I think this is it.
No, no, no, no.
It's not.
- That's...
- You made me so happy.
You gave me everything I could ever, ever have wanted...
Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.
- Look after Rosie.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.
- Promise me.
- I promise.
- No...
- Yes, I promise.
- Promise me!
- I promise, I promise.
Ssh, ssh.
Hey, Sherlock.
Yes.
I... so like you.
Did I ever say?
Yes, yes, you did.
I'm sorry for... for shooting you that time.
I'm really sorry.
It's all right.
I think we're even now, OK?
OK.
- Oh, I think we're...
- Mary, Mary...
- ...even, definitely even.
- Ssh, ssh.
You were my whole world.
Being Mary Watson was the only life worth living.
- Mary...
- Thank you.
Mary...
[HE BEWAILS]
Don't you dare!
You made a vow.
You swore it.
[PHONE BEEPS REPEATEDLY]
'You've been having dreams.
A recurring dream?
'
[CLOCK TICKS RHYTHMICALLY]
Do you want to talk about it?
This is a two-way relationship, you know.
[SHE SIGHS]
The whole world has come crashing down around you.
Everything's hopeless.
Irretrievable.
I know that's what you must feel but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
That's not really my style.
I need to know what to do.
Do?
About John.
[BACK CRACKS, HE GROANS]
Put me through to Sherrinford, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
SOBS:
But nothing will ever be the same again, will it?
I'm afraid it won't.
We'll have to rally round, I expect, do our bit.
Look after little Rosie.
I'm just going to, um look through these things.
There might be a case.
A case?
Oh, you're not up to it, are you?
Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.
Yes.
Yes, I expect you're right.
I'll make some tea, shall I?
- Mrs Hudson?
- Yes, Sherlock?
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident...
- Yes?
- ...would you just say the word Norbury to me?
Would you?
Norbury?
Just that.
I'd be very grateful.
What's this?
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.
Oh, God!
Is that...?
- Must be.
- Oh.
I knew it wouldn't end like this.
I knew Moriarty made plans.
'I thought that would get your attention.
So, this is in case...
In case the day comes.
If you are watching this, I'm probably dead.
I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows?
Nothing's certain, nothing's written.
My old life it was full of consequences.
The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.
You need to remember that.
So I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
Might be the hardest case of your career.
When I'm... gone, if I'm gone I need you to do something for me.'
- [BABY GURGLES]
- Hi.
I just wondered how things were going and if there was anything I could do.
It's, er, it's from John.
- Right.
- You don't need to read it now.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.
He says...
John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...
Yes?
He said he'd that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Anyone.
[DOOR CLOSES]
'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
When I'm gone, if I'm... gone I need you to do something for me.
Save John Watson.
Save him, Sherlock.
Save him.'
'When does the path we walk on lock around our feet?
When does the road become a river with only one destination?
'
'Death waits for us all in Samarra.
But can Samarra be avoided?
'
Go to hell, Sherlock!
My brother is a murderer.
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.
Oh, do your research.
I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Merry Christmas!
(GUNSHOT)
MYCROFT:
I am not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.
You know what happened to the other one.
-Miss me?
-(DISTORTED VOICE) Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
I've only been gone four minutes.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Is that quite clear?
Don't minute any of this.
Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.
A D-notice has been slapped on the entire incident.
Only those within this room, codenames Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love, will ever know the whole truth.
As far as everyone else is concerned, going to the Prime Minister and way beyond,
Charles Augustus...
Are you tweeting?
-No.
-Well, that's what it looks like.
Of course I'm not tweeting.
Why would I be tweeting?
-Give me that.
-What?
No.
-What are you doing?
Get off.
What?
-Give it here.
-"Back on terra firma..."
-No, don't read them out.
-"Free as a bird."
-God, you're such a spoilsport.
Will you take this matter seriously, Sherlock?
I am taking it seriously.
What makes you think I'm not taking it seriously?
"Hashtag, oh what a beautiful morning."
Look, not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death, my death, and now I'm back in a nice, warm office, with my big brother and...
Are those ginger nuts?
-Oh God.
-Love ginger nuts.
Our doctor said you were clean.
I am, utterly.
No need for stimulants now, remember?
I have work to do.
You're as high as a kite.
Natural high.
I assure you.
Totally natural.
I'm just...
* Glad to be alive!
(CHUCKLING)
What shall we do next?
What's your name?
-Vivian.
-What would you do, Vivian?
-Pardon?
-It's a lovely day.
Go for a stroll, make a paper aeroplane, have an ice lolly?
-Ice lolly, I suppose.
-Ice lolly it is.
What's your favourite?
Oh, really, I shouldn't...
-Go on.
-Do they still do Mivvies?
-Mr Holmes.
-Yes?
We do need to get on.
Yes, of course.
(HELICOPTER WHIRRING)
SHERLOCK:
Do your research.
I'm not a hero,
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
(GUNSHOT)
-Sociopath.
-(GUNSHOT)
-Sociopath.
-(GUNSHOT)
-I see.
-Sociopath.
Who is supposed to have shot him then?
Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger, that's who.
That's not what happened at all.
It is now.
Remarkable.
How did you do it?
We have some very talented people working here.
If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured, we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.
That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.
SMALLWOOD:
No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.
You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.
You're home and dry.
Okay, cheers.
Obviously, there's unfinished business.
Moriarty.
I told you, Moriarty's dead.
You say he filmed that video message before he died?
-Yes.
-You also say you know what he's going to do next.
What does that mean?
Perhaps that's all there is to it.
Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
No, no, he would never be that disappointing.
He's planned something, something long term.
(INHALES) Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.
Posthumous revenge.
No, better than that.
Posthumous game.
We brought you back to deal with this.
-What are you going to do?
-SHERLOCK:
Wait.
Wait?
Of course, wait.
I'm the target.
Targets wait.
Look...
Whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up,
I'll know when it begins.
I always know when the game is on.
-You know why?
-Why?
(INHALES) Because I love it.
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
(WATER BUBBLING)
SHERLOCK: "There was once a merchant
"in the famous market at Baghdad.
"One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise.
"And he knew that the stranger was Death.
"Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace
"and made his way many, many miles
"to the city of Samarra.
"For there he was sure Death could not find him.
"But when, at last, he came to Samarra,
"the merchant saw, waiting for him,
"the grim figure of Death.
"'Very well,' said the merchant.
"'I give in.
I am yours.
"'But tell me, why did you look surprised
"'when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?
'
"'Because,' said Death,
"'I had an appointment with you tonight,
"'in Samarra.'"
If this gets any better, I'm gonna get two knives.
It pays to advertise.
So, what about Moriarty then?
Oh, I have a plan.
I'm going to monitor the underworld, every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
So basically, your plan is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do.
Awesome, isn't it?
He drowned, Mr Holmes.
That's what we thought.
-But when they opened up his lungs...
-Yes?
-Sand.
-Superficial.
Come back, it's the wrong thumb.
-Sherlock.
-It's never twins.
Hopkins, arrest Wilson.
Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.
HOPKINS:
Wilson?
DIMMOCK:
Lymph nodes?
Sherlock...
Yes, you may have nothing but a limbless torso, but there'll still be traces of ink left in the lymph nodes under the armpits.
If your mystery corpse had tattoos, the signs will be there.
Bloody hell.
Is that a guess?
I never guess.
-Sherlock...
-HOPKINS:
So, he's the killer.
The canary trainer?
-Of course he's the killer.
-Didn't see that coming.
Naturally.
Sherlock, you can't go on spinning plates like this.
That's it, the place was spinning.
The heart medication you are taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.
Yes, I think so.
-Why?
-Because the fingerprints on your brother's neck were your own.
JOHN: (LAUGHING) A jellyfish.
SHERLOCK:
I know.
You can't arrest a jellyfish.
-You could try.
-We did try.
-(MOBILE VIBRATING) -(SIGHS)
-Oh, God.
-Mary?
Fifty-nine missed calls.
We're in a lot of trouble.
(MARY SCREAMING)
Ow!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Relax.
It's got two syllables...
MARY:
I'm a nurse, darling.
I think I know what to do.
JOHN:
All right, then.
Come on.
-MARY:
Re...
-Lax.
Oh, just drive.
Please go.
Just drive.
God, drive.
-(SCREAMING)
-Sherlock?
Mary.
SHERLOCK:
That's it, Mary.
Re...
Don't you start.
-SHERLOCK:
Lax.
-(MARY GRUNTS)
MARY:
John?
John?
I think you have to pull over.
-Mary, Mary.
-Pull over!
-SHERLOCK:
Oh, my God.
-(MARY SCREAMING)
Has that come out?
-They never come out when I take them.
-Let's have a look.
Oh, she's so beautiful.
-(BABY GURGLING)
-Have another go.
-What about a name?
-Catherine.
-Oh, yeah, we've gone off that.
-Have we?
-Yeah.
-Oh.
-Well, you know what I think.
-BOTH:
It's not a girl's name.
Molly, Mrs H. We would love you to be godparents.
-Oh!
-If you...
-Really?
-That's so lovely.
(CLEARS THROAT) And, uh...
-You too, Sherlock.
-You too, what?
Godfather.
We'd like you to be godfather.
God is a ludicrous fiction dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.
Yeah, but there'll be cake.
Will you do it?
-I'll get back to you.
-All right.
Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water, and sanctify it for our use this day, in Christ's name.
Now, what name have you given your daughter?
-Rosamund Mary.
-Rosamund?
Means "rose of the world."
Rosie, for short.
Didn't you get John's text?
No, I delete his texts.
-I delete any text that begins, "Hi." -(BABY CRYING)
No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.
-(MRS HUDSON CLEARS THROAT)
-Sorry.
Phone.
-And now, godparents.
-(BABY CRYING)
Are you ready to help the parents of this child in their duties as Christian parents?
We are.
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Sorry, I didn't catch that.
Please repeat the question.
(SIGHS) As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.
To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas to me it is an open book.
Hard logic versus romantic whimsy.
That is your choice.
You fail to connect actions to their consequences.
Now, for the last time.
If you want to keep the rattle, do not throw the rattle.
(BABY GURGLING)
Good girl, good girl, good girl.
-I'd better finish this, hadn't I?
-(BABY WHIMPERS)
-Hi.
-JOHN:
Afternoon.
He says you've got a good one, Greg.
Oh, yeah.
-(CROWD SINGS HAPPY BIRTHDAY)
-LESTRADE:
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.
(APPLAUSE)
DAVID:
I'm 50?
Where does it go?
I know for a fact I was only 21 this time last week.
Yeah, well, that's impossible, that's before you...
-Met me.
-Oh, no, no.
BOTH:
There never was such a time.
She's looking at me disapprovingly again.
No.
-She's just jealous.
-No.
Well.
I think we both are.
-(MOBILE VIBRATING)
-Oh.
No, no, don't.
Come on, you promised.
-No.
-(VIBRATING CONTINUES)
Oh no, it's a Skype call.
Oh, then it must be Charlie.
At least he's phoning, I suppose.
-Oh, look, hello!
-Hey, Dad.
Happy birthday.
Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?
No.
Picture's frozen.
Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you.
Why is it rubbish, where are you?
How is he?
Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.
MAN:
David.
Emma.
No, no, hang on a sec.
I'll find somewhere quieter.
So, Charlie, where are you?
Are you there?
Sorry, I'm here.
-I'm just a bit...
-You all right?
It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.
Altitude?
I'm in Tibet.
Didn't you see the mountains?
Oh, never mind mountains.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.
Look, Dad, could you do me a favour?
-What?
-Could you just check something on my car?
-Your car?
-To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet.
Could you take a photo and send it?
-Ah, yes, I can do that.
-(CAMERA CLICKS)
All done.
You got it?
Charlie...
LESTRADE:
A week later...
JOHN:
Yeah?
LESTRADE:
Something really weird happens.
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed.
The cops are chasing him.
And he turns into the drive of the Welsborough house to try and get away.
-(SIREN WAILING)
-Unfortunately...
The drunk guy survived.
They managed to pull him out, but when they put the fire out and examined the parked car...
Whose body?
LESTRADE:
Charlie Welsborough, the son.
-What?
-The son who was in Tibet.
DNA all checks out.
Night of the party the car is empty.
Then a week later...
The dead boy is found at the wheel.
(CHUCKLING)
Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
JOHN:
You got a lab report?
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a cabinet minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get results.
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.
-The seats?
-Yes, the car seats.
Made of vinyl.
Two different types of vinyl present.
Was it his own car?
LESTRADE:
Yeah, not flash.
He was a student.
-Well, that's suggestive.
-LESTRADE:
Why?
Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
Yeah, right.
-JOHN:
There's something else.
-Yes?
According to this, Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.
What?
The body in the car, dead for a week.
Oh, this is a good one.
Is it my birthday?
You want help?
-Yes please.
-One condition.
-Okay.
-Take all the credit.
It gets boring if I just solve them all.
Yeah, you say that, and then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.
-Yeah, he's got a point.
-Which makes me look like some kind of prima donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do.
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.
Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
-Definitely a sore spot.
-So, you take all the glory, thank you.
-Okay.
-LESTRADE:
Thanks all the same.
Just solve the bloody thing will you.
It's driving me nuts.
Anything you say, Giles.
Just kidding.
(MOUTHING)
(CLEARS THROAT)
JOHN:
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?
Not a clue, it's just you normally say that at this point.
Hmm-mmm.
Well, then, let's help you solve your little problem, Greg.
-You hear that?
-I know.
So how's it going then, fatherhood?
Oh good, great.
Yeah, amazing.
-Getting any sleep?
-Christ, no.
You at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up all hours to obey his every whim?
Must feel very different.
-I'm sorry what?
-JOHN:
Yes, well, you know how it is.
All you do is clean up their mess.
-Pat them on the head...
-You two having a little joke?
JOHN:
Never a word of thanks.
-Can't even tell people's faces apart.
-This is a joke, isn't it?
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever?
You're so, so clever."
Is it about me?
-I think he needs winding.
-JOHN:
You know, I think that really might be it.
No, don't get it.
Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect.
-So go easy on them, yeah?
-You know me.
-MARY: (ON MOBILE) Hey, hello.
-Yeah.
Got 'em, don't worry.
Pampers, the cream you can't get from Boots.
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now?
-At the dead boy's house?
-Yeah.
MARY:
What does he think, any theories?
Uh, I texted you the details.
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.
SHERLOCK:
How do you know about that?
MARY:
Oh, you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.
They know everything.
-SHERLOCK:
Solved it, then?
-I'm working on it.
Oh Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.
-Pig.
-Keep trying.
So, what about it then?
What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it.
And what are you gonna call this one?
-Oh, "The Ghost Driver."
-Don't give it a title.
-People like the titles.
-I hate the titles.
Give the people what they want.
No, never do that.
People are stupid.
Uh, some people.
All people are stupid.
-Most people.
-Bizarre enough, though, isn't it, to be him?
I mean it's right up your strasse.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough.
I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.
-Son.
-Son.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.
If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.
Well, I believe that I... can.
DAVID:
Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
Sherlock?
-Mr Holmes?
-Sorry, you were saying?
Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
I don't think we'll get over this.
No.
Shouldn't think so.
(GASPS)
So, sorry, will you excuse me a moment?
I just...
I'll just, erm... (JOHN CLEARS THROAT)
-Now, what's wrong?
-Not sure.
I just...
"By the pricking of my thumbs."
-(CHUCKLES) Seriously, you?
-Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.
They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.
What is this?
Uh, it's a sort of shrine, I suppose, really.
Bit of a fan of Mrs T, big hero of mine when I was getting started.
Right.
Yes.
-Who?
-What?
-Who, who is this?
-Are you serious?
Sherlock.
It's Margaret Thatcher.
The first female Prime Minister of this country.
SHERLOCK:
Right.
-Prime Minister?
-Hmm.
-Leader of the government.
-SHERLOCK:
Right.
-Female?
-For God's sake, you know perfectly well who she is.
Why are you playing for time?
It's the gap, look at the gap.
It's wrong.
Everything else is perfectly ordered.
Managed.
(SIGHS) This whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.
This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been, and this picture's straightened every day.
Yet this ugly gap remains.
Something's missing from here, but only recently.
-DAVID:
Yes, a plaster bust.
-Plaster bust.
Oh, for God's sake, it got broken.
What the hell has this got to do with Charlie?
-Rug.
-What?
Well, how could it get broken?
The only place for it to fall is floor.
And there is a big, thick rug.
-Does it matter?
-Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.
It is worth letting him do this.
Is your friend quite mad?
No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.
Look, no, we had a break-in.
Some little bastard smashed it to bits.
We found the remains out there in the porch.
The porch where we came in?
DAVID:
How anybody could hate her so much, they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness.
I'm no expert, but possibly her face.
Why didn't he smash all the others?
Perfect opportunity.
And look at that one, she's smiling in that one.
EMMA:
Oh, Inspector this is clearly a waste of time.
-If there's nothing...
-I know what happened to your son.
You do?
It's quite simple.
Superficial, to be blunt.
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in.
-This room was in darkness?
-Well, yes.
And the porch where it was smashed, I noticed the motion sensor was damaged.
-So, I assume it's permanently lit?
-How did you notice that?
I lack the arrogance to ignore details.
I'm not the police.
JOHN:
So, you're saying, he smashed it
-where he could see it.
-SHERLOCK:
Exactly.
-Why?
-Don't know.
Wouldn't it be fun if I knew?
Mr Holmes, please.
It was your 50th birthday, Mr Welsborough.
Of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
After all, he was in Tibet.
-Yes.
-No.
No?
SHERLOCK:
The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video.
Easily arranged.
It's a Skype call.
The trick was meant to be a surprise.
-Trick?
-Obviously.
Could you take a photo and send it?
SHERLOCK:
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt out remains of the car.
One, the actual passenger seat, the other a good copy.
Well, good enough.
Effectively a costume.
(SCOFFS) You're joking.
I'm not.
All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
(DAVID SIGHS)
Oh, my God!
Surprise!
(VOICE DISTORTING)
That's when it happened.
I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.
You said he'd felt unwell.
-You all right?
-CHARLIE:
It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.
SHERLOCK:
He died there and then.
No one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained in the driver's seat, hidden until... (SIREN WAILING)
SHERLOCK:
When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who'd been sitting there, quite dead, for a week.
Oh, God.
Poor kid.
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.
This is where it was smashed.
-That was amazing.
-What?
The car, the kid.
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?
Can't stand it.
Never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.
Doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
What kind of a life would that be?
Besides...
-I have the strangest feeling.
-Miss me?
That's mine.
You two take a bus.
JOHN: (CHUCKLING) Why?
I need to concentrate and I don't want to hit you.
-(ENGINE STARTS)
-The Mall, please.
-I met her once.
-Thatcher?
Rather arrogant, I thought.
-You thought that?
-(CHUCKLES) I know.
Why am I looking at this?
That's her, John and Mary's baby.
Oh, I see, yes.
Looks very...
Fully-functioning.
Is that really the best you can do?
Sorry, I've never been very good with them.
Babies?
Humans.
Moriarty.
Did he have any connection with Thatcher?
Any interest in her?
(SCOFFS) Why on earth would he?
I don't know, you tell me.
(SNIFFS)
In the last year of his life,
James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over 70 assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias.
Which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.
It's a pearl, get another one.
Something important about this.
I'm sure, maybe it's Moriarty.
Maybe it's not.
But something's coming.
Are you having a premonition, brother mine?
The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other.
What we call premonition is just movement of the web.
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable.
As inevitable as mathematics.
Appointment In Samarra.
I'm sorry?
MYCROFT:
The merchant who can't outrun Death.
You always hated that story as a child.
Less keen on predestination back then.
I'm not sure I like it now.
You wrote your own version, as I remember.
Appointment In Sumatra.
The merchant goes to a different city, and is perfectly fine.
Good night, Mycroft.
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.
SHERLOCK:
Keep me informed.
-Of what?
-Absolutely no idea.
(GLASS SHATTERS)
MAN'S VOICE:
Ammo!
- Ammo!
-(SIREN WAILING)
(BREATH TREMBLING)
(LESTRADE PANTING)
Oh, hi, Stella.
-Greg.
-You, erm...?
Yeah, he's just got a client, so...
Right, right, right.
Er, so you see a lot of each other, do you?
It's nothing.
I mean, it's nothing serious.
-No, no.
-I just pop around every now and again for a chat.
LESTRADE:
Yeah, of course.
I mean, he loves a really tricky case.
(LAUGHING) Yeah, he does.
So, what are you here for?
Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so...
Borgia Pearl, are they still after that, are they?
Yeah.
So, how did you two first meet?
Oh, it was a case about...
Ten years ago, nobody could figure it out.
-There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.
-Oh, yeah?
-How did she die?
-Hypothermia.
-What?
-I know.
But then I met Sherlock.
It was so simple the way...
Would you please keep it down?
-Sorry.
-Sorry.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?
You started out in manual labour.
Oh, don't bother being astonished.
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left.
Hard manual work does that.
Oh, I was a carpenter, like my dad.
Are you trying to give up smoking unsuccessfully?
And you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you, but now you feel indifferent about.
How the hell...
Yes.
E-cigarettes.
Not just that, ten individual e-cigarettes.
If you just want to smoke indoors, you would have invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.
But you're convinced you can give up, so... (INHALES)
You don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last.
Anything to add, John?
-John.
-Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.
-What is that?
-That is me.
Well, it's a me substitute.
Don't be so hard on yourself, you know I value your little contributions.
JOHN:
Yeah?
It's been there since 9:00 this morning.
Has it?
Where were you?
Helping Mrs H with her Sudoku.
-What about my girlfriend?
-What?
You said I had an ex.
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would have had the word obliterated.
But the first attempt wasn't successful and you haven't tried again.
So it seems you can live with this slightly blurred memory of Akako.
Hence, the indifference.
I thought you'd done something clever.
Oh, no.
No, but now you've explained it.
It's dead simple, innit?
(SIGHS)
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
What do you mean?
Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
-Well...
-You thought she was having an affair.
I'm afraid it's far worse than that.
Your wife is a spy.
-What?
-That's right.
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.
Swedish by birth, and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.
She's been operating deep under cover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only - to get near the American Embassy, which is across the road from your flat.
Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy as part of an official state visit.
As the President greets members of staff,
Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.
This drug will then render the President entirely susceptible to the will of that new master.
-None other than James Moriarty.
-What?
Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War Three.
(CHUCKLING) Are you serious?
No, of course not.
His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.
I don't.
-Just the bras.
-Get out.
So.
What's this all about, then?
-Having fun.
-Fun?
-While I can.
-Mmm-hmm.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
-Sherlock.
-Borgia Pearl.
Boring, Go.
-But...
-Go.
Oh, this had better be good.
Oh, I think you'll like it.
That is the bust, isn't it, the one that was broken?
No, it's another one.
Different owner.
Different part of town.
You were right.
This is a thing.
Something is going on.
-What's wrong?
I thought you'd be pleased.
-SHERLOCK:
I am pleased.
You don't look pleased.
This is my game face.
The game is on.
LESTRADE:
Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one.
One belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan...
Identical busts.
Yeah, and this one to a Dr Barnicot in Holborn.
Three in total.
God knows who'd want to do something like this.
Yeah, but some people have that complex, don't they?
An idee fixe.
They obsess over one thing and they can't let it go.
SHERLOCK:
No, no, good.
There were other images of Margaret.
-Margaret?
-You know who she is.
Thatcher, present at the first break-in.
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?
-Ooh.
-JOHN:
What?
Blood.
Quite a bit of it, too.
Was there any injury at the crime scene?
Nah.
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.
-Come on.
-Holborn?
-Lambeth.
-Lambeth?
Why?
-To see Toby.
-Ah, right.
-Who?
-You'll see.
-Right, you coming?
-No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.
Who told you?
The right sleeve of your jacket plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne, and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.
Have a good time.
I will.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
-What?
-She's not the one.
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.
How do you work all that out?
She's got three children in Rio that he doesn't know about.
-Are you just making this up?
-Possibly.
-Who's Toby?
-There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker.
One of the world's best.
Got himself into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago.
He hacked into the Pentagon security system and I managed to get him off the charge.
Therefore, he owes me a favour.
JOHN:
So, how does that help us?
SHERLOCK:
What?
-Toby the hacker.
-Toby is not the hacker.
What?
-All right, Craig.
-All right, Sherlock.
Craig's got a dog.
JOHN:
So I see.
SHERLOCK: (CHUCKLES) Good boy.
Hiya!
Mary?
What are you...
We, we agreed.
We would never bring Rosie out on a case.
Exactly, so...
-Don't wait up.
-(ROSIE CRIES)
-Hey Sherlock.
-SHERLOCK:
Hey.
But Mary, what are you doing here?
-She's better at this than you.
-Better?
So I texted her.
JOHN:
Hang on.
Mary's better than me?
Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.
Of course she's better.
-Okay.
-SHERLOCK:
Nothing personal.
Well, so I'm supposed to just go home now, am I?
Oh, what do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?
-SHERLOCK:
John or the dog?
-Ha-ha, that's funny.
-John.
He's handy and loyal.
-That's hilarious.
-Hmm.
-Is it too early for a divorce?
-Aw!
-SHERLOCK:
Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge?
-(DOG BARKS)
-Keep up.
He's fast.
-He's not moving.
-He's thinking.
-He's really not moving.
-Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.
You just like this dog, don't you?
-Well, I like you.
-He's still not moving.
-Fascinating.
-Oh!
(MARY CLEARS THROAT)
SHERLOCK:
Well, what do you make of it?
MARY:
That we're looking for something.
Yes, but it wasn't a burglar.
They came specifically for that Thatcher bust.
Why?
Clever.
Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail,
-where would you go?
-Like hiding a tree in a forest.
Or blood in a butcher's.
Never mind, Toby.
Better luck next time, hmm?
This is it, though.
This is the one.
I can feel it.
Not Moriarty?
Has to be him.
It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.
It's designed to beguile me, tease me and lure me in.
Blast.
A noose for me to put my neck into.
MARY:
You should have seen the state of the front lawn.
It was like The Exorcist.
(SCOFFS) Was Rosie's head spinning round?
Mmm, no.
Just the projectile vomiting.
-Nice.
-Mmm.
Now, you think we'd have noticed when she was born.
Noticed what?
The little 666 on her forehead.
Mmm.
That's The Omen.
-So?
-You said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the Devil and the Antichrist.
(SCOFFS)
(ROSIE CRYING)
-Yeah, can't she?
-(GRUNTS)
Oh, coming, darling.
-Mummy's coming.
-(MOBILE VIBRATING)
MARY:
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
CRAIG:
You heard of that thing in Germany?
You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.
Uh, Ostalgie.
People who miss the old days under the Communists.
-People are weird, aren't they?
-Mmm.
According to this, there's quite a market for Cold War memorabilia.
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit?
Thatcher's like, I don't know, Napoleon now.
Yes, fascinating and relevant.
Where exactly did they come from?
Well, I've got into records of the suppliers, Gelder and Co.
-Seems they're from Georgia.
-SHERLOCK:
Where exactly?
Tbilisi.
Batch of six.
One to Welsborough, one to Hassan, one to Dr Barnicot.
Two to Miss Orrie Harker one to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.
-Lestrade, another one?
- Yeah.
Harker or Sandeford?
Harker.
And it's murder this time.
Mmm.
That perks things up a bit.
Defensive wounds on her face and hands, throat cut, sharp blade.
The same thing inside the house, the bust.
Two of them this time.
Interesting.
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago.
Limited edition of six.
And now someone's wandering about destroying them all.
Makes no sense.
What's the point?
Well, they're not destroying them.
That's not what's happening.
-Yes, it is.
-Well, it is what's happening, but it's not the point.
I've been slow.
Far too slow.
Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind.
Slow but lucky, very lucky.
Since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.
Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.
Congratulations, by the way.
-Sorry?
-Well, you're about to solve a big one.
Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
Yeah.
Till then, basically.
(WATER SPLASHING)
That's enough now, love.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.
And you need to get to bed.
Come on.
It would be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station.
SHERLOCK:
You were on the run.
Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying.
It's clever.
Very clever.
But now you've met me.
And you're not so clever, are you?
Who are you?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.
(SCREAMS)
(SCREAMS)
(GRUNTS)
(GRUNTS)
(CHOKING)
(GASPING)
SHERLOCK:
You're out of time.
Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
Who?
I know it's him.
It must be him.
You think you understand?
You understand nothing.
SHERLOCK:
Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don't we just enjoy the moment?
Let me present Interpol's number one case.
Too tough for them, too boring for me.
The Black Pearl of the Borgias.
It's not possible.
How could she...
MARY:
Everything about who I was is on there.
The problems of your past are your business.
The problems of your future are my privilege.
I don't understand.
-She, she destroyed it.
-She?
(GUN COCKING)
You know her.
You do, don't you?
You know the bitch.
She betrayed me.
(SIREN WAILING)
-Betrayed us all.
-Mary.
This is about Mary.
Is that what she's calling herself now?
POLICEMAN: (OVER LOUDSPEAKER) Armed police.
You're surrounded.
Give it to me.
Give it to me!
POLICEMAN:
I'm going in.
I want to see your hands above your head.
Nobody shoots at me.
If anyone shoots, I kill this man.
Lay down your weapons.
Do it now!
I'm leaving this place.
If no one follows me, no one dies.
Lay down your weapons.
You're a policemen.
I'm a professional.
Tell her she's a dead woman.
She's a dead woman walking.
She's my friend, and she's under my protection.
Who are you?
I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.
Who's Sherlock Holmes?
Not a policeman.
(ALARM RINGING)
AMBASSADOR:
What do you think?
Mate in two?
(SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)
MAN:
Don't antagonise them, darling.
Well, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.
Everything palls.
They'll send someone soon.
"They"?
Who are "they"?
Seems to me we put an awful lot of faith in "they."
Well, I've got something "they" would dearly love if only we could get out of here.
-I've got Ammo.
-Ammo?
(SHOUTING)
Madam Ambassador.
What took you so long?
-Can't get the staff.
-MALE SOLDIER:
Everyone out, now!
MALE SOLDIER:
Two left.
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
(LAUGHING)
What now.
What do we do?
We die.
Well?
He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.
-I very much doubt it.
-Why?
Because I think he used to work with Mary.
(GUNFIRE)
(MEN SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)
(GRUNTS)
(GUNFIRE)
(GRUNTS)
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
(MOANING)
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out.
We'll come back later.
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the English woman.
What would you do to a traitor?
Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.
(LAUGHS)
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
SHERLOCK:
I am an idiot.
I know nothing.
MARY:
Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
That was quite a text you sent me.
What's going on, Sherlock?
SHERLOCK:
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,
I couldn't see what was right under my nose.
Expected a pearl.
-Oh, my God.
That's a...
-Yes, it's an AGRA memory stick.
Like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.
-Who?
-I don't know.
We, we all had one, but the others were...
Well, haven't you even looked at it yet?
-I glanced at it, but I prefer to hear it from you.
-Why?
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.
(SCOFFS)
There were four of us.
-Agents.
-Not just agents.
Polite term.
Alex, Gabriel, me and Ajay.
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.
We all had one.
Each containing aliases, our background, everything.
We could never be betrayed because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.
-Who employed you?
-Anyone who paid well.
Oh, we were at the top of our game for years, and then it all ended.
There was a coup in Georgia.
The British Embassy in Tbilisi was taken over, lots of hostages, we got the call to go in, get them out, there was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.
-Who from?
-I don't know.
Just another voice on the phone.
And a codeword.
-Ammo.
-Ammo?
Like ammunition.
We went in, but then something went wrong.
Something went really wrong.
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
That was six years ago.
Feels like forever.
I was the only one that made it out.
No.
-What?
-I met someone tonight.
The same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.
Oh, my God.
That's Ajay.
That's him.
-What, he's alive?
-Yeah, very much so.
I don't believe it.
This is amazing.
I thought I was the only one,
I thought I was the only one who got out.
Where is he?
I need to see him now!
Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?
Yeah, of course.
It was our insurance.
Above all, they mustn't fall into enemy hands.
So Ajay survived as well, and now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide, with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why?
I don't know.
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
(LAUGHS)
Sorry, no, no, 'cause we, we were family.
Families fall out.
The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
Well, he's just trying to find me.
He survived.
That's all that matters.
SHERLOCK:
I heard it from his own mouth.
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."
Why would he want to kill me?
-He said you betrayed him.
-Oh, no.
No, that's insane.
Well, it's what he believes.
(EXHALES)
I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.
No, Mary.
You do.
I made a vow, remember?
To look after the three of you.
Sherlock, the dragon slayer.
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
There's something I think you should read.
What is it?
MARY:
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.
What are you...
-Mary...
Oh, no.
-There you go.
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.
(GROANS)
You just look after him till I get back.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
(LITTLE GIRL SINGING)
(DOG BARKING)
(GROANS)
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
Agra?
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
It is 378 kilometres west of the state capital, Lucknow...
What are you, Wikipedia?
-Yes.
-AGRA's an acronym.
Oh, good.
I love an acronym.
All the best secret societies have them.
Team of agents, the best.
-But you know all of that.
-Of course, I do.
Go on.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.
Indeed.
Well, that's news to me.
Is it?
He's already killed looking for that memory stick,
AGRA always worked for the highest bidder,
I thought that might include you.
-Me?
-Oh, I mean the British Government or whatever government you're currently propping up.
MYCROFT:
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.
They were sent in to free the hostages, but it all went horribly wrong.
And that was that.
We stopped using freelancers.
-Your initiative?
-My initiative.
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.
I don't like loose ends.
Not on my watch.
There was something else.
A detail.
A codeword.
-Ammo?
-It's all I've got.
Little enough.
SHERLOCK:
Could you do some digging as a favour?
You don't have many favours left.
Then I'm calling them all in.
And if you can find who's after her and neutralise them, what then?
You think you can go on saving her forever?
Of course.
Is that sentiment talking?
No.
It's me.
-Difficult to tell the difference these days.
-Told you,
I made a promise.
A vow.
All right, I'll see what I can do.
But remember this, brother mine.
Agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.
Not on my watch.
MARY:
My darling,
I need to tell you this because you mustn't hate me for going away.
(IN NEW YORK ACCENT) Pardon me.
I can hear a squeaking.
Can you hear a squeaking?
No.
Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel,
Why Planes Fail, did you see it?
-Can't say I did.
-Oh, truly terrifying.
Swore I would never fly again, yet here I am.
-Everything okay, madam?
-No.
No, it's not.
But then what's the use in complaining?
I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off, is all.
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.
Oh, okay, relax.
She said relax. (LAUGHS)
Did you have a nice time in London?
It was okay, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun?
Did you lose it in the war?
(LAUGHS MANICALLY)
MARY:
I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.
I'm not running, I promise you that.
I just need to do this in my own way.
Oh, God.
I, I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God.
-Everything okay, madam?
-I think I'm dying.
I don't feel so good.
-(BREATHES HEAVILY)
-You're all right.
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.
God will smile on you.
MARY:
But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm.
I'm sorry, my love.
I know you'll try to find me, but there is no point.
Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of a dice.
I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
I swear, I will.
(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
MAN:
You haven't got a chance.
Not a chance.
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in.
I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.
SHERLOCK:
Mr Baker.
Well, that completes the set.
MAN:
No, it is not.
SHERLOCK:
Well, who else am I missing?
Master Bun.
It's not a set without him.
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?
Hmm.
Maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.
Oh, hi, Mary.
What concept?
Happy families.
Nice trip?
-How the f...
-Please, Mary, there is a child present.
-How did you get in here?
-SHERLOCK:
Karim let me in.
Hello.
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?
-Sure.
-Thank you.
Nice to meet you, Mrs.
No, I, I mean, how did you find me?
-I'm Sherlock Holmes.
-MARY:
Really though, how?
Every movement I made was entirely random.
Every new personality, just on the roll of a dice.
Mary, no human action is ever truly random.
An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability mapped on to a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual can reduce the number of variables considerably.
I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine the seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.
But they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.
(SHERLOCK LAUGHS)
Oh, you bastard.
-You bastard.
-I know, but your face.
"The mathematics of probability."
You believed that.
"Feasible variables."
Yes, I started to run out about then.
In the memory stick.
Yeah, that was my idea.
(CALL TO PRAYER)
-JOHN:
AGRA.
-Yes.
Mmm-hmm.
You said it was your initials.
-In a way, that was true.
-In a way?
So many lies.
I'm so sorry.
-I don't just mean you.
-What?
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...
You're R.
Rosamund?
Rosamund Mary.
I always liked Mary.
Yeah, me too.
I used to. (SIGHS)
I didn't know what else to do.
You could have stayed.
You could have talked to me.
That's what couples are supposed to do.
Work things through.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Mary, I may not be a very good man.
But I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for.
-Most of the time.
-All the time.
You're always a good man, John.
I've never doubted that.
You never judge.
You never complain.
I don't deserve you, I...
All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
I will keep you safe.
But it has to be in London.
It's my city, I know the turf.
Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.
-Get down!
-(GUNSHOTS)
-Hello again.
-Ajay.
Oh, you remember me.
I'm touched.
Look, I thought you were dead.
Believe me, I did.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.
I thought I was the only one who got out.
(GUNSHOT)
SHERLOCK:
How did you find us?
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.
You found her, but I found you, sir.
Perhaps not so clever.
And now here we are.
At last.
-(GUNSHOT) -(BULB SHATTERS)
(CHUCKLES) Touche.
Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
She thought I was dead.
I might as well have been.
It was always just the four of us.
Always, remember?
-Oh, yeah.
-So why do you wanna kill me?
AJAY:
Do you know how long they kept me prisoner?
What they did to me?
-They tortured Alex to death.
-(GASPS)
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.
But you, you, where were you?
That day, at the embassy, I escaped.
Ha!
But I lost sight of you, too, so you explain, where were you?
Oh, I got out.
For a while.
Long enough to hide my memory stick.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.
I was loyal, you see.
Loyal to my friends.
They took me, tortured me.
Not for information.
-(GRUNTING) -(SCREAMING)
Not for anything except fun.
They thought I'd give in.
Die.
But I didn't, I lived.
And eventually, they forgot about me rotting in a cell somewhere.
Six years they kept me there.
Till one day, I saw my chance.
Oh, and I made them pay.
You know, all the time I was there,
I just kept picking up things.
Little whispers, laughter, gossip.
How the clever agents had been betrayed.
Brought down by you!
-Me?
-(HORN HONKING)
(GUN COCKING)
(GRUNTS)
You know I'll kill you, too.
You know I will, Ajay.
(PANTING) What, you think I care if I die?
I've dreamed of killing you.
Every night for six years.
Squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.
I swear to you, Ajay.
SHERLOCK:
What did you hear, Ajay?
When you were a prisoner, what exactly did you hear?
AJAY:
What did I hear?
Ammo.
Every day, as they tore into me,
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
We were betrayed!
SHERLOCK:
And they said it was her.
-And you betrayed us.
-They said her name?
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.
-(GUNSHOTS)
-No!
No!
SHERLOCK:
The English woman.
That's all he heard.
Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.
Couldn't this wait until you're back?
No, it's not over.
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed.
The hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.
There was only a voice on the phone.
Remember, and a codeword.
Ammo, yes, you said.
How's your Latin, brother dear?
My Latin?
Amo, amas, amat.
I love, you love, he loves, what...
Not Ammo as in ammunition, but Amo meaning...
You'd better be right, Sherlock.
(BEEPS)
(BEEPING)
(BEEPING)
-(BEEPING)
-Bloody thing.
What's going on?
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.
What?
So many lies.
I don't just mean you.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
-Hello.
-Ah, hello. (LAUGHS)
-I like your daisy.
-Thank you, yeah.
It's not really me, though, I think.
-No?
-No, no.
It's too floral for me.
I'm more of a knackered with weary old eyes kind of a guy.
Well, I think they're nice.
-Nice eyes.
What, what...
-Thank you. (LAUGHS)
I don't normally do this, but, um...
-But you're gonna.
-Yeah.
-(CHUCKLES)
-What's this?
This is me.
Uh, thank you.
-Cheers.
-Yeah, right.
-Bye.
-Bye.
(BEEPS)
(CHUCKLES)
(CLEARS THROAT)
(MOBILE VIBRATING)
Now, you think we'd have noticed when she was born.
Noticed what?
The little 666 on her forehead.
Mmm.
That's The Omen.
-So?
-You said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the Devil and the Antichrist.
(SCOFFS)
(ROSIE CRYING)
-Yeah, can't she?
-(GRUNTS)
Oh, coming, darling.
-I'm coming.
-(MOBILE VIBRATING)
(SIGHS)
MARY:
Why are you crying?
Shh, shh.
-(PHONE VIBRATES) -(CRYING CONTINUES)
MARY:
I know.
(MOBILE VIBRATING)
(SIGHS)
MARY:
Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you?
(MOBILE VIBRATING)
MARY:
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?
(GASPS)
Let's go see Daddy.
Daddy's here.
It's okay, Rosie's coming.
-I'll take her.
-Yeah?
Yeah, I might as well get up anyway.
Hey, baby, it's Daddy.
(KISSING) Daddy.
-Come here Rosie.
-Yeah.
Come here darling, it's all right.
-MARY:
Yeah, thank you.
-(CRYING CONTINUES)
This is absolutely ridiculous, and you know it.
How many more times?
Six years ago, you held the brief for foreign operations.
Codename, Love.
And you're basing all this on a codename?
On a whispered voice on the telephone?
Come on, Mycroft.
You were the conduit for AGRA.
Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
It was my job.
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
-AGRA went in.
-Yes.
-And they were betrayed.
-Not by me.
Mycroft, we've known each other a long time.
I promise you, I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.
You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.
Not one.
Not one.
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories?
-I'd like to do those.
-Yeah?
Yeah, I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.
-(CHUCKLES)
-Although she does seem to enjoy them.
Well, I'll have to give that a go.
(CHUCKLES)
Got a lot to catch up on.
AJAY:
You think you understand.
You understand nothing.
MYCROFT:
Codenames Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love.
MARY:
You'd be amazed what a receptionist picks up.
They know everything.
AJAY:
They said it was the English woman!
Don't minute any of this.
MARY:
They know everything.
You don't make it easy, do you?
What do you mean?
I mean... (CLEARS THROAT) Being so perfect.
Mary.
I need to tell you...
-(MOBILE VIBRATING)
-Hang on.
Can you tell me later?
-Yeah, yeah.
-Great.
Oh, no, we can't just go.
-Rosie.
Uh, you go.
-No!
I'll come as soon as I've found someone.
-Mrs Hudson.
-Corfu till Saturday.
-Molly.
-Uh, yeah, I'll try.
Well we should both stay and wait for her.
No, you know that's not gonna happen.
If there's more to this case, you're the one who needs to see it.
Yeah, okay, you win.
MAN: (OVER PA) Ladies and gentlemen.
The aquarium will be closing in five minutes.
Please make your way to the exit.
Thank you.
SHERLOCK:
Your office said I'd find you here.
VIVIAN:
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.
We're like them.
Ghostly, living in the shadows.
Predatory.
Well, it depends which side you're on.
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.
Nice location for the final act.
Couldn't have chosen it better myself.
But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.
VIVIAN:
I just come here to look at the fish.
I knew this would happen one day.
It's like that old story.
I really am a very busy man.
Would you mind cutting to the chase?
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
With good reason.
There was once a merchant in a famous market in Baghdad.
I really have never liked this story.
I'm just like the merchant in the story.
I thought I could outrun the inevitable.
I've always been looking over my shoulder.
Always expecting to see the grim figure of...
-MARY:
Death.
-Hello, Mary.
-John?
-Hey.
On his way.
SHERLOCK:
Let me introduce Ammo.
You were Ammo?
You were the person on the phone that time?
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
Why did you betray us?
-Why does anyone do anything?
-SHERLOCK:
Let me guess.
Selling secrets?
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.
Worked very well for a few years.
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it.
But...
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.
Then she was taken hostage in that coup. (LAUGHS)
I couldn't believe my luck.
That bought me a little time.
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
VIVIAN:
Very handy.
They were always such reliable killers.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.
Lady Smallwood gave the order, but I sent another one to the terrorists.
With a nice little clue about her codename, should anyone have an inquiring mind.
Seemed to do the trick.
And you thought your troubles were over.
I was tired.
Tired of the mess of it all.
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.
The hostages were killed.
AGRA too.
Or so I thought.
My secret was safe.
But, apparently not.
Just a little peace.
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
A family?
Home?
Really, I understand.
So, just let me get out of here, right?
Let me just walk away.
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.
-What do you say?
-After what you did?
Mary, no!
MARY:
Okay.
London Aquarium.
Yes, now.
VIVIAN:
I was never a field agent.
I always thought I'd be rather good.
(SCOFFS)
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
-Thanks.
-For a secretary.
What?
Can't have been easy all those years sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut, when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
I didn't do this out of jealousy.
No?
Same old drudge, day in, day out.
Never getting out there, where all the excitement was.
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.
-(STAMMERS)
-They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.
-Yes, your little flat.
-How do you know?
Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?
And what are you?
Widowed or divorced?
Wedding ring's at least 30 years old, and you've moved it to another finger.
That means you're sentimentally attached to it.
But you're not still married.
I favour widowed, given the number of cats
-you share your life with.
-Sherlock?
Two Burmese and a tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.
A divorcee's more likely to look for a new partner.
A widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.
-Sherlock, don't.
-Pets do that, or so I'm told.
And there's clearly no one new in your life otherwise you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
That probably accounts for the drink problem too.
The slight tremor in your hand.
The red wine stain ghosting your top lip.
So, yes.
I'd say jealousy was your motive, after all.
To prove how good you are.
To make up for the inadequacies of your little life.
Well, Mrs Norbury,
I must admit, this is unexpected.
Vivian Norbury.
You outsmarted them all.
All except Sherlock Holmes.
There's no way out.
So it would seem.
You see right through me, Mr Holmes.
It's what I do.
Maybe I can still surprise you.
Now come on.
Be sensible.
No, I don't think so.
(GUNSHOT)
-(MARY SCREAMS)
-Surprise.
(GASPS)
-(GRUNTING)
-Mary.
Everything's fine.
It's gonna be okay.
-Get an ambulance.
-(MARY GASPING)
-SHERLOCK:
It's all right.
It's all right.
-Mary!
John.
Oh...
Mary?
Mary?
Stay with me.
Stay with me.
-Don't worry.
-MARY:
Come on, Doctor.
-You can do better than that.
-JOHN:
Come on, Mary.
Mary?
-John, I think this is it.
-No, no, no, no.
It's not.
It's...
You've made me so happy.
You gave me everything I could ever, ever...
-Shh, shh.
-Wanted.
-Mary, Mary?
Shh, shh.
-(CRYING)
-Look after Rosie.
-Shh.
-Promise me.
-I promise.
-(SOBBING)
-Yes, I promise.
-Promise.
-I promise.
I promise.
Shh.
Hey, Sherlock.
Yes.
I so like you.
Did I ever say?
Yes, yes, you did.
I'm sorry for shooting you that time.
I'm really sorry.
It's all right.
-I think we're even now, okay?
-Okay.
-(WINCES) I think we're even.
Definitely even.
-Mary...
Ah!
(SOBBING)
You were my whole world.
(SOBBING)
Being Mary Watson was the only life worth living.
Thank you.
(JOHN PANTING)
Mary?
(JOHN SOBBING QUIETLY)
(GRUNTING)
(GROANING)

JOHN:
Don't you dare.

You made a vow.
You swore it.
(MOBILE VIBRATING)
(MOBILE CONTINUES VIBRATING)
ELLA:
You've been having dreams.
A recurring dream?
Do you wanna talk about it?
This is a two-way relationship, you know.
(SIGHS)
The whole world has come crashing down around you.
Everything is hopeless.
Irretrievable.
I know that's what you must feel.
But I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
SHERLOCK:
That's not really my style.
I need to know what to do.
-ELLA:
Do?
-About John.
(GRUNTS)
(SIGHS)
Put me through to Sherrinford, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
MRS HUDSON:
Nothing will ever be the same again, will it?
-I'm afraid it won't.
-(SOBBING)
We'll have to rally around, I expect, do our bit.
Look after little Rosie.
I'm just going to, erm...
Look through these things.
There might be a case.
A case?
Oh, you're not up to it, are you?
Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.
Yes, yes, I expect you're right.
I'll make some tea, shall I?
-Mrs Hudson?
-Yes, Sherlock?
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit...full of myself,
-cocky or overconfident...
-MRS HUDSON:
Yes?
Will you just say the word, "Norbury" to me?
-Would you?
-Norbury.
Just that.
I'd be very grateful.
What's this?
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.
-God, is that...
-Must be.
Oh.
I knew it wouldn't end like this.
I knew Moriarty made plans.
(BEEPING)
Thought that would get your attention.
So this is in case...
In case the day comes.
If you're watching this, I'm probably dead.
I hope I can have an ordinary life.
But who knows?
Nothing is certain, nothing is written.
My old life...
It was full of consequences.
The danger was the fun part.
But you can't outrun that forever.
You need to remember that, so...
I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
Might be the hardest case of your career.
When I'm gone, if I'm gone...
I need you to do something for me.
(DOOR OPENS)
Hi.
I just wondered how things were going, you know.
And if there was anything I could do?
It's, uh, it's from John.
-Right.
-You don't need to read it now.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.
He says...
John said if you were to come round, asking after him, offering to help...
Yes?
He said...
That he'd rather have anyone but you.
Anyone.
(DOOR CLOSES)
MARY:
I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
When I'm gone, if I'm gone...
I need you to do something for me.
Save John Watson.
Save him, Sherlock.
Save him.
SHERLOCK:
When does the path we walk on lock around our feet?
When does the road become a river with only one destination?
Death waits for us all in Samarra.
But can Samarra be avoided?
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
Go to hell, Sherlock.

- My brother is a murderer.
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.
Oh, do your research.
I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Merry Christmas!
I'm not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.
You know what happened to the other one.
Miss me?
'Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?

I've only been gone four minutes.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Is that quite clear?
Don't minute any of this.
Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.
A D notice has been slapped on the entire incident.
Only those within this room, code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love, will ever know the whole truth.
As far as everyone else is concerned, going to the Prime Minister and way beyond, Charles Augustus...
- Are you tweeting?
!
- No.
Well, that's what it looks like!
Of course I'm not tweeting.
Why would I be tweeting?
- Give me that!
- What?
No!
What are you doing?
!
- Get off!
- Give it here!
- "Back on terra firma."
- Don't read them out.
- "Free as a bird."
- God, you're such a spoilsport.
Will you take this matter seriously, Sherlock?
I am!
What makes you think I'm not taking it seriously?
"#OhWhatABeautifulMorning"
Look, not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death - my death!
And now I'm back, in a nice warm office, with my big brother and...
Are those ginger nuts?
- Oh, God...
- Love ginger nuts.
Our doctor said you were clean.
I am.
Utterly.
No need for stimulants now, remember?
I have work to do.
You're high as a kite!
Natural high, I assure you.
Totally natural.
I'm just... ♪ ..glad to be alive!

What shall we do next?
What's your name?
Vivian.
- What would you do, Vivian?
- Pardon?
Well, it's a lovely day.
Go for a stroll?
Make a paper aeroplane?
Have an ice lolly?
Ice lolly, I suppose.
Ice lolly it is!
- What's your favourite?
- Well, really, I shouldn't...
- Go on.
- Do they still do Mivvies?
- Mr Holmes...
- Yes?
- ...we do need to get on.
- Yes, of course.
'Do your research.
'I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
..sociopath.
I see.
Who is supposed to have shot him, then?
Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger - that's who.
- That's not what happened at all.
- It is now.
Remarkable.
How did you do it?
We have some very talented people working here.
If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.
That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.
No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.
You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.
You're home and dry.
OK, cheers.
Obviously, there's unfinished business.
Moriarty.
I told you
- Moriarty's dead.
You say he filmed that video message before he died.
Yes.
You also say you know what he's going to do next.
- What does that mean?
- Perhaps that's all there is to it.
Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
No, no, he would never be that disappointing.
He's planned something, something long-term.
Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.
Posthumous revenge.
No, better than that - posthumous game.
We brought you back to deal with this.
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.
Wait?
!
Of course wait.
I'm the target - targets wait.
Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up,
I'll know when it begins.
I always know when the game is on.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because I love it.
There was once a merchant, in the famous market at Baghdad.
One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise, and he knew that the stranger was Death.
Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles, to the city of Samarra.
For there he was sure Death could not find him.
But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.
"Very well," said the merchant.
"I give in.
I am yours."
"But tell me, why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"
"Because," said Death,
"I had an appointment with you tonight... ..in Samarra."
If this gets any better, I'm going to get two knives.
Pays to advertise.
- So, what about Moriarty, then?
- Oh, I have a plan.
I'm going to monitor the underworld, every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
So, basically, your plan is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do?
Awesome, isn't it?
He drowned, Mr Holmes.
That's what we thought.
- But when they opened up his lungs...
- Yes?
..sand.
Superficial.
Come back!
It's the wrong thumb.
_
Sherlock...
It's never twins.
Hopkins, arrest Wilson.
Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.
- 'Wilson?
' 'Lymph nodes?
'
- Sherlock...
Yes, you may have nothing but a limbless torso, but there'll be traces of ink in the lymph nodes under the armpits.
If your mystery corpse had tattoos, the signs will be there.
- 'Bloody hell!
Is that a guess?
'
- I never guess.
- Sherlock...
- 'So, he's the killer?
The canary trainer?
'
- Of course he's the killer.
- 'Didn't see that coming.'
Hm, naturally.
Sherlock, you can't go on spinning plates like this.
That's it!
The place was spinning.
The heart medication you're taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.
Yes, I...
I think so.
Why?
Because the fingerprints on your brother's neck were your own.
- A jellyfish?
- I know.
You can't arrest a jellyfish.
- You could try.
- We did try.
Oh...
- Oh, God.
- Mary?
59 missed calls.
We're in a lot of trouble.
Ow!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Relax, it's got two syllables...
I'm a nurse, darling - I think I know what to do!
- Come on, then...
- Re!
Lax!
No, just drive, please, God, just drive!
God, drive!
Sherlock
- Mary!
That's it, Mary - re...
- Don't you start!
- ...
lax.
John, John...
I think you have to pull over!
- Mary, Mary...
- Pull over!
Oh, my God!
Has that come out?
They never come out when I take them.
Let's have a look.
Aw, she's so beautiful.
- Have another go.
- What about a name?
- Catherine.
- Uh, yeah, we've gone off that.
Have we?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Well, you know what I think...
- It's not a girl's name.
Molly, Mrs H, we would love you to be godparents.
- Oh!
Really?
- If you...
That's so lovely.
And, uh... you too, Sherlock?
- You too what?
- Godfather, we'd like you to be godfather.
God is a ludicrous fiction, dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.
Yeah, but there'll be cake.
Will you do it?
I'll get back to you.
Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.
In Christ's name.
Now, what name have you given your daughter?
Rosamund Mary.
Rosamund?
It means "Rose of the world".
Rosie for short.
Didn't you get John's text?
No.
I delete his texts.
I delete any text that begins "Hi."
No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.
Sorry.
Phone!
And now, godparents, are you ready to help the parents of this child in their duties as Christian parents?
We are.
'Sorry, I didn't catch that.
'Please repeat the question.'
As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.
To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
Hard logic versus romantic whimsy - that is your choice.
You fail to connect actions to their consequences.
Now, for the last time, if you want to keep the rattle, do not throw the rattle.
All right, good girl, good girl.
Good girl.
I'd better finish this, hadn't I?
- Hey.
- Afternoon.
He says you've got a good one, Greg?
Oh, yeah.
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.
God, 50!
Where does it go?
I know for a fact I was only 21 this time last week.
Yeah, well that's impossible.
That was before you met me.
- Well, no, no, there never was...
- "There never was such a time."
She's looking at me disapprovingly again.
No.
She's just jealous.
Yeah, well, I think we both are.
- Oh...
- No, no, David.
- Come on, you promised.
- No, it's...
Oh, no...
Oh, it's a Skype call.
Oh!
Then it must be Charlie.
At least he's phoning, I suppose.
Oh, look!
Hello!
'Hey, Dad.
Happy birthday.
Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?
'
No!
Picture's frozen!
'Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you.'
Why is it rubbish?
Where are you?
How is he?
Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.
David?
Come on!
OK, no, hang on a sec, I'll find somewhere quieter.
So, Charlie, where are you?
Are you there?
- 'Sorry, I'm here.
I'm just a bit...'
- Are you all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
Altitude?
'I'm in Tibet.
Didn't you see the mountains?
'
Never mind mountains.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.
- 'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?
'
- What?
'Could you just check something on my car?
'
Your car?
'To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe
I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet.
- 'Could you take a photo and send it?
'
- Uh, yes, I can do that.
All done.
Have you got it?
Charlie?
A week later...
Yeah?
...something really weird happens.
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed, the cops are chasing him, and he turns into the drive of the Welsborough house to try and get away.
Unfortunately...
The drunk guy survived, they managed to pull him out, but when they put the fire out and examined the parked car...
Whose body?
Charlie Welsborough, the son.
- What?
- The son who was in Tibet.
DNA all checks out.
Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.
- Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
- Have you got a lab report?
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.
- The seats?
- Yes, the car seats.
Made of vinyl.
Two different types of vinyl present.
Was it his own car?
Yeah, not flash - he was a student.
- Well, that's suggestive.
- Why?
- Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
- Yeah, right?
- There's something else.
- Yes?
According to this,
Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.
What?
The body in the car, dead for a week.
Oh, this is a good one.
Is it my birthday?
You want help?
- Yes, please.
OK.
- One condition.
Take all the credit.
It gets boring if I just solve them all.
Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.
He's got a point.
Which makes me look like some kind of prima donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do!
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.
- Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
- Definitely a sore spot.
So you take all the glory, thanks...
- OK!
- ...thanks all the same.
Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?
It's driving me nuts.
Anything you say, Giles.
Just kidding.
What's his name?
Greg.
What?
Greg.
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?
Not a clue.
It's just you normally say that at this point.
Hmm.
Well, then, let's hope you solve your little problem, Greg.
- Hear that?
- I know.
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood?
- Oh, good, great.
Yeah, amazing.
- Getting any sleep?
- Christ, no.
You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.
- Must feel very different...
- Sorry, what?
Yes, well, you know how it is.
All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.
- Are you two having a little joke?
- Never a word of thanks.
Can't even tell people's faces apart.
This is a joke, isn't it?
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever.
You're so, so clever."
- Is it about me?
- I think he needs winding.
You know, I think that really might be it.
No, don't get it.
Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect, so go easy on them, yeah?
- You know me.
- 'Hey, hello.'
Yeah.
Got them, don't worry.
Pampers, the cream you can't get from Boots.
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now?
- At the dead boy's house?
- Yeah.
'And what does he think?
Any theories?
'
Well, I texted you the details.
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.
- Hey!
- How do you know about that?
'Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.'
- They know everything!
- 'Solved it, then?
'
I'm working on it.
'Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.'
- Pig!
- Keep trying.
'So, what about it, then?
'What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it?
'And what are you going to call this one?
'
Oh, the Ghost Driver.
- Don't give it a title.
- People like the titles.
- They hate the titles.
- Give the people what they want.
No, never do that - people are stupid.
Uh, some people.
'All people are stupid.
Most people.'
'Bizarre enough though, isn't it, to be him?
'
I mean, it's right up your strasse.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.
- Son.
- Son!
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.
If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.
Well, I believe that I can.
But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
Sherlock?
Mr Holmes?
Sorry, you were saying?
Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
I don't think we'll ever get over this.
No.
Shouldn't think so.
So sorry, will you excuse me a moment?
I just...
I'll...
I'll just, um...
Ahem.
- Now what's wrong?
- Not sure, I just...
By the pricking of my thumbs.
Seriously?
You?
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.
They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.
What is this?
Oh, it's a sort of shrine, I suppose, really.
Bit of a fan of Mrs T.
A big hero of mine when I was getting started.
Right, yes.
- Who?
- What?
- Who...?
Who was this?
- Are you serious?
- Sherlock...
- It's...
It's Margaret Thatcher, the first female Prime Minister of this country.
Right.
- Prime Minister?
Right.
- Leader of the Government.
- Female?
- For God's sake!
You know perfectly well who she is.
Why are you playing for time?
It's the gap, look at the gap.
It's wrong.
Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed.
The whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.
This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been in, this picture is straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.
- Something's missing from here, but only recently.
- Yes, a...
- Plaster bust... - plaster bust.
- Oh, for God's sake!
It got broken.
What the hell has this got to do with Charlie?
- Rug!
- What?
Well, how could it get broken?
The only place for it to fall is the floor and there is a big thick rug.
- Does it matter?
- Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.
- It is worth letting him do this.
- Is your friend quite mad?
No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
We found the remains out there in the porch.
- The porch where we came in?
- How anybody could hate her so much they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness...
I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.
Why didn't he smash all the others?
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.
Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.
- And if there's nothing...
- I know what happened to your son.
You do?
It's quite simple, superficial, to be blunt.
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness?
- Well, yes.
- And the porch where it was smashed,
I noticed the motion sensor was damaged,
- so I assume it's permanently lit.
- How did you notice that?
I lack the arrogance to ignore details.
I'm not the police.
- So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.
- Exactly.
- Why?
- Don't know.
Wouldn't be fun if I knew.
Mr Holmes, please!
It was your 50th birthday, Mr Welsborough, of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
- After all, he was in Tibet.
- Yes.
- No.
- No?
♪ Happy birthday... ♪
The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video.
Easily arranged.
It's a Skype call.
The trick was meant to be a surprise.
- A trick?
- Obviously.
Could you take a photo and send it?
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.
Well, good enough.
Effectively a costume.
You're joking?
No, I'm not.
All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
- Oh, my God!
- Surprise!
That's when it happened.
I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.
You said he'd felt unwell?
You all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
He died there and then.
No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained, in the driver's seat, hidden, until...
When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who'd been sitting there, quite dead, for a week.
Oh, God!
Poor kid.
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.
This is where it was smashed.
- That was amazing.
- What?
The car, the kid.
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?
I can't stand it, never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
What kind of a life would that be?
Besides, I have the strangest feeling...
Miss me?
- That's mine.
You two take a... bus.
- Why?
I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.
The Mall, please.
- I met her once.
- Thatcher?
Rather arrogant, I thought.
- You thought that?
!
- Ha, I know.
Why am I looking at this?
That's her, John and Mary's baby.
Oh, I see, yes.
Looks very... fully functioning.
Is that really the best you can do?
Sorry, I've never been very good with them.
- Babies?
- Humans.
Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?
Any interest in her?
Why on earth would he?
I don't know.
You tell me.
In the last year of his life,
James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over 70 assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias,
which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.
It's a pearl - get another one.
There's something important about this.
I'm sure.
Maybe it's Moriarty.
Maybe it's not.
But something's coming.
Are you having a premonition, brother mine?
The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other.
What we call premonition is just movement of the web.
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable.
As inevitable as mathematics.
Appointment In Samarra.
I'm sorry?
The merchant who can't outrun Death.
You always hated that story as a child.
Less keen on predestination back then.
I'm not sure I like it now.
You wrote your own version, as I remember.
Appointment In Sumatra.
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.
Goodnight, Mycroft.
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.
- Keep me informed.
- Of what?
Absolutely no idea.
'Ammo!
'
- Oh, hi, Stella.
- Greg.
You, uh...?
- Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...
- Right, right, right...
Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?
It's nothing.
I mean it's nothing serious.
- No, no.
- I just pop round every now and again for a chat.
Yeah, of course.
I mean he loves a really tricky case.
Yeah, he does!
So what you here for?
Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so...
The Borgia Pearl?
They still after that, are they?
Yeah.
So, how did you two first meet?
Oh, well, there was a case about, um, ten years ago.
Nobody could figure it out.
There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.
- Oh, yeah?
How did she die?
- Hypothermia.
What?
I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...
Will you two please keep it down?
!
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?
You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.
I was a carpenter.
Like me dad.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
How the hell...?
Ah... e-cigarettes.
Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.
If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.
But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last.
Anything to add, John?
- John?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.
- What is that?
- That is... me.
Well, it's a me substitute.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You know I value your little contributions.
Yeah?
It's been there since nine this morning.
- Has it?
Where were you?
- Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.
What about my girlfriend?
- What?
- You said I had an ex...
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.
The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.
I...
I thought you'd done something clever.
Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
What do you mean?
Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
- Well...
- You thought she was having an affair.
I'm afraid it's far worse than that, your wife is a spy.
- What?
- That's right.
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy, across the road from your flat.
Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy, as part of an official state visit.
As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.
This drug will render the President entirely susceptible to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty.
What?
Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III.
- Are you serious?
- No, of course not.
His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.
I don't!
- Just the bras.
- Get out.
So, what's this all about, then?
- Having fun.
- Fun?
- While I can.
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, Sherlock...
- Borgia Pearl.
Boring.
Go!
- But...
- Go!
- This had better be good.
- Oh, I think you'll like it.
That is the bust, isn't it?
The one that was broken.
No, it's another one, different owner.
Different part of town.
You were right, this is a thing.
Something's going on.
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be pleased.
- I am pleased.
- You don't look pleased.
This is my game face.
And the game is on.
Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one.
- One belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan.
- Identical busts?
Yeah, and this one to a Dr Barnicot in Holborn.
Three in total.
God knows who'd want to do something like this.
Yeah, but some people have that complex, don't they?
An idee fixe.
They obsess over one thing and they can't let it go.
No, no good.
There were other images of Margaret...
Margaret...?
You know who she is.
...Thatcher, present at the first break-in.
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?
Ooh!
- What?
- Blood.
Quite a bit of it, too.
Was there any injury at the crime scene?
Nah.
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.
- Come on.
- Holborn?
Lambeth!
- Lambeth?
Why?
- To see Toby.
Ah, right.
Who?
- You'll see.
- Right, are you coming?
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.
- Who told you?
- The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.
- Have a good time.
- I will.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
- What?
- She's not the one.
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.
How do you work all that out?
She's got three children in Rio that he doesn't know about.
Are you just making this up?
- Possibly.
- Who's Toby?
There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker, one of the world's best.
Got himself into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago.
He hacked into the Pentagon security system, and I managed to get him off the charge.
Therefore he owes me a favour.
So, how does that help us?
- What?
- Toby the hacker?
- Toby's not the hacker.
- What?
- All right, Craig?
- All right, Sherlock?
Craig's got a dog.
So I see.
Good boy!
Hiya!
Mary?
What are you...?
No, we, we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case.
No, exactly.
So... don't wait up.
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Hey.
Mary, what are you doing here?
She's better at this than you.
- Better?
- So I texted her.
Hang on, Mary's better than me?
Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.
Of course she's better.
Yeah, OK.
Nothing personal.
What, so I'm supposed to just go home now, am I?
What do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?
- John or the dog?
- Ha-ha, that's funny!
- John.
- Well...
He's handy and loyal.
- That's hilarious.
- Is it too early for a divorce?
Oh.
Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge?
Keep up, he's fast.
- He's not moving.
- He's thinking.
He's really not moving.
Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.
You just like this dog, don't you?
- Well, I like you.
- He's still not moving.
- Fascinating.
- Oh!
Well, what do you make of it?
- They were looking for something.
- Yes, but it wasn't a burglar, they came specifically for that Thatcher bust.
Why?
Clever.
Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail,
- where would you go?
- Like hiding a tree in a forest.
Or blood in a butcher's.
Never mind, Toby, better luck next time, hmm?
This is it, though.
This is the one, I can feel it.
Not Moriarty?
It has to be him.
It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.
It's designed to beguile me, tease me and lure me in.
At last, a noose for me to put my neck into.
You should have seen the state of the front room.
- It was like The Exorcist.
- Huh.
Was Rosie's head spinning round?
- No.
Just the projectile vomiting.
- Nice!
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
- Hmm?
Noticed what?
- The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
Yeah, can't she?
I'm coming, darling.
Mummy's coming.
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here.
Have you heard of that thing?
In Germany?
You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.
Ostalgie.
People who missed the old days under the communists.
- People are weird, aren't they?
- Hmm.
According to this, there's quite a market for Cold War memorabilia.
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit?
Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.
Yes, fascinating.
Irrelevant.
Where exactly did they come from?
I've got into the records of the suppliers, Gelder and Co.
Seems they're from Georgia.
Where exactly?
Tbilisi.
Batch of six.
One to Welsborough.
One to Hassan.
One to Dr Barnicot.
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.
One to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.
Lestrade?
Another one?
- 'Yeah.'
- Harker or Sandeford?
Harker.
And it's murder this time.
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.
_
_
Defensive wounds on her face and hands, throat cut.
Sharp blade.
The same thing inside the house?
The bust?
- Two of them this time.
- Interesting.
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago.
- Limited edition of six.
- And now someone's wandering about destroying them all.
Makes no sense.
What's the point?
No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.
- Yes, it is.
- Well, it is, but it's not the point.
I've been slow, far too slow.
Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind...
Slow but lucky, very lucky.
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.
Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.
Congratulations, by the way.
- I'm sorry?
- Well, you're about to solve a big one.
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
- Yeah, until then, basically.
That's enough now, love.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.
And you need to get to bed.
Come on.
Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?
You were on the run.
Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying, it's clever.
Very clever.
But now you've met me and you're not so clever, are you?
Who are you?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.
Argh!
You're out of time.
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
- Who?
I know it's him.
It must be him.
You think you understand.
You understand nothing.
Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don't we just enjoy the moment?
Let me present Interpol's number one case.
Too tough for them, too boring for me.
The Black Pearl of the Borgias!
It's not possible!
How could she...?
!
Everything about who I was is on there.
The problems of your past are your business.
The problems of your future are my privilege.
I don't understand.
She...
She destroyed it.
She?
You know her!
You do, don't you?
You know the bitch?
!
She betrayed me.
Betrayed us all.
Mary.
This is about Mary?
Is that what she's calling herself now, eh?
- 'Armed police, you're surrounded!
'
- Give it to me.
Give it to me!
'Come out slowly, I want to see your hands above your head.'
Nobody shoots me!
Anyone shoots, I kill this man.
'Lay down your weapon.
Do it now!
'
I'm leaving this place.
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.
'Lay down your weapon.'
You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
Tell her she's a dead woman.
She's a dead woman walking.
She's my friend.
And she's under my protection.
Who are you?
I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.
Who's Sherlock Holmes?
Not a policeman.
What do you think?
Mate in two?
Don't antagonise them, darling.
Oh, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.
Everything palls.
They'll send someone soon.
They?
Who are they?
Seems to me we put an awful lot of faith in they.
Well, I've got something they would dearly love, if only we could get out of here.
I've got Ammo.
Ammo?
- Madame Ambassador.
- What took you so long?
- Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now!
Veer left!
What now?
What do we do?
We die.
Well?
He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.
- I very much doubt it.
- Why?
Because I think he used to work with Mary.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out!
We'll come back later.
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the English woman?
What would you do to a traitor?
Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.
I am an idiot, I know nothing.
Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
That was quite a text you sent me.
What's going on, Sherlock?
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,
I couldn't see what was right under my nose.
Expected a pearl.
Oh, my God, that's a...
Yes, it's an AGRA.
Memory stick, like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.
Who?
I don't know.
We...
We all had one but the others were...
Haven't you even looked at it yet?
I glanced at it but I prefer
- to hear it from you.
- Why?
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.
There were four of us, agents.
Not just agents.
Polite term.
Alex.
Gabriel.
Me.
And Ajay.
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.
We all had one.
Each containing aliases, our background, everything.
We could never be betrayed, because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.
- Who employed you?
- Anyone who paid well.
I mean, we were at the top of our game for years.
And then it all ended.
There was a coup in Georgia.
The British Embassy in Tbilisi was taken over, lots of hostages.
We got the call to go in, get them out.
There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.
- Who from?
- I don't know, just another voice on the phone.
And a codeword.
- Ammo.
- Ammo?
Like ammunition.
We went in, but then something went wrong.
Something went really wrong.
That was six years ago.
It feels like forever.
I was the only one that made it out.
No.
What?
I met someone tonight.
Same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.
What, he's alive?
Yeah, very much so.
I don't believe it, this is amazing!
I thought I was the only one,
I thought I was the only one who got out.
Where is he?
I need to see him, now!
Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?
Yeah, of course.
It was our insurance.
Above all, they mustn't fall into enemy hands.
So Ajay survived as well.
And now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide, with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why?
I don't know.
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.
Families fall out.
The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
Well, he's just trying to find me.
He survived, that's all that matters!
I heard it from his own mouth.
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."
Why would he want to kill me?
- He said you betrayed him.
- Oh, no, no, that's insane.
Well, it's what he believes.
I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.
No, Mary...
You do.
I made a vow, remember?
To look after the three of you.
Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
There's something I think you should read.
What is it?
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.
What are you...?
- Mary...
Oh, no!
- There you go.
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.
No.
You just look after them till I get back.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Agra?
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
It is 378km west of the state capital, Lucknow.
What are you, Wikipedia?
- Yes.
- AGRA is an acronym.
Oh, good, I love an acronym.
All the best secret societies have them.
Team of agents, the best.
But you know all that.
Of course I do.
Go on.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.
Indeed?
Well, that's news to me.
Is it?
He's already killed looking for that memory stick.
AGRA always worked for the highest bidder,
I thought that might include you?
- Me?
- Well, I mean the British government, or whatever government you're currently propping up.
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.
They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong.
And that was that, we stopped using freelancers.
- Your initiative?
- My initiative.
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.
I don't like loose ends.
Not on my watch.
There was something else.
A detail.
A codeword.
Ammo?
It's all I've got.
Little enough.
Could you do some digging as a favour?
You don't have many favours left.
Then I'm calling them all in.
And if you can find who's after her and neutralise them, what then?
You think you can go on saving her forever?
Of course.
Is that sentiment talking?
No, it's me.
Difficult to tell the difference these days.
Told you, I made a promise.
A vow.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.
Not on my watch.
'My darling, I need to tell you this because you mustn't hate me for going away.'
Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.
- Can you hear a squeaking?
- No.
Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel.
Why Planes Fail.
- Did you see it?
Oh, truly terrifying.
- Can't say I did.
Swore I would never fly again, yet hear I am!
Everything OK, madam?
No.
No, no, it's not, but then what's the use in complaining?
I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off is all.
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.
Oh, OK.
Relax.
She said relax.
Did you have a nice time in London?
It was OK, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun?
Did you lose it in the war?
'I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.
I'm not running, I promise you that,
I just need to do this in my own way.'
Oh, God!
I'm...
I-I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God!
- Everything OK, madam?
- I think I'm dying.
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.
God will smile on you.
'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,
I'm sorry, my love.'
I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.
Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of a dice.
I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
I swear I will.'
Not like this one.
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in!
I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.
Mr Baker.
Well, that completes the set.
- No, it does not.
- Well, who else am I missing?
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?
Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.
Oh, hi, Mary.
What concept?
Happy families.
Nice trip?
- How the f...?
- Please, Mary, there is a child present.
- How did you get in here?
- Karim let me in.
Hello.
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Nice to meet you, missus.
No, I mean how did you find me?
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
No, really, though, how?
Every movement I made was entirely random, every new personality just on the roll of a dice!
Mary, no human action is ever truly random.
An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability, mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual, can reduce the number of variables considerably.
I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine a seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.
But they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.
Oh, you bastard!
- You bastard!
- I know, but your face!
"The mathematics of probability"?
- You believed that.
- "Feasible variables"?
Yes, I started to run out about then.
In the memory stick!
Yeah, that was my idea.
- AGRA?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
You said it was your initials.
In a way that was true.
In a way?
So many lies.
I'm so sorry.
And I don't just mean you.
What?
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...
You're R?
Rosamund?
Rosamund Mary.
I always liked Mary.
Yeah, me too.
I used to.
I just...
I didn't know what else to do.
You could have stayed, you could have talked to me.
That's what couples are supposed to do.
Work things through.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Mary, I may not be a very good man but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for,
- most of the time.
- All the time.
You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.
You never judge, you never complain.
I don't deserve you, I...
All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
I will keep you safe.
But it has to be in London.
It's my city, I know the turf.
Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.
Get down!
Hello again.
- Ajay?
- Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.
Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.
I thought I was the only one who got out.
How did you find us?
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.
You found her but I found you.
So perhaps not so clever.
And now here we are.
At last.
Touche!
Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
She thought I was dead.
I might as well have been.
It was always just the four of us, always, remember?
Oh, yeah.
So why do you want to kill me?
Do you know how long they kept me prisoner?
What they did to me?
They tortured Alex to death.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.
But you?
You, where were you?
That day at the embassy, I escaped.
Ha!
But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
Where were you?
Oh, I got out.
For a while.
Long enough to hide my memory stick.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.
I was loyal, you see.
Loyal to my friends.
But they took me, tortured me.
Not for information.
Not for anything except fun.
They thought I'd give in, die, but I didn't, I lived.
And eventually, they forgot about me rotting in a cell somewhere.
Six years they kept me there.
Until one day I saw my chance.
Oh, and I made them pay.
You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.
Little whispers.
Laughter.
Gossip.
How the clever agents had been betrayed.
Brought down by you!
Me?
You know I'll kill you too.
You know I will, Ajay.
What, you think I care if I die?
I've dreamed of killing you every night for six years.
Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.
I swear to you, Ajay.
What did you hear, Ajay?
When you were a prisoner, what exactly did you hear?
What did I hear?
Ammo.
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo."
We were betrayed!
- And they said it was her?
- That you betrayed us!
They said her name?
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.
No!
No!
'The English woman, that's all he heard.
Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.'
Couldn't this wait until you're back?
No, it's not over.
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed, the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.
There was only a voice on the phone.
'Remember?
And a codeword.'
"Ammo," yes, you said.
How's your Latin, brother dear?
My Latin?
Amo, amas, amat.
I love, you love, he loves.
What...?
Not "Ammo" as in ammunition, but "Amo", meaning?
You'd better be right, Sherlock.
Bloody thing!
What's going on?
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.
What?
'So many lies.
And I don't just mean you.'
- Hello.
- Ah, hello.
- I like your daisy.
- Thank you, yeah.
It's not really me, though, I think.
- No?
- No, no, it's too floral for me.
I'm more of a "knackered with weary old eyes" kind of guy.
Well, I think they're nice.
Nice eyes.
- Thank you.
- Look...
Look...
I don't normally do this,
- but, um...
- But you're going to.
Yeah.
- What's this?
- This is me.
- Thank you.
Cheers.
- Yeah.
Great.
- Bye!
- Bye.
_
_
_
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
Hmm?
Noticed what?
The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
- Yeah, can't she?
- Hmm.
I'm coming darling.
I'm coming.
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
- _
- Come here...
It's OK.
_
- _
- Do you want a cuddle?
_
I know.
- Oh, sweetheart.
- _
_
Ssh.
Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you?
_
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?
Oh, let's go and see Daddy!
Daddy's here.
It's OK, Rosie.
I'll take her.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I may as well get up now.
Hey, baby, it's Daddy.
Your daddy.
Come here, Rose.
Come here, darling, it's all right.
Thank you.
_
_
This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.
How many more times?
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.
And you're basing all this on a code name?
On a whispered voice on the telephone?
Come on, Mycroft.
You were the conduit for AGRA.
Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
It was my job.
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
AGRA went in.
- Yes.
- And they were betrayed.
Not by me.
Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.
I promise you,
I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.
You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.
Not one.
Not.
One.
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories?
I'd like to do those.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.
Although she does seem to enjoy them.
Well, I'll have to give that a go.
Got a lot to catch up on.
'You think you understand.
You understand nothing.'
'Code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love.'
'You'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.
'They know everything.'
'They said it was the English woman.'
'Don't minute any of this.'
'They know everything.'
- You don't make it easy, do you?
- What do you mean?
Well, being... being so perfect.
Mary, I...
I need to tell you...
Hang on.
Can you tell me later?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Great.
Well, no, we can't just go.
- Rosie.
- Yeah.
- Er, you go.
- No!
I'll come as soon as I've found someone.
Mrs Hudson.
- Corfu till Saturday.
Molly?
- Er, yeah, I'll try.
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.
You know that's not going to happen.
If there's more to this case, you need to see it.
Yeah, OK, you win.
'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes.
'Please make your way to the exit.
Thank you.'
Your office said I'd find you here.
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.
We're like them.
Ghostly, living in the shadows.
Predatory?
Well, it depends which side you're on.
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.
Nice location for the final act, couldn't have chosen it better myself.
But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.
I just come here to look at the fish.
I knew this would happen one day.
- It's like that old story.
- I really am a very busy man.
Would you mind cutting to the chase?
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
With good reason.
"There was once a merchant, in a famous market in Baghdad."
I really have never liked this story.
I'm just like the merchant in the story,
I thought I could out-run the inevitable.
I've always been looking over my shoulder, always expecting to see the grim figure of...
Death.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hey.
- John?
- On his way.
Let me introduce Ammo.
You were Ammo?
You were the person on the phone that time?
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
Why did you betray us?
Why does anyone do anything?
- Hmm.
- Let me guess, selling secrets?
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.
Worked very well for a few years.
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it.
But...
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.
I couldn't believe my luck!
That bought me a little time.
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
Very handy.
They were always such reliable killers.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.
Lady Smallwood gave the order.
But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.
Seemed to do the trick.
And you thought your troubles were over.
I was tired.
Tired of the mess of it all.
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.
The hostages were killed.
AGRA too.
Or so I thought.
My secret was safe.
But... apparently not.
Just a little peace.
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
A family?
Home?
Really, I understand.
So, just let me get out of here, right?
Let me just walk away.
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.
What do you say?
After what you did?
!
Mary, no!
OK.
London Aquarium.
Yes, now.
I was never a field agent.
I always thought I'd be rather good.
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
Thanks.
- For a secretary.
- What?
It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
- I didn't do this out of jealousy.
- No?
Same old drudge, day in, day out.
Never getting out there where all the excitement was.
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.
Yes, your little flat.
- How do you know?
- Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?
And what are you, widowed or divorced?
Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.
That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.
- Sherlock...
- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.
A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.
- Sherlock, don't.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.
There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
That accounts for the drink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.
So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.
To prove how good you are.
To make up for the inadequacies of your...
little life.
Well, Mrs Norbury,
I must admit this is unexpected.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.
All except Sherlock Holmes.
There's no way out.
So it would seem.
You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.
It's what I do.
Maybe I can still surprise you.
Now, come on, be sensible.
Hmm, no, I don't think so.
Ah!
Surprise!
Everything's fine.
It's going to be OK.
Get an ambulance!
It's all right, it's all right.
- Mary!
- John.
All right, Mary?
Mary?
Stay with me, stay with me.
- Oh, come on...
- No, don't worry.
Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
Come on, Mary.
Mary?
Oh, God.
John, I think this is it.
No, no, no, no.
It's not.
- That's...
- You made me so happy.
You gave me everything I could ever, ever have wanted...
Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.
- Look after Rosie.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.
- Promise me.
- I promise.
- No...
- Yes, I promise.
- Promise me!
- I promise, I promise.
Ssh, ssh.
Hey, Sherlock.
Yes.
I... so like you.
Did I ever say?
Yes, yes, you did.
I'm sorry for... for shooting you that time.
I'm really sorry.
It's all right.
I think we're even now, OK?
OK.
- Oh, I think we're...
- Mary, Mary...
- ...even, definitely even.
- Ssh, ssh.
You were my whole world.
Being Mary Watson was the only life worth living.
- Mary...
- Thank you.
Mary...
Don't you dare!
You made a vow.
You swore it.
'You've been having dreams.
A recurring dream?
'
Do you want to talk about it?
This is a two-way relationship, you know.
The whole world has come crashing down around you.
Everything's hopeless.
Irretrievable.
I know that's what you must feel but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
That's not really my style.
I need to know what to do.
Do?
About John.
Put me through to Sherrinford, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
But nothing will ever be the same again, will it?
I'm afraid it won't.
We'll have to rally round, I expect, do our bit.
Look after little Rosie.
I'm just going to, um look through these things.
There might be a case.
A case?
Oh, you're not up to it, are you?
Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.
Yes.
Yes, I expect you're right.
I'll make some tea, shall I?
- Mrs Hudson?
- Yes, Sherlock?
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident...
- Yes?
- ...would you just say the word Norbury to me?
Would you?
Norbury?
Just that.
I'd be very grateful.
What's this?
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.
Oh, God!
Is that...?
- Must be.
- Oh.
I knew it wouldn't end like this.
I knew Moriarty made plans.
'I thought that would get your attention.
So, this is in case...
In case the day comes.
If you are watching this, I'm probably dead.
I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows?
Nothing's certain, nothing's written.
My old life it was full of consequences.
The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.
You need to remember that.
So I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
Might be the hardest case of your career.
When I'm... gone, if I'm gone I need you to do something for me.'
Hi.
I just wondered how things were going and if there was anything I could do.
It's, er, it's from John.
- Right.
- You don't need to read it now.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.
He says...
John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...
Yes?
He said he'd that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Anyone.
'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
When I'm gone, if I'm... gone I need you to do something for me.
Save John Watson.
Save him, Sherlock.
Save him.'
'When does the path we walk on lock around our feet?
When does the road become a river with only one destination?
'
'Death waits for us all in Samarra.
But can Samarra be avoided?
'
Go to hell, Sherlock!
-
- My brother is a murderer.
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr. Holmes.
Oh, do your research.
I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Merry Christmas!
[GUNSHOT]
I'm not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.
You know what happened to the other one.
Miss me?
'Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
'
I've only been gone four minutes.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Is that quite clear?
Don't minute any of this.
Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.
A D notice has been slapped on the entire incident.
Only those within this room, code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love, will ever know the whole truth.
As far as everyone else is concerned, going to the Prime Minister
- and way beyond, Charles Augustus...
- [PHONE KEYBOARD CLICKS]
- Are you tweeting?
!
- No.
Well, that's what it looks like!
Of course I'm not tweeting.
Why would I be tweeting?
- Give me that!
- What?
No!
What are you doing?
!
- Get off!
- Give it here!
- "Back on Terra firma."
- Don't read them out.
- "Free as a bird."
- God, you're such a spoilsport.
Will you take this matter seriously, Sherlock?
I am!
What makes you think I'm not taking it seriously?
"#OhWhatABeautifulMorning"
Look, not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death - my death!
And now I'm back, in a nice warm office, with my big brother and...
Are those ginger nuts?
- Oh, God...
- Love ginger nuts.
Our doctor said you were clean.
I am.
Utterly.
No need for stimulants now, remember?
I have work to do.
You're high as a kite!
Natural high, I assure you.
Totally natural.
I'm just... * ..glad to be alive!
*
What shall we do next?
What's your name?
Vivian.
- What would you do, Vivian?
- Pardon?
Well, it's a lovely day.
Go for a stroll?
Make a paper aeroplane?
Have an ice lolly?
Ice lolly, I suppose.
Ice lolly it is!
- What's your favourite?
- Well, really, I shouldn't...
- Go on.
- Do they still do Mivvies?
- Mr. Holmes...
- Yes?
- We do need to get on.
- Yes, of course.
[HELICOPTER WHIRS]
'Do your research.
'I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
[GUNSHOT]
- Sociopath.
- [GUNSHOT]
- Sociopath.' - [GUNSHOT]
I see.
Who is supposed to have shot him, then?
Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger - that's who.
- That's not what happened at all.
- It is now.
Remarkable.
How did you do it?
We have some very talented people working here.
If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.
That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.
No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.
You're off the hook, Mr. Holmes.
You're home and Dr.y.
OK, cheers.
Obviously, there's unfinished business.
Moriarty.
I told you
- Moriarty's dead.
You say he filmed that video message before he died.
Yes.
You also say you know what he's going to do next.
- What does that mean?
- Perhaps that's all there is to it.
Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
No, no, he would never be that disappointing.
He's planned something, something long-term.
Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.
Posthumous revenge.
No, better than that - posthumous game.
We brought you back to deal with this.
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.
Wait?
!
Of course wait.
I'm the target - targets wait.
Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up,
I'll know when it begins.
I always know when the game is on.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because I love it.
There was once a merchant, in the famous market at Baghdad.
- [WATER SLOSHES]
- One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise, and he knew that the stranger was Death.
Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles, to the city of Samarra.
For there he was sure Death could not find him.
But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.
"Very well," said the merchant.
"I give in.
I am yours."
"But tell me, why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"
"Because," said Death,
"I had an appointment with you tonight... in Samarra."
If this gets any better, I'm going to get two knives.
Pays to advertise.
- So, what about Moriarty, then?
- Oh, I have a plan.
I'm going to monitor the underworld, every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
So, basically, your plan is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do?
Awesome, isn't it?
He Dr.owned, Mr. Holmes.
That's what we thought.
- But when they opened up his lungs...
- Yes?
Sand.
- Superficial.
- [PHONE WHISTLES]
Come back!
It's the wrong thumb.
[DOOR slams.]
- Sherlock...
- It's never twins.
Hopkins, arrest Wilson.
Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.
- 'Wilson?
' 'Lymph nodes?
'
- Sherlock...
Yes, you may have nothing but a limbless torso, but there'll be traces of ink in the lymph nodes under the armpits.
If your mystery corpse had tattoos, the signs will be there.
- 'Bloody hell!
Is that a guess?
'
- I never guess.
- Sherlock...
- 'So, he's the killer?
The canary trainer?
'
- Of course he's the killer.
- 'Didn't see that coming.'
Hm, naturally.
Sherlock, you can't go on spinning plates like this.
That's it!
The place was spinning.
The heart medication you're taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.
Yes, I...
I think so.
Why?
Because the fingerprints on your brother's neck were your own.
- [WATSON CHUCKLES] A jellyfish?
- I know.
You can't arrest a jellyfish.
- You could try.
- We did try.
- [PHONE REPEATEDLY VIBRATES]
- Oh...
- Oh, God.
- Mary?
59 missed calls.
We're in a lot of trouble.
[MARY screams.]
Ow!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Relax, it's got two syllables...
I'm a nurse, darling - I think I know what to do!
- Come on, then...
- Re!
Lax!
No, just Dr.ive, please, God, just Dr.ive!
God, Dr.ive!
- [SHE screams.]
- Sherlock
- Mary!
- That's it, Mary - re...
- [PHONE KEYBOARD CLICKS]
- Don't you start!
- Lax.
John, John...
I think you have to pull over!
- Mary, Mary...
- Pull over!
- Oh, my God!
- [MARY screams.]
Has that come out?
They never come out when I take them.
Let's have a look.
Aw, she's so beautiful.
- Have another go.
- What about a name?
- Catherine.
- Uh, yeah, we've gone off that.
Have we?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Well, you know what I think...
- BOTH:
It's not a girl's name.
Molly, Mr.s H, we would love you to be godparents.
- Oh!
Really?
- If you...
That's so lovely.
And, uh... you too, Sherlock?
- You too what?
- Godfather, we'd like you to be godfather.
God is a ludicrous fiction, Dr.eamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.
Yeah, but there'll be cake.
Will you do it?
I'll get back to you.
Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.
In Christ's name.
Now, what name have you given your daughter?
Rosamund Mary.
Rosamund?
It means "Rose of the world".
Rosie for short.
Didn't you get John's text?
No.
I delete his texts.
I delete any text that begins "Hi."
No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.
- [Mr.S HUDSON CLEARS THROAT]
- Sorry.
WHISPERING:
Phone!
And now, godparents, are you ready to help the parents of this child in their duties as Christian parents?
BOTH:
We are.
SIRI: 'Sorry, I didn't catch that.
'Please repeat the question.'
As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.
To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
Hard logic versus romantic whiMs.y - that is your choice.
You fail to connect actions to their consequences.
Now, for the last time, if you want to keep the rattle, do not throw the rattle.
[MESSAGE TONE]
All right, good girl, good girl.
Good girl.
I'd better finish this, hadn't I?
- Hey.
- Afternoon.
He says you've got a good one, Greg?
Oh, yeah.
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
God, 50!
Where does it go?
I know for a fact I was only 21 this time last week.
Yeah, well that's impossible.
That was before you met me.
- Well, no, no, there never was...
- "There never was such a time."
She's looking at me disapprovingly again.
No.
She's just jealous.
Yeah, well, I think we both are.
[PHONE VIBRATES]
- Oh...
- No, no, David.
- Come on, you promised.
- No, it's...
Oh, no...
Oh, it's a Skype call.
Oh!
Then it must be Charlie.
At least he's phoning, I suppose.
Oh, look!
Hello!
'Hey, Dad.
Happy birthday.
Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?
'
No!
Picture's frozen!
'Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you.'
Why is it rubbish?
Where are you?
How is he?
Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.
MAN:
David?
Come on!
OK, no, hang on a sec, I'll find somewhere quieter.
So, Charlie, where are you?
Are you there?
- 'Sorry, I'm here.
I'm just a bit...'
- Are you all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
Altitude?
'I'm in Tibet.
Didn't you see the mountains?
'
Never mind mountains.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.
- 'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?
'
- What?
'Could you just check something on my car?
'
Your car?
'To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe
I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet.
- 'Could you take a photo and send it?
'
- Uh, yes, I can do that.
All done.
Have you got it?
Charlie?
LESTRADE:
A week later...
Yeah?
Something really weird happens.
Dr.unk Dr.iver, he's totally smashed, the cops are chasing him, and he turns into the Dr.ive of the Welsborough house to try and get away.
Unfortunately...
The Dr.unk guy survived, they managed to pull him out, but when they put the fire out and examined the parked car...
Whose body?
Charlie Welsborough, the son.
- What?
- The son who was in Tibet.
DNA all checks out.
Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.
[SHERLOCK CHUCKLES]
- Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
- Have you got a lab report?
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.
- The seats?
- Yes, the car seats.
Made of vinyl.
Two different types of vinyl present.
Was it his own car?
Yeah, not flash - he was a student.
- Well, that's suggestive.
- Why?
- Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
- Yeah, right?
- There's something else.
- Yes?
According to this,
Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.
What?
The body in the car, dead for a week.
Oh, this is a good one.
Is it my birthday?
You want help?
- Yes, please.
OK.
- One condition.
Take all the credit.
It gets boring if I just solve them all.
Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.
He's got a point.
Which makes me look like some kind of Prima Donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do!
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.
- Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
- Definitely a sore spot.
So you take all the glory, thanks...
- OK!
- Thanks all the same.
Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?
It's Dr.iving me nuts.
Anything you say, Giles.
Just kidding.
HE MOUTHS:
What's his name?
HE MOUTHS:
Greg.
What?
Greg.
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?
Not a clue.
It's just you normally say that at this point.
Hmm.
Well, then, let's hope you solve your little problem, Greg.
- Hear that?
- I know.
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood?
- Oh, good, great.
Yeah, amazing.
- Getting any sleep?
- Christ, no.
You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.
- Must feel very different...
- Sorry, what?
Yes, well, you know how it is.
All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.
- Are you two having a little joke?
- Never a word of thanks.
Can't even tell people's faces apart.
This is a joke, isn't it?
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever.
You're so, so clever."
- Is it about me?
- I think he needs winding.
You know, I think that really might be it.
No, don't get it.
Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect, so go easy on them, yeah?
- You know me.
- MARY: 'Hey, hello.'
Yeah.
Got them, don't worry.
Pampers, the cream you can't get from Boots.
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now?
- At the dead boy's house?
- Yeah.
'And what does he think?
Any theories?
'
Well, I texted you the details.
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.
- Hey!
- How do you know about that?
'Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.'
- WHISPERING:
They know everything!
- 'Solved it, then?
'
I'm working on it.
'Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.'
- Pig!
- Keep trying.
'So, what about it, then?
'What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it?
'And what are you going to call this one?
'
Oh, the Ghost Dr.iver.
- Don't give it a title.
- People like the titles.
- They hate the titles.
- Give the people what they want.
No, never do that - people are stupid.
Uh, some people.
'All people are stupid.
Most people.'
'Bizarre enough though, isn't it, to be him?
'
I mean, it's right up your Straße.
Mr. and Mr.s Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.
- Son.
- Son!
Mr. and Mr.s Welsborough, this is Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.
If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.
Well, I believe that I... can.
DISTORTED:
But Charlie was our whole world, Mr. Holmes.
I...
Sherlock?
Mr. Holmes?
Sorry, you were saying?
Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr. Holmes.
I...
I don't think we'll ever get over this.
No.
Shouldn't think so.
So sorry, will you excuse me a moment?
I just...
I'll...
I'll just, um...
Ahem.
- Now what's wrong?
- Not sure, I just...
By the pricking of my thumbs.
Seriously?
You?
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.
They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.
What is this?
Oh, it's a sort of shrine, I suppose, really.
Bit of a fan of Mr.s T.
A big hero of mine when I was getting started.
Right, yes.
- Who?
- What?
- Who...?
Who was this?
- Are you serious?
- Sherlock...
- It's...
It's Margaret Thatcher, the first female Prime Minister of this country.
Right.
- Prime Minister?
Right.
- Leader of the Government.
- Female?
- For God's sake!
You know perfectly well who she is.
Why are you playing for time?
It's the gap, look at the gap.
It's wrong.
Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed.
The whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.
This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been in, this picture is straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.
Something's missing from here, but only recently.
Yes, a...
- Plaster bust... - plaster bust.
- Oh, for God's sake!
It got broken.
What the hell has this got to do with Charlie?
- Rug!
- What?
Well, how could it get broken?
The only place for it to fall is the floor and there is a big thick rug.
- Does it matter?
- Mr.s Welsborough, my apologies.
- It is worth letting him do this.
- Is your friend quite mad?
No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
We found the remains out there in the porch.
- The porch where we came in?
- How anybody could hate her so much they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness...
I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.
Why didn't he smash all the others?
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.
Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.
- And if there's nothing...
- I know what happened to your son.
You do?
It's quite simple, superficial, to be blunt.
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness?
- Well, yes.
- And the porch where it was smashed,
I noticed the motion sensor was damaged,
- so I assume it's permanently lit.
- How did you notice that?
I lack the arrogance to ignore details.
I'm not the police.
So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.
Exactly.
- Why?
- Don't know.
Wouldn't be fun if I knew.
Mr. Holmes, please!
It was your 50th birthday, Mr. Welsborough, of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
- After all, he was in Tibet.
- Yes.
- No.
- No?
CROWD: * Happy birthday... *
The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video.
Easily arranged.
It's a Skype call.
The trick was meant to be a surprise.
- A trick?
- Obviously.
Could you take a photo and send it?
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.
Well, good enough.
Effectively a costume.
You're joking?
No, I'm not.
All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
- Oh, my God!
- Surprise!
That's when it happened.
I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.
You said he'd felt unwell?
You all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
He died there and then.
No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained, in the Dr.iver's seat, hidden, until...
When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who'd been sitting there, quite dead, for a week.
Oh, God!
Poor kid.
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr. Welsborough, Mr.s Welsborough.
This is where it was smashed.
- That was amazing.
- What?
The car, the kid.
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?
I can't stand it, never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
What kind of a life would that be?
Besides, I have the strangest feeling...
Miss me?
- That's mine.
You two take a... bus.
- Why?
I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.
The Mall, please.
- I met her once.
- Thatcher?
Rather arrogant, I thought.
- You thought that?
!
- Ha, I know.
Why am I looking at this?
That's her, John and Mary's baby.
Oh, I see, yes.
Looks very... fully functioning.
Is that really the best you can do?
Sorry, I've never been very good with them.
- Babies?
- Humans.
Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?
Any interest in her?
Why on earth would he?
I don't know.
You tell me.
In the last year of his life,
James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over 70 assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias,
which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.
It's a pearl - get another one.
There's something important about this.
I'm sure.
Maybe it's Moriarty.
Maybe it's not.
[WATER SLOSHES]
But something's coming.
Are you having a premonition, brother mine?
The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other.
What we call premonition is just movement of the web.
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable.
As inevitable as mathematics.
Appointment In Samarra.
I'm sorry?
The merchant who can't outrun Death.
You always hated that story as a child.
Less keen on predestination back then.
I'm not sure I like it now.
You wrote your own version, as I remember.
Appointment In Sumatra.
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.
Goodnight, Mycroft.
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.
- Keep me informed.
- Of what?
Absolutely no idea.
'Ammo!
'
[MAN SHUDDERS]
- Oh, hi, Stella.
- Greg.
You, uh...?
- Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...
- Right, right, right...
Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?
It's nothing.
I mean it's nothing serious.
- No, no.
- I just pop round every now and again for a chat.
Yeah, of course.
I mean he loves a really tricky case.
Yeah, he does!
So what you here for?
Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so...
The Borgia Pearl?
They still after that, are they?
Yeah.
So, how did you two first meet?
Oh, well, there was a case about, um, ten years ago.
Nobody could figure it out.
There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.
- Oh, yeah?
How did she die?
- Hypothermia.
What?
I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...
Will you two please keep it down?
!
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?
You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.
I was a carpenter.
Like me dad.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
How the hell...?
Ah... e-cigarettes.
Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.
If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.
But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last.
Anything to add, John?
- John?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.
- What is that?
- That is... me.
Well, it's a me substitute.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You know I value your little contributions.
Yeah?
It's been there since nine this morning.
- Has it?
Where were you?
- Helping Mr.s H with her sudoku.
What about my girlfriend?
- What?
- You said I had an ex...
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.
The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seeMs. you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.
I...
I thought you'd done something clever.
Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?
[SHERLOCK INHALES DEEPLY]
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr. Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
What do you mean?
Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
- Well...
- You thought she was having an affair.
I'm afraid it's far worse than that, your wife is a spy.
- What?
- That's right.
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy, across the road from your flat.
Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy, as part of an official state visit.
As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new Dr.ug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.
This Dr.ug will render the President entirely susceptible to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty.
What?
Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III.
- Are you serious?
- No, of course not.
His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.
I don't!
- Just the bras.
- Get out.
So, what's this all about, then?
- Having fun.
- Fun?
- While I can.
- Mm-hmm.
[KNOCK AT DOOR]
- Uh, Sherlock...
- Borgia Pearl.
Boring.
Go!
- But...
- Go!
- This had better be good.
- Oh, I think you'll like it.
That is the bust, isn't it?
The one that was broken.
No, it's another one, different owner.
Different part of town.
You were right, this is a thing.
Something's going on.
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be pleased.
- I am pleased.
- You don't look pleased.
This is my game face.
And the game is on.
Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one.
- One belonging to Mr. Mohandes Hassan.
- Identical busts?
Yeah, and this one to a Dr. Barnicot in Holborn.
Three in total.
God knows who'd want to do something like this.
Yeah, but some people have that complex, don't they?
An idee fixe.
They obsess over one thing and they can't let it go.
No, no good.
There were other images of Margaret...
Margaret...?
You know who she is.
Thatcher, present at the first break-in.
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?
Ooh!
- What?
- Blood.
Quite a bit of it, too.
Was there any injury at the crime scene?
Nah.
Then our suspect must have cut theMs.elves breaking the bust.
- Come on.
- Holborn?
Lambeth!
- Lambeth?
Why?
- To see Toby.
Ah, right.
Who?
- You'll see.
- Right, are you coming?
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.
- Who told you?
- The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.
- Have a good time.
- I will.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
- What?
- She's not the one.
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.
How do you work all that out?
She's got three chilDr.en in Rio that he doesn't know about.
Are you just making this up?
- Possibly.
- Who's Toby?
There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker, one of the world's best.
Got hiMs.elf into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago.
He hacked into the Pentagon security system, and I managed to get him off the charge.
Therefore he owes me a favour.
So, how does that help us?
- What?
- Toby the hacker?
- Toby's not the hacker.
- What?
- All right, Craig?
- All right, Sherlock?
Craig's got a dog.
So I see.
Good boy!
Hiya!
Mary?
What are you...?
No, we, we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case.
No, exactly.
So... don't wait up.
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Hey.
Mary, what are you doing here?
She's better at this than you.
- Better?
- So I texted her.
Hang on, Mary's better than me?
Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.
Of course she's better.
Yeah, OK.
Nothing personal.
What, so I'm supposed to just go home now, am I?
What do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?
- John or the dog?
- Ha-ha, that's funny!
- John.
- Well...
He's handy and loyal.
- That's hilarious.
- Is it too early for a divorce?
Oh.
Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge?
Keep up, he's fast.
- He's not moving.
- He's thinking.
He's really not moving.
Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.
You just like this dog, don't you?
- Well, I like you.
- He's still not moving.
- Fascinating.
- Oh!
[SHE CLEARS HER THROAT]
Well, what do you make of it?
- They were looking for something.
- Yes, but it wasn't a burglar, they came specifically for that Thatcher bust.
Why?
[DOG SNIFFS]
[DOG WHINES]
Clever.
Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail,
- where would you go?
- Like hiding a tree in a forest.
Or blood in a butcher's.
Never mind, Toby, better luck next time, hmm?
This is it, though.
This is the one, I can feel it.
Not Moriarty?
It has to be him.
It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.
It's designed to beguile me, tease me and lure me in.
At last, a noose for me to put my neck into.
You should have seen the state of the front room.
- It was like The Exorcist.
- Huh.
Was Rosie's head spinning round?
- No.
Just the projectile vomiting.
- Nice!
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
- Hmm?
Noticed what?
- The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
[BABY CRIES]
Yeah, can't she?
I'm coming, darling.
Mummy's coming.
LOVINGLY:
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here.
Have you heard of that thing?
In Germany?
You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.
Ostalgie.
People who missed the old days under the communists.
- People are weird, aren't they?
- Hmm.
According to this, there's quite a market for Cold War memorabilia.
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit?
Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.
Yes, fascinating.
Irrelevant.
Where exactly did they come from?
I've got into the records of the suppliers, Gelder and Co.
SeeMs. they're from Georgia.
Where exactly?
Tbilisi.
Batch of six.
One to Welsborough.
One to Hassan.
One to Dr. Barnicot.
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.
One to a Mr. Jack Sandeford of Reading.
Lestrade?
Another one?
- 'Yeah.'
- Harker or Sandeford?
Harker.
And it's murder this time.
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.
Defensive wounds on her face and hands, throat cut.
Sharp blade.
The same thing inside the house?
The bust?
- Two of them this time.
- Interesting.
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago.
- Limited edition of six.
- And now someone's wandering about destroying them all.
Makes no sense.
What's the point?
No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.
- Yes, it is.
- Well, it is, but it's not the point.
I've been slow, far too slow.
Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind...
Slow but lucky, very lucky.
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.
Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.
Congratulations, by the way.
- I'm sorry?
- Well, you're about to solve a big one.
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
- Yeah, until then, basically.
[WATER SPLASHING]
That's enough now, love.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.
And you need to get to bed.
Come on.
Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?
You were on the run.
Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady Dr.ying, it's clever.
Very clever.
But now you've met me and you're not so clever, are you?
Who are you?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.
Argh!
You're out of time.
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
- Who?
I know it's him.
It must be him.
You think you understand.
You understand nothing.
Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don't we just enjoy the moment?
Let me present Interpol's number one case.
Too tough for them, too boring for me.
The Black Pearl of the Borgias!
It's not possible!
How could she...?
!
Everything about who I was is on there.
The probleMs. of your past are your business.
The probleMs. of your future... are my privilege.
I don't understand.
She...
She destroyed it.
She?
You know her!
You do, don't you?
You know the bitch?
!
She betrayed me.
Betrayed us all.
Mary.
This is about Mary?
Is that what she's calling herself now, eh?
- 'Armed police, you're surrounded!
'
- Give it to me.
YELLS:
Give it to me!
'Come out slowly, I want to see your hands above your head.'
Nobody shoots me!
Anyone shoots, I kill this man.
'Lay down your weapon.
Do it now!
'
I'm leaving this place.
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.
'Lay down your weapon.'
You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
Tell her she's a dead woman.
She's a dead woman walking.
She's my friend.
And she's under my protection.
Who are you?
I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.
Who's Sherlock Holmes?
Not a policeman.
[ALARM BLARES]
What do you think?
Mate in two?
Don't antagonise them, darling.
Oh, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.
Everything palls.
They'll send someone soon.
They?
Who are they?
SeeMs. to me we put an awful lot of faith in they.
Well, I've got something they would dearly love, if only we could get out of here.
I've got Ammo.
Ammo?
- MARY:
Madame Ambassador.
- What took you so long?
- Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now!
Veer left!
[SCREAMING]
[HE LAUGHS]
What now?
What do we do?
We die.
Well?
He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.
- I very much doubt it.
- Why?
Because I think he used to work with Mary.
[GUNFIRE]
[SHOUTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE]
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out!
We'll come back later.
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the English woman?
What would you do to a traitor?
Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.
[HE CHUCKLES]
I am an idiot, I know nothing.
Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
That was quite a text you sent me.
What's going on, Sherlock?
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,
I couldn't see what was right under my nose.
Expected a pearl.
Oh, my God, that's a...
Yes, it's an AGRA.
Memory stick, like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.
Who?
I don't know.
We...
We all had one but the others were...
Haven't you even looked at it yet?
I glanced at it but I prefer
- to hear it from you.
- Why?
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.
There were four of us, agents.
Not just agents.
Polite term.
Alex.
Gabriel.
Me.
And Ajay.
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.
We all had one.
Each containing aliases, our background, everything.
We could never be betrayed, because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.
- Who employed you?
- Anyone who paid well.
I mean, we were at the top of our game for years.
And then it all ended.
There was a coup in Georgia.
The British Embassy in Tbilisi was taken over, lots of hostages.
We got the call to go in, get them out.
There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.
- Who from?
- I don't know, just another voice on the phone.
And a codeword.
- Ammo.
- Ammo?
Like ammunition.
We went in, but then something went wrong.
Something went really wrong.
[GUNFIRE, SCREAMING]
That was six years ago.
It feels like forever.
I was the only one that made it out.
No.
What?
I met someone tonight.
Same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.
What, he's alive?
Yeah, very much so.
I don't believe it, this is amazing!
I thought I was the only one,
I thought I was the only one who got out.
Where is he?
I need to see him, now!
Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?
Yeah, of course.
It was our insurance.
Above all, they mustn't fall into enemy hands.
So Ajay survived as well.
And now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide, with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why?
I don't know.
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
[SHE LAUGHS]
Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.
Families fall out.
The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
Well, he's just trying to find me.
He survived, that's all that matters!
I heard it from his own mouth.
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."
Why would he want to kill me?
- He said you betrayed him.
- Oh, no, no, that's insane.
Well, it's what he believes.
[SHE GASPS]
I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.
No, Mary...
You do.
I made a vow, remember?
To look after the three of you.
Sherlock, the Dr.agon-slayer.
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
There's something I think you should read.
What is it?
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.
What are you...?
[HE SNIFFS]
- Mary...
Oh, no!
- There you go.
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.
No.
You just look after them till I get back.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
[CHILD SINGS]
[HE GROANS]
Agra?
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
It is 378km west of the state capital, Lucknow.
What are you, Wikipedia?
- Yes.
- AGRA is an acronym.
Oh, good, I love an acronym.
All the best secret societies have them.
Team of agents, the best.
But you know all that.
Of course I do.
Go on.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.
Indeed?
Well, that's news to me.
Is it?
He's already killed looking for that memory stick.
AGRA always worked for the highest bidder,
I thought that might include you?
- Me?
- Well, I mean the British government, or whatever government you're currently propping up.
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.
They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong.
And that was that, we stopped using freelancers.
- Your initiative?
- My initiative.
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.
I don't like loose ends.
Not on my watch.
There was something else.
A detail.
A codeword.
Ammo?
It's all I've got.
Little enough.
Could you do some digging as a favour?
You don't have many favours left.
Then I'm calling them all in.
And if you can find who's after her and neutralise them, what then?
You think you can go on saving her forever?
Of course.
Is that sentiment talking?
No, it's me.
Difficult to tell the difference these days.
Told you, I made a promise.
A vow.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.
Not on my watch.
MARY: 'My darling, I need to tell you this because you mustn't hate me for going away.'
NEW YORK ACCENT:
Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.
- Can you hear a squeaking?
- No.
Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel.
Why Planes Fail.
- Did you see it?
Oh, truly terrifying.
- Can't say I did.
Swore I would never fly again, yet hear I am!
Everything OK, madam?
No.
No, no, it's not, but then what's the use in complaining?
I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off is all.
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.
Oh, OK.
Relax.
She said relax. [CHUCKLES]
Did you have a nice time in London?
It was OK, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun?
- Did you lose it in the war?
- [SHE LAUGHS]
'I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.
I'm not running, I promise you that,
I just need to do this in my own way.'
Oh, God!
I'm...
I-I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God!
[FLIGHT ATTENDANT BUTTON BEEPS]
- Everything OK, madam?
- I think I'm dying.
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.
God will smile on you.
'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,
I'm sorry, my love.'
I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.
Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of a dice.
I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
I swear I will.'
[LAUGHTER]
Not like this one.
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in!
I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.
Mr. Baker.
Well, that completes the set.
- No, it does not.
- Well, who else am I missing?
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.
How many more times, Mr. Sherlock?
Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.
Oh, hi, Mary.
What concept?
Happy families.
Nice trip?
- How the f...?
- Please, Mary, there is a child present.
- How did you get in here?
- Karim let me in.
Hello.
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Nice to meet you, missus.
No, I mean how did you find me?
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
No, really, though, how?
Every movement I made was entirely random, every new personality just on the roll of a dice!
Mary, no human action is ever truly random.
An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability, mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual, can reduce the number of variables considerably.
I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine a seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.
But they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.
[HE CHUCKLES]
JOKINGLY:
Oh, you bastard!
- ANGRILY:
You bastard!
- I know, but your face!
"The mathematics of probability"?
- You believed that.
- "Feasible variables"?
Yes, I started to run out about then.
In the memory stick!
Yeah, that was my idea.
- AGRA?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
You said it was your initials.
In a way that was true.
In a way?
So many lies.
I'm so sorry.
And I don't just mean you.
What?
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...
You're R?
Rosamund?
Rosamund Mary.
I always liked Mary.
Yeah, me too.
I used to.
I just...
I didn't know what else to do.
You could have stayed, you could have talked to me.
That's what couples are supposed to do.
Work things through.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Mary, I may not be a very good man... but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for,
- most of the time.
- All the time.
You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.
You never judge, you never complain.
I don't deserve you, I...
All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
I will keep you safe.
But it has to be in London.
It's my city, I know the turf.
Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.
Get down!
[RAPID GUNFIRE]
Hello again.
- Ajay?
- Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.
Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.
I thought I was the only one who got out.
How did you find us?
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.
You found her but I found you.
So perhaps not so clever.
And now here we are.
At last.
[HE CHUCKLES] Touche!
Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
She thought I was dead.
I might as well have been.
It was always just the four of us, always, remember?
Oh, yeah.
So why do you want to kill me?
Do you know how long they kept me prisoner?
What they did to me?
They tortured Alex to death.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.
But you?
You, where were you?
That day at the embassy, I escaped.
Ha!
But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
Where were you?
Oh, I got out.
For a while.
Long enough to hide my memory stick.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.
I was loyal, you see.
Loyal to my friends.
But they took me, tortured me.
Not for information.
Not for anything except fun.
They thought I'd give in, die, but I didn't, I lived.
And eventually, they forgot about me rotting in a cell somewhere.
Six years they kept me there.
Until one day I saw my chance.
Oh, and I made them pay.
You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.
Little whispers.
Laughter.
Gossip.
How the clever agents had been betrayed.
Brought down by you!
- Me?
- [TRAIN WHISTLES]
You know I'll kill you too.
You know I will, Ajay.
What, you think I care if I die?
I've Dr.eamed of killing you... every night for six years.
Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.
I swear to you, Ajay.
What did you hear, Ajay?
When you were a prisoner, what exactly did you hear?
What did I hear?
Ammo.
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo."
Ammo.
"Ammo.
Ammo."
We were betrayed!
- And they said it was her?
- That you betrayed us!
They said her name?
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.
No!
No!
'The English woman, that's all he heard.
Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.'
Couldn't this wait until you're back?
No, it's not over.
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed, the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.
There was only a voice on the phone.
'Remember?
And a codeword.'
"Ammo," yes, you said.
How's your Latin, brother dear?
My Latin?
Amo, amas, amat.
I love, you love, he loves.
What...?
Not "Ammo" as in ammunition, but "Amo", meaning?
You'd better be right, Sherlock.
Bloody thing!
What's going on?
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.
What?
'So many lies.
And I don't just mean you.'
- Hello.
- Ah, hello.
- I like your daisy.
- Thank you, yeah.
It's not really me, though, I think.
- No?
- No, no, it's too floral for me.
I'm more of a "knackered with weary old eyes" kind of guy.
Well, I think they're nice.
Nice eyes.
- [HE LAUGHS] Thank you.
- Look...
Look...
I don't normally do this,
- but, um...
- But you're going to.
Yeah.
- What's this?
- This is me.
- Thank you.
Cheers.
- Yeah.
Great.
- Bye!
- Bye.
[HE CHUCKLES]
[PHONE BEEPS]
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
Hmm?
Noticed what?
The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
[BABY CRIES]
- Yeah, can't she?
- Hmm.
I'm coming darling.
I'm coming.
[PHONE BEEPS]
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
-
- Come here...
It's OK.
-
- Do you want a cuddle?
[BABY CONTINUES TO WAIL]
I know.
- Oh, sweetheart.
-
Ssh.
Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you?
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?
Oh, let's go and see Daddy!
Daddy's here.
It's OK, Rosie.
I'll take her.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I may as well get up now.
Hey, baby, it's Daddy.
Your daddy.
Come here, Rose.
Come here, darling, it's all right.
Thank you.
This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.
How many more times?
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.
And you're basing all this on a code name?
On a whispered voice on the telephone?
Come on, Mycroft.
You were the conduit for AGRA.
Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
It was my job.
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
AGRA went in.
- Yes.
- And they were betrayed.
Not by me.
Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.
I promise you,
I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.
You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.
Not one.
Not.
One.
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories?
I'd like to do those.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.
Although she does seem to enjoy them.
Well, I'll have to give that a go.
Got a lot to catch up on.
AJAY: 'You think you understand.
You understand nothing.'
MYCROFT: 'Code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love.'
MARY: 'You'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.
'They know everything.'
'They said it was the English woman.'
'Don't minute any of this.'
'They know everything.'
- You don't make it easy, do you?
- What do you mean?
Well, being... being so perfect.
Mary, I...
I need to tell you...
- [PHONE BEEPS]
- Hang on.
Can you tell me later?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Great.
Well, no, we can't just go.
- Rosie.
- Yeah.
- Er, you go.
- No!
I'll come as soon as I've found someone.
Mr.s Hudson.
- Corfu till Saturday.
Molly?
- Er, yeah, I'll try.
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.
You know that's not going to happen.
If there's more to this case, you need to see it.
Yeah, OK, you win.
'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes.
'Please make your way to the exit.
Thank you.'
Your office said I'd find you here.
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.
We're like them.
Ghostly, living in the shadows.
Predatory?
Well, it depends which side you're on.
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.
Nice location for the final act, couldn't have chosen it better myself.
But then I never could resist a touch of the Dr.amatic.
I just come here to look at the fish.
I knew this would happen one day.
- It's like that old story.
- I really am a very busy man.
Would you mind cutting to the chase?
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
With good reason.
"There was once a merchant, in a famous market in Baghdad."
I really have never liked this story.
I'm just like the merchant in the story,
I thought I could out-run the inevitable.
I've always been looking over my shoulder, always expecting to see the grim figure of...
Death.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hey.
- John?
- On his way.
Let me introduce Ammo.
You were Ammo?
You were the person on the phone that time?
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
Why did you betray us?
Why does anyone do anything?
- Hmm.
- Let me guess, selling secrets?
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.
Worked very well for a few years.
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it.
But...
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.
[SHE CHUCKLES] I couldn't believe my luck!
That bought me a little time.
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
Very handy.
They were always such reliable killers.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.
Lady Smallwood gave the order.
But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.
Seemed to do the trick.
And you thought your troubles were over.
I was tired.
Tired of the mess of it all.
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.
The hostages were killed.
AGRA too.
Or so I thought.
My secret was safe.
But... apparently not.
Just a little peace.
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
A family?
Home?
Really, I understand.
So, just let me get out of here, right?
Let me just walk away.
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.
What do you say?
After what you did?
!
Mary, no!
OK.
London Aquarium.
Yes, now.
I was never a field agent.
I always thought I'd be rather good.
[MARY SCOFFS]
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
Thanks.
- For a secretary.
- What?
It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
- I didn't do this out of jealousy.
- No?
Same old Dr.udge, day in, day out.
Never getting out there where all the excitement was.
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.
Yes, your little flat.
- How do you know?
- Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?
And what are you, widowed or divorced?
Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.
That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.
- Sherlock...
- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.
A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.
- Sherlock, don't.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.
There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
That accounts for the Dr.ink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.
So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.
To prove how good you are.
To make up for the inadequacies of your...
little life.
Well, Mr.s Norbury,
I must admit this is unexpected.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.
All except Sherlock Holmes.
There's no way out.
So it would seem.
You've seen right through me, Mr. Holmes.
It's what I do.
Maybe I can still surprise you.
Now, come on, be sensible.
Hmm, no, I don't think so.
Ah!
Surprise!
[MARY GASPS FOR AIR]
[MARY GROANS]
Everything's fine.
It's going to be OK.
Get an ambulance!
It's all right, it's all right.
- Mary!
- John.
All right, Mary?
Mary?
Stay with me, stay with me.
- Oh, come on...
- No, don't worry.
Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
Come on, Mary.
Mary?
Oh, God.
John, I think this is it.
No, no, no, no.
It's not.
- That's...
- You made me so happy.
You gave me everything I could ever, ever have wanted...
Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.
- Look after Rosie.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.
- Promise me.
- I promise.
- No...
- Yes, I promise.
- Promise me!
- I promise, I promise.
Ssh, ssh.
Hey, Sherlock.
Yes.
I... so like you.
Did I ever say?
Yes, yes, you did.
I'm sorry for... for shooting you that time.
I'm really sorry.
- It's all right.
- I think we're even now, OK?
OK.
- Oh, I think we're...
- Mary, Mary...
- even, definitely even.
- Ssh, ssh.
You were my whole world.
Being Mary Watson... was the only life worth living.
- Mary...
- Thank you.
Mary...
[HE BEWAILS]
Don't you dare!
You made a vow.
You swore it.
[PHONE BEEPS REPEATEDLY]
'You've been having Dr.eaMs..
A recurring Dr.eam?
'
[CLOCK TICKS RHYTHMICALLY]
Do you want to talk about it?
This is a two-way relationship, you know.
[SHE SIGHS]
The whole world has come crashing down around you.
Everything's hopeless.
Irretrievable.
I know that's what you must feel... but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
That's not really my style.
I need to know what to do.
Do?
About John.
[BACK CRACKS, HE GROANS]
Put me through to Sherrinford, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
SOBS:
But nothing will ever be the same again, will it?
I'm afraid it won't.
We'll have to rally round, I expect, do our bit.
Look after little Rosie.
I'm just going to, um... look through these things.
There might be a case.
A case?
Oh, you're not up to it, are you?
Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mr..s Hudson.
Yes.
Yes, I expect you're right.
I'll make some tea, shall I?
- Mr..s Hudson?
- Yes, Sherlock?
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident...
- Yes?
- Would you just say the word Norbury to me?
Would you?
Norbury?
Just that.
I'd be very grateful.
What's this?
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.
Oh, God!
Is that...?
- Must be.
- Oh.
I knew it wouldn't end like this.
I knew Moriarty made plans.
'I thought that would get your attention.
So, this is in case...
In case the day comes.
If you are watching this, I'm probably dead.
I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows?
Nothing's certain, nothing's written.
My old life... it was full of consequences.
The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.
You need to remember that.
So...
I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
Might be the hardest case of your career.
When I'm... gone, if I'm gone...
I need you to do something for me.'
- [BABY GURGLES]
- Hi.
I just wondered how things were going and... if there was anything I could do.
It's, er, it's from John.
- Right.
- You don't need to read it now.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.
He says...
John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...
Yes?
He said he'd... that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Anyone.
[DOOR CLOSES]
'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
When I'm gone, if I'm... gone...
I need you to do something for me.
Save John Watson.
Save him, Sherlock.
Save him.'
'When does the path we walk on lock around our feet?
When does the road become a river with only one destination?
'
'Death waits for us all in Samarra.
But can Samarra be avoided?
'
Go to hell, Sherlock!
- _
- My brother is a murderer.
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.
Oh, do your research.
I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Merry Christmas!
[GUNSHOT]
I'm not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.
You know what happened to the other one.
Miss me?
'Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
'
I've only been gone four minutes.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Is that quite clear?
Don't minute any of this.
Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.
A D notice has been slapped on the entire incident.
Only those within this room, code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love, will ever know the whole truth.
As far as everyone else is concerned, going to the Prime Minister
- and way beyond, Charles Augustus...
- [PHONE KEYBOARD CLICKS]
- Are you tweeting?
!
- No.
Well, that's what it looks like!
Of course I'm not tweeting.
Why would I be tweeting?
- Give me that!
- What?
No!
What are you doing?
!
- Get off!
- Give it here!
- "Back on terra firma."
- Don't read them out.
- "Free as a bird."
- God, you're such a spoilsport.
Will you take this matter seriously, Sherlock?
I am!
What makes you think I'm not taking it seriously?
"#OhWhatABeautifulMorning"
Look, not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death - my death!
And now I'm back, in a nice warm office, with my big brother and...
Are those ginger nuts?
- Oh, God...
- Love ginger nuts.
Our doctor said you were clean.
I am.
Utterly.
No need for stimulants now, remember?
I have work to do.
You're high as a kite!
Natural high, I assure you.
Totally natural.
I'm just... ♪ ..glad to be alive!
♪
What shall we do next?
What's your name?
Vivian.
- What would you do, Vivian?
- Pardon?
Well, it's a lovely day.
Go for a stroll?
Make a paper aeroplane?
Have an ice lolly?
Ice lolly, I suppose.
Ice lolly it is!
- What's your favourite?
- Well, really, I shouldn't...
- Go on.
- Do they still do Mivvies?
- Mr Holmes...
- Yes?
- ...we do need to get on.
- Yes, of course.
[HELICOPTER WHIRS]
'Do your research.
'I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
[GUNSHOT]
- ..sociopath.
- [GUNSHOT]
- ..sociopath.' - [GUNSHOT]
I see.
Who is supposed to have shot him, then?
Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger - that's who.
- That's not what happened at all.
- It is now.
Remarkable.
How did you do it?
We have some very talented people working here.
If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.
That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.
No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.
You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.
You're home and dry.
OK, cheers.
Obviously, there's unfinished business.
Moriarty.
I told you
- Moriarty's dead.
You say he filmed that video message before he died.
Yes.
You also say you know what he's going to do next.
- What does that mean?
- Perhaps that's all there is to it.
Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
No, no, he would never be that disappointing.
He's planned something, something long-term.
Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.
Posthumous revenge.
No, better than that - posthumous game.
We brought you back to deal with this.
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.
Wait?
!
Of course wait.
I'm the target - targets wait.
Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up,
I'll know when it begins.
I always know when the game is on.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because I love it.
There was once a merchant, in the famous market at Baghdad.
- [WATER SLOSHES]
- One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise, and he knew that the stranger was Death.
Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles, to the city of Samarra.
For there he was sure Death could not find him.
But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.
"Very well," said the merchant.
"I give in.
I am yours."
"But tell me, why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"
"Because," said Death,
"I had an appointment with you tonight... ..in Samarra."
If this gets any better, I'm going to get two knives.
Pays to advertise.
- So, what about Moriarty, then?
- Oh, I have a plan.
I'm going to monitor the underworld, every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
So, basically, your plan is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do?
Awesome, isn't it?
He drowned, Mr Holmes.
That's what we thought.
- But when they opened up his lungs...
- Yes?
..sand.
- Superficial.
- [PHONE WHISTLES]
Come back!
It's the wrong thumb.

Sherlock...
It's never twins.
Hopkins, arrest Wilson.
Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.
- 'Wilson?
' 'Lymph nodes?
'
- Sherlock...
Yes, you may have nothing but a limbless torso, but there'll be traces of ink in the lymph nodes under the armpits.
If your mystery corpse had tattoos, the signs will be there.
- 'Bloody hell!
Is that a guess?
'
- I never guess.
- Sherlock...
- 'So, he's the killer?
The canary trainer?
'
- Of course he's the killer.
- 'Didn't see that coming.'
Hm, naturally.
Sherlock, you can't go on spinning plates like this.
That's it!
The place was spinning.
The heart medication you're taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.
Yes, I...
I think so.
Why?
Because the fingerprints on your brother's neck were your own.
- [WATSON CHUCKLES] A jellyfish?
- I know.
You can't arrest a jellyfish.
- You could try.
- We did try.

Let's have a look.
Aw, she's so beautiful.
- Have another go.
- What about a name?
- Catherine.
- Uh, yeah, we've gone off that.
Have we?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Well, you know what I think...
- BOTH:
It's not a girl's name.
Molly, Mrs H, we would love you to be godparents.
- Oh!
Really?
- If you...
That's so lovely.
And, uh... you too, Sherlock?
- You too what?
- Godfather, we'd like you to be godfather.
God is a ludicrous fiction, dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.
Yeah, but there'll be cake.
Will you do it?
I'll get back to you.
Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.
In Christ's name.
Now, what name have you given your daughter?
Rosamund Mary.
Rosamund?
It means "Rose of the world".
Rosie for short.
Didn't you get John's text?
No.
I delete his texts.
I delete any text that begins "Hi."
No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.

All right, good girl, good girl.
Good girl.

- Afternoon.
He says you've got a good one, Greg?
Oh, yeah.
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
God, 50!
Where does it go?
I know for a fact I was only 21 this time last week.
Yeah, well that's impossible.
That was before you met me.
- Well, no, no, there never was...
- "There never was such a time."
She's looking at me disapprovingly again.
No.
She's just jealous.
Yeah, well, I think we both are.
[PHONE VIBRATES]
- Oh...
- No, no, David.
- Come on, you promised.
- No, it's...
Oh, no...
Oh, it's a Skype call.
Oh!
Then it must be Charlie.
At least he's phoning, I suppose.
Oh, look!
Hello!
'Hey, Dad.
Happy birthday.
Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?
'
No!
Picture's frozen!
'Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you.'
Why is it rubbish?
Where are you?
How is he?
Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.
MAN:
David?
Come on!
OK, no, hang on a sec, I'll find somewhere quieter.
So, Charlie, where are you?
Are you there?
- 'Sorry, I'm here.
I'm just a bit...'
- Are you all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
Altitude?
'I'm in Tibet.
Didn't you see the mountains?
'
Never mind mountains.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.
- 'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?
'
- What?
'Could you just check something on my car?
'
Your car?
'To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe
I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet.
- 'Could you take a photo and send it?
'
- Uh, yes, I can do that.
All done.
Have you got it?
Charlie?
LESTRADE:
A week later...
Yeah?
...something really weird happens.
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed, the cops are chasing him, and he turns into the drive of the Welsborough house to try and get away.
Unfortunately...
The drunk guy survived, they managed to pull him out, but when they put the fire out and examined the parked car...
Whose body?
Charlie Welsborough, the son.
- What?
- The son who was in Tibet.
DNA all checks out.
Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.
[SHERLOCK CHUCKLES]
- Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
- Have you got a lab report?
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.
- The seats?
- Yes, the car seats.
Made of vinyl.
Two different types of vinyl present.
Was it his own car?
Yeah, not flash - he was a student.
- Well, that's suggestive.
- Why?
- Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
- Yeah, right?
- There's something else.
- Yes?
According to this,
Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.
What?
The body in the car, dead for a week.
Oh, this is a good one.
Is it my birthday?
You want help?
- Yes, please.
OK.
- One condition.
Take all the credit.
It gets boring if I just solve them all.
Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.
He's got a point.
Which makes me look like some kind of prima donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do!
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.
- Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
- Definitely a sore spot.
So you take all the glory, thanks...
- OK!
- ...thanks all the same.
Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?
It's driving me nuts.
Anything you say, Giles.
Just kidding.
HE MOUTHS:
What's his name?
HE MOUTHS:
Greg.
What?
Greg.
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?
Not a clue.
It's just you normally say that at this point.
Hmm.
Well, then, let's hope you solve your little problem, Greg.
- Hear that?
- I know.
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood?
- Oh, good, great.
Yeah, amazing.
- Getting any sleep?
- Christ, no.
You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.
- Must feel very different...
- Sorry, what?
Yes, well, you know how it is.
All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.
- Are you two having a little joke?
- Never a word of thanks.
Can't even tell people's faces apart.
This is a joke, isn't it?
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever.
You're so, so clever."
- Is it about me?
- I think he needs winding.
You know, I think that really might be it.
No, don't get it.
Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect, so go easy on them, yeah?
- You know me.
- MARY: 'Hey, hello.'
Yeah.
Got them, don't worry.
Pampers, the cream you can't get from Boots.
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now?
- At the dead boy's house?
- Yeah.
'And what does he think?
Any theories?
'
Well, I texted you the details.
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.
- Hey!
- How do you know about that?
'Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.'
- WHISPERING:
They know everything!
- 'Solved it, then?
'
I'm working on it.
'Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.'
- Pig!
- Keep trying.
'So, what about it, then?
'What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it?
'And what are you going to call this one?
'
Oh, the Ghost Driver.
- Don't give it a title.
- People like the titles.
- They hate the titles.
- Give the people what they want.
No, never do that - people are stupid.
Uh, some people.
'All people are stupid.
Most people.'
'Bizarre enough though, isn't it, to be him?
'
I mean, it's right up your strasse.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.
- Son.
- Son!
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.
If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.
Well, I believe that I can.
DISTORTED:
But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
Sherlock?
Mr Holmes?
Sorry, you were saying?
Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
I don't think we'll ever get over this.
No.
Shouldn't think so.
So sorry, will you excuse me a moment?
I just...
I'll...
I'll just, um...
Ahem.
- Now what's wrong?
- Not sure, I just...
By the pricking of my thumbs.
Seriously?
You?
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.
They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.
What is this?
Oh, it's a sort of shrine, I suppose, really.
Bit of a fan of Mrs T.
A big hero of mine when I was getting started.
Right, yes.
- Who?
- What?
- Who...?
Who was this?
- Are you serious?
- Sherlock...
- It's...
It's Margaret Thatcher, the first female Prime Minister of this country.
Right.
- Prime Minister?
Right.
- Leader of the Government.
- Female?
- For God's sake!
You know perfectly well who she is.
Why are you playing for time?
It's the gap, look at the gap.
It's wrong.
Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed.
The whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.
This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been in, this picture is straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.
- Something's missing from here, but only recently.
- Yes, a...
- Plaster bust... - plaster bust.
- Oh, for God's sake!
It got broken.
What the hell has this got to do with Charlie?
- Rug!
- What?
Well, how could it get broken?
The only place for it to fall is the floor and there is a big thick rug.
- Does it matter?
- Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.
- It is worth letting him do this.
- Is your friend quite mad?
No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
We found the remains out there in the porch.
- The porch where we came in?
- How anybody could hate her so much they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness...
I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.
Why didn't he smash all the others?
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.
Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.
- And if there's nothing...
- I know what happened to your son.
You do?
It's quite simple, superficial, to be blunt.
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness?
- Well, yes.
- And the porch where it was smashed,
I noticed the motion sensor was damaged,
- so I assume it's permanently lit.
- How did you notice that?
I lack the arrogance to ignore details.
I'm not the police.
- So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.
- Exactly.
- Why?
- Don't know.
Wouldn't be fun if I knew.
Mr Holmes, please!
It was your 50th birthday, Mr Welsborough, of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
- After all, he was in Tibet.
- Yes.
- No.
- No?

It's a Skype call.
The trick was meant to be a surprise.
- A trick?
- Obviously.
Could you take a photo and send it?
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.
Well, good enough.
Effectively a costume.
You're joking?
No, I'm not.
All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
- Oh, my God!
- Surprise!
That's when it happened.
I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.
You said he'd felt unwell?
You all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
He died there and then.
No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained, in the driver's seat, hidden, until...
When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who'd been sitting there, quite dead, for a week.
Oh, God!
Poor kid.
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.
This is where it was smashed.
- That was amazing.
- What?
The car, the kid.
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?
I can't stand it, never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
What kind of a life would that be?
Besides, I have the strangest feeling...
Miss me?
- That's mine.
You two take a... bus.
- Why?
I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.
The Mall, please.
- I met her once.
- Thatcher?
Rather arrogant, I thought.
- You thought that?
!
- Ha, I know.
Why am I looking at this?
That's her, John and Mary's baby.
Oh, I see, yes.
Looks very... fully functioning.
Is that really the best you can do?
Sorry, I've never been very good with them.
- Babies?
- Humans.
Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?
Any interest in her?
Why on earth would he?
I don't know.
You tell me.
In the last year of his life,
James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over 70 assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias,
which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.
It's a pearl - get another one.
There's something important about this.
I'm sure.
Maybe it's Moriarty.
Maybe it's not.
[WATER SLOSHES]
But something's coming.
Are you having a premonition, brother mine?
The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other.
What we call premonition is just movement of the web.
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable.
As inevitable as mathematics.
Appointment In Samarra.
I'm sorry?
The merchant who can't outrun Death.
You always hated that story as a child.
Less keen on predestination back then.
I'm not sure I like it now.
You wrote your own version, as I remember.
Appointment In Sumatra.
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.
Goodnight, Mycroft.
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.
- Keep me informed.
- Of what?
Absolutely no idea.
'Ammo!
'
[MAN SHUDDERS]
- Oh, hi, Stella.
- Greg.
You, uh...?
- Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...
- Right, right, right...
Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?
It's nothing.
I mean it's nothing serious.
- No, no.
- I just pop round every now and again for a chat.
Yeah, of course.
I mean he loves a really tricky case.
Yeah, he does!
So what you here for?
Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so...
The Borgia Pearl?
They still after that, are they?
Yeah.
So, how did you two first meet?
Oh, well, there was a case about, um, ten years ago.
Nobody could figure it out.
There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.
- Oh, yeah?
How did she die?
- Hypothermia.
What?
I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...
Will you two please keep it down?
!
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?
You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.
I was a carpenter.
Like me dad.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
How the hell...?
Ah... e-cigarettes.
Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.
If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.
But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last.
Anything to add, John?
- John?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.
- What is that?
- That is... me.
Well, it's a me substitute.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You know I value your little contributions.
Yeah?
It's been there since nine this morning.
- Has it?
Where were you?
- Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.
What about my girlfriend?
- What?
- You said I had an ex...
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.
The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.
I...
I thought you'd done something clever.
Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?
[SHERLOCK INHALES DEEPLY]
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
What do you mean?
Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
- Well...
- You thought she was having an affair.
I'm afraid it's far worse than that, your wife is a spy.
- What?
- That's right.
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy, across the road from your flat.
Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy, as part of an official state visit.
As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.
This drug will render the President entirely susceptible to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty.
What?
Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III.
- Are you serious?
- No, of course not.
His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.
I don't!
- Just the bras.
- Get out.
So, what's this all about, then?
- Having fun.
- Fun?
- While I can.
- Mm-hmm.
[KNOCK AT DOOR]
- Uh, Sherlock...
- Borgia Pearl.
Boring.
Go!
- But...
- Go!
- This had better be good.
- Oh, I think you'll like it.
That is the bust, isn't it?
The one that was broken.
No, it's another one, different owner.
Different part of town.
You were right, this is a thing.
Something's going on.
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be pleased.
- I am pleased.
- You don't look pleased.
This is my game face.
And the game is on.
Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one.
- One belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan.
- Identical busts?
Yeah, and this one to a Dr Barnicot in Holborn.
Three in total.
God knows who'd want to do something like this.
Yeah, but some people have that complex, don't they?
An idee fixe.
They obsess over one thing and they can't let it go.
No, no good.
There were other images of Margaret...
Margaret...?
You know who she is.
...Thatcher, present at the first break-in.
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?
Ooh!
- What?
- Blood.
Quite a bit of it, too.
Was there any injury at the crime scene?
Nah.
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.
- Come on.
- Holborn?
Lambeth!
- Lambeth?
Why?
- To see Toby.
Ah, right.
Who?
- You'll see.
- Right, are you coming?
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.
- Who told you?
- The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.
- Have a good time.
- I will.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
- What?
- She's not the one.
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.
How do you work all that out?
She's got three children in Rio that he doesn't know about.
Are you just making this up?
- Possibly.
- Who's Toby?
There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker, one of the world's best.
Got himself into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago.
He hacked into the Pentagon security system, and I managed to get him off the charge.
Therefore he owes me a favour.
So, how does that help us?
- What?
- Toby the hacker?
- Toby's not the hacker.
- What?
- All right, Craig?
- All right, Sherlock?
Craig's got a dog.
So I see.
Good boy!
Hiya!
Mary?
What are you...?
No, we, we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case.
No, exactly.
So... don't wait up.
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Hey.
Mary, what are you doing here?
She's better at this than you.
- Better?
- So I texted her.
Hang on, Mary's better than me?
Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.
Of course she's better.
Yeah, OK.
Nothing personal.
What, so I'm supposed to just go home now, am I?
What do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?
- John or the dog?
- Ha-ha, that's funny!
- John.
- Well...
He's handy and loyal.
- That's hilarious.
- Is it too early for a divorce?
Oh.
Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge?
Keep up, he's fast.
- He's not moving.
- He's thinking.
He's really not moving.
Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.
You just like this dog, don't you?
- Well, I like you.
- He's still not moving.
- Fascinating.
- Oh!
[SHE CLEARS HER THROAT]
Well, what do you make of it?
- They were looking for something.
- Yes, but it wasn't a burglar, they came specifically for that Thatcher bust.
Why?
[DOG SNIFFS]
[DOG WHINES]
Clever.
Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail,
- where would you go?
- Like hiding a tree in a forest.
Or blood in a butcher's.
Never mind, Toby, better luck next time, hmm?
This is it, though.
This is the one, I can feel it.
Not Moriarty?
It has to be him.
It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.
It's designed to beguile me, tease me and lure me in.
At last, a noose for me to put my neck into.
You should have seen the state of the front room.
- It was like The Exorcist.
- Huh.
Was Rosie's head spinning round?
- No.
Just the projectile vomiting.
- Nice!
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
- Hmm?
Noticed what?
- The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
[BABY CRIES]
Yeah, can't she?
I'm coming, darling.
Mummy's coming.
LOVINGLY:
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here.
Have you heard of that thing?
In Germany?
You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.
Ostalgie.
People who missed the old days under the communists.
- People are weird, aren't they?
- Hmm.
According to this, there's quite a market for Cold War memorabilia.
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit?
Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.
Yes, fascinating.
Irrelevant.
Where exactly did they come from?
I've got into the records of the suppliers, Gelder and Co.
Seems they're from Georgia.
Where exactly?
Tbilisi.
Batch of six.
One to Welsborough.
One to Hassan.
One to Dr Barnicot.
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.
One to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.
Lestrade?
Another one?
- 'Yeah.'
- Harker or Sandeford?
Harker.
And it's murder this time.
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.
_
_
Defensive wounds on her face and hands, throat cut.
Sharp blade.
The same thing inside the house?
The bust?
- Two of them this time.
- Interesting.
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago.
- Limited edition of six.
- And now someone's wandering about destroying them all.
Makes no sense.
What's the point?
No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.
- Yes, it is.
- Well, it is, but it's not the point.
I've been slow, far too slow.
Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind...
Slow but lucky, very lucky.
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.
Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.
Congratulations, by the way.
- I'm sorry?
- Well, you're about to solve a big one.
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
- Yeah, until then, basically.
[WATER SPLASHING]
That's enough now, love.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.
And you need to get to bed.
Come on.
Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?
You were on the run.
Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying, it's clever.
Very clever.
But now you've met me and you're not so clever, are you?
Who are you?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.
Argh!
You're out of time.
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
- Who?
I know it's him.
It must be him.
You think you understand.
You understand nothing.
Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don't we just enjoy the moment?
Let me present Interpol's number one case.
Too tough for them, too boring for me.
The Black Pearl of the Borgias!
It's not possible!
How could she...?
!
Everything about who I was is on there.
The problems of your past are your business.
The problems of your future are my privilege.
I don't understand.
She...
She destroyed it.
She?
You know her!
You do, don't you?
You know the bitch?
!
She betrayed me.
Betrayed us all.
Mary.
This is about Mary?
Is that what she's calling herself now, eh?
- 'Armed police, you're surrounded!
'
- Give it to me.
YELLS:
Give it to me!
'Come out slowly, I want to see your hands above your head.'
Nobody shoots me!
Anyone shoots, I kill this man.
'Lay down your weapon.
Do it now!
'
I'm leaving this place.
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.
'Lay down your weapon.'
You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
Tell her she's a dead woman.
She's a dead woman walking.
She's my friend.
And she's under my protection.
Who are you?
I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.
Who's Sherlock Holmes?
Not a policeman.
[ALARM BLARES]
What do you think?
Mate in two?
Don't antagonise them, darling.
Oh, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.
Everything palls.
They'll send someone soon.
They?
Who are they?
Seems to me we put an awful lot of faith in they.
Well, I've got something they would dearly love, if only we could get out of here.
I've got Ammo.
Ammo?
- MARY:
Madame Ambassador.
- What took you so long?
- Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now!
Veer left!
[SCREAMING]
[HE LAUGHS]
What now?
What do we do?
We die.
Well?
He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.
- I very much doubt it.
- Why?
Because I think he used to work with Mary.
[GUNFIRE]
[SHOUTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE]
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out!
We'll come back later.
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the English woman?
What would you do to a traitor?
Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.
[HE CHUCKLES]
I am an idiot, I know nothing.
Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
That was quite a text you sent me.
What's going on, Sherlock?
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,
I couldn't see what was right under my nose.
Expected a pearl.
Oh, my God, that's a...
Yes, it's an AGRA.
Memory stick, like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.
Who?
I don't know.
We...
We all had one but the others were...
Haven't you even looked at it yet?
I glanced at it but I prefer
- to hear it from you.
- Why?
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.
There were four of us, agents.
Not just agents.
Polite term.
Alex.
Gabriel.
Me.
And Ajay.
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.
We all had one.
Each containing aliases, our background, everything.
We could never be betrayed, because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.
- Who employed you?
- Anyone who paid well.
I mean, we were at the top of our game for years.
And then it all ended.
There was a coup in Georgia.
The British Embassy in Tbilisi was taken over, lots of hostages.
We got the call to go in, get them out.
There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.
- Who from?
- I don't know, just another voice on the phone.
And a codeword.
- Ammo.
- Ammo?
Like ammunition.
We went in, but then something went wrong.
Something went really wrong.
[GUNFIRE, SCREAMING]
That was six years ago.
It feels like forever.
I was the only one that made it out.
No.
What?
I met someone tonight.
Same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.
What, he's alive?
Yeah, very much so.
I don't believe it, this is amazing!
I thought I was the only one,
I thought I was the only one who got out.
Where is he?
I need to see him, now!
Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?
Yeah, of course.
It was our insurance.
Above all, they mustn't fall into enemy hands.
So Ajay survived as well.
And now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide, with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why?
I don't know.
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
[SHE LAUGHS]
Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.
Families fall out.
The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
Well, he's just trying to find me.
He survived, that's all that matters!
I heard it from his own mouth.
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."
Why would he want to kill me?
- He said you betrayed him.
- Oh, no, no, that's insane.
Well, it's what he believes.
[SHE GASPS]
I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.
No, Mary...
You do.
I made a vow, remember?
To look after the three of you.
Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
There's something I think you should read.
What is it?
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.
What are you...?
[HE SNIFFS]
- Mary...
Oh, no!
- There you go.
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.
No.
You just look after them till I get back.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
[CHILD SINGS]
[HE GROANS]
Agra?
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
It is 378km west of the state capital, Lucknow.
What are you, Wikipedia?
- Yes.
- AGRA is an acronym.
Oh, good, I love an acronym.
All the best secret societies have them.
Team of agents, the best.
But you know all that.
Of course I do.
Go on.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.
Indeed?
Well, that's news to me.
Is it?
He's already killed looking for that memory stick.
AGRA always worked for the highest bidder,
I thought that might include you?
- Me?
- Well, I mean the British government, or whatever government you're currently propping up.
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.
They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong.
And that was that, we stopped using freelancers.
- Your initiative?
- My initiative.
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.
I don't like loose ends.
Not on my watch.
There was something else.
A detail.
A codeword.
Ammo?
It's all I've got.
Little enough.
Could you do some digging as a favour?
You don't have many favours left.
Then I'm calling them all in.
And if you can find who's after her and neutralise them, what then?
You think you can go on saving her forever?
Of course.
Is that sentiment talking?
No, it's me.
Difficult to tell the difference these days.
Told you, I made a promise.
A vow.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.
Not on my watch.
MARY: 'My darling, I need to tell you this because you mustn't hate me for going away.'
NEW YORK ACCENT:
Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.
- Can you hear a squeaking?
- No.
Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel.
Why Planes Fail.
- Did you see it?
Oh, truly terrifying.
- Can't say I did.
Swore I would never fly again, yet hear I am!
Everything OK, madam?
No.
No, no, it's not, but then what's the use in complaining?
I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off is all.
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.
Oh, OK.
Relax.
She said relax. [CHUCKLES]
Did you have a nice time in London?
It was OK, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun?
- Did you lose it in the war?
- [SHE LAUGHS]
'I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.
I'm not running, I promise you that,
I just need to do this in my own way.'
Oh, God!
I'm...
I-I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God!
[FLIGHT ATTENDANT BUTTON BEEPS]
- Everything OK, madam?
- I think I'm dying.
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.
God will smile on you.
'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,
I'm sorry, my love.'
I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.
Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of a dice.
I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
I swear I will.'
[LAUGHTER]
Not like this one.
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in!
I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.
Mr Baker.
Well, that completes the set.
- No, it does not.
- Well, who else am I missing?
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?
Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.
Oh, hi, Mary.
What concept?
Happy families.
Nice trip?
- How the f...?
- Please, Mary, there is a child present.
- How did you get in here?
- Karim let me in.
Hello.
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Nice to meet you, missus.
No, I mean how did you find me?
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
No, really, though, how?
Every movement I made was entirely random, every new personality just on the roll of a dice!
Mary, no human action is ever truly random.
An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability, mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual, can reduce the number of variables considerably.
I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine a seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.
But they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.
[HE CHUCKLES]
JOKINGLY:
Oh, you bastard!
- ANGRILY:
You bastard!
- I know, but your face!
"The mathematics of probability"?
- You believed that.
- "Feasible variables"?
Yes, I started to run out about then.
In the memory stick!
Yeah, that was my idea.
- AGRA?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
You said it was your initials.
In a way that was true.
In a way?
So many lies.
I'm so sorry.
And I don't just mean you.
What?
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...
You're R?
Rosamund?
Rosamund Mary.
I always liked Mary.
Yeah, me too.
I used to.
I just...
I didn't know what else to do.
You could have stayed, you could have talked to me.
That's what couples are supposed to do.
Work things through.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Mary, I may not be a very good man but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for,
- most of the time.
- All the time.
You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.
You never judge, you never complain.
I don't deserve you, I...
All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
I will keep you safe.
But it has to be in London.
It's my city, I know the turf.
Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.
Get down!
[RAPID GUNFIRE]
Hello again.
- Ajay?
- Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.
Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.
I thought I was the only one who got out.
How did you find us?
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.
You found her but I found you.
So perhaps not so clever.
And now here we are.
At last.
[HE CHUCKLES] Touche!
Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
She thought I was dead.
I might as well have been.
It was always just the four of us, always, remember?
Oh, yeah.
So why do you want to kill me?
Do you know how long they kept me prisoner?
What they did to me?
They tortured Alex to death.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.
But you?
You, where were you?
That day at the embassy, I escaped.
Ha!
But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
Where were you?
Oh, I got out.
For a while.
Long enough to hide my memory stick.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.
I was loyal, you see.
Loyal to my friends.
But they took me, tortured me.
Not for information.
Not for anything except fun.
They thought I'd give in, die, but I didn't, I lived.
And eventually, they forgot about me rotting in a cell somewhere.
Six years they kept me there.
Until one day I saw my chance.
Oh, and I made them pay.
You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.
Little whispers.
Laughter.
Gossip.
How the clever agents had been betrayed.
Brought down by you!
- Me?
- [TRAIN WHISTLES]
You know I'll kill you too.
You know I will, Ajay.
What, you think I care if I die?
I've dreamed of killing you every night for six years.
Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.
I swear to you, Ajay.
What did you hear, Ajay?
When you were a prisoner, what exactly did you hear?
What did I hear?
Ammo.
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo."
We were betrayed!
- And they said it was her?
- That you betrayed us!
They said her name?
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.
No!
No!
'The English woman, that's all he heard.
Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.'
Couldn't this wait until you're back?
No, it's not over.
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed, the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.
There was only a voice on the phone.
'Remember?
And a codeword.'
"Ammo," yes, you said.
How's your Latin, brother dear?
My Latin?
Amo, amas, amat.
I love, you love, he loves.
What...?
Not "Ammo" as in ammunition, but "Amo", meaning?
You'd better be right, Sherlock.
Bloody thing!
What's going on?
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.
What?
'So many lies.
And I don't just mean you.'
- Hello.
- Ah, hello.
- I like your daisy.
- Thank you, yeah.
It's not really me, though, I think.
- No?
- No, no, it's too floral for me.
I'm more of a "knackered with weary old eyes" kind of guy.
Well, I think they're nice.
Nice eyes.
- [HE LAUGHS] Thank you.
- Look...
Look...
I don't normally do this,
- but, um...
- But you're going to.
Yeah.
- What's this?
- This is me.
- Thank you.
Cheers.
- Yeah.
Great.
- Bye!
- Bye.
[HE CHUCKLES]

[PHONE BEEPS]
_
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
Hmm?
Noticed what?
The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
[BABY CRIES]
- Yeah, can't she?
- Hmm.
I'm coming darling.
I'm coming.
[PHONE BEEPS]
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
- _
- Come here...
It's OK.
_
- _
- Do you want a cuddle?
[BABY CONTINUES TO WAIL]
_
I know.
- Oh, sweetheart.
- _
_
Ssh.
Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you?
_
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?
Oh, let's go and see Daddy!
Daddy's here.
It's OK, Rosie.
I'll take her.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I may as well get up now.
Hey, baby, it's Daddy.
Your daddy.
Come here, Rose.
Come here, darling, it's all right.
Thank you.
_
_
This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.
How many more times?
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.
And you're basing all this on a code name?
On a whispered voice on the telephone?
Come on, Mycroft.
You were the conduit for AGRA.
Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
It was my job.
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
AGRA went in.
- Yes.
- And they were betrayed.
Not by me.
Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.
I promise you,
I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.
You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.
Not one.
Not.
One.
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories?
I'd like to do those.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.
Although she does seem to enjoy them.
Well, I'll have to give that a go.
Got a lot to catch up on.
AJAY: 'You think you understand.
You understand nothing.'
MYCROFT: 'Code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love.'
MARY: 'You'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.
'They know everything.'
'They said it was the English woman.'
'Don't minute any of this.'
'They know everything.'
- You don't make it easy, do you?
- What do you mean?
Well, being... being so perfect.
Mary, I...
I need to tell you...
- [PHONE BEEPS]
- Hang on.
Can you tell me later?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Great.
Well, no, we can't just go.
- Rosie.
- Yeah.
- Er, you go.
- No!
I'll come as soon as I've found someone.
Mrs Hudson.
- Corfu till Saturday.
Molly?
- Er, yeah, I'll try.
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.
You know that's not going to happen.
If there's more to this case, you need to see it.
Yeah, OK, you win.
'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes.
'Please make your way to the exit.
Thank you.'
Your office said I'd find you here.
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.
We're like them.
Ghostly, living in the shadows.
Predatory?
Well, it depends which side you're on.
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.
Nice location for the final act, couldn't have chosen it better myself.
But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.
I just come here to look at the fish.
I knew this would happen one day.
- It's like that old story.
- I really am a very busy man.
Would you mind cutting to the chase?
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
With good reason.
"There was once a merchant, in a famous market in Baghdad."
I really have never liked this story.
I'm just like the merchant in the story,
I thought I could out-run the inevitable.
I've always been looking over my shoulder, always expecting to see the grim figure of...
Death.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hey.
- John?
- On his way.
Let me introduce Ammo.
You were Ammo?
You were the person on the phone that time?
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
Why did you betray us?
Why does anyone do anything?
- Hmm.
- Let me guess, selling secrets?
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.
Worked very well for a few years.
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it.
But...
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.
[SHE CHUCKLES] I couldn't believe my luck!
That bought me a little time.
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
Very handy.
They were always such reliable killers.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.
Lady Smallwood gave the order.
But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.
Seemed to do the trick.
And you thought your troubles were over.
I was tired.
Tired of the mess of it all.
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.
The hostages were killed.
AGRA too.
Or so I thought.
My secret was safe.
But... apparently not.
Just a little peace.
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
A family?
Home?
Really, I understand.
So, just let me get out of here, right?
Let me just walk away.
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.
What do you say?
After what you did?
!
Mary, no!
OK.
London Aquarium.
Yes, now.
I was never a field agent.
I always thought I'd be rather good.
[MARY SCOFFS]
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
Thanks.
- For a secretary.
- What?
It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
- I didn't do this out of jealousy.
- No?
Same old drudge, day in, day out.
Never getting out there where all the excitement was.
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.
Yes, your little flat.
- How do you know?
- Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?
And what are you, widowed or divorced?
Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.
That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.
- Sherlock...
- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.
A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.
- Sherlock, don't.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.
There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
That accounts for the drink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.
So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.
To prove how good you are.
To make up for the inadequacies of your...
little life.
Well, Mrs Norbury,
I must admit this is unexpected.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.
All except Sherlock Holmes.
There's no way out.
So it would seem.
You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.
It's what I do.
Maybe I can still surprise you.
Now, come on, be sensible.
Hmm, no, I don't think so.
Ah!
Surprise!
[MARY GASPS FOR AIR]
[MARY GROANS]
Everything's fine.
It's going to be OK.
Get an ambulance!
It's all right, it's all right.
- Mary!
- John.
All right, Mary?
Mary?
Stay with me, stay with me.
- Oh, come on...
- No, don't worry.
Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
Come on, Mary.
Mary?
Oh, God.
John, I think this is it.
No, no, no, no.
It's not.
- That's...
- You made me so happy.
You gave me everything I could ever, ever have wanted...
Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.
- Look after Rosie.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.
- Promise me.
- I promise.
- No...
- Yes, I promise.
- Promise me!
- I promise, I promise.
Ssh, ssh.
Hey, Sherlock.
Yes.
I... so like you.
Did I ever say?
Yes, yes, you did.
I'm sorry for... for shooting you that time.
I'm really sorry.
It's all right.
I think we're even now, OK?
OK.
- Oh, I think we're...
- Mary, Mary...
- ...even, definitely even.
- Ssh, ssh.
You were my whole world.
Being Mary Watson was the only life worth living.
- Mary...
- Thank you.
Mary...
[HE BEWAILS]
Don't you dare!
You made a vow.
You swore it.
[PHONE BEEPS REPEATEDLY]
'You've been having dreams.
A recurring dream?
'
[CLOCK TICKS RHYTHMICALLY]
Do you want to talk about it?
This is a two-way relationship, you know.
[SHE SIGHS]
The whole world has come crashing down around you.
Everything's hopeless.
Irretrievable.
I know that's what you must feel but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
That's not really my style.
I need to know what to do.
Do?
About John.
[BACK CRACKS, HE GROANS]
Put me through to Sherrinford, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
SOBS:
But nothing will ever be the same again, will it?
I'm afraid it won't.
We'll have to rally round, I expect, do our bit.
Look after little Rosie.
I'm just going to, um look through these things.
There might be a case.
A case?
Oh, you're not up to it, are you?
Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.
Yes.
Yes, I expect you're right.
I'll make some tea, shall I?
- Mrs Hudson?
- Yes, Sherlock?
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident...
- Yes?
- ...would you just say the word Norbury to me?
Would you?
Norbury?
Just that.
I'd be very grateful.
What's this?
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.
Oh, God!
Is that...?
- Must be.
- Oh.
I knew it wouldn't end like this.
I knew Moriarty made plans.
'I thought that would get your attention.
So, this is in case...
In case the day comes.
If you are watching this, I'm probably dead.
I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows?
Nothing's certain, nothing's written.
My old life it was full of consequences.
The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.
You need to remember that.
So I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
Might be the hardest case of your career.
When I'm... gone, if I'm gone I need you to do something for me.'
- [BABY GURGLES]
- Hi.
I just wondered how things were going and if there was anything I could do.
It's, er, it's from John.
- Right.
- You don't need to read it now.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.
He says...
John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...
Yes?
He said he'd that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Anyone.
[DOOR CLOSES]
'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
When I'm gone, if I'm... gone I need you to do something for me.
Save John Watson.
Save him, Sherlock.
Save him.'
'When does the path we walk on lock around our feet?
When does the road become a river with only one destination?
'
'Death waits for us all in Samarra.
But can Samarra be avoided?
'
Go to hell, Sherlock!
My brother is a murderer.
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.
Oh, do your research.
I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Merry Christmas!
I'm not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.
You know what happened to the other one.
Miss me?
"Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?"
I've only been gone four minutes.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Is that quite clear?
Don't minute any of this.
Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.
A D notice has been slapped on the entire incident.
Only those within this room, code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love, will ever know the whole truth.
As far as everyone else is concerned, going to the Prime Minister and way beyond, Charles Augustus...
- Are you tweeting?
!
- No.
Well, that's what it looks like!
Of course I'm not tweeting.
Why would I be tweeting?
- Give me that!
- What?
No!
What are you doing?
!
- Get off!
- Give it here!
- "Back on Terra firma."
- Don't read them out.
- "Free as a bird."
- God, you're such a spoilsport.
Will you take this matter seriously, Sherlock?
I am!
What makes you think I'm not taking it seriously?
"#OhWhatABeautifulMorning"
Look, not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death - my death!
And now I'm back, in a nice warm office, with my big brother and...
Are those ginger nuts?
- Oh, God...
- Love ginger nuts.
Our doctor said you were clean.
I am.
Utterly.
No need for stimulants now, remember?
I have work to do.
You're high as a kite!
Natural high, I assure you.
Totally natural.
I'm just... ♪ ...glad to be alive!
♪
What shall we do next?
What's your name?
Vivian.
- What would you do, Vivian?
- Pardon?
Well, it's a lovely day.
Go for a stroll?
Make a paper aeroplane?
Have an ice lolly?
Ice lolly, I suppose.
Ice lolly it is!
- What's your favourite?
- Well, really, I shouldn't...
- Go on.
- Do they still do Mivvies?
- Mr Holmes...
- Yes?
- ...we do need to get on.
- Yes, of course.
Do your research.
"I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
...sociopath.
I see.
Who is supposed to have shot him, then?
Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger - that's who.
- That's not what happened at all.
- It is now.
Remarkable.
How did you do it?
We have some very talented people working here.
If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.
That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.
No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.
You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.
You're home and dry.
OK, cheers.
Obviously, there's unfinished business.
Moriarty.
I told you
- Moriarty's dead.
You say he filmed that video message before he died.
Yes.
You also say you know what he's going to do next.
- What does that mean?
- Perhaps that's all there is to it.
Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
No, no, he would never be that disappointing.
He's planned something, something long-term.
Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.
Posthumous revenge.
No, better than that - posthumous game.
We brought you back to deal with this.
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.
Wait?
!
Of course wait.
I'm the target - targets wait.
Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up,
I'll know when it begins.
I always know when the game is on.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because I love it.
There was once a merchant, in the famous market at Baghdad.
One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise, and he knew that the stranger was Death.
Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles, to the city of Samarra.
For there he was sure Death could not find him.
But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.
"Very well," said the merchant.
"I give in.
I am yours."
"But tell me, why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"
"Because," said Death,
"I had an appointment with you tonight in Samarra."
If this gets any better, I'm going to get two knives.
Pays to advertise.
- So, what about Moriarty, then?
- Oh, I have a plan.
I'm going to monitor the underworld, every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
So, basically, your plan is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do?
Awesome, isn't it?
He drowned, Mr Holmes.
That's what we thought.
- But when they opened up his lungs...
- Yes?
...sand.
Superficial.
Come back!
It's the wrong thumb.
"The Duplicate Man How could Dennis Parkinson be in two places at the same time?
And murder one of them?"
Sherlock...
It's never twins.
Hopkins, arrest Wilson.
Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.
- "Wilson?" "Lymph nodes?"
- Sherlock...
Yes, you may have nothing but a limbless torso, but there'll be traces of ink in the lymph nodes under the armpits.
If your mystery corpse had tattoos, the signs will be there.
- "Bloody hell!
Is that a guess?"
- I never guess.
- Sherlock...
- "So, he's the killer?
The canary trainer?"
- Of course he's the killer.
- "Didn't see that coming."
Hm, naturally.
Sherlock, you can't go on spinning plates like this.
That's it!
The place was spinning.
The heart medication you're taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.
Yes, I...
I think so.
Why?
Because the fingerprints on your brother's neck were your own.
- A jellyfish?
- I know.
You can't arrest a jellyfish.
- You could try.
- We did try.
Oh...
- Oh, God.
- Mary?
59 missed calls.
We're in a lot of trouble.
Ow!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Relax, it's got two syllables...
I'm a nurse, darling...
I think I know what to do!
- Come on, then...
- Re...
lax!
No, just drive, please, God, just drive!
God, drive!
Sherlock
- Mary!
That's it, Mary... re...
- Don't you start!
- ...
lax.
John, John...
I think you have to pull over!
- Mary, Mary...
- Pull over!
Oh, my God!
Has that come out?
They never come out when I take them.
Let's have a look.
Aw, she's so beautiful.
- Have another go.
- What about a name?
- Catherine.
- Uh, yeah, we've gone off that.
Have we?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Well, you know what I think...
- It's not a girl's name.
Molly, Mrs H, we would love you to be godparents.
- Oh!
Really?
- If you...
That's so lovely.
And, uh... you too, Sherlock?
- You too what?
- Godfather, we'd like you to be godfather.
God is a ludicrous fiction, dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.
Yeah, but there'll be cake.
Will you do it?
I'll get back to you.
Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.
In Christ's name.
Now, what name have you given your daughter?
Rosamund Mary.
Rosamund?
It means "Rose of the world".
Rosie for short.
Didn't you get John's text?
No.
I delete his texts.
I delete any text that begins "Hi."
No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.
Sorry.
Phone!
And now, godparents, are you ready to help the parents of this child in their duties as Christian parents?
We are.
"Sorry, I didn't catch that."
"Please repeat the question."
As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.
To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
Hard logic versus romantic whimsy - that is your choice.
You fail to connect actions to their consequences.
Now, for the last time, if you want to keep the rattle, do not throw the rattle.
All right, good girl, good girl.
Good girl.
I'd better finish this, hadn't I?
- Hey.
- Afternoon.
He says you've got a good one, Greg?
Oh, yeah.
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.
God, 50!
Where does it go?
I know for a fact I was only 21 this time last week.
Yeah, well that's impossible.
That was before you met me.
- Well, no, no, there never was...
- "There never was such a time."
She's looking at me disapprovingly again.
No.
She's just jealous.
Yeah, well, I think we both are.
- Oh...
- No, no, David.
- Come on, you promised.
- No, it's...
Oh, no...
Oh, it's a Skype call.
Oh!
Then it must be Charlie.
At least he's phoning, I suppose.
Oh, look!
Hello!
"Hey, Dad.
Happy birthday.
Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?"
No!
Picture's frozen!
"Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you."
Why is it rubbish?
Where are you?
How is he?
Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.
David?
Come on!
OK, no, hang on a sec, I'll find somewhere quieter.
So, Charlie, where are you?
Are you there?
- "Sorry, I'm here.
I'm just a bit..."
- Are you all right?
"It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude."
Altitude?
"I'm in Tibet.
Didn't you see the mountains?"
Never mind mountains.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.
- "Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?"
- What?
"Could you just check something on my car?"
Your car?
"To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe
I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet."
- "Could you take a photo and send it?"
- Uh, yes, I can do that.
All done.
Have you got it?
Charlie?
A week later...
Yeah?
...something really weird happens.
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed, the cops are chasing him, and he turns into the drive of the Welsborough house to try and get away.
Unfortunately...
The drunk guy survived, they managed to pull him out, but when they put the fire out and examined the parked car...
Whose body?
Charlie Welsborough, the son.
- What?
- The son who was in Tibet.
DNA all checks out.
Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.
- Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
- Have you got a lab report?
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.
- The seats?
- Yes, the car seats.
Made of vinyl.
Two different types of vinyl present.
Was it his own car?
Yeah, not flash - he was a student.
- Well, that's suggestive.
- Why?
- Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
- Yeah, right?
- There's something else.
- Yes?
According to this,
Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.
What?
The body in the car, dead for a week.
Oh, this is a good one.
Is it my birthday?
You want help?
- Yes, please.
OK.
- One condition.
Take all the credit.
It gets boring if I just solve them all.
Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.
He's got a point.
Which makes me look like some kind of prima Donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do!
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.
- Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
- Definitely a sore spot.
So you take all the glory, thanks...
- OK!
- ...thanks all the same.
Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?
It's driving me nuts.
Anything you say, Giles.
Just kidding.
What's his name?
Greg.
What?
Greg.
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?
Not a clue.
It's just you normally say that at this point.
Hmm.
Well, then, let's hope you solve your little problem, Greg.
- Hear that?
- I know.
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood?
- Oh, good, great.
Yeah, amazing.
- Getting any sleep?
- Christ, no.
You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.
- Must feel very different...
- Sorry, what?
Yes, well, you know how it is.
All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.
- Are you two having a little joke?
- Never a word of thanks.
Can't even tell people's faces apart.
This is a joke, isn't it?
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever.
You're so, so clever."
- Is it about me?
- I think he needs winding.
You know, I think that really might be it.
No, don't get it.
Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect, so go easy on them, yeah?
- You know me.
- 'Hey, hello.'
Yeah.
Got them, don't worry.
Pampers, the cream you can't get from Boots.
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now?
- At the dead boy's house?
- Yeah.
'And what does he think?
Any theories?
'
Well, I texted you the details.
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.
- Hey!
- How do you know about that?
"Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up."
- They know everything!
- "Solved it, then?"
I'm working on it.
"Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down."
- Pig!
- Keep trying.
"So, what about it, then?"
"What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it?"
"And what are you going to call this one?"
Oh, the Ghost Driver.
- Don't give it a title.
- People like the titles.
- They hate the titles.
- Give the people what they want.
No, never do that - people are stupid.
Uh, some people.
"All people are stupid.
Most people."
"Bizarre enough though, isn't it, to be him?"
I mean, it's right up your strasse.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.
- Son.
- Son!
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.
If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.
Well, I believe that I can.
But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
Sherlock?
Mr Holmes?
Sorry, you were saying?
Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
I don't think we'll ever get over this.
No.
Shouldn't think so.
So sorry, will you excuse me a moment?
I just...
I'll...
I'll just, um...
Ahem.
- Now what's wrong?
- Not sure, I just...
By the pricking of my thumbs.
Seriously?
You?
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.
They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.
What is this?
Oh, it's a sort of shrine, I suppose, really.
Bit of a fan of Mrs T.
A big hero of mine when I was getting started.
Right, yes.
- Who?
- What?
- Who...?
Who was this?
- Are you serious?
- Sherlock...
- It's...
It's Margaret Thatcher, the first female Prime Minister of this country.
Right.
- Prime Minister?
Right.
- Leader of the Government.
- Female?
- For God's sake!
You know perfectly well who she is.
Why are you playing for time?
It's the gap, look at the gap.
It's wrong.
Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed.
The whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.
This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been in, this picture is straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.
- Something's missing from here, but only recently.
- Yes, a...
- Plaster bust... - plaster bust.
- Oh, for God's sake!
It got broken.
What the hell has this got to do with Charlie?
- Rug!
- What?
Well, how could it get broken?
The only place for it to fall is the floor and there is a big thick rug.
- Does it matter?
- Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.
- It is worth letting him do this.
- Is your friend quite mad?
No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
We found the remains out there in the porch.
- The porch where we came in?
- How anybody could hate her so much they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness...
I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.
Why didn't he smash all the others?
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.
Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.
- And if there's nothing...
- I know what happened to your son.
You do?
It's quite simple, superficial, to be blunt.
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness?
- Well, yes.
- And the porch where it was smashed,
I noticed the motion sensor was damaged,
- so I assume it's permanently lit.
- How did you notice that?
I lack the arrogance to ignore details.
I'm not the police.
- So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.
- Exactly.
- Why?
- Don't know.
Wouldn't be fun if I knew.
Mr Holmes, please!
It was your 50th birthday, Mr Welsborough, of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
- After all, he was in Tibet.
- Yes.
- No.
- No?
♪ Happy birthday... ♪
The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video.
Easily arranged.
It's a Skype call.
The trick was meant to be a surprise.
- A trick?
- Obviously.
Could you take a photo and send it?
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.
Well, good enough.
Effectively a costume.
You're joking?
No, I'm not.
All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
- Oh, my God!
- Surprise!
That's when it happened.
I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.
You said he'd felt unwell?
You all right?
"It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude."
He died there and then.
No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained, in the driver's seat, hidden, until...
When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who'd been sitting there, quite dead, for a week.
Oh, God!
Poor kid.
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.
This is where it was smashed.
- That was amazing.
- What?
The car, the kid.
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?
I can't stand it, never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
What kind of a life would that be?
Besides, I have the strangest feeling...
Miss me?
- That's mine.
You two take a... bus.
- Why?
I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.
The Mall, please.
- I met her once.
- Thatcher?
Rather arrogant, I thought.
- You thought that?
!
- Ha, I know.
Why am I looking at this?
That's her, John and Mary's baby.
Oh, I see, yes.
Looks very... fully functioning.
Is that really the best you can do?
Sorry, I've never been very good with them.
- Babies?
- Humans.
Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?
Any interest in her?
Why on earth would he?
I don't know.
You tell me.
In the last year of his life,
James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over 70 assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias,
which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.
It's a pearl... get another one.
There's something important about this.
I'm sure.
Maybe it's Moriarty.
Maybe it's not.
But something's coming.
Are you having a premonition, brother mine?
The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other.
What we call premonition is just movement of the web.
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable.
As inevitable as mathematics.
Appointment In Samarra.
I'm sorry?
The merchant who can't outrun Death.
You always hated that story as a child.
Less keen on predestination back then.
I'm not sure I like it now.
You wrote your own version, as I remember.
Appointment In Sumatra.
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.
Goodnight, Mycroft.
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.
- Keep me informed.
- Of what?
Absolutely no idea.
"Ammo!"
- Oh, hi, Stella.
- Greg.
You, uh...?
- Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...
- Right, right, right...
Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?
It's nothing.
I mean it's nothing serious.
- No, no.
- I just pop round every now and again for a chat.
Yeah, of course.
I mean he loves a really tricky case.
Yeah, he does!
So what you here for?
Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so...
The Borgia Pearl?
They still after that, are they?
Yeah.
So, how did you two first meet?
Oh, well, there was a case about, um, ten years ago.
Nobody could figure it out.
There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.
- Oh, yeah?
How did she die?
- Hypothermia.
What?
I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...
Will you two please keep it down?
!
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?
You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.
I was a carpenter.
Like me dad.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
How the hell...?
Ah... e-cigarettes.
Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.
If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.
But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last.
Anything to add, John?
- John?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.
- What is that?
- That is... me.
Well, it's a me substitute.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You know I value your little contributions.
Yeah?
It's been there since nine this morning.
- Has it?
Where were you?
- Helping Mrs H with her Sudoku.
What about my girlfriend?
- What?
- You said I had an ex...
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.
The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.
I...
I thought you'd done something clever.
Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
What do you mean?
Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
- Well...
- You thought she was having an affair.
I'm afraid it's far worse than that, your wife is a spy.
- What?
- That's right.
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy, across the road from your flat.
Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy, as part of an official state visit.
As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.
This drug will render the President entirely susceptible to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty.
What?
Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III.
- Are you serious?
- No, of course not.
His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.
I don't!
- Just the bras.
- Get out.
So, what's this all about, then?
- Having fun.
- Fun?
- While I can.
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, Sherlock...
- Borgia Pearl.
Boring.
Go!
- But...
- Go!
- This had better be good.
- Oh, I think you'll like it.
That is the bust, isn't it?
The one that was broken.
No, it's another one, different owner.
Different part of town.
You were right, this is a thing.
Something's going on.
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be pleased.
- I am pleased.
- You don't look pleased.
This is my game face.
And the game is on.
Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one.
- One belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan.
- Identical busts?
Yeah, and this one to a Dr Barnicot in Holborn.
Three in total.
God knows who'd want to do something like this.
Yeah, but some people have that complex, don't they?
An idee fixe.
They obsess over one thing and they can't let it go.
No, no good.
There were other images of Margaret...
Margaret...?
You know who she is.
...Thatcher, present at the first break-in.
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?
Ooh!
- What?
- Blood.
Quite a bit of it, too.
Was there any injury at the crime scene?
Nah.
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.
- Come on.
- Holborn?
Lambeth!
- Lambeth?
Why?
- To see Toby.
Ah, right.
Who?
- You'll see.
- Right, are you coming?
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.
- Who told you?
- The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.
- Have a good time.
- I will.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
- What?
- She's not the one.
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.
How do you work all that out?
She's got three children in Rio that he doesn't know about.
Are you just making this up?
- Possibly.
- Who's Toby?
There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker, one of the world's best.
Got himself into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago.
He hacked into the Pentagon security system, and I managed to get him off the charge.
Therefore he owes me a favour.
So, how does that help us?
- What?
- Toby the hacker?
- Toby's not the hacker.
- What?
- All right, Craig?
- All right, Sherlock?
Craig's got a dog.
So I see.
Good boy!
Hiya!
Mary?
What are you...?
No, we, we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case.
No, exactly.
So... don't wait up.
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Hey.
Mary, what are you doing here?
She's better at this than you.
- Better?
- So I texted her.
Hang on, Mary's better than me?
Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.
Of course she's better.
Yeah, OK.
Nothing personal.
What, so I'm supposed to just go home now, am I?
What do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?
- John or the dog?
- Ha-ha, that's funny!
- John.
- Well...
He's handy and loyal.
- That's hilarious.
- Is it too early for a divorce?
Oh.
Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge?
Keep up, he's fast.
- He's not moving.
- He's thinking.
He's really not moving.
Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.
You just like this dog, don't you?
- Well, I like you.
- He's still not moving.
- Fascinating.
- Oh!
Well, what do you make of it?
- They were looking for something.
- Yes, but it wasn't a burglar, they came specifically for that Thatcher bust.
Why?
Clever.
Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail,
- where would you go?
- Like hiding a tree in a forest.
Or blood in a butcher's.
Never mind, Toby, better luck next time, hmm?
This is it, though.
This is the one, I can feel it.
Not Moriarty?
It has to be him.
It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.
It's designed to beguile me, tease me and lure me in.
At last, a noose for me to put my neck into.
You should have seen the state of the front room.
- It was like The Exorcist.
- Huh.
Was Rosie's head spinning round?
- No.
Just the projectile vomiting.
- Nice!
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
- Hmm?
Noticed what?
- The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
Yeah, can't she?
I'm coming, darling.
Mummy's coming.
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here.
Have you heard of that thing?
In Germany?
You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.
Ostalgie.
People who missed the old days under the communists.
- People are weird, aren't they?
- Hmm.
According to this, there's quite a market for Cold War memorabilia.
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit?
Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.
Yes, fascinating.
Irrelevant.
Where exactly did they come from?
I've got into the records of the suppliers, Gelder and Co.
Seems they're from Georgia.
Where exactly?
Tbilisi.
Batch of six.
One to Welsborough.
One to Hassan.
One to Dr Barnicot.
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.
One to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.
Lestrade?
Another one?
- 'Yeah.'
- Harker or Sandeford?
Harker.
And it's murder this time.
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.
_
_
Defensive wounds on her face and hands, throat cut.
Sharp blade.
The same thing inside the house?
The bust?
- Two of them this time.
- Interesting.
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago.
- Limited edition of six.
- And now someone's wandering about destroying them all.
Makes no sense.
What's the point?
No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.
- Yes, it is.
- Well, it is, but it's not the point.
I've been slow, far too slow.
Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind...
Slow but lucky, very lucky.
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.
Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.
Congratulations, by the way.
- I'm sorry?
- Well, you're about to solve a big one.
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
- Yeah, until then, basically.
That's enough now, love.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.
And you need to get to bed.
Come on.
Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?
You were on the run.
Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying, it's clever.
Very clever.
But now you've met me and you're not so clever, are you?
Who are you?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.
Argh!
You're out of time.
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
- Who?
I know it's him.
It must be him.
You think you understand.
You understand nothing.
Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don't we just enjoy the moment?
Let me present Interpol's number one case.
Too tough for them, too boring for me.
The Black Pearl of the Borgias!
It's not possible!
How could she...?
!
Everything about who I was is on there.
The problems of your past are your business.
The problems of your future are my privilege.
I don't understand.
She...
She destroyed it.
She?
You know her!
You do, don't you?
You know the bitch?
!
She betrayed me.
Betrayed us all.
Mary.
This is about Mary?
Is that what she's calling herself now, eh?
- "Armed police, you're surrounded!"
- Give it to me.
Give it to me!
"Come out slowly, I want to see your hands above your head."
Nobody shoots me!
Anyone shoots, I kill this man.
"Lay down your weapon.
Do it now!"
I'm leaving this place.
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.
"Lay down your weapon."
You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
Tell her she's a dead woman.
She's a dead woman walking.
She's my friend.
And she's under my protection.
Who are you?
I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.
Who's Sherlock Holmes?
Not a policeman.
What do you think?
Mate in two?
Don't antagonise them, darling.
Oh, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.
Everything palls.
They'll send someone soon.
They?
Who are they?
Seems to me we put an awful lot of faith in they.
Well, I've got something they would dearly love, if only we could get out of here.
I've got Ammo.
Ammo?
- Madame Ambassador.
- What took you so long?
- Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now!
Veer left!
What now?
What do we do?
We die.
Well?
He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.
- I very much doubt it.
- Why?
Because I think he used to work with Mary.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out!
We'll come back later.
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the English woman?
What would you do to a traitor?
Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.
I am an idiot, I know nothing.
Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
That was quite a text you sent me.
What's going on, Sherlock?
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,
I couldn't see what was right under my nose.
Expected a pearl.
Oh, my God, that's a...
Yes, it's an AGRA.
Memory stick, like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.
Who?
I don't know.
We...
We all had one but the others were...
Haven't you even looked at it yet?
I glanced at it but I prefer
- to hear it from you.
- Why?
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.
There were four of us, agents.
Not just agents.
Polite term.
Alex.
Gabriel.
Me.
And Ajay.
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.
We all had one.
Each containing aliases, our background, everything.
We could never be betrayed, because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.
- Who employed you?
- Anyone who paid well.
I mean, we were at the top of our game for years.
And then it all ended.
There was a coup in Georgia.
The British Embassy in Tbilisi was taken over, lots of hostages.
We got the call to go in, get them out.
There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.
- Who from?
- I don't know, just another voice on the phone.
And a codeword.
- Ammo.
- Ammo?
Like ammunition.
We went in, but then something went wrong.
Something went really wrong.
That was six years ago.
It feels like forever.
I was the only one that made it out.
No.
What?
I met someone tonight.
Same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.
What, he's alive?
Yeah, very much so.
I don't believe it, this is amazing!
I thought I was the only one,
I thought I was the only one who got out.
Where is he?
I need to see him, now!
Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?
Yeah, of course.
It was our insurance.
Above all, they mustn't fall into enemy hands.
So Ajay survived as well.
And now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide, with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why?
I don't know.
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.
Families fall out.
The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
Well, he's just trying to find me.
He survived, that's all that matters!
I heard it from his own mouth.
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."
Why would he want to kill me?
- He said you betrayed him.
- Oh, no, no, that's insane.
Well, it's what he believes.
I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.
No, Mary...
You do.
I made a vow, remember?
To look after the three of you.
Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
There's something I think you should read.
What is it?
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.
What are you...?
- Mary...
Oh, no!
- There you go.
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.
No.
You just look after them till I get back.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Agra?
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
It is 378km west of the state capital, Lucknow.
What are you, Wikipedia?
- Yes.
- AGRA is an acronym.
Oh, good, I love an acronym.
All the best secret societies have them.
Team of agents, the best.
But you know all that.
Of course I do.
Go on.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.
Indeed?
Well, that's news to me.
Is it?
He's already killed looking for that memory stick.
AGRA always worked for the highest bidder,
I thought that might include you?
- Me?
- Well, I mean the British government, or whatever government you're currently propping up.
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.
They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong.
And that was that, we stopped using freelancers.
- Your initiative?
- My initiative.
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.
I don't like loose ends.
Not on my watch.
There was something else.
A detail.
A codeword.
Ammo?
It's all I've got.
Little enough.
Could you do some digging as a favour?
You don't have many favours left.
Then I'm calling them all in.
And if you can find who's after her and neutralise them, what then?
You think you can go on saving her forever?
Of course.
Is that sentiment talking?
No, it's me.
Difficult to tell the difference these days.
Told you, I made a promise.
A vow.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.
Not on my watch.
"My darling, I need to tell you this because you mustn't hate me for going away."
Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.
- Can you hear a squeaking?
- No.
Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel.
Why Planes Fail.
- Did you see it?
Oh, truly terrifying.
- Can't say I did.
Swore I would never fly again, yet hear I am!
Everything OK, madam?
No.
No, no, it's not, but then what's the use in complaining?
I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off is all.
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.
Oh, OK.
Relax.
She said relax.
Did you have a nice time in London?
It was OK, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun?
Did you lose it in the war?
"I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.
I'm not running, I promise you that,
I just need to do this in my own way."
Oh, God!
I'm...
I-I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God!
- Everything OK, madam?
- I think I'm dying.
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.
God will smile on you.
"But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,
I'm sorry, my love."
I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.
Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of a dice.
I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
"I swear I will."
Not like this one.
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in!
I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.
Mr Baker.
Well, that completes the set.
- No, it does not.
- Well, who else am I missing?
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?
Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.
Oh, hi, Mary.
What concept?
Happy families.
Nice trip?
- How the f...?
- Please, Mary, there is a child present.
- How did you get in here?
- Karim let me in.
Hello.
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Nice to meet you, missus.
No, I mean how did you find me?
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
No, really, though, how?
Every movement I made was entirely random, every new personality just on the roll of a dice!
Mary, no human action is ever truly random.
An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability, mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual, can reduce the number of variables considerably.
I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine a seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.
But they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.
Oh, you bastard!
- You bastard!
- I know, but your face!
"The mathematics of probability"?
- You believed that.
- "Feasible variables"?
Yes, I started to run out about then.
In the memory stick!
Yeah, that was my idea.
- AGRA?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
You said it was your initials.
In a way that was true.
In a way?
So many lies.
I'm so sorry.
And I don't just mean you.
What?
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...
You're R?
Rosamund?
Rosamund Mary.
I always liked Mary.
Yeah, me too.
I used to.
I just...
I didn't know what else to do.
You could have stayed, you could have talked to me.
That's what couples are supposed to do.
Work things through.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Mary, I may not be a very good man but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for,
- most of the time.
- All the time.
You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.
You never judge, you never complain.
I don't deserve you, I...
All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
I will keep you safe.
But it has to be in London.
It's my city, I know the turf.
Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.
Get down!
Hello again.
- Ajay?
- Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.
Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.
I thought I was the only one who got out.
How did you find us?
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.
You found her but I found you.
So perhaps not so clever.
And now here we are.
At last.
Touche!
Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
She thought I was dead.
I might as well have been.
It was always just the four of us, always, remember?
Oh, yeah.
So why do you want to kill me?
Do you know how long they kept me prisoner?
What they did to me?
They tortured Alex to death.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.
But you?
You, where were you?
That day at the embassy, I escaped.
Ha!
But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
Where were you?
Oh, I got out.
For a while.
Long enough to hide my memory stick.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.
I was loyal, you see.
Loyal to my friends.
But they took me, tortured me.
Not for information.
Not for anything except fun.
They thought I'd give in, die, but I didn't, I lived.
And eventually, they forgot about me rotting in a cell somewhere.
Six years they kept me there.
Until one day I saw my chance.
Oh, and I made them pay.
You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.
Little whispers.
Laughter.
Gossip.
How the clever agents had been betrayed.
Brought down by you!
Me?
You know I'll kill you too.
You know I will, Ajay.
What, you think I care if I die?
I've dreamed of killing you every night for six years.
Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.
I swear to you, Ajay.
What did you hear, Ajay?
When you were a prisoner, what exactly did you hear?
What did I hear?
Ammo.
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo."
We were betrayed!
- And they said it was her?
- That you betrayed us!
They said her name?
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.
No!
No!
"The English woman, that's all he heard.
Naturally, he assumed it was Mary."
Couldn't this wait until you're back?
No, it's not over.
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed, the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.
There was only a voice on the phone.
"Remember?
And a codeword."
"Ammo," yes, you said.
How's your Latin, brother dear?
My Latin?
Amo, amas, amat.
I love, you love, he loves.
What...?
Not "Ammo" as in ammunition, but "Amo", meaning?
You'd better be right, Sherlock.
Bloody thing!
What's going on?
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.
What?
"So many lies.
And I don't just mean you."
- Hello.
- Ah, hello.
- I like your daisy.
- Thank you, yeah.
It's not really me, though, I think.
- No?
- No, no, it's too floral for me.
I'm more of a "knackered with weary old eyes" kind of guy.
Well, I think they're nice.
Nice eyes.
- Thank you.
- Look...
Look...
I don't normally do this,
- but, um...
- But you're going to.
Yeah.
- What's this?
- This is me.
- Thank you.
Cheers.
- Yeah.
Great.
- Bye!
- Bye.
New Contact E
Hey
Hey
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
Hmm?
Noticed what?
The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
- Yeah, can't she?
- Hmm.
I'm coming darling.
I'm coming.
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
- "It's been too long."
- Come here...
It's OK.
"It's been too long." I"I know.
Sorry."
- "Miss you."
- Do you want a cuddle?
- "Miss you." - "You're up late."
I know.
- Oh, sweetheart.
- "Or early."
"Night owl?"
Ssh.
Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you?
"Vampire"
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?
Oh, let's go and see Daddy!
Daddy's here.
It's OK, Rosie.
I'll take her.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I may as well get up now.
Hey, baby, it's Daddy.
Your daddy.
Come here, Rose.
Come here, darling, it's all right.
Thank you.
"This isn't a good ideea.
I'm not free.
Things won't end well.
It was nice to get to know you a little."
"I'm sorry."
This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.
How many more times?
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.
And you're basing all this on a code name?
On a whispered voice on the telephone?
Come on, Mycroft.
You were the conduit for AGRA.
Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
It was my job.
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
AGRA went in.
- Yes.
- And they were betrayed.
Not by me.
Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.
I promise you,
I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.
You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.
Not one.
Not.
One.
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories?
I'd like to do those.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.
Although she does seem to enjoy them.
Well, I'll have to give that a go.
Got a lot to catch up on.
"You think you understand.
You understand nothing."
"Code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love."
"You'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up."
"They know everything."
"They said it was the English woman."
"Don't minute any of this."
"They know everything."
- You don't make it easy, do you?
- What do you mean?
Well, being... being so perfect.
Mary, I...
I need to tell you...
Hang on.
Can you tell me later?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Great.
Well, no, we can't just go.
- Rosie.
- Yeah.
- Er, you go.
- No!
I'll come as soon as I've found someone.
Mrs Hudson.
- Corfu till Saturday.
Molly?
- Er, yeah, I'll try.
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.
You know that's not going to happen.
If there's more to this case, you need to see it.
Yeah, OK, you win.
"Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes."
"Please make your way to the exit.
Thank you."
Your office said I'd find you here.
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.
We're like them.
Ghostly, living in the shadows.
Predatory?
Well, it depends which side you're on.
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.
Nice location for the final act, couldn't have chosen it better myself.
But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.
I just come here to look at the fish.
I knew this would happen one day.
- It's like that old story.
- I really am a very busy man.
Would you mind cutting to the chase?
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
With good reason.
"There was once a merchant, in a famous market in Baghdad."
I really have never liked this story.
I'm just like the merchant in the story,
I thought I could out-run the inevitable.
I've always been looking over my shoulder, always expecting to see the grim figure of...
Death.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hey.
- John?
- On his way.
Let me introduce Ammo.
You were Ammo?
You were the person on the phone that time?
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
Why did you betray us?
Why does anyone do anything?
- Hmm.
- Let me guess, selling secrets?
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.
Worked very well for a few years.
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it.
But...
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.
I couldn't believe my luck!
That bought me a little time.
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
Very handy.
They were always such reliable killers.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.
Lady Smallwood gave the order.
But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.
Seemed to do the trick.
And you thought your troubles were over.
I was tired.
Tired of the mess of it all.
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.
The hostages were killed.
AGRA too.
Or so I thought.
My secret was safe.
But... apparently not.
Just a little peace.
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
A family?
Home?
Really, I understand.
So, just let me get out of here, right?
Let me just walk away.
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.
What do you say?
After what you did?
!
Mary, no!
OK.
London Aquarium.
Yes, now.
I was never a field agent.
I always thought I'd be rather good.
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
Thanks.
- For a secretary.
- What?
It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
- I didn't do this out of jealousy.
- No?
Same old drudge, day in, day out.
Never getting out there where all the excitement was.
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.
Yes, your little flat.
- How do you know?
- Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?
And what are you, widowed or divorced?
Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.
That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.
- Sherlock...
- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.
A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.
- Sherlock, don't.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.
There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
That accounts for the drink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.
So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.
To prove how good you are.
To make up for the inadequacies of your...
little life.
Well, Mrs Norbury,
I must admit this is unexpected.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.
All except Sherlock Holmes.
There's no way out.
So it would seem.
You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.
It's what I do.
Maybe I can still surprise you.
Now, come on, be sensible.
Hmm, no, I don't think so.
Ah!
Surprise!
Everything's fine.
It's going to be OK.
Get an ambulance!
It's all right, it's all right.
- Mary!
- John.
All right, Mary?
Mary?
Stay with me, stay with me.
- Oh, come on...
- No, don't worry.
Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
Come on, Mary.
Mary?
Oh, God.
John, I think this is it.
No, no, no, no.
It's not.
- That's...
- You made me so happy.
You gave me everything I could ever, ever have wanted...
Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.
- Look after Rosie.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.
- Promise me.
- I promise.
- No...
- Yes, I promise.
- Promise me!
- I promise, I promise.
Ssh, ssh.
Hey, Sherlock.
Yes.
I... so like you.
Did I ever say?
Yes, yes, you did.
I'm sorry for... for shooting you that time.
I'm really sorry.
It's all right.
I think we're even now, OK?
OK.
- Oh, I think we're...
- Mary, Mary...
- ...even, definitely even.
- Ssh, ssh.
You were my whole world.
Being Mary Watson was the only life worth living.
- Mary...
- Thank you.
Mary...
Don't you dare!
You made a vow.
You swore it.
"You've been having dreams.
A recurring dream?"
Do you want to talk about it?
This is a two-way relationship, you know.
The whole world has come crashing down around you.
Everything's hopeless.
Irretrievable.
I know that's what you must feel but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
That's not really my style.
I need to know what to do.
Do?
About John.
Put me through to Sherrinford, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
But nothing will ever be the same again, will it?
I'm afraid it won't.
We'll have to rally round, I expect, do our bit.
Look after little Rosie.
I'm just going to, um look through these things.
There might be a case.
A case?
Oh, you're not up to it, are you?
Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.
Yes.
Yes, I expect you're right.
I'll make some tea, shall I?
- Mrs Hudson?
- Yes, Sherlock?
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident...
- Yes?
- ...would you just say the word Norbury to me?
Would you?
Norbury?
Just that.
I'd be very grateful.
What's this?
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.
Oh, God!
Is that...?
- Must be.
- Oh.
I knew it wouldn't end like this.
I knew Moriarty made plans.
"I thought that would get your attention."
So, this is in case...
In case the day comes.
If you are watching this, I'm probably dead.
I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows?
Nothing's certain, nothing's written.
My old life it was full of consequences.
The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.
You need to remember that.
So I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
Might be the hardest case of your career.
When I'm... gone, if I'm gone...
"...
I need you to do something for me."
Hi.
I just wondered how things were going and if there was anything I could do.
It's, Er, it's from John.
- Right.
- You don't need to read it now.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.
He says...
John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...
Yes?
He said he'd that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Anyone.
"I'm giving you a case, Sherlock."
When I'm gone, if I'm... gone I need you to do something for me.
Save John Watson.
Save him, Sherlock.
"Save him."
"When does the path we walk on lock around our feet?
When does the road become a river with only one destination?"
"Death waits for us all in Samarra.
But can Samarra be avoided?"
Go to hell, Sherlock.

- My brother is a murderer.
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.
Oh, do your research.
I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Merry Christmas!
I'm not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.
You know what happened to the other one.
Miss me?
'Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
'
I've only been gone four minutes.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Is that quite clear?
Don't minute any of this.
Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.
A D notice has been slapped on the entire incident.
Only those within this room, code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love, will ever know the whole truth.
As far as everyone else is concerned, going to the Prime Minister and way beyond, Charles Augustus...
- Are you tweeting?
!
- No.
Well, that's what it looks like!
Of course I'm not tweeting.
Why would I be tweeting?
- Give me that!
- What?
No!
What are you doing?
!
- Get off!
- Give it here!
- "Back on terra firma."
- Don't read them out.
- "Free as a bird."
- God, you're such a spoilsport.
Will you take this matter seriously, Sherlock?
I am!
What makes you think I'm not taking it seriously?
"#OhWhatABeautifulMorning"
Look, not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death - my death!
And now I'm back, in a nice warm office, with my big brother and...
Are those ginger nuts?
- Oh, God...
- Love ginger nuts.
Our doctor said you were clean.
I am.
Utterly.
No need for stimulants now, remember?
I have work to do.
You're high as a kite!
Natural high, I assure you.
Totally natural.
I'm just... ?
..glad to be alive!
?
What shall we do next?
What's your name?
Vivian.
- What would you do, Vivian?
- Pardon?
Well, it's a lovely day.
Go for a stroll?
Make a paper aeroplane?
Have an ice lolly?
Ice lolly, I suppose.
Ice lolly it is!
- What's your favourite?
- Well, really, I shouldn't...
- Go on.
- Do they still do Mivvies?
- Mr Holmes...
- Yes?
- ...we do need to get on.
- Yes, of course.
'Do your research.
'I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
..sociopath.
I see.
Who is supposed to have shot him, then?
Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger - that's who.
- That's not what happened at all.
- It is now.
Remarkable.
How did you do it?
We have some very talented people working here.
If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.
That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.
No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.
You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.
You're home and dry.
OK, cheers.
Obviously, there's unfinished business.
Moriarty.
I told you
- Moriarty's dead.
You say he filmed that video message before he died.
Yes.
You also say you know what he's going to do next.
- What does that mean?
- Perhaps that's all there is to it.
Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
No, no, he would never be that disappointing.
He's planned something, something long-term.
Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.
Posthumous revenge.
No, better than that - posthumous game.
We brought you back to deal with this.
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.
Wait?
!
Of course wait.
I'm the target - targets wait.
Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up,
I'll know when it begins.
I always know when the game is on.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because I love it.
There was once a merchant, in the famous market at Baghdad.
One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise, and he knew that the stranger was Death.
Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles, to the city of Samarra.
For there he was sure Death could not find him.
But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.
"Very well," said the merchant.
"I give in.
I am yours."
"But tell me, why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"
"Because," said Death,
"I had an appointment with you tonight... ..in Samarra."
If this gets any better, I'm going to get two knives.
Pays to advertise.
- So, what about Moriarty, then?
- Oh, I have a plan.
I'm going to monitor the underworld, every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
So, basically, your plan is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do?
Awesome, isn't it?
He drowned, Mr Holmes.
That's what we thought.
- But when they opened up his lungs...
- Yes?
..sand.
Superficial.
Come back!
It's the wrong thumb.
_
Sherlock...
It's never twins.
Hopkins, arrest Wilson.
Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.
- 'Wilson?
' 'Lymph nodes?
'
- Sherlock...
Yes, you may have nothing but a limbless torso, but there'll be traces of ink in the lymph nodes under the armpits.
If your mystery corpse had tattoos, the signs will be there.
- 'Bloody hell!
Is that a guess?
'
- I never guess.
- Sherlock...
- 'So, he's the killer?
The canary trainer?
'
- Of course he's the killer.
- 'Didn't see that coming.'
Hm, naturally.
Sherlock, you can't go on spinning plates like this.
That's it!
The place was spinning.
The heart medication you're taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.
Yes, I...
I think so.
Why?
Because the fingerprints on your brother's neck were your own.
- A jellyfish?
- I know.
You can't arrest a jellyfish.
- You could try.
- We did try.
Oh...
- Oh, God.
- Mary?
59 missed calls.
We're in a lot of trouble.
Ow!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Relax, it's got two syllables...
I'm a nurse, darling - I think I know what to do!
- Come on, then...
- Re!
Lax!
No, just drive, please, God, just drive!
God, drive!
Sherlock
- Mary!
That's it, Mary - re...
- Don't you start!
- ...
lax.
John, John...
I think you have to pull over!
- Mary, Mary...
- Pull over!
Oh, my God!
Has that come out?
They never come out when I take them.
Let's have a look.
Aw, she's so beautiful.
- Have another go.
- What about a name?
- Catherine.
- Uh, yeah, we've gone off that.
Have we?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Well, you know what I think...
- It's not a girl's name.
Molly, Mrs H, we would love you to be godparents.
- Oh!
Really?
- If you...
That's so lovely.
And, uh... you too, Sherlock?
- You too what?
- Godfather, we'd like you to be godfather.
God is a ludicrous fiction, dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.
Yeah, but there'll be cake.
Will you do it?
I'll get back to you.
Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.
In Christ's name.
Now, what name have you given your daughter?
Rosamund Mary.
Rosamund?
It means "Rose of the world".
Rosie for short.
Didn't you get John's text?
No.
I delete his texts.
I delete any text that begins "Hi."
No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.
Sorry.
Phone!
And now, godparents, are you ready to help the parents of this child in their duties as Christian parents?
We are.
'Sorry, I didn't catch that.
'Please repeat the question.'
As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.
To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
Hard logic versus romantic whimsy - that is your choice.
You fail to connect actions to their consequences.
Now, for the last time, if you want to keep the rattle, do not throw the rattle.
All right, good girl, good girl.
Good girl.
I'd better finish this, hadn't I?
- Hey.
- Afternoon.
He says you've got a good one, Greg?
Oh, yeah.
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.
God, 50!
Where does it go?
I know for a fact I was only 21 this time last week.
Yeah, well that's impossible.
That was before you met me.
- Well, no, no, there never was...
- "There never was such a time."
She's looking at me disapprovingly again.
No.
She's just jealous.
Yeah, well, I think we both are.
- Oh...
- No, no, David.
- Come on, you promised.
- No, it's...
Oh, no...
Oh, it's a Skype call.
Oh!
Then it must be Charlie.
At least he's phoning, I suppose.
Oh, look!
Hello!
'Hey, Dad.
Happy birthday.
Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?
'
No!
Picture's frozen!
'Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you.'
Why is it rubbish?
Where are you?
How is he?
Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.
David?
Come on!
OK, no, hang on a sec, I'll find somewhere quieter.
So, Charlie, where are you?
Are you there?
- 'Sorry, I'm here.
I'm just a bit...'
- Are you all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
Altitude?
'I'm in Tibet.
Didn't you see the mountains?
'
Never mind mountains.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.
- 'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?
'
- What?
'Could you just check something on my car?
'
Your car?
'To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe
I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet.
- 'Could you take a photo and send it?
'
- Uh, yes, I can do that.
All done.
Have you got it?
Charlie?
A week later...
Yeah?
...something really weird happens.
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed, the cops are chasing him, and he turns into the drive of the Welsborough house to try and get away.
Unfortunately...
The drunk guy survived, they managed to pull him out, but when they put the fire out and examined the parked car...
Whose body?
Charlie Welsborough, the son.
- What?
- The son who was in Tibet.
DNA all checks out.
Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.
- Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
- Have you got a lab report?
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.
- The seats?
- Yes, the car seats.
Made of vinyl.
Two different types of vinyl present.
Was it his own car?
Yeah, not flash - he was a student.
- Well, that's suggestive.
- Why?
- Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
- Yeah, right?
- There's something else.
- Yes?
According to this,
Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.
What?
The body in the car, dead for a week.
Oh, this is a good one.
Is it my birthday?
You want help?
- Yes, please.
OK.
- One condition.
Take all the credit.
It gets boring if I just solve them all.
Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.
He's got a point.
Which makes me look like some kind of prima donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do!
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.
- Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
- Definitely a sore spot.
So you take all the glory, thanks...
- OK!
- ...thanks all the same.
Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?
It's driving me nuts.
Anything you say, Giles.
Just kidding.
What's his name?
Greg.
What?
Greg.
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?
Not a clue.
It's just you normally say that at this point.
Hmm.
Well, then, let's hope you solve your little problem, Greg.
- Hear that?
- I know.
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood?
- Oh, good, great.
Yeah, amazing.
- Getting any sleep?
- Christ, no.
You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.
- Must feel very different...
- Sorry, what?
Yes, well, you know how it is.
All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.
- Are you two having a little joke?
- Never a word of thanks.
Can't even tell people's faces apart.
This is a joke, isn't it?
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever.
You're so, so clever."
- Is it about me?
- I think he needs winding.
You know, I think that really might be it.
No, don't get it.
Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect, so go easy on them, yeah?
- You know me.
- 'Hey, hello.'
Yeah.
Got them, don't worry.
Pampers, the cream you can't get from Boots.
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now?
- At the dead boy's house?
- Yeah.
'And what does he think?
Any theories?
'
Well, I texted you the details.
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.
- Hey!
- How do you know about that?
'Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.'
- They know everything!
- 'Solved it, then?
'
I'm working on it.
'Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.'
- Pig!
- Keep trying.
'So, what about it, then?
'What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it?
'And what are you going to call this one?
'
Oh, the Ghost Driver.
- Don't give it a title.
- People like the titles.
- They hate the titles.
- Give the people what they want.
No, never do that - people are stupid.
Uh, some people.
'All people are stupid.
Most people.'
'Bizarre enough though, isn't it, to be him?
'
I mean, it's right up your strasse.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.
- Son.
- Son!
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.
If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.
Well, I believe that I can.
But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
Sherlock?
Mr Holmes?
Sorry, you were saying?
Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
I don't think we'll ever get over this.
No.
Shouldn't think so.
So sorry, will you excuse me a moment?
I just...
I'll...
I'll just, um...
Ahem.
- Now what's wrong?
- Not sure, I just...
By the pricking of my thumbs.
Seriously?
You?
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.
They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.
What is this?
Oh, it's a sort of shrine, I suppose, really.
Bit of a fan of Mrs T.
A big hero of mine when I was getting started.
Right, yes.
- Who?
- What?
- Who...?
Who was this?
- Are you serious?
- Sherlock...
- It's...
It's Margaret Thatcher, the first female Prime Minister of this country.
Right.
- Prime Minister?
Right.
- Leader of the Government.
- Female?
- For God's sake!
You know perfectly well who she is.
Why are you playing for time?
It's the gap, look at the gap.
It's wrong.
Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed.
The whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.
This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been in, this picture is straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.
- Something's missing from here, but only recently.
- Yes, a...
- Plaster bust... - plaster bust.
- Oh, for God's sake!
It got broken.
What the hell has this got to do with Charlie?
- Rug!
- What?
Well, how could it get broken?
The only place for it to fall is the floor and there is a big thick rug.
- Does it matter?
- Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.
- It is worth letting him do this.
- Is your friend quite mad?
No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
We found the remains out there in the porch.
- The porch where we came in?
- How anybody could hate her so much they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness...
I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.
Why didn't he smash all the others?
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.
Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.
- And if there's nothing...
- I know what happened to your son.
You do?
It's quite simple, superficial, to be blunt.
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness?
- Well, yes.
- And the porch where it was smashed,
I noticed the motion sensor was damaged,
- so I assume it's permanently lit.
- How did you notice that?
I lack the arrogance to ignore details.
I'm not the police.
- So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.
- Exactly.
- Why?
- Don't know.
Wouldn't be fun if I knew.
Mr Holmes, please!
It was your 50th birthday, Mr Welsborough, of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
- After all, he was in Tibet.
- Yes.
- No.
- No?
?
Happy birthday... ?
The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video.
Easily arranged.
It's a Skype call.
The trick was meant to be a surprise.
- A trick?
- Obviously.
Could you take a photo and send it?
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.
Well, good enough.
Effectively a costume.
You're joking?
No, I'm not.
All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
- Oh, my God!
- Surprise!
That's when it happened.
I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.
You said he'd felt unwell?
You all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
He died there and then.
No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained, in the driver's seat, hidden, until...
When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who'd been sitting there, quite dead, for a week.
Oh, God!
Poor kid.
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.
This is where it was smashed.
- That was amazing.
- What?
The car, the kid.
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?
I can't stand it, never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
What kind of a life would that be?
Besides, I have the strangest feeling...
Miss me?
- That's mine.
You two take a... bus.
- Why?
I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.
The Mall, please.
- I met her once.
- Thatcher?
Rather arrogant, I thought.
- You thought that?
!
- Ha, I know.
Why am I looking at this?
That's her, John and Mary's baby.
Oh, I see, yes.
Looks very... fully functioning.
Is that really the best you can do?
Sorry, I've never been very good with them.
- Babies?
- Humans.
Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?
Any interest in her?
Why on earth would he?
I don't know.
You tell me.
In the last year of his life,
James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over 70 assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias,
which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.
It's a pearl - get another one.
There's something important about this.
I'm sure.
Maybe it's Moriarty.
Maybe it's not.
But something's coming.
Are you having a premonition, brother mine?
The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other.
What we call premonition is just movement of the web.
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable.
As inevitable as mathematics.
Appointment In Samarra.
I'm sorry?
The merchant who can't outrun Death.
You always hated that story as a child.
Less keen on predestination back then.
I'm not sure I like it now.
You wrote your own version, as I remember.
Appointment In Sumatra.
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.
Goodnight, Mycroft.
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.
- Keep me informed.
- Of what?
Absolutely no idea.
'Ammo!
'
- Oh, hi, Stella.
- Greg.
You, uh...?
- Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...
- Right, right, right...
Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?
It's nothing.
I mean it's nothing serious.
- No, no.
- I just pop round every now and again for a chat.
Yeah, of course.
I mean he loves a really tricky case.
Yeah, he does!
So what you here for?
Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so...
The Borgia Pearl?
They still after that, are they?
Yeah.
So, how did you two first meet?
Oh, well, there was a case about, um, ten years ago.
Nobody could figure it out.
There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.
- Oh, yeah?
How did she die?
- Hypothermia.
What?
I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...
Will you two please keep it down?
!
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?
You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.
I was a carpenter.
Like me dad.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
How the hell...?
Ah... e-cigarettes.
Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.
If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.
But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last.
Anything to add, John?
- John?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.
- What is that?
- That is... me.
Well, it's a me substitute.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You know I value your little contributions.
Yeah?
It's been there since nine this morning.
- Has it?
Where were you?
- Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.
What about my girlfriend?
- What?
- You said I had an ex...
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.
The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.
I...
I thought you'd done something clever.
Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
What do you mean?
Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
- Well...
- You thought she was having an affair.
I'm afraid it's far worse than that, your wife is a spy.
- What?
- That's right.
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy, across the road from your flat.
Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy, as part of an official state visit.
As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.
This drug will render the President entirely susceptible to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty.
What?
Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III.
- Are you serious?
- No, of course not.
His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.
I don't!
- Just the bras.
- Get out.
So, what's this all about, then?
- Having fun.
- Fun?
- While I can.
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, Sherlock...
- Borgia Pearl.
Boring.
Go!
- But...
- Go!
- This had better be good.
- Oh, I think you'll like it.
That is the bust, isn't it?
The one that was broken.
No, it's another one, different owner.
Different part of town.
You were right, this is a thing.
Something's going on.
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be pleased.
- I am pleased.
- You don't look pleased.
This is my game face.
And the game is on.
Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one.
- One belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan.
- Identical busts?
Yeah, and this one to a Dr Barnicot in Holborn.
Three in total.
God knows who'd want to do something like this.
Yeah, but some people have that complex, don't they?
An idee fixe.
They obsess over one thing and they can't let it go.
No, no good.
There were other images of Margaret...
Margaret...?
You know who she is.
...Thatcher, present at the first break-in.
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?
Ooh!
- What?
- Blood.
Quite a bit of it, too.
Was there any injury at the crime scene?
Nah.
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.
- Come on.
- Holborn?
Lambeth!
- Lambeth?
Why?
- To see Toby.
Ah, right.
Who?
- You'll see.
- Right, are you coming?
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.
- Who told you?
- The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.
- Have a good time.
- I will.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
- What?
- She's not the one.
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.
How do you work all that out?
She's got three children in Rio that he doesn't know about.
Are you just making this up?
- Possibly.
- Who's Toby?
There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker, one of the world's best.
Got himself into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago.
He hacked into the Pentagon security system, and I managed to get him off the charge.
Therefore he owes me a favour.
So, how does that help us?
- What?
- Toby the hacker?
- Toby's not the hacker.
- What?
- All right, Craig?
- All right, Sherlock?
Craig's got a dog.
So I see.
Good boy!
Hiya!
Mary?
What are you...?
No, we, we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case.
No, exactly.
So... don't wait up.
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Hey.
Mary, what are you doing here?
She's better at this than you.
- Better?
- So I texted her.
Hang on, Mary's better than me?
Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.
Of course she's better.
Yeah, OK.
Nothing personal.
What, so I'm supposed to just go home now, am I?
What do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?
- John or the dog?
- Ha-ha, that's funny!
- John.
- Well...
He's handy and loyal.
- That's hilarious.
- Is it too early for a divorce?
Oh.
Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge?
Keep up, he's fast.
- He's not moving.
- He's thinking.
He's really not moving.
Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.
You just like this dog, don't you?
- Well, I like you.
- He's still not moving.
- Fascinating.
- Oh!
Well, what do you make of it?
- They were looking for something.
- Yes, but it wasn't a burglar, they came specifically for that Thatcher bust.
Why?
Clever.
Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail,
- where would you go?
- Like hiding a tree in a forest.
Or blood in a butcher's.
Never mind, Toby, better luck next time, hmm?
This is it, though.
This is the one, I can feel it.
Not Moriarty?
It has to be him.
It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.
It's designed to beguile me, tease me and lure me in.
At last, a noose for me to put my neck into.
You should have seen the state of the front room.
- It was like The Exorcist.
- Huh.
Was Rosie's head spinning round?
- No.
Just the projectile vomiting.
- Nice!
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
- Hmm?
Noticed what?
- The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
Yeah, can't she?
I'm coming, darling.
Mummy's coming.
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here.
Have you heard of that thing?
In Germany?
You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.
Ostalgie.
People who missed the old days under the communists.
- People are weird, aren't they?
- Hmm.
According to this, there's quite a market for Cold War memorabilia.
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit?
Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.
Yes, fascinating.
Irrelevant.
Where exactly did they come from?
I've got into the records of the suppliers, Gelder and Co.
Seems they're from Georgia.
Where exactly?
Tbilisi.
Batch of six.
One to Welsborough.
One to Hassan.
One to Dr Barnicot.
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.
One to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.
Lestrade?
Another one?
- 'Yeah.'
- Harker or Sandeford?
Harker.
And it's murder this time.
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.
_
_
Defensive wounds on her face and hands, throat cut.
Sharp blade.
The same thing inside the house?
The bust?
- Two of them this time.
- Interesting.
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago.
- Limited edition of six.
- And now someone's wandering about destroying them all.
Makes no sense.
What's the point?
No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.
- Yes, it is.
- Well, it is, but it's not the point.
I've been slow, far too slow.
Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind...
Slow but lucky, very lucky.
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.
Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.
Congratulations, by the way.
- I'm sorry?
- Well, you're about to solve a big one.
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
- Yeah, until then, basically.
That's enough now, love.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.
And you need to get to bed.
Come on.
Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?
You were on the run.
Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying, it's clever.
Very clever.
But now you've met me and you're not so clever, are you?
Who are you?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.
Argh!
You're out of time.
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
- Who?
I know it's him.
It must be him.
You think you understand.
You understand nothing.
Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don't we just enjoy the moment?
Let me present Interpol's number one case.
Too tough for them, too boring for me.
The Black Pearl of the Borgias!
It's not possible!
How could she...?
!
Everything about who I was is on there.
The problems of your past are your business.
The problems of your future are my privilege.
I don't understand.
She...
She destroyed it.
She?
You know her!
You do, don't you?
You know the bitch?
!
She betrayed me.
Betrayed us all.
Mary.
This is about Mary?
Is that what she's calling herself now, eh?
- 'Armed police, you're surrounded!
'
- Give it to me.
Give it to me!
'Come out slowly, I want to see your hands above your head.'
Nobody shoots me!
Anyone shoots, I kill this man.
'Lay down your weapon.
Do it now!
'
I'm leaving this place.
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.
'Lay down your weapon.'
You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
Tell her she's a dead woman.
She's a dead woman walking.
She's my friend.
And she's under my protection.
Who are you?
I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.
Who's Sherlock Holmes?
Not a policeman.
What do you think?
Mate in two?
Don't antagonise them, darling.
Oh, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.
Everything palls.
They'll send someone soon.
They?
Who are they?
Seems to me we put an awful lot of faith in they.
Well, I've got something they would dearly love, if only we could get out of here.
I've got Ammo.
Ammo?
- Madame Ambassador.
- What took you so long?
- Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now!
Veer left!
What now?
What do we do?
We die.
Well?
He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.
- I very much doubt it.
- Why?
Because I think he used to work with Mary.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out!
We'll come back later.
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the English woman?
What would you do to a traitor?
Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.
I am an idiot, I know nothing.
Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
That was quite a text you sent me.
What's going on, Sherlock?
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,
I couldn't see what was right under my nose.
Expected a pearl.
Oh, my God, that's a...
Yes, it's an AGRA.
Memory stick, like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.
Who?
I don't know.
We...
We all had one but the others were...
Haven't you even looked at it yet?
I glanced at it but I prefer
- to hear it from you.
- Why?
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.
There were four of us, agents.
Not just agents.
Polite term.
Alex.
Gabriel.
Me.
And Ajay.
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.
We all had one.
Each containing aliases, our background, everything.
We could never be betrayed, because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.
- Who employed you?
- Anyone who paid well.
I mean, we were at the top of our game for years.
And then it all ended.
There was a coup in Georgia.
The British Embassy in Tbilisi was taken over, lots of hostages.
We got the call to go in, get them out.
There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.
- Who from?
- I don't know, just another voice on the phone.
And a codeword.
- Ammo.
- Ammo?
Like ammunition.
We went in, but then something went wrong.
Something went really wrong.
That was six years ago.
It feels like forever.
I was the only one that made it out.
No.
What?
I met someone tonight.
Same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.
What, he's alive?
Yeah, very much so.
I don't believe it, this is amazing!
I thought I was the only one,
I thought I was the only one who got out.
Where is he?
I need to see him, now!
Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?
Yeah, of course.
It was our insurance.
Above all, they mustn't fall into enemy hands.
So Ajay survived as well.
And now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide, with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why?
I don't know.
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.
Families fall out.
The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
Well, he's just trying to find me.
He survived, that's all that matters!
I heard it from his own mouth.
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."
Why would he want to kill me?
- He said you betrayed him.
- Oh, no, no, that's insane.
Well, it's what he believes.
I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.
No, Mary...
You do.
I made a vow, remember?
To look after the three of you.
Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
There's something I think you should read.
What is it?
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.
What are you...?
- Mary...
Oh, no!
- There you go.
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.
No.
You just look after them till I get back.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Agra?
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
It is 378km west of the state capital, Lucknow.
What are you, Wikipedia?
- Yes.
- AGRA is an acronym.
Oh, good, I love an acronym.
All the best secret societies have them.
Team of agents, the best.
But you know all that.
Of course I do.
Go on.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.
Indeed?
Well, that's news to me.
Is it?
He's already killed looking for that memory stick.
AGRA always worked for the highest bidder,
I thought that might include you?
- Me?
- Well, I mean the British government, or whatever government you're currently propping up.
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.
They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong.
And that was that, we stopped using freelancers.
- Your initiative?
- My initiative.
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.
I don't like loose ends.
Not on my watch.
There was something else.
A detail.
A codeword.
Ammo?
It's all I've got.
Little enough.
Could you do some digging as a favour?
You don't have many favours left.
Then I'm calling them all in.
And if you can find who's after her and neutralise them, what then?
You think you can go on saving her forever?
Of course.
Is that sentiment talking?
No, it's me.
Difficult to tell the difference these days.
Told you, I made a promise.
A vow.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.
Not on my watch.
'My darling, I need to tell you this because you mustn't hate me for going away.'
Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.
- Can you hear a squeaking?
- No.
Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel.
Why Planes Fail.
- Did you see it?
Oh, truly terrifying.
- Can't say I did.
Swore I would never fly again, yet hear I am!
Everything OK, madam?
No.
No, no, it's not, but then what's the use in complaining?
I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off is all.
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.
Oh, OK.
Relax.
She said relax.
Did you have a nice time in London?
It was OK, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun?
Did you lose it in the war?
'I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.
I'm not running, I promise you that,
I just need to do this in my own way.'
Oh, God!
I'm...
I-I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God!
- Everything OK, madam?
- I think I'm dying.
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.
God will smile on you.
'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,
I'm sorry, my love.'
I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.
Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of a dice.
I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
I swear I will.'
Not like this one.
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in!
I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.
Mr Baker.
Well, that completes the set.
- No, it does not.
- Well, who else am I missing?
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?
Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.
Oh, hi, Mary.
What concept?
Happy families.
Nice trip?
- How the f...?
- Please, Mary, there is a child present.
- How did you get in here?
- Karim let me in.
Hello.
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Nice to meet you, missus.
No, I mean how did you find me?
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
No, really, though, how?
Every movement I made was entirely random, every new personality just on the roll of a dice!
Mary, no human action is ever truly random.
An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability, mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual, can reduce the number of variables considerably.
I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine a seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.
But they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.
Oh, you bastard!
- You bastard!
- I know, but your face!
"The mathematics of probability"?
- You believed that.
- "Feasible variables"?
Yes, I started to run out about then.
In the memory stick!
Yeah, that was my idea.
- AGRA?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
You said it was your initials.
In a way that was true.
In a way?
So many lies.
I'm so sorry.
And I don't just mean you.
What?
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...
You're R?
Rosamund?
Rosamund Mary.
I always liked Mary.
Yeah, me too.
I used to.
I just...
I didn't know what else to do.
You could have stayed, you could have talked to me.
That's what couples are supposed to do.
Work things through.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Mary, I may not be a very good man but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for,
- most of the time.
- All the time.
You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.
You never judge, you never complain.
I don't deserve you, I...
All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
I will keep you safe.
But it has to be in London.
It's my city, I know the turf.
Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.
Get down!
Hello again.
- Ajay?
- Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.
Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.
I thought I was the only one who got out.
How did you find us?
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.
You found her but I found you.
So perhaps not so clever.
And now here we are.
At last.
Touche!
Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
She thought I was dead.
I might as well have been.
It was always just the four of us, always, remember?
Oh, yeah.
So why do you want to kill me?
Do you know how long they kept me prisoner?
What they did to me?
They tortured Alex to death.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.
But you?
You, where were you?
That day at the embassy, I escaped.
Ha!
But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
Where were you?
Oh, I got out.
For a while.
Long enough to hide my memory stick.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.
I was loyal, you see.
Loyal to my friends.
But they took me, tortured me.
Not for information.
Not for anything except fun.
They thought I'd give in, die, but I didn't, I lived.
And eventually, they forgot about me rotting in a cell somewhere.
Six years they kept me there.
Until one day I saw my chance.
Oh, and I made them pay.
You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.
Little whispers.
Laughter.
Gossip.
How the clever agents had been betrayed.
Brought down by you!
Me?
You know I'll kill you too.
You know I will, Ajay.
What, you think I care if I die?
I've dreamed of killing you every night for six years.
Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.
I swear to you, Ajay.
What did you hear, Ajay?
When you were a prisoner, what exactly did you hear?
What did I hear?
Ammo.
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo."
We were betrayed!
- And they said it was her?
- That you betrayed us!
They said her name?
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.
No!
No!
'The English woman, that's all he heard.
Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.'
Couldn't this wait until you're back?
No, it's not over.
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed, the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.
There was only a voice on the phone.
'Remember?
And a codeword.'
"Ammo," yes, you said.
How's your Latin, brother dear?
My Latin?
Amo, amas, amat.
I love, you love, he loves.
What...?
Not "Ammo" as in ammunition, but "Amo", meaning?
You'd better be right, Sherlock.
Bloody thing!
What's going on?
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.
What?
'So many lies.
And I don't just mean you.'
- Hello.
- Ah, hello.
- I like your daisy.
- Thank you, yeah.
It's not really me, though, I think.
- No?
- No, no, it's too floral for me.
I'm more of a "knackered with weary old eyes" kind of guy.
Well, I think they're nice.
Nice eyes.
- Thank you.
- Look...
Look...
I don't normally do this,
- but, um...
- But you're going to.
Yeah.
- What's this?
- This is me.
- Thank you.
Cheers.
- Yeah.
Great.
- Bye!
- Bye.
_
_
_
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
Hmm?
Noticed what?
The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
- Yeah, can't she?
- Hmm.
I'm coming darling.
I'm coming.
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
- _
- Come here...
It's OK.
_
- _
- Do you want a cuddle?
_
I know.
- Oh, sweetheart.
- _
_
Ssh.
Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you?
_
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?
Oh, let's go and see Daddy!
Daddy's here.
It's OK, Rosie.
I'll take her.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I may as well get up now.
Hey, baby, it's Daddy.
Your daddy.
Come here, Rose.
Come here, darling, it's all right.
Thank you.
_
_
This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.
How many more times?
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.
And you're basing all this on a code name?
On a whispered voice on the telephone?
Come on, Mycroft.
You were the conduit for AGRA.
Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
It was my job.
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
AGRA went in.
- Yes.
- And they were betrayed.
Not by me.
Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.
I promise you,
I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.
You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.
Not one.
Not.
One.
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories?
I'd like to do those.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.
Although she does seem to enjoy them.
Well, I'll have to give that a go.
Got a lot to catch up on.
'You think you understand.
You understand nothing.'
'Code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love.'
'You'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.
'They know everything.'
'They said it was the English woman.'
'Don't minute any of this.'
'They know everything.'
- You don't make it easy, do you?
- What do you mean?
Well, being... being so perfect.
Mary, I...
I need to tell you...
Hang on.
Can you tell me later?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Great.
Well, no, we can't just go.
- Rosie.
- Yeah.
- Er, you go.
- No!
I'll come as soon as I've found someone.
Mrs Hudson.
- Corfu till Saturday.
Molly?
- Er, yeah, I'll try.
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.
You know that's not going to happen.
If there's more to this case, you need to see it.
Yeah, OK, you win.
'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes.
'Please make your way to the exit.
Thank you.'
Your office said I'd find you here.
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.
We're like them.
Ghostly, living in the shadows.
Predatory?
Well, it depends which side you're on.
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.
Nice location for the final act, couldn't have chosen it better myself.
But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.
I just come here to look at the fish.
I knew this would happen one day.
- It's like that old story.
- I really am a very busy man.
Would you mind cutting to the chase?
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
With good reason.
"There was once a merchant, in a famous market in Baghdad."
I really have never liked this story.
I'm just like the merchant in the story,
I thought I could out-run the inevitable.
I've always been looking over my shoulder, always expecting to see the grim figure of...
Death.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hey.
- John?
- On his way.
Let me introduce Ammo.
You were Ammo?
You were the person on the phone that time?
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
Why did you betray us?
Why does anyone do anything?
- Hmm.
- Let me guess, selling secrets?
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.
Worked very well for a few years.
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it.
But...
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.
I couldn't believe my luck!
That bought me a little time.
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
Very handy.
They were always such reliable killers.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.
Lady Smallwood gave the order.
But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.
Seemed to do the trick.
And you thought your troubles were over.
I was tired.
Tired of the mess of it all.
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.
The hostages were killed.
AGRA too.
Or so I thought.
My secret was safe.
But... apparently not.
Just a little peace.
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
A family?
Home?
Really, I understand.
So, just let me get out of here, right?
Let me just walk away.
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.
What do you say?
After what you did?
!
Mary, no!
OK.
London Aquarium.
Yes, now.
I was never a field agent.
I always thought I'd be rather good.
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
Thanks.
- For a secretary.
- What?
It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
- I didn't do this out of jealousy.
- No?
Same old drudge, day in, day out.
Never getting out there where all the excitement was.
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.
Yes, your little flat.
- How do you know?
- Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?
And what are you, widowed or divorced?
Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.
That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.
- Sherlock...
- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.
A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.
- Sherlock, don't.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.
There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
That accounts for the drink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.
So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.
To prove how good you are.
To make up for the inadequacies of your...
little life.
Well, Mrs Norbury,
I must admit this is unexpected.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.
All except Sherlock Holmes.
There's no way out.
So it would seem.
You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.
It's what I do.
Maybe I can still surprise you.
Now, come on, be sensible.
Hmm, no, I don't think so.
Ah!
Surprise!
Everything's fine.
It's going to be OK.
Get an ambulance!
It's all right, it's all right.
- Mary!
- John.
All right, Mary?
Mary?
Stay with me, stay with me.
- Oh, come on...
- No, don't worry.
Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
Come on, Mary.
Mary?
Oh, God.
John, I think this is it.
No, no, no, no.
It's not.
- That's...
- You made me so happy.
You gave me everything I could ever, ever have wanted...
Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.
- Look after Rosie.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.
- Promise me.
- I promise.
- No...
- Yes, I promise.
- Promise me!
- I promise, I promise.
Ssh, ssh.
Hey, Sherlock.
Yes.
I... so like you.
Did I ever say?
Yes, yes, you did.
I'm sorry for... for shooting you that time.
I'm really sorry.
It's all right.
I think we're even now, OK?
OK.
- Oh, I think we're...
- Mary, Mary...
- ...even, definitely even.
- Ssh, ssh.
You were my whole world.
Being Mary Watson was the only life worth living.
- Mary...
- Thank you.
Mary...
Don't you dare!
You made a vow.
You swore it.
'You've been having dreams.
A recurring dream?
'
Do you want to talk about it?
This is a two-way relationship, you know.
The whole world has come crashing down around you.
Everything's hopeless.
Irretrievable.
I know that's what you must feel but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
That's not really my style.
I need to know what to do.
Do?
About John.
Put me through to Sherrinford, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
But nothing will ever be the same again, will it?
I'm afraid it won't.
We'll have to rally round, I expect, do our bit.
Look after little Rosie.
I'm just going to, um look through these things.
There might be a case.
A case?
Oh, you're not up to it, are you?
Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.
Yes.
Yes, I expect you're right.
I'll make some tea, shall I?
- Mrs Hudson?
- Yes, Sherlock?
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident...
- Yes?
- ...would you just say the word Norbury to me?
Would you?
Norbury?
Just that.
I'd be very grateful.
What's this?
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.
Oh, God!
Is that...?
- Must be.
- Oh.
I knew it wouldn't end like this.
I knew Moriarty made plans.
'I thought that would get your attention.
So, this is in case...
In case the day comes.
If you are watching this, I'm probably dead.
I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows?
Nothing's certain, nothing's written.
My old life it was full of consequences.
The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.
You need to remember that.
So I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
Might be the hardest case of your career.
When I'm... gone, if I'm gone I need you to do something for me.'
Hi.
I just wondered how things were going and if there was anything I could do.
It's, er, it's from John.
- Right.
- You don't need to read it now.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.
He says...
John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...
Yes?
He said he'd that he'd rather have anyone but you.

My brother is a murderer.
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.

I see.
Who is supposed to have shot him, then?
Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger - that's who.
- That's not what happened at all.
- It is now.
Remarkable.
How did you do it?
We have some very talented people working here.
If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.
That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.
No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.
You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.
You're home and dry.
OK, cheers.
Obviously, there's unfinished business.
Moriarty.
I told you
- Moriarty's dead.
You say he filmed that video message before he died.
Yes.
You also say you know what he's going to do next.
- What does that mean?
- Perhaps that's all there is to it.
Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
No, no, he would never be that disappointing.
He's planned something, something long-term.
Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.
Posthumous revenge.
No, better than that - posthumous game.
We brought you back to deal with this.
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.
Wait?
!
Of course wait.
I'm the target - targets wait.
Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up,
I'll know when it begins.
I always know when the game is on.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because I love it.
There was once a merchant, in the famous market at Baghdad.
WATER SLOSHES One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise, and he knew that the stranger was Death.
Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles, to the city of Samarra.
For there he was sure Death could not find him.
But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.
"Very well," said the merchant. "I give in.
I am yours."
"But tell me, why did you look surprised
"when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"
"Because," said Death,
"I had an appointment with you tonight...
"..in Samarra."
If this gets any better, I'm going to get two knives.
Pays to advertise.
- So, what about Moriarty, then?
- Oh, I have a plan.
I'm going to monitor the underworld, every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
So, basically, your plan is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do?
Awesome, isn't it?
He drowned, Mr Holmes.
That's what we thought.
- But when they opened up his lungs...
- Yes?
- ..sand.
Superficial.

Oh, look!
Hello!
'Hey, Dad.
Happy birthday.
'Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?
'
No!
Picture's frozen!
'Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you.'
Why is it rubbish?
Where are you?
- How is he?
Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.
- No...
- MAN:
- David?
Come on!
OK, no, hang on a sec, I'll find somewhere quieter.
So, Charlie, where are you?
Are you there?
- 'Sorry, I'm here.
I'm just a bit...'
- Are you all right?
- 'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
- Altitude?
- 'I'm in Tibet.
Didn't you see the mountains?
'
- Never mind mountains.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.
- 'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?
'
- What?
- 'Could you just check something on my car?
'
- Your car?
'To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe
'I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet.
- 'Could you take a photo and send it?

Charlie?
- LESTRADE:
- A week later...
Yeah?
..something really weird happens.
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed, the cops are chasing him, and he turns into the drive of the Welsborough house to try and get away.
Unfortunately...
The drunk guy survived, they managed to pull him out, but when they put the fire out and examined the parked car...
Whose body?
Charlie Welsborough, the son.
- What?
- The son who was in Tibet.
DNA all checks out.
Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.
SHERLOCK CHUCKLES
- Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
- Have you got a lab report?
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.
- The seats?
- Yes, the car seats.
Made of vinyl.
Two different types of vinyl present.
Was it his own car?
Yeah, not flash - he was a student.
- Well, that's suggestive.
- Why?
- Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
- Yeah, right?
- There's something else.
- Yes?
According to this,
Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.
What?
The body in the car, dead for a week.
Oh, this is a good one.
Is it my birthday?
You want help?
- Yes, please.
- One condition.
- OK.
Take all the credit.
It gets boring if I just solve them all.
Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.
He's got a point.
Which makes me look like some kind of prima donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do!
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.
- Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
- Definitely a sore spot.
- So you take all the glory, thanks...
- OK!
- ..thanks all the same.
Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?
It's driving me nuts.
Anything you say, Giles.
Just kidding.

What's his name?
- HE MOUTHS:
- Greg.
- What?
Greg.
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?
Not a clue.
It's just you normally say that at this point.
Hmm.
Well, then, let's hope you solve your little problem, Greg.
- Hear that?
- I know.
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood?
- Oh, good, great.
Yeah, amazing.
- Getting any sleep?
- Christ, no.
You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.
- Must feel very different...
- Sorry, what?
Yes, well, you know how it is.
All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.
- Are you two having a little joke?
- Never a word of thanks.
Can't even tell people's faces apart.
This is a joke, isn't it?
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever.
You're so, so clever."
- Is it about me?
- I think he needs winding.
- You know, I think that really might be it.
- No, don't get it.
Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect,
- so go easy on them, yeah?

'What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it?
'And what are you going to call this one?

Oh, the Ghost Driver.
- Don't give it a title.
- People like the titles.
- They hate the titles.
- Give the people what they want.
No, never do that - people are stupid.
Uh, SOME people.
'All people are stupid.
'Most people.'
'Bizarre enough though, isn't it, to be him?
'
I mean, it's right up your strasse.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry
- to hear about your daughter.
- Son.
- Son!
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.
If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.
Well, I believe that I... ..can.
- DISTORTED:
- But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
Sherlock?
Mr Holmes?
Sorry, you were saying?
Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
I don't think we'll ever get over this.
No.
Shouldn't think so.
So sorry, will you excuse me a moment?
I just...
I'll...
I'll just, um...
Ahem.
- Now what's wrong?
- Not sure, I just...
By the pricking of my thumbs.
Seriously?
You?
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.
They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.
What is this?
Oh, it's a sort of shrine, I suppose, really.
Bit of a fan of Mrs T.
A big hero of mine when I was getting started.
Right, yes.
- Who?
- What?
- Who...?
Who was this?
- Are you serious?
- Sherlock...
- It's...
It's Margaret Thatcher, the first female Prime Minister of this country.
Right.
- Prime Minister?
- Hmm.
Leader of the Government.
- Right.
- Female?
- For God's sake!
You know perfectly well who she is.
Why are you playing for time?
It's the gap, look at the gap.
It's wrong.
Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed.
The whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.
This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been in, this picture is straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.
- Something's missing from here, but only recently.
- Yes, a...
- Plaster bust.
- ..plaster bust.
- Oh, for God's sake!
It got broken.
What the hell has this got to do with Charlie?
- Rug!
- What?
- Well, how could it get broken?
The only place for it to fall is the floor and there is a big thick rug.
- Does it matter?
- Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.
- It is worth letting him do this.
- Is your friend quite mad?
No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
We found the remains out there in the porch.
- The porch where we came in?
- How anybody could hate her so much they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness...
I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.
Why didn't he smash all the others?
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.
Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.
- And if there's nothing...
- I know what happened to your son.
You do?
It's quite simple, superficial, to be blunt.
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness?
- Well, yes.
- And the porch where it was smashed,
I noticed the motion sensor was damaged,
- so I assume it's permanently lit.
- How did you notice that?
I lack the arrogance to ignore details
- I'm not the police.
- So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.
- Exactly.
- Why?
- Don't know.
Wouldn't be fun if I knew.
Mr Holmes, please!
It was your 50th birthday, Mr Welsborough, of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
- After all, he was in Tibet.
- Yes.
- No.
- No?
CROWD: # Happy birthday... #
The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video.
Easily arranged.
It's a Skype call.
The trick was meant to be a surprise.
- A trick?
- Obviously.
Could you take a photo and send it?
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.
Well, good enough.
Effectively a costume.
You're joking?
No, I'm not.
All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
- Oh, my God!
- Surprise!
That's when it happened.
I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.
You said he'd felt unwell?
You all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
He died there and then.
No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained, in the driver's seat, hidden, until...
When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who'd been sitting there, quite dead, for a week.
Oh, God!
Poor kid.
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.
This is where it was smashed.
- That was amazing.
- What?
- The car, the kid.
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?
I can't stand it, never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
What kind of a life would that be?
Besides, I have the strangest feeling...
Miss me?
- That's mine.
You two take a...bus.
- Why?
I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.
The Mall, please.
- I met her once.
- Thatcher?
- Rather arrogant, I thought.
- YOU thought that?
!
- Ha, I know.
Why am I looking at this?
That's her, John and Mary's baby.
Oh, I see, yes.
Looks very...fully functioning.
Is that really the best you can do?
Sorry, I've never been very good with them.
- Babies?
- Humans.
Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?
Any interest in her?
Why on earth would he?
I don't know.
You tell me.
In the last year of his life,
James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over 70 assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias,
which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.
It's a pearl - get another one.
There's something important about this.
I'm sure.
Maybe it's Moriarty.
Maybe it's not.
WATER SLOSHES
But something's coming.
Are you having a premonition, brother mine?
The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other.
What we call premonition is just movement of the web.
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable.
As inevitable as mathematics.
- Appointment In Samarra.
- I'm sorry?
The merchant who can't outrun Death.
You always hated that story as a child.
Less keen on predestination back then.
I'm not sure I like it now.
You wrote your own version, as I remember.
Appointment In Sumatra.
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.
Goodnight, Mycroft.
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.
- Keep me informed.
- Of what?
- Absolutely no idea.
'Ammo!
'
MAN SHUDDERS
- Oh, hi, Stella.
- Greg.
- You, uh...?
- Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...
- Right, right, right...
Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?
It's nothing.
I mean it's nothing serious.
- No, no.
- I just pop round every now and again for a chat.
Yeah, of course.
I mean he loves a really tricky case.
Yeah, he does!
So what you here for?
Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so...
The Borgia Pearl?
They still after that, are they?
Yeah.
So, how did you two first meet?
Oh, well, there was a case about, um, ten years ago.
Nobody could figure it out.
There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.
- Oh, yeah?
How did she die?
- Hypothermia.
What?
I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...
Will you two please keep it down?
!
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?
You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.
I was a carpenter.
Like me dad.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
How the hell...?
Ah...e-cigarettes.
Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.
If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.
But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last.
Anything to add, John?
- John?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.
- What is that?
- That is...me.
Well, it's a me substitute.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You know I value your little contributions.
Yeah?
It's been there since nine this morning.
- Has it?
Where were you?
- Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.
- What about my girlfriend?
- What?
- You said I had an ex...
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.
The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.
I...
I thought you'd done something clever.
Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?
SHERLOCK INHALES DEEPLY
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
What do you mean?
Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
- Well...
- You thought she was having an affair.
I'm afraid it's far worse than that - your wife is a spy.
- What?
- That's right.
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy, across the road from your flat.
Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy, as part of an official state visit.
As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.
This drug will render the President entirely susceptible
- to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty.
- What?
Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III.
- Are you serious?
- No, of course not.
His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.
I don't!
- Just the bras.
- Get out.
So, what's this all about, then?
- Having fun.
- Fun?
- While I can.
- Mm-hmm.
KNOCK AT DOOR
- Uh, Sherlock...
- Borgia Pearl.
Boring.
Go!
- But...
- Go!
- This had better be good.
- Oh, I think you'll like it.
That is the bust, isn't it?
The one that was broken.
No, it's another one - different owner.
Different part of town.
You were right - this is a thing.
Something's going on.
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be pleased.
- I am pleased.
- You don't look pleased.
This is my game face.
And the game is on.
Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one.
- One belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan.
- Identical busts?
Yeah, and this one to a Dr Barnicot in Holborn.
Three in total.
God knows who'd want to do something like this.
Yeah, but some people have that complex, don't they?
An idee fixe.
They obsess over one thing and they can't let it go.
No, no good.
There were other images of Margaret...
Margaret...?
You know who she is.
..Thatcher, present at the first break-in.
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?
Ooh!
- What?
- Blood.
Quite a bit of it, too.
Was there any injury at the crime scene?
Nah.
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.
- Come on.
- Holborn?
- Lambeth!
- Lambeth?
Why?
- To see Toby.
Ah, right.
Who?
- You'll see.
- Right, are you coming?
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.
- Who told you?
- The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.
- Have a good time.
- I will.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
- What?
- She's not the one.
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.
How do you work all that out?
She's got three children in Rio that he doesn't know about.
- Are you just making this up?
- Possibly.
- Who's Toby?
There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker, one of the world's best.
Got himself into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago.
He hacked into the Pentagon security system, and I managed to get him off the charge.
Therefore he owes me a favour.
- So, how does that help us?
- What?
- Toby the hacker?
- Toby's not the hacker.
- What?
- All right, Craig?
- All right, Sherlock?
Craig's got a dog.
So I see.
Good boy!
Hiya!
Mary?
What are you...?
No, we, we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case.
No, exactly.
So...don't wait up.
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Hey.
- Mary, what are you doing here?
- She's better at this than you.
- Better?
- So I texted her.
Hang on, Mary's better than me?
Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.
- Of course she's better.
- Yeah, OK.
- Nothing personal.
What, so I'm supposed to just go home now, am I?
What do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?
- John or the dog?
- Ha-ha, that's funny!
- John.
- Well...
- He's handy and loyal.
- That's hilarious.
- Hmm.
- Is it too early for a divorce?
- Oh.
- Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge?
Keep up, he's fast.
- He's not moving.
- He's thinking.
He's really not moving.
Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.
You just like this dog, don't you?
- Well, I like you.
- He's still not moving.
- Fascinating.
- Oh!
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT
Well, what do you make of it?
- They were looking for something.
- Yes, but it wasn't a burglar, they came specifically for that Thatcher bust.
Why?
DOG SNIFFS
DOG WHINES
Clever.
Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail,
- where would you go?
- Like hiding a tree in a forest.
Or blood in a butcher's.
Never mind, Toby, better luck next time, hmm?
This is it, though.
This is the one, I can feel it.
Not Moriarty?
It has to be him.
It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.
It's designed to beguile me, tease me and lure me in.
At last, a noose for me to put my neck into.
You should have seen the state of the front room.
- It was like The Exorcist.
- Huh.
Was Rosie's head spinning round?
- No.
Just the projectile vomiting.
- Nice!
- Hmm.
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
- Hmm?
Noticed what?
- The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
BABY CRIES
Yeah, can't she?
I'm coming, darling.
Mummy's coming.
- LOVINGLY:
- Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here.
Have you heard of that thing?
In Germany?
You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.
Ostalgie.
People who missed the old days under the communists.
- People are weird, aren't they?
- Hmm.
According to this, there's quite a market for Cold War memorabilia.
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit?
Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.
Yes, fascinating.
Irrelevant.
Where exactly did they come from?
I've got into the records of the suppliers
- Gelder and Co.
Seems they're from Georgia.
Where exactly?
Tbilisi.
Batch of six.
One to Welsborough.
One to Hassan.
One to Dr Barnicot.
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.
One to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.
Lestrade?
Another one?
- 'Yeah.'
- Harker or Sandeford?
Harker.
And it's murder this time.
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.
Defensive wounds on her face and hands, throat cut.
Sharp blade.
The same thing inside the house?
The bust?
- Two of them this time.
- Interesting.
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago.
- Limited edition of six.
- And now someone's wandering about destroying them all.
Makes no sense.
What's the point?
No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.
- Yes, it is.
- Well, it is, but it's not the point.
I've been slow, far too slow.
Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind...
Slow but lucky, very lucky.
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.
Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.
Congratulations, by the way.
- I'm sorry?
- Well, you're about to solve a big one.
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
- Yeah, until then, basically.
WATER SPLASHING
That's enough now, love.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.
And you need to get to bed.
Come on.
Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?
You were on the run.
Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying, it's clever.
Very clever.
But now you've met me and you're not so clever, are you?
Who are you?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.
Argh!
You're out of time.
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
- Who?
I know it's him.
It must be him.
You think you understand.
You understand nothing.
Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don't we just enjoy the moment?
Let me present Interpol's number one case.
Too tough for them, too boring for me.
The Black Pearl of the Borgias!
It's not possible!
How could she...?
!
Everything about who I was is on there.
The problems of your past are your business.
The problems of your future... ..are my privilege.
I don't understand.
She...
She destroyed it.
She?
You know her!
You do, don't you?
You know the bitch?
!
She betrayed me.
- Betrayed us all.
- Mary.
This is about Mary?
Is that what she's calling herself now, eh?
- 'Armed police, you're surrounded!
'
- Give it to me.
- YELLS:
- Give it to me!
'Come out slowly, I want to see your hands above your head.'
Nobody shoots me!
Anyone shoots, I kill this man.
'Lay down your weapon.
Do it now!
'
I'm leaving this place.
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.
'Lay down your weapon.'
You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
Tell her she's a dead woman.
She's a dead woman walking.
She's my friend.
And she's under my protection.
Who are you?
I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.
Who's Sherlock Holmes?
Not a policeman.
ALARM BLARES
What do you think?
Mate in two?
Don't antagonise them, darling.
Oh, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.
Everything palls.
They'll send someone soon.
They?
Who are THEY?
Seems to me we put an awful lot of faith in THEY.
Well, I've got something THEY would dearly love, if only we could get out of here.
I've got Ammo.
Ammo?
- MARY:
- Madame Ambassador.
- What took you so long?
- Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now!
Veer left!
SCREAMING
HE LAUGHS
What now?
What do we do?
We die.
Well?
He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.
- I very much doubt it.
- Why?
Because I think he used to work with Mary.
GUNFIRE
SHOUTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out!
We'll come back later.
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the English woman?
What would you do to a traitor?
Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.
HE CHUCKLES
I am an idiot, I know nothing.
Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
That was quite a text you sent me.
What's going on, Sherlock?
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,
I couldn't see what was right under my nose.
Expected a pearl.
Oh, my God, that's a...
Yes, it's an AGRA. memory stick, like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.
Who?
I don't know.
We...
We all had one but the others were...
Haven't you even looked at it yet?
- I glanced at it but I prefer to hear it from you.
- Why?
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.
There were four of us, agents.
Not just agents.
Polite term.
Alex.
Gabriel.
Me.
And Ajay.
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.
We all had one.
Each containing aliases, our background, everything.
We could never be betrayed, because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.
- Who employed you?
- Anyone who paid well.
I mean, we were at the top of our game for years.
And then it all ended.
There was a coup in Georgia.
The British Embassy in Tbilisi was taken over, lots of hostages.
We got the call to go in, get them out.
There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.
- Who from?
- I don't know, just another voice on the phone.
And a codeword.
- Ammo.
- Ammo?
Like ammunition.
We went in, but then something went wrong.
Something went really wrong.
GUNFIRE, SCREAMING
That was six years ago.
It feels like forever.
I was the only one that made it out.
No.
What?
I met someone tonight.
Same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.
What, he's alive?
Yeah, very much so.
I don't believe it, this is amazing!
I thought I was the only one,
I thought I was the only one who got out.
Where is he?
I need to see him, now!
Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?
Yeah, of course.
It was our insurance.
Above all, they mustn't fall into enemy hands.
So Ajay survived as well.
And now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide, with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why?
I don't know.
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
SHE LAUGHS
Sorry, no, no, because we...we were family.
Families fall out.
The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
Well, he's just trying to find me.
He survived, that's all that matters!
I heard it from his own mouth.
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."
Why would he want to kill me?
- He said you betrayed him.
- Oh, no, no, that's insane.
Well, it's what he believes.
SHE GASPS
I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.
No, Mary...
You do.
I made a vow, remember?
To look after the three of you.
Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
There's something I think you should read.
What is it?
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.
What are you...?
HE SNIFFS
- Mary...
- There you go.
- Oh, no!
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.
No.
You just look after them till I get back.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
CHILD SINGS
HE GROANS
Agra?
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
It is 378km west of the state capital, Lucknow.
What are you, Wikipedia?
- Yes.
- AGRA is an acronym.
Oh, good, I love an acronym.
All the best secret societies have them.
Team of agents, the best.
But you know all that.
Of course I do.
Go on.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.
Indeed?
Well, that's news to me.
Is it?
He's already killed looking for that memory stick.
AGRA always worked for the highest bidder,
I thought that might include you?
- Me?
- Well, I mean the British government, or whatever government you're currently propping up.
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.
They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong.
And that was that, we stopped using freelancers.
- Your initiative?
- My initiative.
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.
I don't like loose ends.
Not on my watch.
There was something else.
A detail.
A codeword.
Ammo?
It's all I've got.
Little enough.
Could you do some digging as a favour?
You don't have many favours left.
Then I'm calling them all in.
And if you can find who's after her and neutralise them, what then?
You think you can go on saving her forever?
Of course.
Is that sentiment talking?
No, it's me.
Difficult to tell the difference these days.
Told you, I made a promise.
A vow.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.
Not on my watch.
- MARY:
- 'My darling, I need to tell you this 'because you mustn't hate me for going away.'
- NEW YORK ACCENT:
- Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.
- Can you hear a squeaking?
- No.
Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel -
Why Planes Fail.
- Did you see it?
- Can't say I did.
- Oh, truly terrifying.
Swore I would never fly again, yet hear I am!
Ha.
Everything OK, madam?
No.
No, no, it's not, but then what's the use in complaining?
I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off is all.
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.
Oh, OK.
Relax.
- She said relax.
- SHE CHUCKLES
Did you have a nice time in London?
It was OK, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun?
- Did you lose it in the war?
- SHE LAUGHS
'I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.
'I'm not running, I promise you that,
'I just need to do this in my own way.'
Oh, God!
I'm...
I-I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God!
FLIGHT ATTENDANT BUTTON BEEPS
- Everything OK, madam?
- I think I'm dying.
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.
God will smile on you.
'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,
'I'm sorry, my love.'
'I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.
'Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate 'the roll of a dice.
'I need to move the target far, far away from you 'and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
'I swear I will.'
LAUGHTER
Not like this one.
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in!
I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.
Mr Baker.
Well, that completes the set.
- No, it does not.
- Well, who else am I missing?
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?
Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.
Oh, hi, Mary.
What concept?
Happy families.
Nice trip?
- How the f...?
- Please, Mary, there is a child present.
- How did you get in here?
- Karim let me in.
Hello.
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Nice to meet you, missus.
No, I mean how did you find me?
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
No, really, though, how?
Every movement I made was entirely random, every new personality just on the roll of a dice!
Mary, no human action is ever truly random.
An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability, mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual, can reduce the number of variables considerably.
I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine a seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.
But they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.
HE CHUCKLES
- JOKINGLY:
- Oh, you bastard!
- ANGRILY:
- You bastard!
- I know, but your face!
"The mathematics of probability"?
- You believed that.
- "Feasible variables"?
Yes, I started to run out about then.
In the memory stick!
Yeah, that was my idea.
- AGRA?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
You said it was your initials.
In a way that was true.
In a way?
So many lies.
I'm so sorry.
And I don't just mean you.
What?
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...
You're R?
Rosamund?
Rosamund Mary.
I always liked Mary.
Yeah, me too.
I used to.
I just...
I didn't know what else to do.
You could have stayed, you could have talked to me.
That's what couples are supposed to do.
Work things through.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Mary, I may not be a very good man... ..but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for,
- most of the time.
- All the time.
You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.
You never judge, you never complain.
I don't deserve you, I...
All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
I will keep you safe.
But it has to be in London.
It's my city, I know the turf.
Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.
Get down!
RAPID GUNFIRE
Hello again.
- Ajay?
- Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.
Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.
I thought I was the only one who got out.
How did you find us?
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.
You found her but I found you.
So perhaps not so clever.
And now here we are.
At last.
- HE CHUCKLES
- Touche!
Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
She thought I was dead.
I might as well have been.
It was always just the four of us, always, remember?
Oh, yeah.
So why do you want to kill me?
Do you know how long they kept me prisoner?
What they did to me?
They tortured Alex to death.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.
But you?
You, where were you?
That day at the embassy, I escaped.
Ha!
But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
Where were you?
Oh, I got out.
For a while.
Long enough to hide my memory stick.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.
- I - was loyal, you see.
Loyal to my friends.
But they took me, tortured me.
Not for information.
Not for anything except fun.
They thought I'd give in, die, but I didn't, I lived.
And eventually, they forgot about me rotting in a cell somewhere.
Six years they kept me there.
Until one day I saw my chance.
Oh, and I made them pay.
You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.
Little whispers.
Laughter.
Gossip.
How the clever agents had been betrayed.
Brought down by you!
- Me?
- TRAIN WHISTLES
You know I'll kill you too.
You know I will, Ajay.
What, you think I care if I die?
I've dreamed of killing you... ..every night for six years.
Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.
I swear to you, Ajay.
What did you hear, Ajay?
When you were a prisoner, what EXACTLY did you hear?
What did I hear?
Ammo.
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo.
"Ammo.
"Ammo.
Ammo."
We were betrayed!
- And they said it was her?
- That you betrayed us!
They said her name?
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.
No!
No!
'The English woman, that's all he heard.
'Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.'
Couldn't this wait until you're back?
No, it's not over.
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed, the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.
There was only a voice on the phone.
'Remember?
And a codeword.'
"Ammo," yes, you said.
How's your Latin, brother dear?
My Latin?
Amo, amas, amat.
I love, you love, he loves.
What...?
Not "Ammo" as in ammunition, but "Amo", meaning?
You'd better be right, Sherlock.
Bloody thing!
What's going on?
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.
What?
'So many lies.
And I don't just mean you.'
- Hello.
- Ah, hello.
- I like your daisy.
- Thank you, yeah.
- It's not really me, though, I think.
- No?
- No, no, it's too floral for me.
I'm more of a "knackered with weary old eyes" kind of guy.
Well, I think they're nice.
Nice eyes.
- HE LAUGHS
- Thank you.
- Look...
Look...
I don't normally do this,
- but, um...
- But you're going to.
Yeah.
- What's this?
- This is me.
- Thank you.
Cheers.
- Yeah.
Great.
- Bye!
- Bye.
HE CHUCKLES
PHONE BEEPS
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
Hmm?
Noticed what?
The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
BABY CRIES
- Yeah, can't she?
- Hmm.
I'm coming darling.
I'm coming.
PHONE BEEPS
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here...
It's OK.
Do you want a cuddle?
BABY CONTINUES TO WAIL
I know.
Oh, sweetheart.
Ssh.
Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you?
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?
Oh, let's go and see Daddy!
Daddy's here.
It's OK, Rosie.
I'll take her.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I may as well get up now.
Hey, baby, it's Daddy.
Your daddy.
Come here, Rose.
Come here, darling, it's all right.
Thank you.
This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.
How many more times?
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.
And you're basing all this on a code name?
On a whispered voice on the telephone?
Come on, Mycroft.
You were the conduit for AGRA.
Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
It was my job.
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
AGRA went in.
- Yes.
- And they were betrayed.
Not by me.
Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.
I promise you,
I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.
You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.
Not one.
Not.
One.
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories?
I'd like to do those.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.
Although she does seem to enjoy them.
Well, I'll have to give that a go.
Got a lot to catch up on.
- AJAY:
- 'You think you understand.
You understand nothing.'
- MYCROFT:
- 'Code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love.'
- MARY:
- 'You'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.
'They know everything.'
'They said it was the English woman.'
'Don't minute any of this.'
'They know everything.'
- You don't make it easy, do you?
- What do you mean?
Well, being...being so perfect.
Mary, I...
I need to tell you...
- PHONE BEEPS
- Hang on.
Can you tell me later?
- Yeah.
- Great.
- Yeah.
Well, no, we can't just go.
- Rosie.
- Yeah.
- Er, you go.
- No!
I'll come as soon as I've found someone
- Mrs Hudson.
- Corfu till Saturday.
Molly?
- Er, yeah, I'll try.
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.
You know that's not going to happen.
If there's more to this case, you need to see it.
Yeah, OK, you win.
'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes.
'Please make your way to the exit.
Thank you.'
Your office said I'd find you here.
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.
We're like them.
Ghostly, living in the shadows.
Predatory?
Well, it depends which side you're on.
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.
Nice location for the final act, couldn't have chosen it better myself.
But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.
I just come here to look at the fish.
I knew this would happen one day.
- It's like that old story.
- I really am a very busy man.
Would you mind cutting to the chase?
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
With good reason.
"There was once a merchant, in a famous market in Baghdad."
I really have never liked this story.
I'm just like the merchant in the story,
I thought I could out-run the inevitable.
I've always been looking over my shoulder,
- always expecting to see the grim figure of...
- Death.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hey.
- John?
- On his way.
Let me introduce Ammo.
You were Ammo?
You were the person on the phone that time?
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
Why did you betray us?
Why does anyone do anything?
Hmm.
Let me guess, selling secrets?
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.
Worked very well for a few years.
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it.
But...
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.
- SHE CHUCKLES
- I couldn't believe my luck!
That bought me a little time.
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
Very handy.
They were always such reliable killers.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.
Lady Smallwood gave the order.
But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.
Seemed to do the trick.
And you thought your troubles were over.
I was tired.
Tired of the mess of it all.
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.
The hostages were killed.
AGRA too.
Or so I thought.
My secret was safe.
But...apparently not.
Just a little peace.
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
A family?
Home?
Really, I understand.
So, just let me get out of here, right?
Let me just walk away.
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.
What do you say?
After what you did?
!
Mary, no!
OK.
London Aquarium.
Yes, now.
I was never a field agent.
I always thought I'd be rather good.
MARY SCOFFS
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
Thanks.
- For a secretary.
- What?
It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
- I didn't do this out of jealousy.
- No?
Same old drudge, day in, day out.
Never getting out there where all the excitement was.
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.
- Yes, your little flat.
- How do you know?
- Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?
And what are you, widowed or divorced?
Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.
That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.
- Sherlock...
- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.
A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.
- Sherlock, don't.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.
There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
That accounts for the drink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.
So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.
To prove how good you are.
To make up for the inadequacies of your...
little life.
Well, Mrs Norbury,
I must admit this is unexpected.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.
All except Sherlock Holmes.
There's no way out.
So it would seem.
You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.
It's what I do.
Maybe I can still surprise you.
Now, come on, be sensible.
Hmm, no, I don't think so.
- Ah!
- Surprise!
MARY GASPS FOR AIR
MARY GROANS
Everything's fine.
It's going to be OK.
Get an ambulance!
- It's all right, it's all right.
- Mary!
- John.
All right, Mary?
Mary?
Stay with me, stay with me.
- Oh, come on...
- No, don't worry.
Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
Come on, Mary.
Mary?
Oh, God.
John, I think this is it.
No, no, no, no.
It's not.
- That's...
- You made me so happy.
You gave me everything I could ever, ever have wanted...
Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.
- Look after Rosie.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.
- Promise me.
- I promise.
- No...
- Yes, I promise.
- Promise me!
- I promise, I promise.
Ssh, ssh.
Hey, Sherlock.
Yes.
I... so like you.
Did I ever say?
Yes, yes, you did.
I'm sorry for...for shooting you that time.
I'm really sorry.
- It's all right.
- I think we're even now, OK?
OK.
- Oh, I think we're...
- Mary, Mary...
- ..even, definitely even.
- Ssh, ssh.
- Ooh.
You were my whole world.
Being Mary Watson... ..was the only life worth living.
- Mary...
- Thank you.
Mary...
HE BEWAILS
Don't you dare!
You made a vow.
You swore it.
PHONE BEEPS REPEATEDLY
'You've been having dreams.
A recurring dream?
'
CLOCK TICKS RHYTHMICALLY
Do you want to talk about it?
This is a two-way relationship, you know.
SHE SIGHS
The whole world has come crashing down around you.
Everything's hopeless.
Irretrievable.
I know that's what you must feel... ..but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
That's not really my style.
I need to know what to do.
Do?
About John.
BACK CRACKS, HE GROANS
Put me through to Sherrinford, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
- SOBS:
- But nothing will ever be the same again, will it?
I'm afraid it won't.
We'll have to rally round, I expect, do our bit.
Look after little Rosie.
I'm just going to, um... ..look through these things.
There might be a case.
A case?
Oh, you're not up to it, are you?
Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.
Yes.
Yes, I expect you're right.
I'll make some tea, shall I?
- Mrs Hudson?
- Yes, Sherlock?
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident...
- Yes?
- ..would you just say the word Norbury to me?
Would you?
Norbury?
Just that.
I'd be very grateful.
What's this?
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.
Oh, God!
Is that...?
- Must be.
- Oh.
I knew it wouldn't end like this.
I knew Moriarty made plans.
'I thought that would get your attention.
'So, this is in case...
'In case the day comes.
'If you are watching this, I'm probably dead.
'I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows?
'Nothing's certain, nothing's written.
'My old life... '..it was full of consequences.
'The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.
'You need to remember that.
So... '..
I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
'Might be the hardest case of your career.
'When I'm...gone, if I'm gone... '..
I need you to do something for me.'
- BABY GURGLES
- Hi.
I just wondered how things were going and... ..if there was anything I could do.
It's, er, it's from John.
- Right.
- You don't need to read it now.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.
He says...
John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...
Yes?
He said he'd... ..that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Anyone.
DOOR CLOSES
'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
'When I'm gone, if I'm...gone... '..
I need you to do something for me.
'Save John Watson.
'Save him, Sherlock.
'Save him.'
'When does the path we walk on lock around our feet?
'When does the road become a river with only one destination?
'
'Death waits for us all in Samarra.
'But can Samarra be avoided?
'
'Go to hell, Sherlock.'
My brother is a murderer.
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.
Oh, do your research.
I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Merry Christmas!
I'm not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.
You know what happened to the other one.
Miss me?
'Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
'
I've only been gone four minutes.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Is that quite clear?
Don't minute any of this.
Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.
A D notice has been slapped on the entire incident.
Only those within this room, code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love, will ever know the whole truth.
As far as everyone else is concerned, going to the Prime Minister and way beyond, Charles Augustus...
- Are you tweeting?
!
- No.
Well, that's what it looks like!
Of course I'm not tweeting.
Why would I be tweeting?
- Give me that!
- What?
No!
What are you doing?
!
- Get off!
- Give it here!
- "Back on terra firma."
- Don't read them out.
- "Free as a bird."
- God, you're such a spoilsport.
Will you take this matter seriously, Sherlock?
I am!
What makes you think I'm not taking it seriously?
"#OhWhatABeautifulMorning"
Look, not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death - my death!
And now I'm back, in a nice warm office, with my big brother and...
Are those ginger nuts?
- Oh, God...
- Love ginger nuts.
Our doctor said you were clean.
I am.
Utterly.
No need for stimulants now, remember?
I have work to do.
You're high as a kite!
Natural high, I assure you.
Totally natural.
I'm just... ♪ ..glad to be alive!
♪
What shall we do next?
What's your name?
Vivian.
- What would you do, Vivian?
- Pardon?
Well, it's a lovely day.
Go for a stroll?
Make a paper aeroplane?
Have an ice lolly?
Ice lolly, I suppose.
Ice lolly it is!
- What's your favourite?
- Well, really, I shouldn't...
- Go on.
- Do they still do Mivvies?
- Mr Holmes...
- Yes?
- ...we do need to get on.
- Yes, of course.
'Do your research.
'I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
..sociopath.
I see.
Who is supposed to have shot him, then?
Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger - that's who.
- That's not what happened at all.
- It is now.
Remarkable.
How did you do it?
We have some very talented people working here.
If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.
That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.
No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.
You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.
You're home and dry.
OK, cheers.
Obviously, there's unfinished business.
Moriarty.
I told you
- Moriarty's dead.
You say he filmed that video message before he died.
Yes.
You also say you know what he's going to do next.
- What does that mean?
- Perhaps that's all there is to it.
Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
No, no, he would never be that disappointing.
He's planned something, something long-term.
Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.
Posthumous revenge.
No, better than that - posthumous game.
We brought you back to deal with this.
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.
Wait?
!
Of course wait.
I'm the target - targets wait.
Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up,
I'll know when it begins.
I always know when the game is on.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because I love it.
There was once a merchant, in the famous market at Baghdad.
One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise, and he knew that the stranger was Death.
Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles, to the city of Samarra.
For there he was sure Death could not find him.
But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.
"Very well," said the merchant.
"I give in.
I am yours."
"But tell me, why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"
"Because," said Death,
"I had an appointment with you tonight... ..in Samarra."
If this gets any better, I'm going to get two knives.
Pays to advertise.
- So, what about Moriarty, then?
- Oh, I have a plan.
I'm going to monitor the underworld, every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
So, basically, your plan is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do?
Awesome, isn't it?
He drowned, Mr Holmes.
That's what we thought.
- But when they opened up his lungs...
- Yes?
..sand.
Superficial.
Come back!
It's the wrong thumb.
_
Sherlock...
It's never twins.
Hopkins, arrest Wilson.
Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.
- 'Wilson?
' 'Lymph nodes?
'
- Sherlock...
Yes, you may have nothing but a limbless torso, but there'll be traces of ink in the lymph nodes under the armpits.
If your mystery corpse had tattoos, the signs will be there.
- 'Bloody hell!
Is that a guess?
'
- I never guess.
- Sherlock...
- 'So, he's the killer?
The canary trainer?
'
- Of course he's the killer.
- 'Didn't see that coming.'
Hm, naturally.
Sherlock, you can't go on spinning plates like this.
That's it!
The place was spinning.
The heart medication you're taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.
Yes, I...
I think so.
Why?
Because the fingerprints on your brother's neck were your own.
- A jellyfish?
- I know.
You can't arrest a jellyfish.
- You could try.
- We did try.
Oh...
- Oh, God.
- Mary?
59 missed calls.
We're in a lot of trouble.
Ow!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Relax, it's got two syllables...
I'm a nurse, darling - I think I know what to do!
- Come on, then...
- Re!
Lax!
No, just drive, please, God, just drive!
God, drive!
Sherlock
- Mary!
That's it, Mary - re...
- Don't you start!
- ...
lax.
John, John...
I think you have to pull over!
- Mary, Mary...
- Pull over!
Oh, my God!
Has that come out?
They never come out when I take them.
Let's have a look.
Aw, she's so beautiful.
- Have another go.
- What about a name?
- Catherine.
- Uh, yeah, we've gone off that.
Have we?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Well, you know what I think...
- It's not a girl's name.
Molly, Mrs H, we would love you to be godparents.
- Oh!
Really?
- If you...
That's so lovely.
And, uh... you too, Sherlock?
- You too what?
- Godfather, we'd like you to be godfather.
God is a ludicrous fiction, dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.
Yeah, but there'll be cake.
Will you do it?
I'll get back to you.
Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.
In Christ's name.
Now, what name have you given your daughter?
Rosamund Mary.
Rosamund?
It means "Rose of the world".
Rosie for short.
Didn't you get John's text?
No.
I delete his texts.
I delete any text that begins "Hi."
No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.
Sorry.
Phone!
And now, godparents, are you ready to help the parents of this child in their duties as Christian parents?
We are.
'Sorry, I didn't catch that.
'Please repeat the question.'
As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.
To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
Hard logic versus romantic whimsy - that is your choice.
You fail to connect actions to their consequences.
Now, for the last time, if you want to keep the rattle, do not throw the rattle.
All right, good girl, good girl.
Good girl.
I'd better finish this, hadn't I?
- Hey.
- Afternoon.
He says you've got a good one, Greg?
Oh, yeah.
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.
God, 50!
Where does it go?
I know for a fact I was only 21 this time last week.
Yeah, well that's impossible.
That was before you met me.
- Well, no, no, there never was...
- "There never was such a time."
She's looking at me disapprovingly again.
No.
She's just jealous.
Yeah, well, I think we both are.
- Oh...
- No, no, David.
- Come on, you promised.
- No, it's...
Oh, no...
Oh, it's a Skype call.
Oh!
Then it must be Charlie.
At least he's phoning, I suppose.
Oh, look!
Hello!
'Hey, Dad.
Happy birthday.
Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?
'
No!
Picture's frozen!
'Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you.'
Why is it rubbish?
Where are you?
How is he?
Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.
David?
Come on!
OK, no, hang on a sec, I'll find somewhere quieter.
So, Charlie, where are you?
Are you there?
- 'Sorry, I'm here.
I'm just a bit...'
- Are you all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
Altitude?
'I'm in Tibet.
Didn't you see the mountains?
'
Never mind mountains.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.
- 'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?
'
- What?
'Could you just check something on my car?
'
Your car?
'To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe
I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet.
- 'Could you take a photo and send it?
'
- Uh, yes, I can do that.
All done.
Have you got it?
Charlie?
A week later...
Yeah?
...something really weird happens.
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed, the cops are chasing him, and he turns into the drive of the Welsborough house to try and get away.
Unfortunately...
The drunk guy survived, they managed to pull him out, but when they put the fire out and examined the parked car...
Whose body?
Charlie Welsborough, the son.
- What?
- The son who was in Tibet.
DNA all checks out.
Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.
- Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
- Have you got a lab report?
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.
- The seats?
- Yes, the car seats.
Made of vinyl.
Two different types of vinyl present.
Was it his own car?
Yeah, not flash - he was a student.
- Well, that's suggestive.
- Why?
- Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
- Yeah, right?
- There's something else.
- Yes?
According to this,
Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.
What?
The body in the car, dead for a week.
Oh, this is a good one.
Is it my birthday?
You want help?
- Yes, please.
OK.
- One condition.
Take all the credit.
It gets boring if I just solve them all.
Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.
He's got a point.
Which makes me look like some kind of prima donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do!
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.
- Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
- Definitely a sore spot.
So you take all the glory, thanks...
- OK!
- ...thanks all the same.
Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?
It's driving me nuts.
Anything you say, Giles.
Just kidding.
What's his name?
Greg.
What?
Greg.
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?
Not a clue.
It's just you normally say that at this point.
Hmm.
Well, then, let's hope you solve your little problem, Greg.
- Hear that?
- I know.
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood?
- Oh, good, great.
Yeah, amazing.
- Getting any sleep?
- Christ, no.
You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.
- Must feel very different...
- Sorry, what?
Yes, well, you know how it is.
All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.
- Are you two having a little joke?
- Never a word of thanks.
Can't even tell people's faces apart.
This is a joke, isn't it?
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever.
You're so, so clever."
- Is it about me?
- I think he needs winding.
You know, I think that really might be it.
No, don't get it.
Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect, so go easy on them, yeah?
- You know me.
- 'Hey, hello.'
Yeah.
Got them, don't worry.
Pampers, the cream you can't get from Boots.
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now?
- At the dead boy's house?
- Yeah.
'And what does he think?
Any theories?
'
Well, I texted you the details.
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.
- Hey!
- How do you know about that?
'Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.'
- They know everything!
- 'Solved it, then?
'
I'm working on it.
'Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.'
- Pig!
- Keep trying.
'So, what about it, then?
'What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it?
'And what are you going to call this one?
'
Oh, the Ghost Driver.
- Don't give it a title.
- People like the titles.
- They hate the titles.
- Give the people what they want.
No, never do that - people are stupid.
Uh, some people.
'All people are stupid.
Most people.'
'Bizarre enough though, isn't it, to be him?
'
I mean, it's right up your strasse.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.
- Son.
- Son!
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.
If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.
Well, I believe that I can.
But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
Sherlock?
Mr Holmes?
Sorry, you were saying?
Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
I don't think we'll ever get over this.
No.
Shouldn't think so.
So sorry, will you excuse me a moment?
I just...
I'll...
I'll just, um...
Ahem.
- Now what's wrong?
- Not sure, I just...
By the pricking of my thumbs.
Seriously?
You?
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.
They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.
What is this?
Oh, it's a sort of shrine, I suppose, really.
Bit of a fan of Mrs T.
A big hero of mine when I was getting started.
Right, yes.
- Who?
- What?
- Who...?
Who was this?
- Are you serious?
- Sherlock...
- It's...
It's Margaret Thatcher, the first female Prime Minister of this country.
Right.
- Prime Minister?
Right.
- Leader of the Government.
- Female?
- For God's sake!
You know perfectly well who she is.
Why are you playing for time?
It's the gap, look at the gap.
It's wrong.
Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed.
The whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.
This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been in, this picture is straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.
- Something's missing from here, but only recently.
- Yes, a...
- Plaster bust... - plaster bust.
- Oh, for God's sake!
It got broken.
What the hell has this got to do with Charlie?
- Rug!
- What?
Well, how could it get broken?
The only place for it to fall is the floor and there is a big thick rug.
- Does it matter?
- Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.
- It is worth letting him do this.
- Is your friend quite mad?
No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
We found the remains out there in the porch.
- The porch where we came in?
- How anybody could hate her so much they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness...
I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.
Why didn't he smash all the others?
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.
Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.
- And if there's nothing...
- I know what happened to your son.
You do?
It's quite simple, superficial, to be blunt.
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness?
- Well, yes.
- And the porch where it was smashed,
I noticed the motion sensor was damaged,
- so I assume it's permanently lit.
- How did you notice that?
I lack the arrogance to ignore details.
I'm not the police.
- So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.
- Exactly.
- Why?
- Don't know.
Wouldn't be fun if I knew.
Mr Holmes, please!
It was your 50th birthday, Mr Welsborough, of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
- After all, he was in Tibet.
- Yes.
- No.
- No?
♪ Happy birthday... ♪
The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video.
Easily arranged.
It's a Skype call.
The trick was meant to be a surprise.
- A trick?
- Obviously.
Could you take a photo and send it?
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.
Well, good enough.
Effectively a costume.
You're joking?
No, I'm not.
All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
- Oh, my God!
- Surprise!
That's when it happened.
I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.
You said he'd felt unwell?
You all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
He died there and then.
No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained, in the driver's seat, hidden, until...
When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who'd been sitting there, quite dead, for a week.
Oh, God!
Poor kid.
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.
This is where it was smashed.
- That was amazing.
- What?
The car, the kid.
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?
I can't stand it, never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
What kind of a life would that be?
Besides, I have the strangest feeling...
Miss me?
- That's mine.
You two take a... bus.
- Why?
I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.
The Mall, please.
- I met her once.
- Thatcher?
Rather arrogant, I thought.
- You thought that?
!
- Ha, I know.
Why am I looking at this?
That's her, John and Mary's baby.
Oh, I see, yes.
Looks very... fully functioning.
Is that really the best you can do?
Sorry, I've never been very good with them.
- Babies?
- Humans.
Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?
Any interest in her?
Why on earth would he?
I don't know.
You tell me.
In the last year of his life,
James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over 70 assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias,
which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.
It's a pearl - get another one.
There's something important about this.
I'm sure.
Maybe it's Moriarty.
Maybe it's not.
But something's coming.
Are you having a premonition, brother mine?
The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other.
What we call premonition is just movement of the web.
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable.
As inevitable as mathematics.
Appointment In Samarra.
I'm sorry?
The merchant who can't outrun Death.
You always hated that story as a child.
Less keen on predestination back then.
I'm not sure I like it now.
You wrote your own version, as I remember.
Appointment In Sumatra.
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.
Goodnight, Mycroft.
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.
- Keep me informed.
- Of what?
Absolutely no idea.
'Ammo!
'
- Oh, hi, Stella.
- Greg.
You, uh...?
- Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...
- Right, right, right...
Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?
It's nothing.
I mean it's nothing serious.
- No, no.
- I just pop round every now and again for a chat.
Yeah, of course.
I mean he loves a really tricky case.
Yeah, he does!
So what you here for?
Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so...
The Borgia Pearl?
They still after that, are they?
Yeah.
So, how did you two first meet?
Oh, well, there was a case about, um, ten years ago.
Nobody could figure it out.
There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.
- Oh, yeah?
How did she die?
- Hypothermia.
What?
I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...
Will you two please keep it down?
!
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?
You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.
I was a carpenter.
Like me dad.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
How the hell...?
Ah... e-cigarettes.
Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.
If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.
But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last.
Anything to add, John?
- John?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.
- What is that?
- That is... me.
Well, it's a me substitute.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You know I value your little contributions.
Yeah?
It's been there since nine this morning.
- Has it?
Where were you?
- Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.
What about my girlfriend?
- What?
- You said I had an ex...
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.
The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.
I...
I thought you'd done something clever.
Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
What do you mean?
Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
- Well...
- You thought she was having an affair.
I'm afraid it's far worse than that, your wife is a spy.
- What?
- That's right.
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy, across the road from your flat.
Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy, as part of an official state visit.
As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.
This drug will render the President entirely susceptible to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty.
What?
Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III.
- Are you serious?
- No, of course not.
His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.
I don't!
- Just the bras.
- Get out.
So, what's this all about, then?
- Having fun.
- Fun?
- While I can.
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, Sherlock...
- Borgia Pearl.
Boring.
Go!
- But...
- Go!
- This had better be good.
- Oh, I think you'll like it.
That is the bust, isn't it?
The one that was broken.
No, it's another one, different owner.
Different part of town.
You were right, this is a thing.
Something's going on.
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be pleased.
- I am pleased.
- You don't look pleased.
This is my game face.
And the game is on.
Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one.
- One belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan.
- Identical busts?
Yeah, and this one to a Dr Barnicot in Holborn.
Three in total.
God knows who'd want to do something like this.
Yeah, but some people have that complex, don't they?
An idee fixe.
They obsess over one thing and they can't let it go.
No, no good.
There were other images of Margaret...
Margaret...?
You know who she is.
...Thatcher, present at the first break-in.
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?
Ooh!
- What?
- Blood.
Quite a bit of it, too.
Was there any injury at the crime scene?
Nah.
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.
- Come on.
- Holborn?
Lambeth!
- Lambeth?
Why?
- To see Toby.
Ah, right.
Who?
- You'll see.
- Right, are you coming?
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.
- Who told you?
- The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.
- Have a good time.
- I will.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
- What?
- She's not the one.
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.
How do you work all that out?
She's got three children in Rio that he doesn't know about.
Are you just making this up?
- Possibly.
- Who's Toby?
There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker, one of the world's best.
Got himself into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago.
He hacked into the Pentagon security system, and I managed to get him off the charge.
Therefore he owes me a favour.
So, how does that help us?
- What?
- Toby the hacker?
- Toby's not the hacker.
- What?
- All right, Craig?
- All right, Sherlock?
Craig's got a dog.
So I see.
Good boy!
Hiya!
Mary?
What are you...?
No, we, we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case.
No, exactly.
So... don't wait up.
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Hey.
Mary, what are you doing here?
She's better at this than you.
- Better?
- So I texted her.
Hang on, Mary's better than me?
Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.
Of course she's better.
Yeah, OK.
Nothing personal.
What, so I'm supposed to just go home now, am I?
What do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?
- John or the dog?
- Ha-ha, that's funny!
- John.
- Well...
He's handy and loyal.
- That's hilarious.
- Is it too early for a divorce?
Oh.
Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge?
Keep up, he's fast.
- He's not moving.
- He's thinking.
He's really not moving.
Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.
You just like this dog, don't you?
- Well, I like you.
- He's still not moving.
- Fascinating.
- Oh!
Well, what do you make of it?
- They were looking for something.
- Yes, but it wasn't a burglar, they came specifically for that Thatcher bust.
Why?
Clever.
Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail,
- where would you go?
- Like hiding a tree in a forest.
Or blood in a butcher's.
Never mind, Toby, better luck next time, hmm?
This is it, though.
This is the one, I can feel it.
Not Moriarty?
It has to be him.
It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.
It's designed to beguile me, tease me and lure me in.
At last, a noose for me to put my neck into.
You should have seen the state of the front room.
- It was like The Exorcist.
- Huh.
Was Rosie's head spinning round?
- No.
Just the projectile vomiting.
- Nice!
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
- Hmm?
Noticed what?
- The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
Yeah, can't she?
I'm coming, darling.
Mummy's coming.
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here.
Have you heard of that thing?
In Germany?
You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.
Ostalgie.
People who missed the old days under the communists.
- People are weird, aren't they?
- Hmm.
According to this, there's quite a market for Cold War memorabilia.
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit?
Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.
Yes, fascinating.
Irrelevant.
Where exactly did they come from?
I've got into the records of the suppliers, Gelder and Co.
Seems they're from Georgia.
Where exactly?
Tbilisi.
Batch of six.
One to Welsborough.
One to Hassan.
One to Dr Barnicot.
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.
One to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.
Lestrade?
Another one?
- 'Yeah.'
- Harker or Sandeford?
Harker.
And it's murder this time.
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.
_
_
Defensive wounds on her face and hands, throat cut.
Sharp blade.
The same thing inside the house?
The bust?
- Two of them this time.
- Interesting.
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago.
- Limited edition of six.
- And now someone's wandering about destroying them all.
Makes no sense.
What's the point?
No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.
- Yes, it is.
- Well, it is, but it's not the point.
I've been slow, far too slow.
Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind...
Slow but lucky, very lucky.
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.
Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.
Congratulations, by the way.
- I'm sorry?
- Well, you're about to solve a big one.
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
- Yeah, until then, basically.
That's enough now, love.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.
And you need to get to bed.
Come on.
Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?
You were on the run.
Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying, it's clever.
Very clever.
But now you've met me and you're not so clever, are you?
Who are you?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.
Argh!
You're out of time.
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
- Who?
I know it's him.
It must be him.
You think you understand.
You understand nothing.
Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don't we just enjoy the moment?
Let me present Interpol's number one case.
Too tough for them, too boring for me.
The Black Pearl of the Borgias!
It's not possible!
How could she...?
!
Everything about who I was is on there.
The problems of your past are your business.
The problems of your future are my privilege.
I don't understand.
She...
She destroyed it.
She?
You know her!
You do, don't you?
You know the bitch?
!
She betrayed me.
Betrayed us all.
Mary.
This is about Mary?
Is that what she's calling herself now, eh?
- 'Armed police, you're surrounded!
'
- Give it to me.
Give it to me!
'Come out slowly, I want to see your hands above your head.'
Nobody shoots me!
Anyone shoots, I kill this man.
'Lay down your weapon.
Do it now!
'
I'm leaving this place.
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.
'Lay down your weapon.'
You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
Tell her she's a dead woman.
She's a dead woman walking.
She's my friend.
And she's under my protection.
Who are you?
I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.
Who's Sherlock Holmes?
Not a policeman.
What do you think?
Mate in two?
Don't antagonise them, darling.
Oh, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.
Everything palls.
They'll send someone soon.
They?
Who are they?
Seems to me we put an awful lot of faith in they.
Well, I've got something they would dearly love, if only we could get out of here.
I've got Ammo.
Ammo?
- Madame Ambassador.
- What took you so long?
- Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now!
Veer left!
What now?
What do we do?
We die.
Well?
He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.
- I very much doubt it.
- Why?
Because I think he used to work with Mary.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out!
We'll come back later.
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the English woman?
What would you do to a traitor?
Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.
I am an idiot, I know nothing.
Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
That was quite a text you sent me.
What's going on, Sherlock?
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,
I couldn't see what was right under my nose.
Expected a pearl.
Oh, my God, that's a...
Yes, it's an AGRA.
Memory stick, like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.
Who?
I don't know.
We...
We all had one but the others were...
Haven't you even looked at it yet?
I glanced at it but I prefer
- to hear it from you.
- Why?
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.
There were four of us, agents.
Not just agents.
Polite term.
Alex.
Gabriel.
Me.
And Ajay.
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.
We all had one.
Each containing aliases, our background, everything.
We could never be betrayed, because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.
- Who employed you?
- Anyone who paid well.
I mean, we were at the top of our game for years.
And then it all ended.
There was a coup in Georgia.
The British Embassy in Tbilisi was taken over, lots of hostages.
We got the call to go in, get them out.
There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.
- Who from?
- I don't know, just another voice on the phone.
And a codeword.
- Ammo.
- Ammo?
Like ammunition.
We went in, but then something went wrong.
Something went really wrong.
That was six years ago.
It feels like forever.
I was the only one that made it out.
No.
What?
I met someone tonight.
Same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.
What, he's alive?
Yeah, very much so.
I don't believe it, this is amazing!
I thought I was the only one,
I thought I was the only one who got out.
Where is he?
I need to see him, now!
Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?
Yeah, of course.
It was our insurance.
Above all, they mustn't fall into enemy hands.
So Ajay survived as well.
And now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide, with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why?
I don't know.
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.
Families fall out.
The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
Well, he's just trying to find me.
He survived, that's all that matters!
I heard it from his own mouth.
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."
Why would he want to kill me?
- He said you betrayed him.
- Oh, no, no, that's insane.
Well, it's what he believes.
I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.
No, Mary...
You do.
I made a vow, remember?
To look after the three of you.
Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
There's something I think you should read.
What is it?
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.
What are you...?
- Mary...
Oh, no!
- There you go.
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.
No.
You just look after them till I get back.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Agra?
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
It is 378km west of the state capital, Lucknow.
What are you, Wikipedia?
- Yes.
- AGRA is an acronym.
Oh, good, I love an acronym.
All the best secret societies have them.
Team of agents, the best.
But you know all that.
Of course I do.
Go on.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.
Indeed?
Well, that's news to me.
Is it?
He's already killed looking for that memory stick.
AGRA always worked for the highest bidder,
I thought that might include you?
- Me?
- Well, I mean the British government, or whatever government you're currently propping up.
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.
They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong.
And that was that, we stopped using freelancers.
- Your initiative?
- My initiative.
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.
I don't like loose ends.
Not on my watch.
There was something else.
A detail.
A codeword.
Ammo?
It's all I've got.
Little enough.
Could you do some digging as a favour?
You don't have many favours left.
Then I'm calling them all in.
And if you can find who's after her and neutralise them, what then?
You think you can go on saving her forever?
Of course.
Is that sentiment talking?
No, it's me.
Difficult to tell the difference these days.
Told you, I made a promise.
A vow.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.
Not on my watch.
'My darling, I need to tell you this because you mustn't hate me for going away.'
Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.
- Can you hear a squeaking?
- No.
Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel.
Why Planes Fail.
- Did you see it?
Oh, truly terrifying.
- Can't say I did.
Swore I would never fly again, yet hear I am!
Everything OK, madam?
No.
No, no, it's not, but then what's the use in complaining?
I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off is all.
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.
Oh, OK.
Relax.
She said relax.
Did you have a nice time in London?
It was OK, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun?
Did you lose it in the war?
'I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.
I'm not running, I promise you that,
I just need to do this in my own way.'
Oh, God!
I'm...
I-I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God!
- Everything OK, madam?
- I think I'm dying.
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.
God will smile on you.
'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,
I'm sorry, my love.'
I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.
Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of a dice.
I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
I swear I will.'
Not like this one.
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in!
I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.
Mr Baker.
Well, that completes the set.
- No, it does not.
- Well, who else am I missing?
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?
Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.
Oh, hi, Mary.
What concept?
Happy families.
Nice trip?
- How the f...?
- Please, Mary, there is a child present.
- How did you get in here?
- Karim let me in.
Hello.
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Nice to meet you, missus.
No, I mean how did you find me?
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
No, really, though, how?
Every movement I made was entirely random, every new personality just on the roll of a dice!
Mary, no human action is ever truly random.
An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability, mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual, can reduce the number of variables considerably.
I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine a seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.
But they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.
Oh, you bastard!
- You bastard!
- I know, but your face!
"The mathematics of probability"?
- You believed that.
- "Feasible variables"?
Yes, I started to run out about then.
In the memory stick!
Yeah, that was my idea.
- AGRA?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
You said it was your initials.
In a way that was true.
In a way?
So many lies.
I'm so sorry.
And I don't just mean you.
What?
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...
You're R?
Rosamund?
Rosamund Mary.
I always liked Mary.
Yeah, me too.
I used to.
I just...
I didn't know what else to do.
You could have stayed, you could have talked to me.
That's what couples are supposed to do.
Work things through.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Mary, I may not be a very good man but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for,
- most of the time.
- All the time.
You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.
You never judge, you never complain.
I don't deserve you, I...
All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
I will keep you safe.
But it has to be in London.
It's my city, I know the turf.
Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.
Get down!
Hello again.
- Ajay?
- Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.
Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.
I thought I was the only one who got out.
How did you find us?
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.
You found her but I found you.
So perhaps not so clever.
And now here we are.
At last.
Touche!
Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
She thought I was dead.
I might as well have been.
It was always just the four of us, always, remember?
Oh, yeah.
So why do you want to kill me?
Do you know how long they kept me prisoner?
What they did to me?
They tortured Alex to death.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.
But you?
You, where were you?
That day at the embassy, I escaped.
Ha!
But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
Where were you?
Oh, I got out.
For a while.
Long enough to hide my memory stick.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.
I was loyal, you see.
Loyal to my friends.
But they took me, tortured me.
Not for information.
Not for anything except fun.
They thought I'd give in, die, but I didn't, I lived.
And eventually, they forgot about me rotting in a cell somewhere.
Six years they kept me there.
Until one day I saw my chance.
Oh, and I made them pay.
You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.
Little whispers.
Laughter.
Gossip.
How the clever agents had been betrayed.
Brought down by you!
Me?
You know I'll kill you too.
You know I will, Ajay.
What, you think I care if I die?
I've dreamed of killing you every night for six years.
Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.
I swear to you, Ajay.
What did you hear, Ajay?
When you were a prisoner, what exactly did you hear?
What did I hear?
Ammo.
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo."
We were betrayed!
- And they said it was her?
- That you betrayed us!
They said her name?
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.
No!
No!
'The English woman, that's all he heard.
Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.'
Couldn't this wait until you're back?
No, it's not over.
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed, the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.
There was only a voice on the phone.
'Remember?
And a codeword.'
"Ammo," yes, you said.
How's your Latin, brother dear?
My Latin?
Amo, amas, amat.
I love, you love, he loves.
What...?
Not "Ammo" as in ammunition, but "Amo", meaning?
You'd better be right, Sherlock.
Bloody thing!
What's going on?
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.
What?
'So many lies.
And I don't just mean you.'
- Hello.
- Ah, hello.
- I like your daisy.
- Thank you, yeah.
It's not really me, though, I think.
- No?
- No, no, it's too floral for me.
I'm more of a "knackered with weary old eyes" kind of guy.
Well, I think they're nice.
Nice eyes.
- Thank you.
- Look...
Look...
I don't normally do this,
- but, um...
- But you're going to.
Yeah.
- What's this?
- This is me.
- Thank you.
Cheers.
- Yeah.
Great.
- Bye!
- Bye.

Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
Hmm?
Noticed what?
The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
- Yeah, can't she?
- Hmm.
I'm coming darling.
I'm coming.
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
- _
- Come here...
It's OK.
_
- _
- Do you want a cuddle?
_
I know.
- Oh, sweetheart.
- _
_
Ssh.
Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you?
_
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?
Oh, let's go and see Daddy!
Daddy's here.
It's OK, Rosie.
I'll take her.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I may as well get up now.
Hey, baby, it's Daddy.
Your daddy.
Come here, Rose.
Come here, darling, it's all right.
Thank you.
_
_
This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.
How many more times?
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.
And you're basing all this on a code name?
On a whispered voice on the telephone?
Come on, Mycroft.
You were the conduit for AGRA.
Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
It was my job.
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
AGRA went in.
- Yes.
- And they were betrayed.
Not by me.
Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.
I promise you,
I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.
You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.
Not one.
Not.
One.
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories?
I'd like to do those.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.
Although she does seem to enjoy them.
Well, I'll have to give that a go.
Got a lot to catch up on.
'You think you understand.
You understand nothing.'
'Code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love.'
'You'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.
'They know everything.'
'They said it was the English woman.'
'Don't minute any of this.'
'They know everything.'
- You don't make it easy, do you?
- What do you mean?
Well, being... being so perfect.
Mary, I...
I need to tell you...
Hang on.
Can you tell me later?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Great.
Well, no, we can't just go.
- Rosie.
- Yeah.
- Er, you go.
- No!
I'll come as soon as I've found someone.
Mrs Hudson.
- Corfu till Saturday.
Molly?
- Er, yeah, I'll try.
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.
You know that's not going to happen.
If there's more to this case, you need to see it.
Yeah, OK, you win.
'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes.
'Please make your way to the exit.
Thank you.'
Your office said I'd find you here.
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.
We're like them.
Ghostly, living in the shadows.
Predatory?
Well, it depends which side you're on.
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.
Nice location for the final act, couldn't have chosen it better myself.
But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.
I just come here to look at the fish.
I knew this would happen one day.
- It's like that old story.
- I really am a very busy man.
Would you mind cutting to the chase?
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
With good reason.
"There was once a merchant, in a famous market in Baghdad."
I really have never liked this story.
I'm just like the merchant in the story,
I thought I could out-run the inevitable.
I've always been looking over my shoulder, always expecting to see the grim figure of...
Death.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hey.
- John?
- On his way.
Let me introduce Ammo.
You were Ammo?
You were the person on the phone that time?
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
Why did you betray us?
Why does anyone do anything?
- Hmm.
- Let me guess, selling secrets?
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.
Worked very well for a few years.
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it.
But...
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.
I couldn't believe my luck!
That bought me a little time.
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
Very handy.
They were always such reliable killers.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.
Lady Smallwood gave the order.
But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.
Seemed to do the trick.
And you thought your troubles were over.
I was tired.
Tired of the mess of it all.
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.
The hostages were killed.
AGRA too.
Or so I thought.
My secret was safe.
But... apparently not.
Just a little peace.
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
A family?
Home?
Really, I understand.
So, just let me get out of here, right?
Let me just walk away.
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.
What do you say?
After what you did?
!
Mary, no!
OK.
London Aquarium.
Yes, now.
I was never a field agent.
I always thought I'd be rather good.
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
Thanks.
- For a secretary.
- What?
It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
- I didn't do this out of jealousy.
- No?
Same old drudge, day in, day out.
Never getting out there where all the excitement was.
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.
Yes, your little flat.
- How do you know?
- Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?
And what are you, widowed or divorced?
Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.
That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.
- Sherlock...
- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.
A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.
- Sherlock, don't.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.
There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
That accounts for the drink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.
So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.
To prove how good you are.
To make up for the inadequacies of your...
little life.
Well, Mrs Norbury,
I must admit this is unexpected.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.
All except Sherlock Holmes.
There's no way out.
So it would seem.
You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.
It's what I do.
Maybe I can still surprise you.
Now, come on, be sensible.
Hmm, no, I don't think so.
Ah!
Surprise!
Everything's fine.
It's going to be OK.
Get an ambulance!
It's all right, it's all right.
- Mary!
- John.
All right, Mary?
Mary?
Stay with me, stay with me.
- Oh, come on...
- No, don't worry.
Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
Come on, Mary.
Mary?
Oh, God.
John, I think this is it.
No, no, no, no.
It's not.
- That's...
- You made me so happy.
You gave me everything I could ever, ever have wanted...
Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.
- Look after Rosie.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.
- Promise me.
- I promise.
- No...
- Yes, I promise.
- Promise me!
- I promise, I promise.
Ssh, ssh.
Hey, Sherlock.
Yes.
I... so like you.
Did I ever say?
Yes, yes, you did.
I'm sorry for... for shooting you that time.
I'm really sorry.
It's all right.
I think we're even now, OK?
OK.
- Oh, I think we're...
- Mary, Mary...
- ...even, definitely even.
- Ssh, ssh.
You were my whole world.
Being Mary Watson was the only life worth living.
- Mary...
- Thank you.
Mary...
Don't you dare!
You made a vow.
You swore it.
'You've been having dreams.
A recurring dream?
'
Do you want to talk about it?
This is a two-way relationship, you know.
The whole world has come crashing down around you.
Everything's hopeless.
Irretrievable.
I know that's what you must feel but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
That's not really my style.
I need to know what to do.
Do?
About John.
Put me through to Sherrinford, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
But nothing will ever be the same again, will it?
I'm afraid it won't.
We'll have to rally round, I expect, do our bit.
Look after little Rosie.
I'm just going to, um look through these things.
There might be a case.
A case?
Oh, you're not up to it, are you?
Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.
Yes.
Yes, I expect you're right.
I'll make some tea, shall I?
- Mrs Hudson?
- Yes, Sherlock?
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident...
- Yes?
- ...would you just say the word Norbury to me?
Would you?
Norbury?
Just that.
I'd be very grateful.
What's this?
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.
Oh, God!
Is that...?
- Must be.
- Oh.
I knew it wouldn't end like this.
I knew Moriarty made plans.
'I thought that would get your attention.
So, this is in case...
In case the day comes.
If you are watching this, I'm probably dead.
I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows?
Nothing's certain, nothing's written.
My old life it was full of consequences.
The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.
You need to remember that.
So I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
Might be the hardest case of your career.
When I'm... gone, if I'm gone I need you to do something for me.'
Hi.
I just wondered how things were going and if there was anything I could do.
It's, er, it's from John.
- Right.
- You don't need to read it now.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.
He says...
John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...
Yes?
He said he'd that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Anyone.
'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
When I'm gone, if I'm... gone I need you to do something for me.
Save John Watson.
Save him, Sherlock.
Save him.'
'When does the path we walk on lock around our feet?
When does the road become a river with only one destination?
'
'Death waits for us all in Samarra.
But can Samarra be avoided?
'
Go to hell, Sherlock.
- _
- My brother is a murderer.
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.
Oh, do your research.
I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Merry Christmas!
I'm not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.
You know what happened to the other one.
Miss me?
'Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
'
I've only been gone four minutes.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Is that quite clear?
Don't minute any of this.
Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.
A D notice has been slapped on the entire incident.
Only those within this room, code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love, will ever know the whole truth.
As far as everyone else is concerned, going to the Prime Minister and way beyond, Charles Augustus...
- Are you tweeting?
!
- No.
Well, that's what it looks like!
Of course I'm not tweeting.
Why would I be tweeting?
- Give me that!
- What?
No!
What are you doing?
!
- Get off!
- Give it here!
- "Back on terra firma."
- Don't read them out.
- "Free as a bird."
- God, you're such a spoilsport.
Will you take this matter seriously, Sherlock?
I am!
What makes you think I'm not taking it seriously?
"#OhWhatABeautifulMorning"
Look, not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death - my death!
And now I'm back, in a nice warm office, with my big brother and...
Are those ginger nuts?
- Oh, God...
- Love ginger nuts.
Our doctor said you were clean.
I am.
Utterly.
No need for stimulants now, remember?
I have work to do.
You're high as a kite!
Natural high, I assure you.
Totally natural.
I'm just... ♪ ..glad to be alive!
♪
What shall we do next?
What's your name?
Vivian.
- What would you do, Vivian?
- Pardon?
Well, it's a lovely day.
Go for a stroll?
Make a paper aeroplane?
Have an ice lolly?
Ice lolly, I suppose.
Ice lolly it is!
- What's your favourite?
- Well, really, I shouldn't...
- Go on.
- Do they still do Mivvies?
- Mr Holmes...
- Yes?
- ...we do need to get on.
- Yes, of course.
'Do your research.
'I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
..sociopath.
I see.
Who is supposed to have shot him, then?
Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger - that's who.
- That's not what happened at all.
- It is now.
Remarkable.
How did you do it?
We have some very talented people working here.
If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.
That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.
No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.
You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.
You're home and dry.
OK, cheers.
Obviously, there's unfinished business.
Moriarty.
I told you
- Moriarty's dead.
You say he filmed that video message before he died.
Yes.
You also say you know what he's going to do next.
- What does that mean?
- Perhaps that's all there is to it.
Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
No, no, he would never be that disappointing.
He's planned something, something long-term.
Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.
Posthumous revenge.
No, better than that - posthumous game.
We brought you back to deal with this.
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.
Wait?
!
Of course wait.
I'm the target - targets wait.
Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up,
I'll know when it begins.
I always know when the game is on.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because I love it.
There was once a merchant, in the famous market at Baghdad.
One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise, and he knew that the stranger was Death.
Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles, to the city of Samarra.
For there he was sure Death could not find him.
But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.
"Very well," said the merchant.
"I give in.
I am yours."
"But tell me, why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"
"Because," said Death,
"I had an appointment with you tonight... ..in Samarra."
If this gets any better, I'm going to get two knives.
Pays to advertise.
- So, what about Moriarty, then?
- Oh, I have a plan.
I'm going to monitor the underworld, every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
So, basically, your plan is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do?
Awesome, isn't it?
He drowned, Mr Holmes.
That's what we thought.
- But when they opened up his lungs...
- Yes?
..sand.
Superficial.
Come back!
It's the wrong thumb.
_
Sherlock...
It's never twins.
Hopkins, arrest Wilson.
Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.
- 'Wilson?
' 'Lymph nodes?
'
- Sherlock...
Yes, you may have nothing but a limbless torso, but there'll be traces of ink in the lymph nodes under the armpits.
If your mystery corpse had tattoos, the signs will be there.
- 'Bloody hell!
Is that a guess?
'
- I never guess.
- Sherlock...
- 'So, he's the killer?
The canary trainer?
'
- Of course he's the killer.
- 'Didn't see that coming.'
Hm, naturally.
Sherlock, you can't go on spinning plates like this.
That's it!
The place was spinning.
The heart medication you're taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.
Yes, I...
I think so.
Why?
Because the fingerprints on your brother's neck were your own.
- A jellyfish?
- I know.
You can't arrest a jellyfish.
- You could try.
- We did try.
Oh...
- Oh, God.
- Mary?
59 missed calls.
We're in a lot of trouble.
Ow!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Relax, it's got two syllables...
I'm a nurse, darling - I think I know what to do!
- Come on, then...
- Re!
Lax!
No, just drive, please, God, just drive!
God, drive!
Sherlock
- Mary!
That's it, Mary - re...
- Don't you start!
- ...
lax.
John, John...
I think you have to pull over!
- Mary, Mary...
- Pull over!
Oh, my God!
Has that come out?
They never come out when I take them.
Let's have a look.
Aw, she's so beautiful.
- Have another go.
- What about a name?
- Catherine.
- Uh, yeah, we've gone off that.
Have we?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Well, you know what I think...
- It's not a girl's name.
Molly, Mrs H, we would love you to be godparents.
- Oh!
Really?
- If you...
That's so lovely.
And, uh... you too, Sherlock?
- You too what?
- Godfather, we'd like you to be godfather.
God is a ludicrous fiction, dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.
Yeah, but there'll be cake.
Will you do it?
I'll get back to you.
Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.
In Christ's name.
Now, what name have you given your daughter?
Rosamund Mary.
Rosamund?
It means "Rose of the world".
Rosie for short.
Didn't you get John's text?
No.
I delete his texts.
I delete any text that begins "Hi."
No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.
Sorry.
Phone!
And now, godparents, are you ready to help the parents of this child in their duties as Christian parents?
We are.
'Sorry, I didn't catch that.
'Please repeat the question.'
As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.
To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
Hard logic versus romantic whimsy - that is your choice.
You fail to connect actions to their consequences.
Now, for the last time, if you want to keep the rattle, do not throw the rattle.
All right, good girl, good girl.
Good girl.
I'd better finish this, hadn't I?
- Hey.
- Afternoon.
He says you've got a good one, Greg?
Oh, yeah.
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.
God, 50!
Where does it go?
I know for a fact I was only 21 this time last week.
Yeah, well that's impossible.
That was before you met me.
- Well, no, no, there never was...
- "There never was such a time."
She's looking at me disapprovingly again.
No.
She's just jealous.
Yeah, well, I think we both are.
- Oh...
- No, no, David.
- Come on, you promised.
- No, it's...
Oh, no...
Oh, it's a Skype call.
Oh!
Then it must be Charlie.
At least he's phoning, I suppose.
Oh, look!
Hello!
'Hey, Dad.
Happy birthday.
Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?
'
No!
Picture's frozen!
'Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you.'
Why is it rubbish?
Where are you?
How is he?
Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.
David?
Come on!
OK, no, hang on a sec, I'll find somewhere quieter.
So, Charlie, where are you?
Are you there?
- 'Sorry, I'm here.
I'm just a bit...'
- Are you all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
Altitude?
'I'm in Tibet.
Didn't you see the mountains?
'
Never mind mountains.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.
- 'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?
'
- What?
'Could you just check something on my car?
'
Your car?
'To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe
I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet.
- 'Could you take a photo and send it?
'
- Uh, yes, I can do that.
All done.
Have you got it?
Charlie?
A week later...
Yeah?
...something really weird happens.
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed, the cops are chasing him, and he turns into the drive of the Welsborough house to try and get away.
Unfortunately...
The drunk guy survived, they managed to pull him out, but when they put the fire out and examined the parked car...
Whose body?
Charlie Welsborough, the son.
- What?
- The son who was in Tibet.
DNA all checks out.
Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.
- Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
- Have you got a lab report?
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.
- The seats?
- Yes, the car seats.
Made of vinyl.
Two different types of vinyl present.
Was it his own car?
Yeah, not flash - he was a student.
- Well, that's suggestive.
- Why?
- Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
- Yeah, right?
- There's something else.
- Yes?
According to this,
Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.
What?
The body in the car, dead for a week.
Oh, this is a good one.
Is it my birthday?
You want help?
- Yes, please.
OK.
- One condition.
Take all the credit.
It gets boring if I just solve them all.
Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.
He's got a point.
Which makes me look like some kind of prima donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do!
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.
- Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
- Definitely a sore spot.
So you take all the glory, thanks...
- OK!
- ...thanks all the same.
Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?
It's driving me nuts.
Anything you say, Giles.
Just kidding.
What's his name?
Greg.
What?
Greg.
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?
Not a clue.
It's just you normally say that at this point.
Hmm.
Well, then, let's hope you solve your little problem, Greg.
- Hear that?
- I know.
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood?
- Oh, good, great.
Yeah, amazing.
- Getting any sleep?
- Christ, no.
You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.
- Must feel very different...
- Sorry, what?
Yes, well, you know how it is.
All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.
- Are you two having a little joke?
- Never a word of thanks.
Can't even tell people's faces apart.
This is a joke, isn't it?
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever.
You're so, so clever."
- Is it about me?
- I think he needs winding.
You know, I think that really might be it.
No, don't get it.
Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect, so go easy on them, yeah?
- You know me.
- 'Hey, hello.'
Yeah.
Got them, don't worry.
Pampers, the cream you can't get from Boots.
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now?
- At the dead boy's house?
- Yeah.
'And what does he think?
Any theories?
'
Well, I texted you the details.
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.
- Hey!
- How do you know about that?
'Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.'
- They know everything!
- 'Solved it, then?
'
I'm working on it.
'Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.'
- Pig!
- Keep trying.
'So, what about it, then?
'What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it?
'And what are you going to call this one?
'
Oh, the Ghost Driver.
- Don't give it a title.
- People like the titles.
- They hate the titles.
- Give the people what they want.
No, never do that - people are stupid.
Uh, some people.
'All people are stupid.
Most people.'
'Bizarre enough though, isn't it, to be him?
'
I mean, it's right up your strasse.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.
- Son.
- Son!
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.
If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.
Well, I believe that I can.
But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
Sherlock?
Mr Holmes?
Sorry, you were saying?
Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
I don't think we'll ever get over this.
No.
Shouldn't think so.
So sorry, will you excuse me a moment?
I just...
I'll...
I'll just, um...
Ahem.
- Now what's wrong?
- Not sure, I just...
By the pricking of my thumbs.
Seriously?
You?
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.
They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.
What is this?
Oh, it's a sort of shrine, I suppose, really.
Bit of a fan of Mrs T.
A big hero of mine when I was getting started.
Right, yes.
- Who?
- What?
- Who...?
Who was this?
- Are you serious?
- Sherlock...
- It's...
It's Margaret Thatcher, the first female Prime Minister of this country.
Right.
- Prime Minister?
Right.
- Leader of the Government.
- Female?
- For God's sake!
You know perfectly well who she is.
Why are you playing for time?
It's the gap, look at the gap.
It's wrong.
Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed.
The whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.
This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been in, this picture is straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.
- Something's missing from here, but only recently.
- Yes, a...
- Plaster bust... - plaster bust.
- Oh, for God's sake!
It got broken.
What the hell has this got to do with Charlie?
- Rug!
- What?
Well, how could it get broken?
The only place for it to fall is the floor and there is a big thick rug.
- Does it matter?
- Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.
- It is worth letting him do this.
- Is your friend quite mad?
No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
We found the remains out there in the porch.
- The porch where we came in?
- How anybody could hate her so much they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness...
I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.
Why didn't he smash all the others?
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.
Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.
- And if there's nothing...
- I know what happened to your son.
You do?
It's quite simple, superficial, to be blunt.
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness?
- Well, yes.
- And the porch where it was smashed,
I noticed the motion sensor was damaged,
- so I assume it's permanently lit.
- How did you notice that?
I lack the arrogance to ignore details.
I'm not the police.
- So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.
- Exactly.
- Why?
- Don't know.
Wouldn't be fun if I knew.
Mr Holmes, please!
It was your 50th birthday, Mr Welsborough, of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
- After all, he was in Tibet.
- Yes.
- No.
- No?
♪ Happy birthday... ♪
The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video.
Easily arranged.
It's a Skype call.
The trick was meant to be a surprise.
- A trick?
- Obviously.
Could you take a photo and send it?
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.
Well, good enough.
Effectively a costume.
You're joking?
No, I'm not.
All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
- Oh, my God!
- Surprise!
That's when it happened.
I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.
You said he'd felt unwell?
You all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
He died there and then.
No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained, in the driver's seat, hidden, until...
When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who'd been sitting there, quite dead, for a week.
Oh, God!
Poor kid.
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.
This is where it was smashed.
- That was amazing.
- What?
The car, the kid.
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?
I can't stand it, never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
What kind of a life would that be?
Besides, I have the strangest feeling...
Miss me?
- That's mine.
You two take a... bus.
- Why?
I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.
The Mall, please.
- I met her once.
- Thatcher?
Rather arrogant, I thought.
- You thought that?
!
- Ha, I know.
Why am I looking at this?
That's her, John and Mary's baby.
Oh, I see, yes.
Looks very... fully functioning.
Is that really the best you can do?
Sorry, I've never been very good with them.
- Babies?
- Humans.
Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?
Any interest in her?
Why on earth would he?
I don't know.
You tell me.
In the last year of his life,
James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over 70 assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias,
which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.
It's a pearl - get another one.
There's something important about this.
I'm sure.
Maybe it's Moriarty.
Maybe it's not.
But something's coming.
Are you having a premonition, brother mine?
The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other.
What we call premonition is just movement of the web.
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable.
As inevitable as mathematics.
Appointment In Samarra.
I'm sorry?
The merchant who can't outrun Death.
You always hated that story as a child.
Less keen on predestination back then.
I'm not sure I like it now.
You wrote your own version, as I remember.
Appointment In Sumatra.
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.
Goodnight, Mycroft.
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.
- Keep me informed.
- Of what?
Absolutely no idea.
'Ammo!
'
- Oh, hi, Stella.
- Greg.
You, uh...?
- Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...
- Right, right, right...
Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?
It's nothing.
I mean it's nothing serious.
- No, no.
- I just pop round every now and again for a chat.
Yeah, of course.
I mean he loves a really tricky case.
Yeah, he does!
So what you here for?
Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so...
The Borgia Pearl?
They still after that, are they?
Yeah.
So, how did you two first meet?
Oh, well, there was a case about, um, ten years ago.
Nobody could figure it out.
There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.
- Oh, yeah?
How did she die?
- Hypothermia.
What?
I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...
Will you two please keep it down?
!
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?
You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.
I was a carpenter.
Like me dad.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
How the hell...?
Ah... e-cigarettes.
Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.
If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.
But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last.
Anything to add, John?
- John?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.
- What is that?
- That is... me.
Well, it's a me substitute.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You know I value your little contributions.
Yeah?
It's been there since nine this morning.
- Has it?
Where were you?
- Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.
What about my girlfriend?
- What?
- You said I had an ex...
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.
The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.
I...
I thought you'd done something clever.
Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
What do you mean?
Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
- Well...
- You thought she was having an affair.
I'm afraid it's far worse than that, your wife is a spy.
- What?
- That's right.
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy, across the road from your flat.
Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy, as part of an official state visit.
As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.
This drug will render the President entirely susceptible to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty.
What?
Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III.
- Are you serious?
- No, of course not.
His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.
I don't!
- Just the bras.
- Get out.
So, what's this all about, then?
- Having fun.
- Fun?
- While I can.
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, Sherlock...
- Borgia Pearl.
Boring.
Go!
- But...
- Go!
- This had better be good.
- Oh, I think you'll like it.
That is the bust, isn't it?
The one that was broken.
No, it's another one, different owner.
Different part of town.
You were right, this is a thing.
Something's going on.
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be pleased.
- I am pleased.
- You don't look pleased.
This is my game face.
And the game is on.
Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one.
- One belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan.
- Identical busts?
Yeah, and this one to a Dr Barnicot in Holborn.
Three in total.
God knows who'd want to do something like this.
Yeah, but some people have that complex, don't they?
An idee fixe.
They obsess over one thing and they can't let it go.
No, no good.
There were other images of Margaret...
Margaret...?
You know who she is.
...Thatcher, present at the first break-in.
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?
Ooh!
- What?
- Blood.
Quite a bit of it, too.
Was there any injury at the crime scene?
Nah.
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.
- Come on.
- Holborn?
Lambeth!
- Lambeth?
Why?
- To see Toby.
Ah, right.
Who?
- You'll see.
- Right, are you coming?
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.
- Who told you?
- The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.
- Have a good time.
- I will.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
- What?
- She's not the one.
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.
How do you work all that out?
She's got three children in Rio that he doesn't know about.
Are you just making this up?
- Possibly.
- Who's Toby?
There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker, one of the world's best.
Got himself into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago.
He hacked into the Pentagon security system, and I managed to get him off the charge.
Therefore he owes me a favour.
So, how does that help us?
- What?
- Toby the hacker?
- Toby's not the hacker.
- What?
- All right, Craig?
- All right, Sherlock?
Craig's got a dog.
So I see.
Good boy!
Hiya!
Mary?
What are you...?
No, we, we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case.
No, exactly.
So... don't wait up.
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Hey.
Mary, what are you doing here?
She's better at this than you.
- Better?
- So I texted her.
Hang on, Mary's better than me?
Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.
Of course she's better.
Yeah, OK.
Nothing personal.
What, so I'm supposed to just go home now, am I?
What do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?
- John or the dog?
- Ha-ha, that's funny!
- John.
- Well...
He's handy and loyal.
- That's hilarious.
- Is it too early for a divorce?
Oh.
Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge?
Keep up, he's fast.
- He's not moving.
- He's thinking.
He's really not moving.
Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.
You just like this dog, don't you?
- Well, I like you.
- He's still not moving.
- Fascinating.
- Oh!
Well, what do you make of it?
- They were looking for something.
- Yes, but it wasn't a burglar, they came specifically for that Thatcher bust.
Why?
Clever.
Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail,
- where would you go?
- Like hiding a tree in a forest.
Or blood in a butcher's.
Never mind, Toby, better luck next time, hmm?
This is it, though.
This is the one, I can feel it.
Not Moriarty?
It has to be him.
It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.
It's designed to beguile me, tease me and lure me in.
At last, a noose for me to put my neck into.
You should have seen the state of the front room.
- It was like The Exorcist.
- Huh.
Was Rosie's head spinning round?
- No.
Just the projectile vomiting.
- Nice!
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
- Hmm?
Noticed what?
- The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
Yeah, can't she?
I'm coming, darling.
Mummy's coming.
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here.
Have you heard of that thing?
In Germany?
You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.
Ostalgie.
People who missed the old days under the communists.
- People are weird, aren't they?
- Hmm.
According to this, there's quite a market for Cold War memorabilia.
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit?
Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.
Yes, fascinating.
Irrelevant.
Where exactly did they come from?
I've got into the records of the suppliers, Gelder and Co.
Seems they're from Georgia.
Where exactly?
Tbilisi.
Batch of six.
One to Welsborough.
One to Hassan.
One to Dr Barnicot.
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.
One to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.
Lestrade?
Another one?
- 'Yeah.'
- Harker or Sandeford?
Harker.
And it's murder this time.
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.
_
_
Defensive wounds on her face and hands, throat cut.
Sharp blade.
The same thing inside the house?
The bust?
- Two of them this time.
- Interesting.
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago.
- Limited edition of six.
- And now someone's wandering about destroying them all.
Makes no sense.
What's the point?
No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.
- Yes, it is.
- Well, it is, but it's not the point.
I've been slow, far too slow.
Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind...
Slow but lucky, very lucky.
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.
Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.
Congratulations, by the way.
- I'm sorry?
- Well, you're about to solve a big one.
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
- Yeah, until then, basically.
That's enough now, love.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.
And you need to get to bed.
Come on.
Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?
You were on the run.
Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying, it's clever.
Very clever.
But now you've met me and you're not so clever, are you?
Who are you?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.
Argh!
You're out of time.
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
- Who?
I know it's him.
It must be him.
You think you understand.
You understand nothing.
Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don't we just enjoy the moment?
Let me present Interpol's number one case.
Too tough for them, too boring for me.
The Black Pearl of the Borgias!
It's not possible!
How could she...?
!
Everything about who I was is on there.
The problems of your past are your business.
The problems of your future are my privilege.
I don't understand.
She...
She destroyed it.
She?
You know her!
You do, don't you?
You know the bitch?
!
She betrayed me.
Betrayed us all.
Mary.
This is about Mary?
Is that what she's calling herself now, eh?
- 'Armed police, you're surrounded!
'
- Give it to me.
Give it to me!
'Come out slowly, I want to see your hands above your head.'
Nobody shoots me!
Anyone shoots, I kill this man.
'Lay down your weapon.
Do it now!
'
I'm leaving this place.
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.
'Lay down your weapon.'
You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
Tell her she's a dead woman.
She's a dead woman walking.
She's my friend.
And she's under my protection.
Who are you?
I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.
Who's Sherlock Holmes?
Not a policeman.
What do you think?
Mate in two?
Don't antagonise them, darling.
Oh, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.
Everything palls.
They'll send someone soon.
They?
Who are they?
Seems to me we put an awful lot of faith in they.
Well, I've got something they would dearly love, if only we could get out of here.
I've got Ammo.
Ammo?
- Madame Ambassador.
- What took you so long?
- Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now!
Veer left!
What now?
What do we do?
We die.
Well?
He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.
- I very much doubt it.
- Why?
Because I think he used to work with Mary.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out!
We'll come back later.
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the English woman?
What would you do to a traitor?
Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.
I am an idiot, I know nothing.
Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
That was quite a text you sent me.
What's going on, Sherlock?
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,
I couldn't see what was right under my nose.
Expected a pearl.
Oh, my God, that's a...
Yes, it's an AGRA.
Memory stick, like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.
Who?
I don't know.
We...
We all had one but the others were...
Haven't you even looked at it yet?
I glanced at it but I prefer
- to hear it from you.
- Why?
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.
There were four of us, agents.
Not just agents.
Polite term.
Alex.
Gabriel.
Me.
And Ajay.
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.
We all had one.
Each containing aliases, our background, everything.
We could never be betrayed, because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.
- Who employed you?
- Anyone who paid well.
I mean, we were at the top of our game for years.
And then it all ended.
There was a coup in Georgia.
The British Embassy in Tbilisi was taken over, lots of hostages.
We got the call to go in, get them out.
There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.
- Who from?
- I don't know, just another voice on the phone.
And a codeword.
- Ammo.
- Ammo?
Like ammunition.
We went in, but then something went wrong.
Something went really wrong.
That was six years ago.
It feels like forever.
I was the only one that made it out.
No.
What?
I met someone tonight.
Same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.
What, he's alive?
Yeah, very much so.
I don't believe it, this is amazing!
I thought I was the only one,
I thought I was the only one who got out.
Where is he?
I need to see him, now!
Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?
Yeah, of course.
It was our insurance.
Above all, they mustn't fall into enemy hands.
So Ajay survived as well.
And now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide, with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why?
I don't know.
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.
Families fall out.
The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
Well, he's just trying to find me.
He survived, that's all that matters!
I heard it from his own mouth.
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."
Why would he want to kill me?
- He said you betrayed him.
- Oh, no, no, that's insane.
Well, it's what he believes.
I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.
No, Mary...
You do.
I made a vow, remember?
To look after the three of you.
Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
There's something I think you should read.
What is it?
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.
What are you...?
- Mary...
Oh, no!
- There you go.
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.
No.
You just look after them till I get back.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Agra?
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
It is 378km west of the state capital, Lucknow.
What are you, Wikipedia?
- Yes.
- AGRA is an acronym.
Oh, good, I love an acronym.
All the best secret societies have them.
Team of agents, the best.
But you know all that.
Of course I do.
Go on.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.
Indeed?
Well, that's news to me.
Is it?
He's already killed looking for that memory stick.
AGRA always worked for the highest bidder,
I thought that might include you?
- Me?
- Well, I mean the British government, or whatever government you're currently propping up.
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.
They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong.
And that was that, we stopped using freelancers.
- Your initiative?
- My initiative.
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.
I don't like loose ends.
Not on my watch.
There was something else.
A detail.
A codeword.
Ammo?
It's all I've got.
Little enough.
Could you do some digging as a favour?
You don't have many favours left.
Then I'm calling them all in.
And if you can find who's after her and neutralise them, what then?
You think you can go on saving her forever?
Of course.
Is that sentiment talking?
No, it's me.
Difficult to tell the difference these days.
Told you, I made a promise.
A vow.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.
Not on my watch.
'My darling, I need to tell you this because you mustn't hate me for going away.'
Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.
- Can you hear a squeaking?
- No.
Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel.
Why Planes Fail.
- Did you see it?
Oh, truly terrifying.
- Can't say I did.
Swore I would never fly again, yet hear I am!
Everything OK, madam?
No.
No, no, it's not, but then what's the use in complaining?
I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off is all.
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.
Oh, OK.
Relax.
She said relax.
Did you have a nice time in London?
It was OK, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun?
Did you lose it in the war?
'I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.
I'm not running, I promise you that,
I just need to do this in my own way.'
Oh, God!
I'm...
I-I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God!
- Everything OK, madam?
- I think I'm dying.
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.
God will smile on you.
'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,
I'm sorry, my love.'
I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.
Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of a dice.
I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
I swear I will.'
Not like this one.
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in!
I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.
Mr Baker.
Well, that completes the set.
- No, it does not.
- Well, who else am I missing?
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?
Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.
Oh, hi, Mary.
What concept?
Happy families.
Nice trip?
- How the f...?
- Please, Mary, there is a child present.
- How did you get in here?
- Karim let me in.
Hello.
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Nice to meet you, missus.
No, I mean how did you find me?
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
No, really, though, how?
Every movement I made was entirely random, every new personality just on the roll of a dice!
Mary, no human action is ever truly random.
An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability, mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual, can reduce the number of variables considerably.
I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine a seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.
But they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.
Oh, you bastard!
- You bastard!
- I know, but your face!
"The mathematics of probability"?
- You believed that.
- "Feasible variables"?
Yes, I started to run out about then.
In the memory stick!
Yeah, that was my idea.
- AGRA?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
You said it was your initials.
In a way that was true.
In a way?
So many lies.
I'm so sorry.
And I don't just mean you.
What?
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...
You're R?
Rosamund?
Rosamund Mary.
I always liked Mary.
Yeah, me too.
I used to.
I just...
I didn't know what else to do.
You could have stayed, you could have talked to me.
That's what couples are supposed to do.
Work things through.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Mary, I may not be a very good man but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for,
- most of the time.
- All the time.
You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.
You never judge, you never complain.
I don't deserve you, I...
All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
I will keep you safe.
But it has to be in London.
It's my city, I know the turf.
Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.
Get down!
Hello again.
- Ajay?
- Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.
Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.
I thought I was the only one who got out.
How did you find us?
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.
You found her but I found you.
So perhaps not so clever.
And now here we are.
At last.
Touche!
Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
She thought I was dead.
I might as well have been.
It was always just the four of us, always, remember?
Oh, yeah.
So why do you want to kill me?
Do you know how long they kept me prisoner?
What they did to me?
They tortured Alex to death.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.
But you?
You, where were you?
That day at the embassy, I escaped.
Ha!
But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
Where were you?
Oh, I got out.
For a while.
Long enough to hide my memory stick.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.
I was loyal, you see.
Loyal to my friends.
But they took me, tortured me.
Not for information.
Not for anything except fun.
They thought I'd give in, die, but I didn't, I lived.
And eventually, they forgot about me rotting in a cell somewhere.
Six years they kept me there.
Until one day I saw my chance.
Oh, and I made them pay.
You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.
Little whispers.
Laughter.
Gossip.
How the clever agents had been betrayed.
Brought down by you!
Me?
You know I'll kill you too.
You know I will, Ajay.
What, you think I care if I die?
I've dreamed of killing you every night for six years.
Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.
I swear to you, Ajay.
What did you hear, Ajay?
When you were a prisoner, what exactly did you hear?
What did I hear?
Ammo.
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo."
We were betrayed!
- And they said it was her?
- That you betrayed us!
They said her name?
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.
No!
No!
'The English woman, that's all he heard.
Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.'
Couldn't this wait until you're back?
No, it's not over.
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed, the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.
There was only a voice on the phone.
'Remember?
And a codeword.'
"Ammo," yes, you said.
How's your Latin, brother dear?
My Latin?
Amo, amas, amat.
I love, you love, he loves.
What...?
Not "Ammo" as in ammunition, but "Amo", meaning?
You'd better be right, Sherlock.
Bloody thing!
What's going on?
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.
What?
'So many lies.
And I don't just mean you.'
- Hello.
- Ah, hello.
- I like your daisy.
- Thank you, yeah.
It's not really me, though, I think.
- No?
- No, no, it's too floral for me.
I'm more of a "knackered with weary old eyes" kind of guy.
Well, I think they're nice.
Nice eyes.
- Thank you.
- Look...
Look...
I don't normally do this,
- but, um...
- But you're going to.
Yeah.
- What's this?
- This is me.
- Thank you.
Cheers.
- Yeah.
Great.
- Bye!
- Bye.

_
_
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
Hmm?
Noticed what?
The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
- Yeah, can't she?
- Hmm.
I'm coming darling.
I'm coming.
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
- _
- Come here...
It's OK.
_
- _
- Do you want a cuddle?
_
I know.
- Oh, sweetheart.
- _
_
Ssh.
Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you?
_
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?
Oh, let's go and see Daddy!
Daddy's here.
It's OK, Rosie.
I'll take her.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I may as well get up now.
Hey, baby, it's Daddy.
Your daddy.
Come here, Rose.
Come here, darling, it's all right.
Thank you.
_
_
This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.
How many more times?
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.
And you're basing all this on a code name?
On a whispered voice on the telephone?
Come on, Mycroft.
You were the conduit for AGRA.
Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
It was my job.
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
AGRA went in.
- Yes.
- And they were betrayed.
Not by me.
Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.
I promise you,
I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.
You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.
Not one.
Not.
One.
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories?
I'd like to do those.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.
Although she does seem to enjoy them.
Well, I'll have to give that a go.
Got a lot to catch up on.
'You think you understand.
You understand nothing.'
'Code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love.'
'You'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.
'They know everything.'
'They said it was the English woman.'
'Don't minute any of this.'
'They know everything.'
- You don't make it easy, do you?
- What do you mean?
Well, being... being so perfect.
Mary, I...
I need to tell you...
Hang on.
Can you tell me later?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Great.
Well, no, we can't just go.
- Rosie.
- Yeah.
- Er, you go.
- No!
I'll come as soon as I've found someone.
Mrs Hudson.
- Corfu till Saturday.
Molly?
- Er, yeah, I'll try.
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.
You know that's not going to happen.
If there's more to this case, you need to see it.
Yeah, OK, you win.
'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes.
'Please make your way to the exit.
Thank you.'
Your office said I'd find you here.
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.
We're like them.
Ghostly, living in the shadows.
Predatory?
Well, it depends which side you're on.
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.
Nice location for the final act, couldn't have chosen it better myself.
But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.
I just come here to look at the fish.
I knew this would happen one day.
- It's like that old story.
- I really am a very busy man.
Would you mind cutting to the chase?
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
With good reason.
"There was once a merchant, in a famous market in Baghdad."
I really have never liked this story.
I'm just like the merchant in the story,
I thought I could out-run the inevitable.
I've always been looking over my shoulder, always expecting to see the grim figure of...
Death.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hey.
- John?
- On his way.
Let me introduce Ammo.
You were Ammo?
You were the person on the phone that time?
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
Why did you betray us?
Why does anyone do anything?
- Hmm.
- Let me guess, selling secrets?
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.
Worked very well for a few years.
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it.
But...
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.
I couldn't believe my luck!
That bought me a little time.
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
Very handy.
They were always such reliable killers.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.
Lady Smallwood gave the order.
But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.
Seemed to do the trick.
And you thought your troubles were over.
I was tired.
Tired of the mess of it all.
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.
The hostages were killed.
AGRA too.
Or so I thought.
My secret was safe.
But... apparently not.
Just a little peace.
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
A family?
Home?
Really, I understand.
So, just let me get out of here, right?
Let me just walk away.
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.
What do you say?
After what you did?
!
Mary, no!
OK.
London Aquarium.
Yes, now.
I was never a field agent.
I always thought I'd be rather good.
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
Thanks.
- For a secretary.
- What?
It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
- I didn't do this out of jealousy.
- No?
Same old drudge, day in, day out.
Never getting out there where all the excitement was.
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.
Yes, your little flat.
- How do you know?
- Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?
And what are you, widowed or divorced?
Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.
That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.
- Sherlock...
- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.
A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.
- Sherlock, don't.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.
There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
That accounts for the drink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.
So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.
To prove how good you are.
To make up for the inadequacies of your...
little life.
Well, Mrs Norbury,
I must admit this is unexpected.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.
All except Sherlock Holmes.
There's no way out.
So it would seem.
You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.
It's what I do.
Maybe I can still surprise you.
Now, come on, be sensible.
Hmm, no, I don't think so.
Ah!
Surprise!
Everything's fine.
It's going to be OK.
Get an ambulance!
It's all right, it's all right.
- Mary!
- John.
All right, Mary?
Mary?
Stay with me, stay with me.
- Oh, come on...
- No, don't worry.
Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
Come on, Mary.
Mary?
Oh, God.
John, I think this is it.
No, no, no, no.
It's not.
- That's...
- You made me so happy.
You gave me everything I could ever, ever have wanted...
Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.
- Look after Rosie.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.
- Promise me.
- I promise.
- No...
- Yes, I promise.
- Promise me!
- I promise, I promise.
Ssh, ssh.
Hey, Sherlock.
Yes.
I... so like you.
Did I ever say?
Yes, yes, you did.
I'm sorry for... for shooting you that time.
I'm really sorry.
It's all right.
I think we're even now, OK?
OK.
- Oh, I think we're...
- Mary, Mary...
- ...even, definitely even.
- Ssh, ssh.
You were my whole world.
Being Mary Watson was the only life worth living.
- Mary...
- Thank you.
Mary...
Don't you dare!
You made a vow.
You swore it.
'You've been having dreams.
A recurring dream?
'
Do you want to talk about it?
This is a two-way relationship, you know.
The whole world has come crashing down around you.
Everything's hopeless.
Irretrievable.
I know that's what you must feel but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
That's not really my style.
I need to know what to do.
Do?
About John.
Put me through to Sherrinford, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
But nothing will ever be the same again, will it?
I'm afraid it won't.
We'll have to rally round, I expect, do our bit.
Look after little Rosie.
I'm just going to, um look through these things.
There might be a case.
A case?
Oh, you're not up to it, are you?
Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.
Yes.
Yes, I expect you're right.
I'll make some tea, shall I?
- Mrs Hudson?
- Yes, Sherlock?
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident...
- Yes?
- ...would you just say the word Norbury to me?
Would you?
Norbury?
Just that.
I'd be very grateful.
What's this?
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.
Oh, God!
Is that...?
- Must be.
- Oh.
I knew it wouldn't end like this.
I knew Moriarty made plans.
'I thought that would get your attention.
So, this is in case...
In case the day comes.
If you are watching this, I'm probably dead.
I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows?
Nothing's certain, nothing's written.
My old life it was full of consequences.
The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.
You need to remember that.
So I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
Might be the hardest case of your career.
When I'm... gone, if I'm gone I need you to do something for me.'
Hi.
I just wondered how things were going and if there was anything I could do.
It's, er, it's from John.
- Right.
- You don't need to read it now.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.
He says...
John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...
Yes?
He said he'd that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Anyone.
'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
When I'm gone, if I'm... gone I need you to do something for me.
Save John Watson.
Save him, Sherlock.
Save him.'
'When does the path we walk on lock around our feet?
When does the road become a river with only one destination?
'
'Death waits for us all in Samarra.
But can Samarra be avoided?
'
Go to hell, Sherlock!
My brother is a murderer.
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.
Oh, do your research.
I'm not a hero -
- I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Merry Christmas!
I'm not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.
You know what happened to the other one.
Miss me?
'Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
'
I've only been gone four minutes.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Is that quite clear?
Don't minute any of this.
Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.
A D notice has been slapped on the entire incident.
Only those within this room, code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love, will ever know the whole truth.
As far as everyone else is concerned, going to the Prime Minister and way beyond, Charles Augustus...
Are you tweeting?
!
No.
Well, that's what it looks like!
Of course I'm not tweeting.
Why would I be tweeting?
Give me that!
What?
No!
What are you doing?
!
Get off!
Give it here!
"Back on terra firma." Don't read them out.
"Free as a bird." God, you're such a spoilsport.
Will you take this matter seriously, Sherlock?
I am!
What makes you think I'm not taking it seriously?
"#OhWhatABeautifulMorning"
Look, not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death - my death!
And now I'm back, in a nice warm office, with my big brother and...
Are those ginger nuts?
Oh, God...
LOVE ginger nuts.
Our doctor said you were clean.
I am.
Utterly.
No need for stimulants now, remember?
I have work to do.
You're high as a kite!
Natural high, I assure you.
Totally natural.
I'm just...
♪ ..glad to be alive!
♪
What shall we do next?
What's your name?
Vivian.
What would you do, Vivian?
Pardon?
Well, it's a lovely day.
Go for a stroll?
Make a paper aeroplane?
Have an ice lolly?
Ice lolly, I suppose.
Ice lolly it is!
What's your favourite?
Well, really, I shouldn't...
Go on.
Do they still do Mivvies?
Mr Holmes...
- Yes?
..we do need to get on.
- Yes, of course.
'Do your research.
'I'm not a hero - I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
'..sociopath.
I see.
Who is supposed to have shot him, then?
Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger - that's who.
That's not what happened at all.
It is now.
Remarkable.
How did you do it?
We have some very talented people working here.
If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.
That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.
No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.
You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.
You're home and dry.
OK, cheers.
Obviously, there's unfinished business.
Moriarty.
I told you
- Moriarty's dead.
You say he filmed that video message before he died.
Yes.
You also say you know what he's going to do next.
What does that mean?
Perhaps that's all there is to it.
Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
No, no, he would never be that disappointing.
He's planned something, something long-term.
Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.
Posthumous revenge.
No, better than that - posthumous game.
We brought you back to deal with this.
What are you going to do?
- Wait.
Wait?
!
Of course wait.
I'm the target - targets wait.
Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up,
I'll know when it begins.
I always know when the game is on.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because I love it.
There was once a merchant, in the famous market at Baghdad.
One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise, and he knew that the stranger was Death.
Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles, to the city of Samarra.
For there he was sure Death could not find him.
But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.
"Very well," said the merchant.
"I give in.
I am yours."
"But tell me, why did you look surprised"
"when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"
"Because," said Death,
"I had an appointment with you tonight..."
"in Samarra."
If this gets any better, I'm going to get two knives.
Pays to advertise.
So, what about Moriarty, then?
- Oh, I have a plan.
I'm going to monitor the underworld, every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
So, basically, your plan is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do?
Awesome, isn't it?
He drowned, Mr Holmes.
- That's what we thought.
But when they opened up his lungs...
- Yes?
- ..
Sand.
Superficial.
Come back!
It's the wrong thumb.
Sherlock...
It's never twins.
Hopkins, arrest Wilson.
Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.
'Wilson?
' 'Lymph nodes?
' Sherlock...
Yes, you may have nothing but a limbless torso, but there'll be traces of ink in the lymph nodes under the armpits.
If your mystery corpse had tattoos, the signs will be there.
'Bloody hell!
Is that a guess?
'
- I never guess.
Sherlock... - 'So, he's the killer?
The canary trainer?
'
Of course he's the killer.
- 'Didn't see that coming.'
Hm, naturally.
Sherlock, you can't go on spinning plates like this.
That's it!
The place was spinning.
The heart medication you're taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.
Yes, I...
I think so.
Why?
Because the fingerprints on your brother's neck were your own.
A jellyfish?
- I know.
You can't arrest a jellyfish.
- You could try.
We did try.
Oh...
Oh, God.
- Mary?
- 59 missed calls.
We're in a lot of trouble.
Ow!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Relax, it's got two syllables...
I'm a nurse, darling - I think I know what to do!
Come on, then...
Re!
Lax!
No, just drive, please, God, just drive!
God, drive!
Sherlock
- Mary!
That's it, Mary - re...
Don't you start!
- ..
Lax.
John, John...
I think you have to pull over!
Mary, Mary...
- Pull over!
Oh, my God!
Has that come out?
They never come out when I take them.
Let's have a look.
Aw, she's so beautiful.
Have another go.
What about a name?
Catherine.
- Uh, yeah, we've gone off that.
Have we?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Well, you know what I think...
- It's not a girl's name.
Molly, Mrs H, we would love you to be godparents.
Oh!
- If you...
- Really?
That's so lovely.
And, uh... you too, Sherlock?
You too what?
Godfather, we'd like you to be godfather.
God is a ludicrous fiction, dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.
Yeah, but there'll be cake.
Will you do it?
I'll get back to you.
Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.
In Christ's name.
Now, what name have you given your daughter?
Rosamund Mary.
Rosamund?
It means "Rose of the world".
Rosie for short.
Didn't you get John's text?
No.
I delete his texts.
I delete any text that begins "Hi."
No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.
Sorry.
Phone!
And now, godparents, are you ready to help the parents of this child in their duties as Christian parents?
We are.
'Sorry, I didn't catch that.
'Please repeat the question.'
As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.
To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
Hard logic versus romantic whimsy - that is your choice.
You fail to connect actions to their consequences.
Now, for the last time, if you want to keep the rattle, do not throw the rattle.
All right, good girl, good girl.
Good girl.
I'd better finish this, hadn't I?
Hey.
Afternoon.
He says you've got a good one, Greg?
Oh, yeah.
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.
God, 50!
Where does it go?
I know for a fact I was only 21 this time last week.
Yeah, well that's impossible.
That was before you met me.
Well, no, no, there never was...
"There never was such a time."
She's looking at me disapprovingly again.
No.
She's just jealous.
Yeah, well, I think we both are.
Oh...
No, no, David.
Come on, you promised.
No, it's...
Oh, no...
Oh, it's a Skype call.
Oh!
Then it must be Charlie.
At least he's phoning, I suppose.
Oh, look!
Hello!
'Hey, Dad.
Happy birthday.
'Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?
'
No!
Picture's frozen!
'Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you.'
Why is it rubbish?
Where are you?
How is he?
Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.
No...
David?
Come on!
OK, no, hang on a sec, I'll find somewhere quieter.
So, Charlie, where are you?
Are you there?
'Sorry, I'm here.
I'm just a bit...'
- Are you all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
- Altitude?
'I'm in Tibet.
Didn't you see the mountains?
'
- Never mind mountains.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.
'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?
'
- What?
'Could you just check something on my car?
'
- Your car?
'To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe.
'I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet.
'Could you take a photo and send it?
'
- Uh, yes, I can do that.
All done.
Have you got it?
Charlie?
A week later...
Yeah?
..something really weird happens.
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed, the cops are chasing him, and he turns into the drive of the Welsborough house to try and get away.
Unfortunately...
The drunk guy survived, they managed to pull him out, but when they put the fire out and examined the parked car...
Whose body?
Charlie Welsborough, the son.
What?
- The son who was in Tibet.
DNA all checks out.
Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.
Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
Have you got a lab report?
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.
The seats?
- Yes, the car seats.
Made of vinyl.
Two different types of vinyl present.
Was it his own car?
Yeah, not flash - he was a student.
Well, that's suggestive.
- Why?
Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
- Yeah, right?
There's something else.
- Yes?
According to this,
Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.
What?
The body in the car, dead for a week.
Oh, this is a good one.
Is it my birthday?
You want help?
Yes, please.
- One condition.
- OK.
Take all the credit.
It gets boring if I just solve them all.
Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.
He's got a point.
Which makes me look like some kind of prima donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do!
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.
Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
- Definitely a sore spot.
So you take all the glory, thanks...
- OK!
- ..
Thanks all the same.
Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?
It's driving me nuts.
Anything you say, Giles.
Just kidding.
What's his name?
Greg.
- What?
Greg.
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?
Not a clue.
It's just you normally say that at this point.
Hmm.
Well, then, let's hope you solve your little problem, Greg.
Hear that?
I know.
So, how's it going then, fatherhood?
- Oh, good, great.
Yeah, amazing.
Getting any sleep?
- Christ, no.
You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.
Must feel very different...
Sorry, what?
Yes, well, you know how it is.
All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.
Are you two having a little joke?
Never a word of thanks.
Can't even tell people's faces apart.
This is a joke, isn't it?
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever.
You're so, so clever."
Is it about me?
- I think he needs winding.
You know, I think that really might be it.
- No, don't get it.
Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect, so go easy on them, yeah?
You know me. - 'Hey, hello.'
- Yeah.
Got them, don't worry.
Pampers, the cream you can't get from Boots.
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now?
At the dead boy's house?
- Yeah.
'And what does he think?
Any theories?
'
Well, I texted you the details.
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.
Hey!
How do you know about that?
'Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.'
They know everything!
'Solved it, then?
'
I'm working on it. 'Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.'
Pig!
Keep trying.
'So, what about it, then?
'What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it?
'And what are you going to call this one?
'
Oh, the Ghost Driver.
Don't give it a title.
People like the titles.
They hate the titles.
Give the people what they want.
No, never do that - people are stupid.
Uh, SOME people.
'All people are stupid.
'Most people.'
'Bizarre enough though, isn't it, to be him?
'
I mean, it's right up your strasse.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.
- Son.
- Son!
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.
If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.
Well, I believe that I... ..can.
But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
Sherlock?
Mr Holmes?
Sorry, you were saying?
Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
I don't think we'll ever get over this.
No.
Shouldn't think so.
So sorry, will you excuse me a moment?
I just...
I'll...
I'll just, um...
Ahem.
Now what's wrong?
Not sure, I just...
By the pricking of my thumbs.
Seriously?
You?
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.
They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.
What is this?
Oh, it's a sort of shrine, I suppose, really.
Bit of a fan of Mrs T.
A big hero of mine when I was getting started.
Right, yes.
Who?
What?
Who...?
Who was this?
Are you serious?
Sherlock...
It's...
It's Margaret Thatcher, the first female Prime Minister of this country.
Right.
Prime Minister?
- Hmm.
Leader of the Government.
- Right.
Female?
- For God's sake!
You know perfectly well who she is.
Why are you playing for time?
It's the gap, look at the gap.
It's wrong.
Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed.
The whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.
This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been in, this picture is straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.
Something's missing from here, but only recently.
Yes, a...
Plaster bust... plaster bust.
Oh, for God's sake!
It got broken.
What the hell has this got to do with Charlie?
Rug!
What?
Well, how could it get broken?
The only place for it to fall is the floor and there is a big thick rug.
Does it matter?
Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.
It is worth letting him do this.
Is your friend quite mad?
No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
We found the remains out there in the porch.
The porch where we came in?
How anybody could hate her so much they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness...
I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.
Why didn't he smash all the others?
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.
Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.
And if there's nothing...
I know what happened to your son.
You do?
It's quite simple, superficial, to be blunt.
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness?
Well, yes.
And the porch where it was smashed,
I noticed the motion sensor was damaged, so I assume it's permanently lit.
How did you notice that?
I lack the arrogance to ignore details
- I'm not the police.
So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.
Exactly.
Why?
Don't know.
Wouldn't be fun if I knew.
Mr Holmes, please!
It was your 50th birthday, Mr Welsborough, of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
After all, he was in Tibet.
Yes.
No.
No?
♪ Happy birthday... ♪
The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video.
Easily arranged.
It's a Skype call.
The trick was meant to be a surprise.
A trick?
Obviously.
Could you take a photo and send it?
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.
Well, good enough.
Effectively a costume.
You're joking?
No, I'm not.
All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
Oh, my God!
Surprise!
That's when it happened.
I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.
You said he'd felt unwell?
You all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
He died there and then.
No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained, in the driver's seat, hidden, until...
When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who'd been sitting there, quite dead, for a week.
Oh, God!
Poor kid.
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.
This is where it was smashed.
That was amazing.
What?
The car, the kid.
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?
I can't stand it, never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
What kind of a life would that be?
Besides, I have the strangest feeling...
Miss me?
That's mine.
You two take a... bus.
Why?
I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.
The Mall, please.
I met her once.
Thatcher?
Rather arrogant, I thought.
YOU thought that?
!
Ha, I know.
Why am I looking at this?
That's her, John and Mary's baby.
Oh, I see, yes.
Looks very... fully functioning.
Is that really the best you can do?
Sorry, I've never been very good with them.
Babies?
Humans.
Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?
Any interest in her?
Why on earth would he?
I don't know.
You tell me.
In the last year of his life,
James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over 70 assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias,
which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.
It's a pearl - get another one.
There's something important about this.
I'm sure.
Maybe it's Moriarty.
Maybe it's not.
But something's coming.
Are you having a premonition, brother mine?
The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other.
What we call premonition is just movement of the web.
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable.
As inevitable as mathematics.
Appointment In Samarra.
I'm sorry?
The merchant who can't outrun Death.
You always hated that story as a child.
Less keen on predestination back then.
I'm not sure I like it now.
You wrote your own version, as I remember.
Appointment In Sumatra.
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.
Goodnight, Mycroft.
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.
Keep me informed.
Of what?
Absolutely no idea.
'Ammo!
'
Oh, hi, Stella.
Greg.
You, uh...?
Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...
Right, right, right...
Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?
It's nothing.
I mean it's nothing serious.
No, no.
I just pop round every now and again for a chat.
Yeah, of course.
I mean he loves a really tricky case.
Yeah, he does!
So what you here for?
Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so...
The Borgia Pearl?
They still after that, are they?
Yeah.
So, how did you two first meet?
Oh, well, there was a case about, um, ten years ago.
Nobody could figure it out.
There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.
Oh, yeah?
How did she die?
Hypothermia.
What?
I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...
Will you two please keep it down?
!
Sorry.
Sorry.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?
You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.
I was a carpenter.
Like me dad.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
How the hell...?
Ah... e-cigarettes.
Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.
If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.
But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last.
Anything to add, John?
John?
Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.
What is that?
That is... me.
Well, it's a me substitute.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You know I value your little contributions.
Yeah?
It's been there since nine this morning.
Has it?
Where were you?
Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.
What about my girlfriend?
What?
You said I had an ex...
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.
The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.
I...
I thought you'd done something clever.
Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
What do you mean?
Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
Well...
You thought she was having an affair.
I'm afraid it's far worse than that - your wife is a spy.
What?
That's right.
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy, across the road from your flat.
Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy, as part of an official state visit.
As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.
This drug will render the President entirely susceptible to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty.
What?
Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III.
Are you serious?
No, of course not.
His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.
I don't!
Just the bras.
Get out.
So, what's this all about, then?
Having fun.
Fun?
While I can.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, Sherlock...
Borgia Pearl.
Boring.
Go!
But...
Go!
This had better be good.
Oh, I think you'll like it.
That is the bust, isn't it?
The one that was broken.
No, it's another one - different owner.
Different part of town.
You were right - this is a thing.
Something's going on.
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be pleased.
I am pleased.
You don't look pleased.
This is my game face.
And the game is on.
Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one.
One belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan.
Identical busts?
Yeah, and this one to a Dr Barnicot in Holborn.
Three in total.
God knows who'd want to do something like this.
Yeah, but some people have that complex, don't they?
An idee fixe.
They obsess over one thing and they can't let it go.
No, no good.
There were other images of Margaret...
Margaret...?
You know who she is.
..Thatcher, present at the first break-in.
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?
Ooh!
What?
Blood.
Quite a bit of it, too.
Was there any injury at the crime scene?
Nah.
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.
Come on.
Holborn?
Lambeth!
Lambeth?
Why?
To see Toby.
Ah, right.
Who?
You'll see.
Right, are you coming?
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.
Who told you?
The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.
Have a good time.
I will.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
What?
She's not the one.
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.
How do you work all that out?
She's got three children in Rio that he doesn't know about.
Are you just making this up?
Possibly.
Who's Toby?
There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker, one of the world's best.
Got himself into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago.
He hacked into the Pentagon security system, and I managed to get him off the charge.
Therefore he owes me a favour.
So, how does that help us?
What?
Toby the hacker?
Toby's not the hacker.
What?
All right, Craig?
All right, Sherlock?
Craig's got a dog.
So I see.
Good boy!
Hiya!
Mary?
What are you...?
No, we, we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case.
No, exactly.
So... don't wait up.
Hey, Sherlock.
Hey.
Mary, what are you doing here?
She's better at this than you.
Better?
So I texted her.
Hang on, Mary's better than me?
Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.
Of course she's better.
Yeah, OK.
Nothing personal.
What, so I'm supposed to just go home now, am I?
What do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?
John or the dog?
Ha-ha, that's funny!
John.
Well...
He's handy and loyal.
That's hilarious.
Hmm.
Is it too early for a divorce?
Oh.
Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge?
Keep up, he's fast.
He's not moving.
He's thinking.
He's really not moving.
Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.
You just like this dog, don't you?
Well, I like you.
He's still not moving.
Fascinating.
Oh!
Well, what do you make of it?
They were looking for something.
Yes, but it wasn't a burglar, they came specifically for that Thatcher bust.
Why?
Clever.
Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail, where would you go?
Like hiding a tree in a forest.
Or blood in a butcher's.
Never mind, Toby, better luck next time, hmm?
This is it, though.
This is the one, I can feel it.
Not Moriarty?
It has to be him.
It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.
It's designed to beguile me, tease me and lure me in.
At last, a noose for me to put my neck into.
You should have seen the state of the front room.
It was like The Exorcist.
Huh.
Was Rosie's head spinning round?
No.
Just the projectile vomiting.
Nice!
Hmm.
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
Hmm?
Noticed what?
The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
So?
Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
Yeah, can't she?
I'm coming, darling.
Mummy's coming.
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here.
Have you heard of that thing?
In Germany?
You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.
Ostalgie.
People who missed the old days under the communists.
People are weird, aren't they?
Hmm.
According to this, there's quite a market for Cold War memorabilia.
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit?
Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.
Yes, fascinating.
Irrelevant.
Where exactly did they come from?
I've got into the records of the suppliers
- Gelder and Co.
Seems they're from Georgia.
Where exactly?
Tbilisi.
Batch of six.
One to Welsborough.
One to Hassan.
One to Dr Barnicot.
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.
One to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.
Lestrade?
Another one?
'Yeah.'
- Harker or Sandeford?
Harker.
And it's murder this time.
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.
Defensive wounds on her face and hands, throat cut.
Sharp blade.
The same thing inside the house?
The bust?
Two of them this time.
Interesting.
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago.
Limited edition of six.
- And now someone's wandering about destroying them all.
Makes no sense.
What's the point?
No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.
Yes, it is.
Well, it is, but it's not the point.
I've been slow, far too slow.
Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind...
Slow but lucky, very lucky.
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.
Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.
Congratulations, by the way.
I'm sorry?
Well, you're about to solve a big one.
Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
Yeah, until then, basically.
That's enough now, love.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.
And you need to get to bed.
Come on.
Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?
You were on the run.
Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying, it's clever.
Very clever.
But now you've met me and you're not so clever, are you?
Who are you?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.
Argh!
You're out of time.
Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
Who?
I know it's him.
It must be him.
You think you understand.
You understand nothing.
Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don't we just enjoy the moment?
Let me present Interpol's number one case.
Too tough for them, too boring for me.
The Black Pearl of the Borgias!
It's not possible!
How could she...?
!
Everything about who I was is on there.
The problems of your past are your business.
The problems of your future... ..are my privilege.
I don't understand.
She...
She destroyed it.
She?
You know her!
You do, don't you?
You know the bitch?
!
She betrayed me.
Betrayed us all.
Mary.
This is about Mary?
Is that what she's calling herself now, eh?
'Armed police, you're surrounded!
' Give it to me.
Give it to me!
'Come out slowly, I want to see your hands above your head.'
Nobody shoots me!
Anyone shoots, I kill this man.
'Lay down your weapon.
Do it now!
'
I'm leaving this place.
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.
'Lay down your weapon.'
You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
Tell her she's a dead woman.
She's a dead woman walking.
She's my friend.
And she's under my protection.
Who are you?
I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.
Who's Sherlock Holmes?
Not a policeman.
What do you think?
Mate in two?
Don't antagonise them, darling.
Oh, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.
Everything palls.
They'll send someone soon.
They?
Who are THEY?
Seems to me we put an awful lot of faith in THEY.
Well, I've got something THEY would dearly love, if only we could get out of here.
I've got Ammo.
Ammo?
Madame Ambassador.
- What took you so long?
Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now!
Veer left!
What now?
What do we do?
We die.
Well?
He can't have got far.
- We'll have him in a bit.
I very much doubt it.
- Why?
Because I think he used to work with Mary.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out!
We'll come back later.
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the English woman?
What would you do to a traitor?
Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.
I am an idiot, I know nothing.
Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
That was quite a text you sent me.
What's going on, Sherlock?
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,
I couldn't see what was right under my nose.
Expected a pearl.
Oh, my God, that's a...
Yes, it's an AGRA.
Memory stick, like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.
Who?
I don't know.
We...
We all had one but the others were...
Haven't you even looked at it yet?
I glanced at it but I prefer to hear it from you.
Why?
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.
There were four of us, agents.
Not just agents.
Polite term.
Alex.
Gabriel.
Me.
And Ajay.
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.
We all had one.
Each containing aliases, our background, everything.
We could never be betrayed, because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.
Who employed you?
Anyone who paid well.
I mean, we were at the top of our game for years.
And then it all ended.
There was a coup in Georgia.
The British Embassy in Tbilisi was taken over, lots of hostages.
We got the call to go in, get them out.
There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.
Who from?
I don't know, just another voice on the phone.
And a codeword.
Ammo.
Ammo?
Like ammunition.
We went in, but then something went wrong.
Something went really wrong.
That was six years ago.
It feels like forever.
I was the only one that made it out.
No.
What?
I met someone tonight.
Same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.
What, he's alive?
Yeah, very much so.
I don't believe it, this is amazing!
I thought I was the only one,
I thought I was the only one who got out.
Where is he?
I need to see him, now!
Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?
Yeah, of course.
It was our insurance.
Above all, they mustn't fall into enemy hands.
So Ajay survived as well.
And now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide, with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why?
I don't know.
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.
Families fall out.
The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
Well, he's just trying to find me.
He survived, that's all that matters!
I heard it from his own mouth.
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."
Why would he want to kill me?
He said you betrayed him.
Oh, no, no, that's insane.
Well, it's what he believes.
I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.
No, Mary...
You do.
I made a vow, remember?
To look after the three of you.
Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
There's something I think you should read.
What is it?
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.
What are you...?
Mary...
There you go.
Oh, no!
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.
No.
You just look after them till I get back.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Agra?
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
It is 378km west of the state capital, Lucknow.
What are you, Wikipedia?
Yes.
AGRA is an acronym.
Oh, good, I love an acronym.
All the best secret societies have them.
Team of agents, the best.
But you know all that.
Of course I do.
Go on.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.
Indeed?
Well, that's news to me.
Is it?
He's already killed looking for that memory stick.
AGRA always worked for the highest bidder,
I thought that might include you?
Me?
Well, I mean the British government, or whatever government you're currently propping up.
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.
They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong.
And that was that, we stopped using freelancers.
Your initiative?
My initiative.
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.
I don't like loose ends.
Not on my watch.
There was something else.
A detail.
A codeword.
Ammo?
It's all I've got.
Little enough.
Could you do some digging as a favour?
You don't have many favours left.
Then I'm calling them all in.
And if you can find who's after her and neutralise them, what then?
You think you can go on saving her forever?
Of course.
Is that sentiment talking?
No, it's me.
Difficult to tell the difference these days.
Told you, I made a promise.
A vow.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.
Not on my watch.
'My darling, I need to tell you this 'because you mustn't hate me for going away.'
Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.
Can you hear a squeaking?
No.
Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel -
Why Planes Fail.
Did you see it?
Can't say I did.
Oh, truly terrifying.
Swore I would never fly again, yet hear I am!
Ha.
Everything OK, madam?
No.
No, no, it's not, but then what's the use in complaining?
I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off is all.
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.
Oh, OK.
Relax.
She said relax.
Did you have a nice time in London?
It was OK, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun?
Did you lose it in the war?
'I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.
'I'm not running, I promise you that,
'I just need to do this in my own way.'
Oh, God!
I'm...
I-I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God!
Everything OK, madam?
I think I'm dying.
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.
God will smile on you.
'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,
'I'm sorry, my love.'
'I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.
'Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate 'the roll of a dice.
'I need to move the target far, far away from you 'and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
'I swear I will.'
Not like this one.
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in!
I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.
Mr Baker.
Well, that completes the set.
No, it does not.
Well, who else am I missing?
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?
Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.
Oh, hi, Mary.
What concept?
Happy families.
Nice trip?
How the f...?
Please, Mary, there is a child present.
How did you get in here?
Karim let me in.
Hello.
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?
Sure.
Thank you.
Nice to meet you, missus.
No, I mean how did you find me?
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
No, really, though, how?
Every movement I made was entirely random, every new personality just on the roll of a dice!
Mary, no human action is ever truly random.
An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability, mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual, can reduce the number of variables considerably.
I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine a seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.
But they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.
Oh, you bastard!
You bastard!
I know, but your face!
"The mathematics of probability"?
You believed that.
"Feasible variables"?
Yes, I started to run out about then.
In the memory stick!
Yeah, that was my idea.
AGRA?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
You said it was your initials.
In a way that was true.
In a way?
So many lies.
I'm so sorry.
And I don't just mean you.
What?
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...
You're R?
Rosamund?
Rosamund Mary.
I always liked Mary.
Yeah, me too.
I used to.
I just...
I didn't know what else to do.
You could have stayed, you could have talked to me.
That's what couples are supposed to do.
Work things through.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Mary, I may not be a very good man... ..but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for, most of the time.
All the time.
You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.
You never judge, you never complain.
I don't deserve you, I...
All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
I will keep you safe.
But it has to be in London.
It's my city, I know the turf.
Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.
Get down!
Hello again.
Ajay?
Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.
Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.
I thought I was the only one who got out.
How did you find us?
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.
You found her but I found you.
So perhaps not so clever.
And now here we are.
At last.
Touche!
Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
She thought I was dead.
I might as well have been.
It was always just the four of us, always, remember?
Oh, yeah.
So why do you want to kill me?
Do you know how long they kept me prisoner?
What they did to me?
They tortured Alex to death.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.
But you?
You, where were you?
That day at the embassy, I escaped.
Ha!
But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
Where were you?
Oh, I got out.
For a while.
Long enough to hide my memory stick.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.
I was loyal, you see.
Loyal to my friends.
But they took me, tortured me.
Not for information.
Not for anything except fun.
They thought I'd give in, die, but I didn't, I lived.
And eventually, they forgot about me rotting in a cell somewhere.
Six years they kept me there.
Until one day I saw my chance.
Oh, and I made them pay.
You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.
Little whispers.
Laughter.
Gossip.
How the clever agents had been betrayed.
Brought down by you!
Me?
You know I'll kill you too.
You know I will, Ajay.
What, you think I care if I die?
I've dreamed of killing you... ..every night for six years.
Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.
I swear to you, Ajay.
What did you hear, Ajay?
When you were a prisoner, what EXACTLY did you hear?
What did I hear?
Ammo.
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo."
"Ammo."
"Ammo.
Ammo."
We were betrayed!
And they said it was her?
That you betrayed us!
They said her name?
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.
No!
No!
'The English woman, that's all he heard.
'Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.'
Couldn't this wait until you're back?
No, it's not over.
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed, the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.
There was only a voice on the phone.
'Remember?
And a codeword.'
"Ammo," yes, you said.
How's your Latin, brother dear?
My Latin?
Amo, amas, amat.
I love, you love, he loves.
What...?
Not "Ammo" as in ammunition, but "Amo", meaning?
You'd better be right, Sherlock.
Bloody thing!
What's going on?
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.
What?
'So many lies.
And I don't just mean you.'
Hello.
Ah, hello.
I like your daisy.
Thank you, yeah.
It's not really me, though, I think.
No?
No, no, it's too floral for me.
I'm more of a "knackered with weary old eyes" kind of guy.
Well, I think they're nice.
Nice eyes.
Thank you.
Look...
Look...
I don't normally do this, but, um...
But you're going to.
Yeah.
What's this?
This is me.
Thank you.
Cheers.
Yeah.
Great.
Bye!
Bye.
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
Hmm?
Noticed what?
The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
So?
Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
Yeah, can't she?
Hmm.
I'm coming darling.
I'm coming.
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here...
It's OK.
Do you want a cuddle?
I know.
Oh, sweetheart.
Ssh.
Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you?
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?
Oh, let's go and see Daddy!
Daddy's here.
It's OK, Rosie.
I'll take her.
Yeah?
Yeah, I may as well get up now.
Hey, baby, it's Daddy.
Your daddy.
Come here, Rose.
Come here, darling, it's all right.
Thank you.
This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.
How many more times?
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.
And you're basing all this on a code name?
On a whispered voice on the telephone?
Come on, Mycroft.
You were the conduit for AGRA.
Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
It was my job.
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
AGRA went in.
Yes.
And they were betrayed.
Not by me.
Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.
I promise you,
I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.
You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.
Not one.
Not.
One.
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories?
I'd like to do those.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.
Although she does seem to enjoy them.
Well, I'll have to give that a go.
Got a lot to catch up on.
'You think you understand.
You understand nothing.'
'Code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love.'
'You'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.
'They know everything.'
'They said it was the English woman.'
'Don't minute any of this.'
'They know everything.'
You don't make it easy, do you?
What do you mean?
Well, being... being so perfect.
Mary, I...
I need to tell you...
Hang on.
Can you tell me later?
Yeah.
Great.
Yeah.
Well, no, we can't just go.
Rosie.
Yeah.
Er, you go.
No!
I'll come as soon as I've found someone
- Mrs Hudson.
Corfu till Saturday.
Molly?
Er, yeah, I'll try.
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.
You know that's not going to happen.
If there's more to this case, you need to see it.
Yeah, OK, you win.
'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes.
'Please make your way to the exit.
Thank you.'
Your office said I'd find you here.
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.
We're like them.
Ghostly, living in the shadows.
Predatory?
Well, it depends which side you're on.
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.
Nice location for the final act, couldn't have chosen it better myself.
But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.
I just come here to look at the fish.
I knew this would happen one day.
It's like that old story.
I really am a very busy man.
Would you mind cutting to the chase?
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
With good reason.
"There was once a merchant, in a famous market in Baghdad."
I really have never liked this story.
I'm just like the merchant in the story,
I thought I could out-run the inevitable.
I've always been looking over my shoulder, always expecting to see the grim figure of...
Death.
Hello, Mary.
Hey.
John?
On his way.
Let me introduce Ammo.
You were Ammo?
You were the person on the phone that time?
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
Why did you betray us?
Why does anyone do anything?
Hmm.
Let me guess, selling secrets?
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.
Worked very well for a few years.
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it.
But...
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.
I couldn't believe my luck!
That bought me a little time.
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
Very handy.
They were always such reliable killers.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.
Lady Smallwood gave the order.
But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.
Seemed to do the trick.
And you thought your troubles were over.
I was tired.
Tired of the mess of it all.
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.
The hostages were killed.
AGRA too.
Or so I thought.
My secret was safe.
But... apparently not.
Just a little peace.
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
A family?
Home?
Really, I understand.
So, just let me get out of here, right?
Let me just walk away.
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.
What do you say?
After what you did?
!
Mary, no!
OK.
London Aquarium.
Yes, now.
I was never a field agent.
I always thought I'd be rather good.
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
Thanks.
For a secretary.
- What?
It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
I didn't do this out of jealousy.
- No?
Same old drudge, day in, day out.
Never getting out there where all the excitement was.
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.
Yes, your little flat.
- How do you know?
- Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?
And what are you, widowed or divorced?
Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.
That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.
Sherlock...
- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.
A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.
Sherlock, don't.
Pets do that, or so I'm told.
There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
That accounts for the drink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.
So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.
To prove how good you are.
To make up for the inadequacies of your...
little life.
Well, Mrs Norbury,
I must admit this is unexpected.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.
All except Sherlock Holmes.
There's no way out.
So it would seem.
You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.
It's what I do.
Maybe I can still surprise you.
Now, come on, be sensible.
Hmm, no, I don't think so.
Ah!
Surprise!
Everything's fine.
It's going to be OK.
Get an ambulance!
It's all right, it's all right.
Mary!
John.
All right, Mary?
Mary?
Stay with me, stay with me.
Oh, come on...
No, don't worry.
Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
Come on, Mary.
Mary?
Oh, God.
John, I think this is it.
No, no, no, no.
It's not.
That's...
You made me so happy.
You gave me everything I could ever, ever have wanted...
Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.
Look after Rosie.
Ssh, ssh, ssh.
Promise me.
I promise.
No...
Yes, I promise.
Promise me!
I promise, I promise.
Ssh, ssh.
Hey, Sherlock.
Yes.
I... so like you.
Did I ever say?
Yes, yes, you did.
I'm sorry for... for shooting you that time.
I'm really sorry.
It's all right.
I think we're even now, OK?
OK.
Oh, I think we're...
Mary, Mary... ..even, definitely even.
Ssh, ssh.
Ooh.
You were my whole world.
Being Mary Watson... ..was the only life worth living.
Mary...
Thank you.
Mary...
Don't you dare!
You made a vow.
You swore it.
'You've been having dreams.
A recurring dream?
'
Do you want to talk about it?
This is a two-way relationship, you know.
The whole world has come crashing down around you.
Everything's hopeless.
Irretrievable.
I know that's what you must feel... ..but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
That's not really my style.
I need to know what to do.
Do?
About John.
Put me through to Sherrinford, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
But nothing will ever be the same again, will it?
I'm afraid it won't.
We'll have to rally round, I expect, do our bit.
Look after little Rosie.
I'm just going to, um... ..look through these things.
There might be a case.
A case?
Oh, you're not up to it, are you?
Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.
Yes.
Yes, I expect you're right.
I'll make some tea, shall I?
Mrs Hudson?
- Yes, Sherlock?
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident...
Yes?
- ..
Would you just say the word Norbury to me?
Would you?
Norbury?
Just that.
I'd be very grateful.
What's this?
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.
Oh, God!
Is that...?
Must be.
- Oh.
I knew it wouldn't end like this.
I knew Moriarty made plans.
'I thought that would get your attention.
'So, this is in case...
'In case the day comes.
'If you are watching this, I'm probably dead.
'I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows?
'Nothing's certain, nothing's written.
'My old life... '..it was full of consequences.
'The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.
'You need to remember that.
So... '..
I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
'Might be the hardest case of your career.
'When I'm... gone, if I'm gone... '..
I need you to do something for me.'
Hi.
I just wondered how things were going and... ..if there was anything I could do.
It's, er, it's from John.
Right.
You don't need to read it now.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.
He says...
John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...
Yes?
He said he'd... ..that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Anyone.
'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
'When I'm gone, if I'm... gone... '..
I need you to do something for me.
'Save John Watson.
'Save him, Sherlock.
'Save him.'
'When does the path we walk on lock around our feet?
'When does the road become a river with only one destination?
'
'Death waits for us all in Samarra.
'But can Samarra be avoided?
'
'Go to hell, Sherlock.'
- _
- My brother is a murderer.
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.
Oh, do your research.
I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Merry Christmas!
I'm not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.
You know what happened to the other one.
Miss me?
'Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
'
I've only been gone four minutes.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Is that quite clear?
Don't minute any of this.
Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.
A D notice has been slapped on the entire incident.
Only those within this room, code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love, will ever know the whole truth.
As far as everyone else is concerned, going to the Prime Minister and way beyond, Charles Augustus...
- Are you tweeting?
!
- No.
Well, that's what it looks like!
Of course I'm not tweeting.
Why would I be tweeting?
- Give me that!
- What?
No!
What are you doing?
!
- Get off!
- Give it here!
- "Back on terra firma."
- Don't read them out.
- "Free as a bird."
- God, you're such a spoilsport.
Will you take this matter seriously, Sherlock?
I am!
What makes you think I'm not taking it seriously?
"#OhWhatABeautifulMorning"
Look, not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death - my death!
And now I'm back, in a nice warm office, with my big brother and...
Are those ginger nuts?
- Oh, God...
- Love ginger nuts.
Our doctor said you were clean.
I am.
Utterly.
No need for stimulants now, remember?
I have work to do.
You're high as a kite!
Natural high, I assure you.
Totally natural.
I'm just... ♪ ..glad to be alive!
♪
What shall we do next?
What's your name?
Vivian.
- What would you do, Vivian?
- Pardon?
Well, it's a lovely day.
Go for a stroll?
Make a paper aeroplane?
Have an ice lolly?
Ice lolly, I suppose.
Ice lolly it is!
- What's your favourite?
- Well, really, I shouldn't...
- Go on.
- Do they still do Mivvies?
- Mr Holmes...
- Yes?
- ...we do need to get on.
- Yes, of course.
'Do your research.
'I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
..sociopath.
I see.
Who is supposed to have shot him, then?
Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger - that's who.
- That's not what happened at all.
- It is now.
Remarkable.
How did you do it?
We have some very talented people working here.
If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.
That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.
No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.
You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.
You're home and dry.
OK, cheers.
Obviously, there's unfinished business.
Moriarty.
I told you
- Moriarty's dead.
You say he filmed that video message before he died.
Yes.
You also say you know what he's going to do next.
- What does that mean?
- Perhaps that's all there is to it.
Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
No, no, he would never be that disappointing.
He's planned something, something long-term.
Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.
Posthumous revenge.
No, better than that - posthumous game.
We brought you back to deal with this.
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.
Wait?
!
Of course wait.
I'm the target - targets wait.
Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up,
I'll know when it begins.
I always know when the game is on.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because I love it.
There was once a merchant, in the famous market at Baghdad.
One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise, and he knew that the stranger was Death.
Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles, to the city of Samarra.
For there he was sure Death could not find him.
But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.
"Very well," said the merchant.
"I give in.
I am yours."
"But tell me, why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"
"Because," said Death,
"I had an appointment with you tonight... ..in Samarra."
If this gets any better, I'm going to get two knives.
Pays to advertise.
- So, what about Moriarty, then?
- Oh, I have a plan.
I'm going to monitor the underworld, every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
So, basically, your plan is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do?
Awesome, isn't it?
He drowned, Mr Holmes.
That's what we thought.
- But when they opened up his lungs...
- Yes?
..sand.
Superficial.
Come back!
It's the wrong thumb.
_
Sherlock...
It's never twins.
Hopkins, arrest Wilson.
Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.
- 'Wilson?
' 'Lymph nodes?
'
- Sherlock...
Yes, you may have nothing but a limbless torso, but there'll be traces of ink in the lymph nodes under the armpits.
If your mystery corpse had tattoos, the signs will be there.
- 'Bloody hell!
Is that a guess?
'
- I never guess.
- Sherlock...
- 'So, he's the killer?
The canary trainer?
'
- Of course he's the killer.
- 'Didn't see that coming.'
Hm, naturally.
Sherlock, you can't go on spinning plates like this.
That's it!
The place was spinning.
The heart medication you're taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.
Yes, I...
I think so.
Why?
Because the fingerprints on your brother's neck were your own.
- A jellyfish?
- I know.
You can't arrest a jellyfish.
- You could try.
- We did try.
Oh...
- Oh, God.
- Mary?
59 missed calls.
We're in a lot of trouble.
Ow!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Relax, it's got two syllables...
I'm a nurse, darling - I think I know what to do!
- Come on, then...
- Re!
Lax!
No, just drive, please, God, just drive!
God, drive!
Sherlock
- Mary!
That's it, Mary - re...
- Don't you start!
- ...
lax.
John, John...
I think you have to pull over!
- Mary, Mary...
- Pull over!
Oh, my God!
Has that come out?
They never come out when I take them.
Let's have a look.
Aw, she's so beautiful.
- Have another go.
- What about a name?
- Catherine.
- Uh, yeah, we've gone off that.
Have we?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Well, you know what I think...
- It's not a girl's name.
Molly, Mrs H, we would love you to be godparents.
- Oh!
Really?
- If you...
That's so lovely.
And, uh... you too, Sherlock?
- You too what?
- Godfather, we'd like you to be godfather.
God is a ludicrous fiction, dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.
Yeah, but there'll be cake.
Will you do it?
I'll get back to you.
Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.
In Christ's name.
Now, what name have you given your daughter?
Rosamund Mary.
Rosamund?
It means "Rose of the world".
Rosie for short.
Didn't you get John's text?
No.
I delete his texts.
I delete any text that begins "Hi."
No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.
Sorry.
Phone!
And now, godparents, are you ready to help the parents of this child in their duties as Christian parents?
We are.
'Sorry, I didn't catch that.
'Please repeat the question.'
As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.
To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
Hard logic versus romantic whimsy - that is your choice.
You fail to connect actions to their consequences.
Now, for the last time, if you want to keep the rattle, do not throw the rattle.
All right, good girl, good girl.
Good girl.
I'd better finish this, hadn't I?
- Hey.
- Afternoon.
He says you've got a good one, Greg?
Oh, yeah.
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.
God, 50!
Where does it go?
I know for a fact I was only 21 this time last week.
Yeah, well that's impossible.
That was before you met me.
- Well, no, no, there never was...
- "There never was such a time."
She's looking at me disapprovingly again.
No.
She's just jealous.
Yeah, well, I think we both are.
- Oh...
- No, no, David.
- Come on, you promised.
- No, it's...
Oh, no...
Oh, it's a Skype call.
Oh!
Then it must be Charlie.
At least he's phoning, I suppose.
Oh, look!
Hello!
'Hey, Dad.
Happy birthday.
Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?
'
No!
Picture's frozen!
'Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you.'
Why is it rubbish?
Where are you?
How is he?
Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.
David?
Come on!
OK, no, hang on a sec, I'll find somewhere quieter.
So, Charlie, where are you?
Are you there?
- 'Sorry, I'm here.
I'm just a bit...'
- Are you all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
Altitude?
'I'm in Tibet.
Didn't you see the mountains?
'
Never mind mountains.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.
- 'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?
'
- What?
'Could you just check something on my car?
'
Your car?
'To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe
I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet.
- 'Could you take a photo and send it?
'
- Uh, yes, I can do that.
All done.
Have you got it?
Charlie?
A week later...
Yeah?
...something really weird happens.
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed, the cops are chasing him, and he turns into the drive of the Welsborough house to try and get away.
Unfortunately...
The drunk guy survived, they managed to pull him out, but when they put the fire out and examined the parked car...
Whose body?
Charlie Welsborough, the son.
- What?
- The son who was in Tibet.
DNA all checks out.
Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.
- Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
- Have you got a lab report?
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.
- The seats?
- Yes, the car seats.
Made of vinyl.
Two different types of vinyl present.
Was it his own car?
Yeah, not flash - he was a student.
- Well, that's suggestive.
- Why?
- Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
- Yeah, right?
- There's something else.
- Yes?
According to this,
Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.
What?
The body in the car, dead for a week.
Oh, this is a good one.
Is it my birthday?
You want help?
- Yes, please.
OK.
- One condition.
Take all the credit.
It gets boring if I just solve them all.
Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.
He's got a point.
Which makes me look like some kind of prima donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do!
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.
- Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
- Definitely a sore spot.
So you take all the glory, thanks...
- OK!
- ...thanks all the same.
Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?
It's driving me nuts.
Anything you say, Giles.
Just kidding.
What's his name?
Greg.
What?
Greg.
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?
Not a clue.
It's just you normally say that at this point.
Hmm.
Well, then, let's hope you solve your little problem, Greg.
- Hear that?
- I know.
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood?
- Oh, good, great.
Yeah, amazing.
- Getting any sleep?
- Christ, no.
You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.
- Must feel very different...
- Sorry, what?
Yes, well, you know how it is.
All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.
- Are you two having a little joke?
- Never a word of thanks.
Can't even tell people's faces apart.
This is a joke, isn't it?
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever.
You're so, so clever."
- Is it about me?
- I think he needs winding.
You know, I think that really might be it.
No, don't get it.
Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect, so go easy on them, yeah?
- You know me.
- 'Hey, hello.'
Yeah.
Got them, don't worry.
Pampers, the cream you can't get from Boots.
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now?
- At the dead boy's house?
- Yeah.
'And what does he think?
Any theories?
'
Well, I texted you the details.
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.
- Hey!
- How do you know about that?
'Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.'
- They know everything!
- 'Solved it, then?
'
I'm working on it.
'Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.'
- Pig!
- Keep trying.
'So, what about it, then?
'What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it?
'And what are you going to call this one?
'
Oh, the Ghost Driver.
- Don't give it a title.
- People like the titles.
- They hate the titles.
- Give the people what they want.
No, never do that - people are stupid.
Uh, some people.
'All people are stupid.
Most people.'
'Bizarre enough though, isn't it, to be him?
'
I mean, it's right up your strasse.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.
- Son.
- Son!
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.
If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.
Well, I believe that I can.
But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
Sherlock?
Mr Holmes?
Sorry, you were saying?
Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I...
I don't think we'll ever get over this.
No.
Shouldn't think so.
So sorry, will you excuse me a moment?
I just...
I'll...
I'll just, um...
Ahem.
- Now what's wrong?
- Not sure, I just...
By the pricking of my thumbs.
Seriously?
You?
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.
They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.
What is this?
Oh, it's a sort of shrine, I suppose, really.
Bit of a fan of Mrs T.
A big hero of mine when I was getting started.
Right, yes.
- Who?
- What?
- Who...?
Who was this?
- Are you serious?
- Sherlock...
- It's...
It's Margaret Thatcher, the first female Prime Minister of this country.
Right.
- Prime Minister?
Right.
- Leader of the Government.
- Female?
- For God's sake!
You know perfectly well who she is.
Why are you playing for time?
It's the gap, look at the gap.
It's wrong.
Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed.
The whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.
This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been in, this picture is straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.
- Something's missing from here, but only recently.
- Yes, a...
- Plaster bust... - plaster bust.
- Oh, for God's sake!
It got broken.
What the hell has this got to do with Charlie?
- Rug!
- What?
Well, how could it get broken?
The only place for it to fall is the floor and there is a big thick rug.
- Does it matter?
- Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.
- It is worth letting him do this.
- Is your friend quite mad?
No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
We found the remains out there in the porch.
- The porch where we came in?
- How anybody could hate her so much they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness...
I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.
Why didn't he smash all the others?
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.
Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.
- And if there's nothing...
- I know what happened to your son.
You do?
It's quite simple, superficial, to be blunt.
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness?
- Well, yes.
- And the porch where it was smashed,
I noticed the motion sensor was damaged,
- so I assume it's permanently lit.
- How did you notice that?
I lack the arrogance to ignore details.
I'm not the police.
- So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.
- Exactly.
- Why?
- Don't know.
Wouldn't be fun if I knew.
Mr Holmes, please!
It was your 50th birthday, Mr Welsborough, of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
- After all, he was in Tibet.
- Yes.
- No.
- No?
♪ Happy birthday... ♪
The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video.
Easily arranged.
It's a Skype call.
The trick was meant to be a surprise.
- A trick?
- Obviously.
Could you take a photo and send it?
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.
Well, good enough.
Effectively a costume.
You're joking?
No, I'm not.
All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
- Oh, my God!
- Surprise!
That's when it happened.
I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.
You said he'd felt unwell?
You all right?
'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.'
He died there and then.
No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained, in the driver's seat, hidden, until...
When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who'd been sitting there, quite dead, for a week.
Oh, God!
Poor kid.
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.
This is where it was smashed.
- That was amazing.
- What?
The car, the kid.
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?
I can't stand it, never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
What kind of a life would that be?
Besides, I have the strangest feeling...
Miss me?
- That's mine.
You two take a... bus.
- Why?
I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.
The Mall, please.
- I met her once.
- Thatcher?
Rather arrogant, I thought.
- You thought that?
!
- Ha, I know.
Why am I looking at this?
That's her, John and Mary's baby.
Oh, I see, yes.
Looks very... fully functioning.
Is that really the best you can do?
Sorry, I've never been very good with them.
- Babies?
- Humans.
Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?
Any interest in her?
Why on earth would he?
I don't know.
You tell me.
In the last year of his life,
James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over 70 assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias,
which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.
It's a pearl - get another one.
There's something important about this.
I'm sure.
Maybe it's Moriarty.
Maybe it's not.
But something's coming.
Are you having a premonition, brother mine?
The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other.
What we call premonition is just movement of the web.
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable.
As inevitable as mathematics.
Appointment In Samarra.
I'm sorry?
The merchant who can't outrun Death.
You always hated that story as a child.
Less keen on predestination back then.
I'm not sure I like it now.
You wrote your own version, as I remember.
Appointment In Sumatra.
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.
Goodnight, Mycroft.
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.
- Keep me informed.
- Of what?
Absolutely no idea.
'Ammo!
'
- Oh, hi, Stella.
- Greg.
You, uh...?
- Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...
- Right, right, right...
Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?
It's nothing.
I mean it's nothing serious.
- No, no.
- I just pop round every now and again for a chat.
Yeah, of course.
I mean he loves a really tricky case.
Yeah, he does!
So what you here for?
Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so...
The Borgia Pearl?
They still after that, are they?
Yeah.
So, how did you two first meet?
Oh, well, there was a case about, um, ten years ago.
Nobody could figure it out.
There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.
- Oh, yeah?
How did she die?
- Hypothermia.
What?
I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...
Will you two please keep it down?
!
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?
You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.
I was a carpenter.
Like me dad.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
How the hell...?
Ah... e-cigarettes.
Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.
If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.
But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last.
Anything to add, John?
- John?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.
- What is that?
- That is... me.
Well, it's a me substitute.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You know I value your little contributions.
Yeah?
It's been there since nine this morning.
- Has it?
Where were you?
- Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.
What about my girlfriend?
- What?
- You said I had an ex...
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.
The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.
I...
I thought you'd done something clever.
Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
What do you mean?
Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
- Well...
- You thought she was having an affair.
I'm afraid it's far worse than that, your wife is a spy.
- What?
- That's right.
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy, across the road from your flat.
Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy, as part of an official state visit.
As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.
This drug will render the President entirely susceptible to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty.
What?
Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III.
- Are you serious?
- No, of course not.
His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.
I don't!
- Just the bras.
- Get out.
So, what's this all about, then?
- Having fun.
- Fun?
- While I can.
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, Sherlock...
- Borgia Pearl.
Boring.
Go!
- But...
- Go!
- This had better be good.
- Oh, I think you'll like it.
That is the bust, isn't it?
The one that was broken.
No, it's another one, different owner.
Different part of town.
You were right, this is a thing.
Something's going on.
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be pleased.
- I am pleased.
- You don't look pleased.
This is my game face.
And the game is on.
Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one.
- One belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan.
- Identical busts?
Yeah, and this one to a Dr Barnicot in Holborn.
Three in total.
God knows who'd want to do something like this.
Yeah, but some people have that complex, don't they?
An idee fixe.
They obsess over one thing and they can't let it go.
No, no good.
There were other images of Margaret...
Margaret...?
You know who she is.
...Thatcher, present at the first break-in.
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?
Ooh!
- What?
- Blood.
Quite a bit of it, too.
Was there any injury at the crime scene?
Nah.
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.
- Come on.
- Holborn?
Lambeth!
- Lambeth?
Why?
- To see Toby.
Ah, right.
Who?
- You'll see.
- Right, are you coming?
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.
- Who told you?
- The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.
- Have a good time.
- I will.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
- What?
- She's not the one.
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.
How do you work all that out?
She's got three children in Rio that he doesn't know about.
Are you just making this up?
- Possibly.
- Who's Toby?
There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker, one of the world's best.
Got himself into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago.
He hacked into the Pentagon security system, and I managed to get him off the charge.
Therefore he owes me a favour.
So, how does that help us?
- What?
- Toby the hacker?
- Toby's not the hacker.
- What?
- All right, Craig?
- All right, Sherlock?
Craig's got a dog.
So I see.
Good boy!
Hiya!
Mary?
What are you...?
No, we, we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case.
No, exactly.
So... don't wait up.
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Hey.
Mary, what are you doing here?
She's better at this than you.
- Better?
- So I texted her.
Hang on, Mary's better than me?
Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.
Of course she's better.
Yeah, OK.
Nothing personal.
What, so I'm supposed to just go home now, am I?
What do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?
- John or the dog?
- Ha-ha, that's funny!
- John.
- Well...
He's handy and loyal.
- That's hilarious.
- Is it too early for a divorce?
Oh.
Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge?
Keep up, he's fast.
- He's not moving.
- He's thinking.
He's really not moving.
Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.
You just like this dog, don't you?
- Well, I like you.
- He's still not moving.
- Fascinating.
- Oh!
Well, what do you make of it?
- They were looking for something.
- Yes, but it wasn't a burglar, they came specifically for that Thatcher bust.
Why?
Clever.
Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail,
- where would you go?
- Like hiding a tree in a forest.
Or blood in a butcher's.
Never mind, Toby, better luck next time, hmm?
This is it, though.
This is the one, I can feel it.
Not Moriarty?
It has to be him.
It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.
It's designed to beguile me, tease me and lure me in.
At last, a noose for me to put my neck into.
You should have seen the state of the front room.
- It was like The Exorcist.
- Huh.
Was Rosie's head spinning round?
- No.
Just the projectile vomiting.
- Nice!
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
- Hmm?
Noticed what?
- The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
Yeah, can't she?
I'm coming, darling.
Mummy's coming.
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Come here.
Have you heard of that thing?
In Germany?
You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.
Ostalgie.
People who missed the old days under the communists.
- People are weird, aren't they?
- Hmm.
According to this, there's quite a market for Cold War memorabilia.
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit?
Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.
Yes, fascinating.
Irrelevant.
Where exactly did they come from?
I've got into the records of the suppliers, Gelder and Co.
Seems they're from Georgia.
Where exactly?
Tbilisi.
Batch of six.
One to Welsborough.
One to Hassan.
One to Dr Barnicot.
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.
One to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.
Lestrade?
Another one?
- 'Yeah.'
- Harker or Sandeford?
Harker.
And it's murder this time.
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.
_
_
Defensive wounds on her face and hands, throat cut.
Sharp blade.
The same thing inside the house?
The bust?
- Two of them this time.
- Interesting.
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago.
- Limited edition of six.
- And now someone's wandering about destroying them all.
Makes no sense.
What's the point?
No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.
- Yes, it is.
- Well, it is, but it's not the point.
I've been slow, far too slow.
Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind...
Slow but lucky, very lucky.
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.
Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.
Congratulations, by the way.
- I'm sorry?
- Well, you're about to solve a big one.
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
- Yeah, until then, basically.
That's enough now, love.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.
And you need to get to bed.
Come on.
Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?
You were on the run.
Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying, it's clever.
Very clever.
But now you've met me and you're not so clever, are you?
Who are you?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.
Argh!
You're out of time.
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
- Who?
I know it's him.
It must be him.
You think you understand.
You understand nothing.
Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don't we just enjoy the moment?
Let me present Interpol's number one case.
Too tough for them, too boring for me.
The Black Pearl of the Borgias!
It's not possible!
How could she...?
!
Everything about who I was is on there.
The problems of your past are your business.
The problems of your future are my privilege.
I don't understand.
She...
She destroyed it.
She?
You know her!
You do, don't you?
You know the bitch?
!
She betrayed me.
Betrayed us all.
Mary.
This is about Mary?
Is that what she's calling herself now, eh?
- 'Armed police, you're surrounded!
'
- Give it to me.
Give it to me!
'Come out slowly, I want to see your hands above your head.'
Nobody shoots me!
Anyone shoots, I kill this man.
'Lay down your weapon.
Do it now!
'
I'm leaving this place.
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.
'Lay down your weapon.'
You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
Tell her she's a dead woman.
She's a dead woman walking.
She's my friend.
And she's under my protection.
Who are you?
I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.
Who's Sherlock Holmes?
Not a policeman.
What do you think?
Mate in two?
Don't antagonise them, darling.
Oh, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.
Everything palls.
They'll send someone soon.
They?
Who are they?
Seems to me we put an awful lot of faith in they.
Well, I've got something they would dearly love, if only we could get out of here.
I've got Ammo.
Ammo?
- Madame Ambassador.
- What took you so long?
- Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now!
Veer left!
What now?
What do we do?
We die.
Well?
He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.
- I very much doubt it.
- Why?
Because I think he used to work with Mary.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out!
We'll come back later.
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the English woman?
What would you do to a traitor?
Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.
I am an idiot, I know nothing.
Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
That was quite a text you sent me.
What's going on, Sherlock?
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,
I couldn't see what was right under my nose.
Expected a pearl.
Oh, my God, that's a...
Yes, it's an AGRA.
Memory stick, like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.
Who?
I don't know.
We...
We all had one but the others were...
Haven't you even looked at it yet?
I glanced at it but I prefer
- to hear it from you.
- Why?
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.
There were four of us, agents.
Not just agents.
Polite term.
Alex.
Gabriel.
Me.
And Ajay.
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.
We all had one.
Each containing aliases, our background, everything.
We could never be betrayed, because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.
- Who employed you?
- Anyone who paid well.
I mean, we were at the top of our game for years.
And then it all ended.
There was a coup in Georgia.
The British Embassy in Tbilisi was taken over, lots of hostages.
We got the call to go in, get them out.
There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.
- Who from?
- I don't know, just another voice on the phone.
And a codeword.
- Ammo.
- Ammo?
Like ammunition.
We went in, but then something went wrong.
Something went really wrong.
That was six years ago.
It feels like forever.
I was the only one that made it out.
No.
What?
I met someone tonight.
Same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.
What, he's alive?
Yeah, very much so.
I don't believe it, this is amazing!
I thought I was the only one,
I thought I was the only one who got out.
Where is he?
I need to see him, now!
Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?
Yeah, of course.
It was our insurance.
Above all, they mustn't fall into enemy hands.
So Ajay survived as well.
And now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide, with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why?
I don't know.
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.
Families fall out.
The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
Well, he's just trying to find me.
He survived, that's all that matters!
I heard it from his own mouth.
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."
Why would he want to kill me?
- He said you betrayed him.
- Oh, no, no, that's insane.
Well, it's what he believes.
I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.
No, Mary...
You do.
I made a vow, remember?
To look after the three of you.
Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
There's something I think you should read.
What is it?
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.
What are you...?
- Mary...
Oh, no!
- There you go.
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.
No.
You just look after them till I get back.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Agra?
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
It is 378km west of the state capital, Lucknow.
What are you, Wikipedia?
- Yes.
- AGRA is an acronym.
Oh, good, I love an acronym.
All the best secret societies have them.
Team of agents, the best.
But you know all that.
Of course I do.
Go on.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.
Indeed?
Well, that's news to me.
Is it?
He's already killed looking for that memory stick.
AGRA always worked for the highest bidder,
I thought that might include you?
- Me?
- Well, I mean the British government, or whatever government you're currently propping up.
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.
They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong.
And that was that, we stopped using freelancers.
- Your initiative?
- My initiative.
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.
I don't like loose ends.
Not on my watch.
There was something else.
A detail.
A codeword.
Ammo?
It's all I've got.
Little enough.
Could you do some digging as a favour?
You don't have many favours left.
Then I'm calling them all in.
And if you can find who's after her and neutralise them, what then?
You think you can go on saving her forever?
Of course.
Is that sentiment talking?
No, it's me.
Difficult to tell the difference these days.
Told you, I made a promise.
A vow.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.
Not on my watch.
'My darling, I need to tell you this because you mustn't hate me for going away.'
Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.
- Can you hear a squeaking?
- No.
Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel.
Why Planes Fail.
- Did you see it?
Oh, truly terrifying.
- Can't say I did.
Swore I would never fly again, yet hear I am!
Everything OK, madam?
No.
No, no, it's not, but then what's the use in complaining?
I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off is all.
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.
Oh, OK.
Relax.
She said relax.
Did you have a nice time in London?
It was OK, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun?
Did you lose it in the war?
'I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.
I'm not running, I promise you that,
I just need to do this in my own way.'
Oh, God!
I'm...
I-I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God!
- Everything OK, madam?
- I think I'm dying.
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.
God will smile on you.
'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,
I'm sorry, my love.'
I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.
Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of a dice.
I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
I swear I will.'
Not like this one.
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in!
I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.
Mr Baker.
Well, that completes the set.
- No, it does not.
- Well, who else am I missing?
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?
Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.
Oh, hi, Mary.
What concept?
Happy families.
Nice trip?
- How the f...?
- Please, Mary, there is a child present.
- How did you get in here?
- Karim let me in.
Hello.
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Nice to meet you, missus.
No, I mean how did you find me?
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
No, really, though, how?
Every movement I made was entirely random, every new personality just on the roll of a dice!
Mary, no human action is ever truly random.
An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability, mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual, can reduce the number of variables considerably.
I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine a seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.
But they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.
Oh, you bastard!
- You bastard!
- I know, but your face!
"The mathematics of probability"?
- You believed that.
- "Feasible variables"?
Yes, I started to run out about then.
In the memory stick!
Yeah, that was my idea.
- AGRA?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
You said it was your initials.
In a way that was true.
In a way?
So many lies.
I'm so sorry.
And I don't just mean you.
What?
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...
You're R?
Rosamund?
Rosamund Mary.
I always liked Mary.
Yeah, me too.
I used to.
I just...
I didn't know what else to do.
You could have stayed, you could have talked to me.
That's what couples are supposed to do.
Work things through.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Mary, I may not be a very good man but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for,
- most of the time.
- All the time.
You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.
You never judge, you never complain.
I don't deserve you, I...
All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
I will keep you safe.
But it has to be in London.
It's my city, I know the turf.
Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.
Get down!
Hello again.
- Ajay?
- Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.
Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.
I thought I was the only one who got out.
How did you find us?
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.
You found her but I found you.
So perhaps not so clever.
And now here we are.
At last.
Touche!
Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
She thought I was dead.
I might as well have been.
It was always just the four of us, always, remember?
Oh, yeah.
So why do you want to kill me?
Do you know how long they kept me prisoner?
What they did to me?
They tortured Alex to death.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.
But you?
You, where were you?
That day at the embassy, I escaped.
Ha!
But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
Where were you?
Oh, I got out.
For a while.
Long enough to hide my memory stick.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.
I was loyal, you see.
Loyal to my friends.
But they took me, tortured me.
Not for information.
Not for anything except fun.
They thought I'd give in, die, but I didn't, I lived.
And eventually, they forgot about me rotting in a cell somewhere.
Six years they kept me there.
Until one day I saw my chance.
Oh, and I made them pay.
You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.
Little whispers.
Laughter.
Gossip.
How the clever agents had been betrayed.
Brought down by you!
Me?
You know I'll kill you too.
You know I will, Ajay.
What, you think I care if I die?
I've dreamed of killing you every night for six years.
Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.
I swear to you, Ajay.
What did you hear, Ajay?
When you were a prisoner, what exactly did you hear?
What did I hear?
Ammo.
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo."
We were betrayed!
- And they said it was her?
- That you betrayed us!
They said her name?
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.
No!
No!
'The English woman, that's all he heard.
Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.'
Couldn't this wait until you're back?
No, it's not over.
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed, the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.
There was only a voice on the phone.
'Remember?
And a codeword.'
"Ammo," yes, you said.
How's your Latin, brother dear?
My Latin?
Amo, amas, amat.
I love, you love, he loves.
What...?
Not "Ammo" as in ammunition, but "Amo", meaning?
You'd better be right, Sherlock.
Bloody thing!
What's going on?
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.
What?
'So many lies.
And I don't just mean you.'
- Hello.
- Ah, hello.
- I like your daisy.
- Thank you, yeah.
It's not really me, though, I think.
- No?
- No, no, it's too floral for me.
I'm more of a "knackered with weary old eyes" kind of guy.
Well, I think they're nice.
Nice eyes.
- Thank you.
- Look...
Look...
I don't normally do this,
- but, um...
- But you're going to.
Yeah.
- What's this?
- This is me.
- Thank you.
Cheers.
- Yeah.
Great.
- Bye!
- Bye.
_
_
_
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
Hmm?
Noticed what?
The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So?
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
- Yeah, can't she?
- Hmm.
I'm coming darling.
I'm coming.
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
- _
- Come here...
It's OK.
_
- _
- Do you want a cuddle?
_
I know.
- Oh, sweetheart.
- _
_
Ssh.
Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you?
_
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?
Oh, let's go and see Daddy!
Daddy's here.
It's OK, Rosie.
I'll take her.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I may as well get up now.
Hey, baby, it's Daddy.
Your daddy.
Come here, Rose.
Come here, darling, it's all right.
Thank you.
_
_
This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.
How many more times?
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.
And you're basing all this on a code name?
On a whispered voice on the telephone?
Come on, Mycroft.
You were the conduit for AGRA.
Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
It was my job.
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
AGRA went in.
- Yes.
- And they were betrayed.
Not by me.
Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.
I promise you,
I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.
You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.
Not one.
Not.
One.
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories?
I'd like to do those.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.
Although she does seem to enjoy them.
Well, I'll have to give that a go.
Got a lot to catch up on.
'You think you understand.
You understand nothing.'
'Code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love.'
'You'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.
'They know everything.'
'They said it was the English woman.'
'Don't minute any of this.'
'They know everything.'
- You don't make it easy, do you?
- What do you mean?
Well, being... being so perfect.
Mary, I...
I need to tell you...
Hang on.
Can you tell me later?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Great.
Well, no, we can't just go.
- Rosie.
- Yeah.
- Er, you go.
- No!
I'll come as soon as I've found someone.
Mrs Hudson.
- Corfu till Saturday.
Molly?
- Er, yeah, I'll try.
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.
You know that's not going to happen.
If there's more to this case, you need to see it.
Yeah, OK, you win.
'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes.
'Please make your way to the exit.
Thank you.'
Your office said I'd find you here.
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.
We're like them.
Ghostly, living in the shadows.
Predatory?
Well, it depends which side you're on.
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.
Nice location for the final act, couldn't have chosen it better myself.
But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.
I just come here to look at the fish.
I knew this would happen one day.
- It's like that old story.
- I really am a very busy man.
Would you mind cutting to the chase?
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
With good reason.
"There was once a merchant, in a famous market in Baghdad."
I really have never liked this story.
I'm just like the merchant in the story,
I thought I could out-run the inevitable.
I've always been looking over my shoulder, always expecting to see the grim figure of...
Death.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hey.
- John?
- On his way.
Let me introduce Ammo.
You were Ammo?
You were the person on the phone that time?
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
Why did you betray us?
Why does anyone do anything?
- Hmm.
- Let me guess, selling secrets?
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.
Worked very well for a few years.
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it.
But...
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.
I couldn't believe my luck!
That bought me a little time.
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
Very handy.
They were always such reliable killers.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.
Lady Smallwood gave the order.
But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.
Seemed to do the trick.
And you thought your troubles were over.
I was tired.
Tired of the mess of it all.
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.
The hostages were killed.
AGRA too.
Or so I thought.
My secret was safe.
But... apparently not.
Just a little peace.
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
A family?
Home?
Really, I understand.
So, just let me get out of here, right?
Let me just walk away.
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.
What do you say?
After what you did?
!
Mary, no!
OK.
London Aquarium.
Yes, now.
I was never a field agent.
I always thought I'd be rather good.
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
Thanks.
- For a secretary.
- What?
It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
- I didn't do this out of jealousy.
- No?
Same old drudge, day in, day out.
Never getting out there where all the excitement was.
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.
Yes, your little flat.
- How do you know?
- Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?
And what are you, widowed or divorced?
Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.
That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.
- Sherlock...
- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.
A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.
- Sherlock, don't.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.
There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
That accounts for the drink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.
So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.
To prove how good you are.
To make up for the inadequacies of your...
little life.
Well, Mrs Norbury,
I must admit this is unexpected.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.
All except Sherlock Holmes.
There's no way out.
So it would seem.
You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.
It's what I do.
Maybe I can still surprise you.
Now, come on, be sensible.
Hmm, no, I don't think so.
Ah!
Surprise!
Everything's fine.
It's going to be OK.
Get an ambulance!
It's all right, it's all right.
- Mary!
- John.
All right, Mary?
Mary?
Stay with me, stay with me.
- Oh, come on...
- No, don't worry.
Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
Come on, Mary.
Mary?
Oh, God.
John, I think this is it.
No, no, no, no.
It's not.
- That's...
- You made me so happy.
You gave me everything I could ever, ever have wanted...
Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.
- Look after Rosie.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.
- Promise me.
- I promise.
- No...
- Yes, I promise.
- Promise me!
- I promise, I promise.
Ssh, ssh.
Hey, Sherlock.
Yes.
I... so like you.
Did I ever say?
Yes, yes, you did.
I'm sorry for... for shooting you that time.
I'm really sorry.
It's all right.
I think we're even now, OK?
OK.
- Oh, I think we're...
- Mary, Mary...
- ...even, definitely even.
- Ssh, ssh.
You were my whole world.
Being Mary Watson was the only life worth living.
- Mary...
- Thank you.
Mary...
Don't you dare!
You made a vow.
You swore it.
'You've been having dreams.
A recurring dream?
'
Do you want to talk about it?
This is a two-way relationship, you know.
The whole world has come crashing down around you.
Everything's hopeless.
Irretrievable.
I know that's what you must feel but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
That's not really my style.
I need to know what to do.
Do?
About John.
Put me through to Sherrinford, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
But nothing will ever be the same again, will it?
I'm afraid it won't.
We'll have to rally round, I expect, do our bit.
Look after little Rosie.
I'm just going to, um look through these things.
There might be a case.
A case?
Oh, you're not up to it, are you?
Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.
Yes.
Yes, I expect you're right.
I'll make some tea, shall I?
- Mrs Hudson?
- Yes, Sherlock?
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident...
- Yes?
- ...would you just say the word Norbury to me?
Would you?
Norbury?
Just that.
I'd be very grateful.
What's this?
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.
Oh, God!
Is that...?
- Must be.
- Oh.
I knew it wouldn't end like this.
I knew Moriarty made plans.
'I thought that would get your attention.
So, this is in case...
In case the day comes.
If you are watching this, I'm probably dead.
I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows?
Nothing's certain, nothing's written.
My old life it was full of consequences.
The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.
You need to remember that.
So I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
Might be the hardest case of your career.
When I'm... gone, if I'm gone I need you to do something for me.'
Hi.
I just wondered how things were going and if there was anything I could do.
It's, er, it's from John.
- Right.
- You don't need to read it now.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.
He says...
John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...
Yes?
He said he'd that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Anyone.
'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
When I'm gone, if I'm... gone I need you to do something for me.
Save John Watson.
Save him, Sherlock.
Save him.'
'When does the path we walk on lock around our feet?
When does the road become a river with only one destination?
'
'Death waits for us all in Samarra.
But can Samarra be avoided?
'
Go to hell, Sherlock!
- ALISON:
Ten, nine...
- JASON:
Hold on.
Are you crazy?
- Are you crazy?
- It's the Project Runway finale.
- You're crazy.
- So you can DVR it!
Just stop ruining my life.
Oh, my... you know what?
You know what?
!
You are so dead!
- I-I actually didn't do it.
- You know what, Alison?
- I didn't.
- Then who did?
!
What are you...?
- Ready for the Runway?
- Of course, of course it was the other one.
Uh, no, the real world, actually.
President Dalton gave his, uh, State of the Union, like, an hour ago.
I have to be up on what the cable-verse thinks for work tomorrow.
Oh, great.
So just because you're interning for Russell Jackson, you have to stay current on how screwed-up the world is?
Guys, Mom has spent the last six months negotiating a global climate deal, and the president announced it tonight.
It's like the moon shot of our generation.
More than 200 countries committed to the Stockholm Protocols' sweeping carbon emission benchmarks.
But the crown jewel for President Dalton was getting India and China on board.
The question now:
will the treaty pass the U.S. Senate?
Ah.
Hey, look who's civically engaged.
Hey.
Do you guys think that the Senate's gonna ratify?
You mean act rationally and sacrifice minor short-term domestic economic gains for the greater good?
Oh, yeah, they always do stuff like that.
I have faith.
In the scorched-earth fight our president is willing to wage to bulldoze those who would deny reality.
Scorched earth over scorched earth?
Appropriate.
- I need ice cream.
- (phone ringing)
You were really playing Titanfall, weren't you?
- I mean, you know...
- Weren't you?
Huh?
JASON:
If the State of the Union had just a few more explosions...
- Hello.
Who?
- ALISON:
I want to watch Project Runway.
Oh, God.
Uh, yeah, let him in.
Who is it?
The Grim Reaper?
Pretty much.
You sure you don't want a spoon?
Mm, no, thanks.
So, I hear you are meeting with the Dalai Lama tomorrow.
Been on my schedule for months.
I doubt you just heard.
But I did just hear from the Chinese president about it.
I'm sure that you explained to him that our policy towards Tibet has not changed, and we would never let the Chinese dictate with whom our secretary of state can or cannot meet.
President Li and I simply agreed this is a delicate time.
Often the first step toward appeasement.
The Chinese have had a bug up their ass about the Dalai Lama since the 1950s, when they first drove him from his spiritual seat in Tibet.
To them, he's a font of separatist rhetoric, hell-bent on breaking away from China, so it is indeed delicate.
Are you really mansplaining Tibetan history to me?
We need China on board for the president to deliver on his promise to fight climate change, which I know you know.
And you also know that in just five days, China's congress decides whether or not to ratify the treaty.
After that, you can go on Dancing With the Stars with the Lama for all I care.
Please, Elizabeth.
Please?
Really?
Does Conrad even know you're here?
The president says it's your call.
Look.
I get that the timing of this isn't great.
But as we know, this meeting has been on the books for some time.
And caving to Chinese pressure about it would set a terrible precedent.
That said,
I can pare back the coverage.
Try and keep the visit under the radar, I guess.
Thank you.
MO:
Good morning.
Any word from Ian?
Still radio silence.
Dead militia member and an asset gone quiet.
- Go, team.
- Yeah.
Good morning.
MO:
Good morning.
DOJ ruled that Ian's kill was justified.
Wayne O'Connell's wounds were consistent with Ian's account of the attack.
Okay.
And what about the disposition of the body?
Office of Legal Counsel wants it released to the family immediately.
HENRY:
And say what?
That he was killed during an FBI sting into his death cult?
We can't risk word that the investigation will get back
- to the VFF.
- That's right.
You want to pull Ian out.
I don't see how we have any other choice, unless you expect the Federal Bureau
- to disappear a body.
- Okay, look.
I have a meeting scheduled with Ian tomorrow.
Assuming he shows, I'll give him a camera.
As far as the militia's concerned,
Wayne O'Connell is just missing.
Let's give Ian more time to gather evidence, then we can pull him out, grab the drone and the bomb, and then release O'Connell's body.
The most I can get the DOJ to hold is four days.
That's how long you have to me something actionable.
(monks chanting)
NADINE:
Preparations for the sand mandala
- are going well.
- I don't get it.
These monks spent all week painstakingly arranging colored sand to fit this blueprint, and when, whoosh, they just sweep it away.
- Wh-What's the point?
- (chanting continues)
NADINE:
That is the point.
DAISY:
Everything's transitory.
Everything ends.
That's very sad.
Even that feeling, that'll pass, too.
Okay, now you're just piling on.
(elevator bell dings)
Just keep at it.
- Good morning, ma'am.
- BLAKE:
Morning, ma'am.
Great morning. (gasps)
Is the sand mandala
- ready to rock?
- NADINE:
Yes, ma'am.
Uh, I still don't get the point.
That is the point.
No.
Due respect, ma'am, not getting the point can't possibly be the point.
You can say that about anything.
Exactly.
Give over, Blake.
Okay, you know,
Buddhism clearly isn't for neurotics.
Or maybe just the opposite.
Look who that is!
Come here!
- Who is this?
Who is this?
- (giggling)
Oh, my goodness.
This is my girl.
I tell ya, staffers just keep getting younger and younger,
- don't they?
- Sorry, ma'am.
- The sitter canceled on us last minute.
- Oh, are you kidding?
She keeps me on my toes, just like her daddy.
- Right, little varmint?
- (elevator bell dings)
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.
- Secretary Elizabeth McCord.
- (speaks Tibetan)
Ah, so good to see you.
- It's so good to see you.
- You are the kindest of world leaders.
Tall bird lady with lion's heart.
(laughs):
Thank you, Your Holiness.
You remember my assistants, Lama Samten, Lama Dote and Geshe Tashi.
You can tell them apart by their auras.
Oh.
- Buddhist humor.
- Oh!
(laughter)
That's...
He's...
That's...
- He's funny.
- MAN:
Yeah.
Oh, now, who are you, little sister?
This is Chloe.
- Hello.
- Chloe.
JAY:
Your Holiness, this...
- Whoa!
- (claps)
She is the wisest of us all.
(Chloe babbles)
Yes.
Now, where is the sand mandala?
Members of the National Buddhist Center here in D.C. anticipated your arrival.
Ah.
May you be at peace.
May you be well.
May you find loving kindness.
Let this cosmic Buddha palace heal and energize the world.
May I have some tea?
Of course.
We have a masala chai that the tea snobs around here just rave about.
(elevator bell dings)
- Hi.
- Sorry about this.
No, it's fine.
My mom's coming for her.
- Hi, baby. (groans)
- You got her?
I really am trying my best here.
Um, listen, I was gonna give this to you a little later, but, uh, it seems appropriate.
It's an informal custody settlement agreement.
Are you serious?
You... you want sole physical custody of our child?
I want a routine for Chloe.
Yeah, but what's-what's this?
Can't we just talk about it?
Every time we set a schedule, something comes up, and she and I end up ping-ponging between offices and departments, and we cannot keep doing that.
And my lawyer friend says it's a, uh, it's a standard arrangement.
One day a week, every other weekend, and-and then we can discuss holidays.
(stammers) What happened to working on the marriage?
My lawyer friend.
And we still need a custody agreement
- while we're working on the marriage.
- No.
I do not accept this.
You don't get to dictate the terms here.
Shh.
Okay.
- Okay.
- (elevator bell dings)
We should just talk about this later.
I'm sorry.
I thought you would understand.
Say good-bye to Daddy.
Good girl.
I'll see you soon, okay, honey?
See you later.
Come on.
CHODEN:
I must request your help with a rather serious matter.
Your Holiness, you know I...
I can't discuss statecraft with you.
I'm terminal.
Pancreatic cancer.
I'm so sorry.
Everyone must die.
I have aligned my life to my purpose:
to fight for the autonomy of the Tibetan people.
And as for them,
I ask that you endorse my choice for my successor over China's.
Well, as always... the United States encourages you to achieve your goal through direct dialogue with China.
When I die, the Tibetans will lose their loudest voice in this world.
China will be emboldened to trample even more of our rights.
U.S. policy is clear.
We are officially neutral on this issue.
I die knowing that I've done everything I can for my people.
I have no regrets, Elizabeth.
Do you?
Of course I have regrets.
How could I not?
It was a rhetorical question, babe.
And now he's dying.
And I feel terrible about that.
And I feel guilty about Tibet.
Like, now it's all on me, but I... we're too... enmeshed with China, especially with this climate deal, to offend them over a battle they've-they've mostly won, right?
I mean...
Thoughts from the world- renowned religious scholar?
(sighs) I guess I'm preoccupied with my own regrets.
Uh, not just that the office shut down.
The bomb's still out there, to say nothing of the drone.
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
I... (sighs) It's okay.
Just... stop hogging all the self-flagellation.
(phone ringing)
(groans)
Hello.
Sorry to bother you, ma'am, but are you watching the news?
I'll turn it on.
NEWSWOMAN: ...announcement.
Breaking with hundreds of years of tradition, the Dalai Lama named his successor while still alive.
Gaden Bhuti, a two-year-old Tibetan-American boy from Delaware, son to immigrants Yonten and Sonam Bhuti...
Didn't see that coming.
Please tell me this boy isn't an American citizen, Jay.
Wish I could, but if we let him keep his citizenship or leave the country to take his new position, the Chinese will accuse us of backing the Tibetan cause.
Well, you got to hand it to the Lama.
He figured out a way to force our hand.
- China will make a meal of this.
- (phone ringing)
Yeah, and the appetizer will be our climate deal.
Hang on, Jay.
I have peace and light on the other line.
I got to call you back.
(sighs) Namaste, Russell.
JACKSON:
You watching this?
!
Y...
Yes.
Where did he get this bright idea?
What the hell did you say to the Lama?
!
♪
Mr. Chen, the United States will not officially endorse any new Lama; you have my word.
CHEN:
How generous, Madam Secretary, but the People's Republic needs you to publicly disavow this choice.
You know we can't do that.
Not endorsing maintains our neutrality.
If the Dalai Lama is an American, then by definition, that's not neutral.
It's the United States harboring an anti-China instigator.
Ming, the boy is two.
I think your way of life will survive.
Symbols are often more potent than armies, Elizabeth.
Change your position, or I will make sure the National People's Congress Standing Committee never considers the Stockholm Protocols for approval.
Are you really going to hold the world hostage over a symbol, who's probably not even potty-trained?
I believe my position is clear.
To hell with the cooling-off period.
I want to look at officially naming China a currency manipulator.
Even hinting at that will be considered aggressive.
Look, whether we like it or not,
Tibet is a symbol of nationalism in China.
And the Dalai Lama personifies the last vestiges of Tibetan independence.
So let China look tough for a few days, and I bet that they will quietly ratify the protocols.
(door opens)
JACKSON:
Well, forget the Chinese.
Now we're taking fire from our own flank.
Chandler Morton, the distinguished junior senator from Pennsylvania, just did a lap of the morning shows to express his ardent support for the Dalai Lama and his American successor.
Senator Dumbass even invited the Lama to address the Senate Foreign Relations Committee next week.
- Why jeopardize the climate deal?
- (sighs)
Morton's on record as a supporter.
The Dalai Lama's announcement last night broke the Internet.
The public moved on from sad polar bears to cute baby saviors.
The senator's just chasing that narrative to boost his profile.
Well, regardless of his motive, we still need to show China we take this seriously.
Chen won't accept a condemnation.
Morton will have to back down.
Hit 'em where it hurts, sir.
Threaten to withdraw support from your donor list.
And we provoke him, it could blow up in our face.
Look, let me find a carrot to entice the good senator.
You want to reward this punk?
If we can quietly get him off his high horse, then I will have something to point to when I talk the Chinese off theirs.
Do it, Bess.
(door opens)
Rewarding bad behavior it is.
(door closes)
(monks chanting)
ELIZABETH:
Nadine, do you still play in that monthly Hill leadership poker game?
I consider it my pension fund.
You ever clean out anyone from the Pennsylvania delegation?
Well, it's a friendly game.
Are you looking for leverage on Senator Morton?
I just wanted to... offer him some alternative paths to the attention he seeks.
I'll find something.
Thank you.
Hey.
Hey.
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.
I got to be quick.
Ever since Wayne disappeared, they've got us on even tighter lockdown.
Does the Council of Elders suspect foul play?
Yeah, of course.
They got conspiracy theories on why certain squirrels show up when they do.
Since Wayne's disappearance is an actual mystery, they're going nuts;
I swear they're watching me.
Can you hang on for another 72 hours?
HQ shutting it down?
Got to release Wayne's body.
So we need you to focus on collecting significant Intel now.
We'll raid camp after we extract you.
I don't have any significant Intel.
I haven't seen the bomb.
After Wayne, they moved the drone.
(dogs barking in distance)
You're gonna have to wear another camera.
At the very least, it'll help us plan the raid.
Uh, did you not hear me?
They already think I'm shady.
If they see that thing, they're gonna kill me.
- They sweep the camp every day...
- Okay, listen, I know what the risk is, but remember, we're trying to keep VFF from committing mass murder.
All the work you've done,
Wayne's death, it means nothing unless we get enough information before we go in.
Look, if you're not up for it...
I can bring you in right now.
I'm fine.
I should go.
Okay.
See you in 72 hours.
(monks chanting)
(elevator bell dings)
JAY:
Ben.
Hey.
- Thanks for this.
- Hey, I'm always happy to dispense legal advice when it's paired with a free steak.
Could we actually do something quicker?
Work is...
Oh, yeah, I read about the Lama thing.
Uh, whatever you want, man.
(chanting continues)
So, what can I do?
BEN:
You mean if reasoning with her fails?
You have to play the game you're in.
Hardball.
Use anything you can to make her look less optimal.
Didn't you say she went through some postpartum stuff?
Do not go there, man.
I didn't say it was pretty.
NADINE:
Ma'am, I did the recon.
Senator Morton's chief professional passion is lobbying the FCC to approve a telecom merger.
But he does have pretty powerful motivation for supporting an American Lama.
I'll let my source tell you.
You play poker with the vice president, Nadine?
I cashed in my chips when I took this gig.
- How are you?
- Hi, Teresa.
How are you?
So good to see you.
Come, please, sit down.
Uh, yes, well, it was just as well, because Nadine is a shark. (laughs)
Teresa was gracious enough to take my call anyway.
What better source on Morton than his predecessor?
I wish I had better news.
Morton's untimely pursuit of Tibetan freedom has particularly craven motives.
His biggest donor is Gration Tech, manufacturer of heavy machinery.
NADINE:
They make almost half their revenue from hydraulic valve parts crucial to coal mining.
An industry that would take an enormous hit if the Stockholm Protocols were ratified.
Ma'am, I just got word from our India desk...
Oh, Madam Vice President, hi.
Sorry to interrupt.
No worries.
It's good to see you, Jay.
India wants to reopen the Stockholm Protocols.
They're demanding a reduction on all coal restrictions.
They're clearly reacting to China wavering.
That and growing protests in Delhi and Mumbai over the prospect of rising electricity costs.
Well, with India bailing, China is even less likely to ratify the climate deal.
And we have our own senator to thank for blowing it up.
(whispers):
Wow.
So Morton is trying to spike the deal to help one of his donors, but he's hiding behind the feel-good issue of Tibetan independence.
That's my assessment, sir, yes.
You staked your second term on taking meaningful action on climate change.
If this deal falls apart, the enemy smells weakness, works that much harder to deny any of your other priorities.
Why did I want this job again?
Your house does have a bowling alley in the basement.
TERESA: (chuckles) So no one will care that Morton puts his donors' priorities ahead of the nation's, I mean, of-of the world?
Yeah.
No one will care.
(sighs) We need to stop the bleeding.
Get India back on board, Morton back in line, before every other hack in the Senate puts his hand out and our own side falls apart.
ELIZABETH:
Well, I can handle the India inducements.
As for Morton...
I rescind my earlier concerns about provoking him.
I think we all know what needs to happen.
We've been watching Ian's feed for hours, with no new sign of evidence.
On the other hand, they haven't killed him.
Yet.
Our dead friend Wayne O'Connell's been out of pocket for days now.
Ian's the new guy;
they got to be looking at him.
Yeah, but if we pull him now, there's no way we'll find the bomb.
Unless... we release O'Connell's body to his family without telling the details of his death.
(chuckles):
Whoa.
That's a surprising notion coming from an ethics professor.
Could take the heat off Ian.
Buy him some time to find the bomb.
Can you live with that?
(monks chanting)
(knocks)
I'm so sorry I forgot to give you this.
Was Chloe up all night?
Thank you.
Hey, I said I'm sorry.
How could you go to the guy who officiated our wedding for legal advice?
What about your lawyer friend?
Someone from yoga who downloaded a form for me.
I didn't seek her advice, and she didn't marry us.
Well, I'm allowed to know my rights.
You really want to fight me in court for the right to leave her with a babysitter in your apartment half the time?
Who does that serve, Jay?
And you can't seriously think that you would be a better custodial parent to Chloe.
I practically was her only parent for six months when you couldn't get out of bed.
Remember that?
Because I sure as hell do!
ELIZABETH:
Prime Minister Verma, let me start by saying that I am open to taking a second look at some of the protocols.
Since India will sacrifice the most, we believe it's only fair.
Just none that increase coal emissions.
Ah.
The rich Western nation built on coal tells the emerging market, "It's okay when we polluted.
You find a new way."
A classic.
Look, I get it.
You promised to bring electricity to the 300 million Indians who live without it, and you think loosening coal restrictions will help you deliver.
And it will.
We have lots of people in India and lots of coal.
It's not a complicated equation.
But the majority of those without electricity live in remote rural areas, far from any kind of grid.
Indeed.
I'm well aware of that.
So let's find that new way together.
Return to the deal as is, and the U.S. will subsidize a mass scale lo-fi alternative:
bottom-up, solar mini grid efforts to rural areas.
Get the Chinese to resuscitate the protocols, along with this new amendment, we could be amenable.
(knocks on desk)
TERESA:
I told POTUS what this telecom merger would mean for Pennsylvania.
A thumbs-up could push it over the top, really put you on the map.
Good luck, Senator.
You're not coming?
Oh, no, no, no.
The president wanted to keep this meeting top tier...
just one and two.
Number five.
Didn't make the cut.
Let's not keep the leader of the free world waiting.
DALTON:
Senator Morton, are you familiar with the migratory pattern of the osprey?
Um, no, sir.
They winter in South America, then travel up to 5,000 miles to their North American breeding grounds.
They settle here to eat fish from the Potomac.
I saw a few my first year, but... not many since.
My grandchildren, well they may never see an osprey at all.
That's what scientists call shifting baseline syndrome.
Each generation accepts their version of nature, plunders it, then leaves the next generation to accept the depleted version, and so on.
Which brings me to us.
Now.
You.
Mr. President, I'm here about the telecom deal.
We'll get to that in a minute.
I know you're killing my climate deal to appease your donor.
Who is it again, uh,
Gration Technologies?
All due respect, sir, your sources don't know what they're talking about.
I'm his source, Chandler.
Your telecom merger is up for review in two weeks.
It, uh, rides the line on antitrust issues, on what's proper and not.
Shifting baseline syndrome.
It's everywhere these days.
Point is,
I can choose to become troubled by those issues.
Or not.
So do the right thing.
Don't screw up the climate deal that a majority of Americans support, including your constituents.
Or I will kick your ass.
Welcome to Washington, Senator.
(monks chanting)
CHEN:
I received your inducements, Madam Secretary.
All very generous.
But we cannot accept as long as your government endorses the American Lama.
And that's why I'm glad to report that Senator Morton had a change of heart.
We reaffirm our neutrality.
A government with conflicting opinions.
I will never understand democracy.
Well, you say "tomato,"
I say "let's ratify our climate deal."
Okay?
We'll resubmit the protocols with a new addendum for Indian solar funding.
Everybody's happy.
Planet saved.
Thank you.
There's just one more matter to settle.
Really?
Chinese Buddhist scholars have found the Dalai Lama's true reincarnation.
A two-year-old boy in Sichuan Province.
If you officially recognize him, we will gladly have the Standing Committee consider the protocols for ratification.
Ming, we-we support the PRC's right to recognize this boy as the next Lama.
Just as we support Tibet's right to recognize their own boy.
I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Disqualify the American Lama or recognize ours.
Otherwise, no deal.
Do you know the mountains that President Dalton and I had to move to put this deal back together?
All to do what's best for our children and grandchildren... oh, and the other seven billion people on the planet, too.
But...
And you are putting it all on the line, trying to strong-arm us into endorsing some toddler that you are using as a political pawn!
Do...
You know who the real toddler is, Ming?
You.
You're the real toddler.
You are.
(sighs)
Well, that happened.
Yes, it most certainly did.
Are you going to see the Bhuti family today?
In a few minutes, actually.
Uh, would you like us to try to talk them out of letting their child do the Lama tests?
No.
We are not putting our thumb on the scale.
Let's just hope the universe... gives us a break.
SONAM:
The Chinese officials said you will take away our citizenship if we let Gaden study as a monk.
NADINE:
Oh, no, the State Department would never do that.
They were just trying to intimidate you.
We heard the Chinese stopped the climate deal over of our son.
How do we know you won't try to pressure us in order
- to make your deal?
- NADINE:
Well, of course,
American government has policy concerns.
But it is not our place to try to influence you.
It is a difficult decision.
If your child was chosen to enlighten all people...
SONAM:
And to save your home...
YONTEN:
Shouldn't you let him?
So you're actually considering giving up your child to be raised by monks?
Which is your choice.
But, effectively, you'd be choosing to abandon him.
You know that, right?
Excuse me.
NADINE:
You want to tell me what happened in there?
Abby wants full custody of Chloe and won't give me an inch.
It's gotten... pretty nasty.
(exhales)
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
You know, I went through something similar with my son, Roman.
Um...
His father and I weren't married.
And he wanted nothing to do with us, until Roman turned eight.
And then he asked for a relationship.
(sighs) I think I resented the whole "prodigal father returning for the fun stuff"
after I'd done all the heavy lifting.
And I knew he didn't have money to take me to court, so...
I boxed him out.
And then one day, I was cleaning out Roman's backpack, and I found the announcement for the father-son camping trip at his school.
It was torn into pieces.
That's when I realized who was really going to be picking up the tab.
HENRY:
What's the status at the crash site?
MO:
Placed an anonymous call over an hour ago.
Highway Patrol should be there any minute.
With any luck... (car alarm wailing in distance) ...they rule Wayne's death accidental.
We just have to make sure VFF gets the word and buys the story.
Yeah.
Okay.
Call me the minute you get a ping from Ian.
ELIZABETH:
You all right?
(sighs) No, not really.
You know, my asset.
How 'bout you?
Well, I just heard that the Lama's been hospitalized.
Likely the beginning of the end.
I'm sorry.
Well, I got to deal with how his passing is gonna affect the planet.
China's playing with global catastrophe, and no one knows yet whether Gaden Bhuti will pass the test and be the next Lama or not.
There's no way to influence the outcome?
You mean... by doing something brazenly unethical?
Are you okay?
Really?
You have a fever?
I just have been suggesting a lot of things that aren't me lately.
Well, I'm right here.
You know, sometimes those Lama tests can take years to initiate.
Great.
Then it won't matter whether he's the Lama or not, because the planet can't wait.
There's-there's no time.
Maybe you can't put your thumb on the scale.
How 'bout you put your foot on the gas?
(heart monitor beeping steadily)
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Transition team to O.R. 3.
MAN:
Ma'am.
Transition team to O.R. 3.
Ah, Elizabeth.
I brought you these.
Ah.
How very kind, Elizabeth.
If you want to say something, there's no better time than now.
I-I've been thinking about how, for Buddhists, clinging is the root of suffering.
Well, I understand that now, because I have been clinging to ensuring a future for our planet and its people.
(chuckles softly)
This may even be my purpose.
That is a worthy purpose.
But the trouble is... our purposes are at odds.
If Gaden Bhuti is the Lama, Tibet has a leader.
But the Chinese will not ratify your climate deal.
And by 2050, 200 million people in your region will face losing their homes and lives from the melting Himalayan glacier.
And once gone, so will be the water supply to the Indian seat of your own government in exile.
CHODEN:
But if
Gaden Bhuti is not the Lama...
If the tests take years, it won't matter.
(sighs)
What do you ask of me, Elizabeth?
Give my purpose fair footing.
Test the American child now.
We'll accept the results... then go from there.
(indistinct chatter)
Jay, what are you doing here?
You cannot ambush me like this.
Don't worry.
I come in peace.
So, I just spent the week watching Tibet and China fight over a two-year-old who may or may not be the reincarnation of the Bodhisattva of compassion.
I know.
I read about it.
It's crazy.
He's this avatar for everyone's hopes and fears, even mine.
I'm clinging to Chloe like she's the last mooring of the life I knew, the life that I... that I thought made sense to me.
You're a wonderful mother.
And I'm a present and loving dad when I'm around.
I'm gonna work on doing more of that.
But the main thing is, no matter what choices that we're making in our lives right now, she didn't choose it.
She deserves parents who respect each other and put her first, and I just...
I just want to focus on that.
So...
I'm saying yes to your agreement.
Chloe needs stability more than I need... anything.
But I hope we can keep talking about it, though.
Things can change.
I could get fired.
And then I'm coming after her with everything I've got.
Yeah, of course we can keep talking about it.
I want Chloe to think that her dad is the greatest.
DALTON:
So, the Dalai Lama's representatives are set to meet him today?
Uh, yeah, in an hour.
It's the final test.
And if they recognize their master in this little American boy?
Then we are out of moves.
You should have heard me wax poetic about the ospreys to Senator Morton.
Oh, I'm sure you were very eloquent, Conrad.
No one would tell me otherwise.
This job gives you an inflated sense of your own importance, so it can be sobering when the world just does what it wants, all your fine talk be damned.
I just got word.
The Dalai Lama passed away.
His attendants are preparing to take his body back to India.
I'm sorry to hear that.
He was a great man.
Maybe even something rarer.
He was a good man.
Do they still plan on testing the child?
Well, Tibet needs a spiritual and symbolic leader now more than ever.
I hate to root against a toddler here, but the Little Buddha'd be doing the world a favor if he shanked this test.
Hey.
They're taking Ian to the chapel.
News of O'Connell's death broke this morning.
Reaction's been mixed.
Any pronouncements from the Elders?
SLATTERY:
Soldiers of God, welcome.
We'll see.
ALL:
Amen.
It's been a hard morning.
We lost Wayne, a brother in the struggle.
Suspicion abounded and fell in particular on the newcomer.
Brother Ryan, join me.
Uh-oh.
There's no way we can get him out now.
Brother Ryan reminds me of when Paul washed ashore in Malta.
When the local people found him, they thought, like we did, that he must be a murderer.
Why would God punish Paul with a snakebite after a shipwreck, if he didn't have it coming?
Now we hear Wayne drove off the road to his death.
But remember, my brothers, what comes next for Paul.
What comes next?
It's good news.
Scripture says,
"But after they had looked a great while and saw no harm come to him..."
"...they changed their minds and said that he was a god."
Now I'm not saying Brother Ryan is a god.
The Maltese are a fickle people.
(laughter)
But he has endured our judgment with patience.
We apologize.
Now... bless Brother Ryan as he takes Wayne's place on the Council of Elders and fulfills our purpose:
to bring a timely end to this decaying world!
ALL:
Amen.
Amen!
(applause and cheering)
He's alive, and he's a member of the Council now.
Not a bad day at the office.
Yeah, yeah.
Ma'am?
Geshe Tashi.
ELIZABETH:
I am so sorry about your teacher's passing.
Thank you.
His legacy lives on in his reincarnation.
The search will continue.
So, Gaden Bhuti did not pass the test?
When Lama Dote, Lama Samten, and I met the child, we agreed: he is not our teacher.
I know His Holiness had a lot of faith in your discernment, so we wish Tibet luck in its search.
The path to the new Lama often has many turns.
Before I go, may I fulfill one of the Lama's last wishes?
Can we go to the mandala?
Of course.
Yes.
(quietly):
Shall I ask Blake to call Minister Chen?
In a minute.
For now, will you please gather the staff?
So, where will you search next?
There is a girl in Nepal.
Or perhaps there will be no Lama.
I would find that kind of ambiguity hard to accept.
As you noted in the hospital, clinging to anything, including a vision or a political stance, is a recipe for suffering.
The Chinese exiled the Lama, but this introduced him and Tibetan culture to the world.
Whether or not autonomy comes,
Tibet lives in the hearts of many, and, so, can never die.
Perhaps in this way, the Lama did achieve his purpose.
Now other purposes can flourish, perhaps not ones beneficial only to Tibetans, but to all mankind.
Thank you.

- Then who did?

What are you...?
- Ready for the Runway?
- Of course, of course it was the other one.
No, the real world, actually.
President Dalton gave his, State of the Union, like, an hour ago.
I have to be up on what the cable-verse thinks for work tomorrow.
Great.
So just because you're interning for Russell Jackson, you have to stay current on how screwed-up the world is?
Guys, Mom has spent the last six months negotiating a global climate deal, and the president announced it tonight.
It's like the moon shot of our generation.
More than 200 countries committed to the Stockholm Protocols' sweeping carbon emission benchmarks.
But the crown jewel for President Dalton was getting India and China on board.
The question now:
Will the treaty pass the U.S. Senate?
Hey, look who's civically engaged.
Hey.
Do you guys think that the Senate's gonna ratify?
You mean act rationally and sacrifice minor short-term domestic economic gains for the greater good?
Yeah, they always do stuff like that.
I have faith.
In the scorched-earth fight our president is willing to wage to bulldoze those who would deny reality.
Scorched earth over scorched earth?
Appropriate.
I need ice cream.
You were really playing Titanfall, weren't you?

God.
Yeah, let him in.
Who is it?
The Grim Reaper?
Pretty much.
You sure you don't want a spoon?
No, thanks.
So, I hear you are meeting with the Dalai Lama tomorrow.
Been on my schedule for months.
I doubt you just heard.
But I did just hear from the Chinese president about it.
I'm sure that you explained to him that our policy towards Tibet has not changed, and we would never let the Chinese dictate with whom our secretary of state can or cannot meet.
President Li and I simply agreed this is a delicate time.
Often the first step toward appeasement.
The Chinese have had a bug up their ass about the Dalai Lama since the 1950s, when they first drove him from his spiritual seat in Tibet.
To them, he's a font of separatist rhetoric, hell-bent on breaking away from China, so it is indeed delicate.
Are you really mansplaining Tibetan history to me?
We need China on board for the president to deliver on his promise to fight climate change, which I know you know.
And you also know that in just five days, China's congress decides whether or not to ratify the treaty.
After that, you can go on Dancing With the Stars with the Lama for all I care.
Please, Elizabeth.
Please?
Really?
Does Conrad even know you're here?
The president says... it's your call.
Look.
I get that the timing of this isn't great.
But as we know, this meeting has been on the books for some time.
And caving to Chinese pressure about it would set a terrible precedent.
That said,
I can pare back the coverage.
Try and keep the visit under the radar, I guess.
Thank you.
Good morning.
Any word from Ian?
Still radio silence.
Dead militia member and an asset gone quiet.
- Go, team.
- Yeah.
Good morning.
Good morning.
DOJ ruled that Ian's kill was justified.
Wayne O'Connell's wounds were consistent with Ian's account of the attack.
Okay.
And what about the disposition of the body?
Office of Legal Counsel wants it released to the family immediately.
And say what?
That he was killed during an FBI sting into his death cult?
We can't risk word that the investigation will get back
- to the VFF.
- That's right.
You want to pull Ian out.
I don't see how we have any other choice, unless you expect the Federal Bureau
- to disappear a body.
- Okay, look.
I have a meeting scheduled with Ian tomorrow.
Assuming he shows, I'll give him a camera.
As far as the militia's concerned,
Wayne O'Connell is just missing.
Let's give Ian more time to gather evidence, then we can pull him out, grab the drone and the bomb, and then release O'Connell's body.
The most I can get the DOJ to hold is four days.
That's how long you have to me something actionable.
Preparations for the sand mandala
- are going well.
- I don't get it.
These monks spent all week painstakingly arranging colored sand to fit this blueprint, and when, whoosh, they just sweep it away.
Wh-What's the point?
That is the point.
Everything's transitory.
Everything ends.
That's very sad.
Even that feeling, that'll pass, too.
Okay, now you're just piling on.
Just keep at it.
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Morning, ma'am.
Great morning.
Is the sand mandala
- ready to rock?
- Yes, ma'am.
I still don't get the point.
That is the point.
No.
Due respect, ma'am, not getting the point can't possibly be the point.
You can say that about anything.
Exactly.
Give over, Blake.
Okay, you know,
Buddhism clearly isn't for neurotics.
Or maybe just the opposite.
Look who that is!
Come here!
Who is this?
Who is this?
My goodness.
This is my girl.
I tell ya, staffers just keep getting younger and younger,
- don't they?
- Sorry, ma'am.
- The sitter canceled on us last minute.
- Are you kidding?
She keeps me on my toes, just like her daddy.
Right, little varmint?
My goodness.
My goodness.
Secretary Elizabeth McCord.
So good to see you.
- It's so good to see you.
- You are the kindest of world leaders.
Tall bird lady with lion's heart.
Thank you, Your Holiness.
You remember my assistants, Lama Samten, Lama Dote and Geshe Tashi.
You can tell them apart by their auras.
Buddhist humor.
That's...
He's...
That's...
- He's funny.
- Yeah.
Now, who are you, little sister?
This is Chloe.
- Hello.
- Chloe.
Your Holiness, this...
Whoa!
She is the wisest of us all.
Yes.
Now, where is the sand mandala?
Members of the National Buddhist Center here in D.C. anticipated your arrival.
May you be at peace.
May you be well.
May you find loving kindness.
Let this cosmic Buddha palace heal and energize the world.
May I have some tea?
Of course.
We have a masala chai that the tea snobs around here just rave about.
- Hi.
- Sorry about this.
No, it's fine.
My mom's coming for her.
- Hi, baby.
- You got her?
I really am trying my best here.
Um, listen, I was gonna give this to you a little later, but, it seems appropriate.
It's an informal custody settlement agreement.
Are you serious?
You... you want sole physical custody of our child?
I want a routine for Chloe.
Yeah, but what's-what's this?
Can't we just talk about it?
Every time we set a schedule, something comes up, and she and I end up ping-ponging between offices and departments, and we cannot keep doing that.
And my lawyer friend says it's a, it's a standard arrangement.
One day a week, every other weekend, and-and then we can discuss holidays.
What happened to working on the marriage?
My lawyer friend.
And we still need a custody agreement
- while we're working on the marriage.
- No.
I do not accept this.
You don't get to dictate the terms here.
Shh.
Okay.
Okay.
We should just talk about this later.
I'm sorry.
I thought you would understand.
Say good-bye to Daddy.
Good girl.
I'll see you soon, okay, honey?
See you later.
Come on.
I must request your help with a rather serious matter.
Your Holiness, you know I...
I can't discuss statecraft with you.
I'm terminal.
Pancreatic cancer.
I'm so sorry.
Everyone must die.
I have aligned my life to my purpose:
To fight for the autonomy of the Tibetan people.
And as for them,
I ask that you endorse my choice for my successor over China's.
Well, as always... the United States encourages you to achieve your goal through direct dialogue with China.
When I die, the Tibetans will lose their loudest voice in this world.
China will be emboldened to trample even more of our rights.
U.S. policy is clear.
We are officially neutral on this issue.
I die knowing that I've done everything I can for my people.
I have no regrets, Elizabeth.
Do you?
Of course I have regrets.
How could I not?
It was a rhetorical question, babe.
And now he's dying.
And I feel terrible about that.
And I feel guilty about Tibet.
Like, now it's all on me, but I... we're too... enmeshed with China, especially with this climate deal, to offend them over a battle they've-they've mostly won, right?
I mean...
Thoughts from the world renowned religious scholar?
I guess I'm preoccupied with my own regrets.
Not just that the office shut down.
The bomb's still out there, to say nothing of the drone.
Gosh, I'm sorry.
I...
It's okay.
Just... stop hogging all the self-flagellation.
Hello.
Sorry to bother you, ma'am, but are you watching the news?
I'll turn it on.
Announcement.
Breaking with hundreds of years of tradition, the Dalai Lama named his successor while still alive.
Gaden Bhuti, a two-year-old Tibetan-American boy from Delaware, son to immigrants Yonten and Sonam Bhuti...
Didn't see that coming.
Please tell me this boy isn't an American citizen, Jay.
Wish I could, but if we let him keep his citizenship or leave the country to take his new position, the Chinese will accuse us of backing the Tibetan cause.
Well, you got to hand it to the Lama.
He figured out a way to force our hand.
China will make a meal of this.
Yeah, and the appetizer will be our climate deal.
Hang on, Jay.
I have peace and light on the other line.
I got to call you back.
Namaste, Russell.
You watching this?
!
Y...
Yes.
Where did he get this bright idea?
What the hell did you say to the Lama?
!
Mr. Chen, the United States will not officially endorse any new Lama;
You have my word.
How generous, Madam Secretary, but the People's Republic needs you to publicly disavow this choice.
You know we can't do that.
Not endorsing maintains our neutrality.
If the Dalai Lama is an American, then by definition, that's not neutral.
It's the United States harboring an anti-China instigator.
Ming, the boy is two.
I think your way of life will survive.
Symbols are often more potent than armies, Elizabeth.
Change your position, or I will make sure the National People's Congress Standing Committee never considers the Stockholm Protocols for approval.
Are you really going to hold the world hostage over a symbol, who's probably not even potty-trained?
I believe my position is clear.
To hell with the cooling-off period.
I want to look at officially naming China a currency manipulator.
Even hinting at that will be considered aggressive.
Look, whether we like it or not,
Tibet is a symbol of nationalism in China.
And the Dalai Lama personifies the last vestiges of Tibetan independence.
So let China look tough for a few days, and I bet that they will quietly ratify the protocols.
Well, forget the Chinese.
Now we're taking fire from our own flank.
Chandler Morton, the distinguished junior senator from Pennsylvania, just did a lap of the morning shows to express his ardent support for the Dalai Lama and his American successor.
Senator Dumbass even invited the Lama to address the Senate Foreign Relations Committee next week.
Why jeopardize the climate deal?
Morton's on record as a supporter.
The Dalai Lama's announcement last night broke the Internet.
The public moved on from sad polar bears to cute baby saviors.
The senator's just chasing that narrative to boost his profile.
Well, regardless of his motive, we still need to show China we take this seriously.
Chen won't accept a condemnation.
Morton will have to back down.
Hit 'em where it hurts, sir.
Threaten to withdraw support from your donor list.
And we provoke him, it could blow up in our face.
Look, let me find a carrot to entice the good senator.
You want to reward this punk?
If we can quietly get him off his high horse, then I will have something to point to when I talk the Chinese off theirs.
Do it, Bess.
Rewarding bad behavior it is.
Nadine, do you still play in that monthly Hill leadership poker game?
I consider it my pension fund.
You ever clean out anyone from the Pennsylvania delegation?
Well, it's a friendly game.
Are you looking for leverage on Senator Morton?
I just wanted to... offer him some alternative paths to the attention he seeks.
I'll find something.
Thank you.
Hey.
Hey.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
I got to be quick.
Ever since Wayne disappeared, they've got us on even tighter lockdown.
Does the Council of Elders suspect foul play?
Yeah, of course.
They got conspiracy theories on why certain squirrels show up when they do.
Since Wayne's disappearance is an actual mystery, they're going nuts;
I swear they're watching me.
Can you hang on for another 72 hours?
HQ shutting it down?
Got to release Wayne's body.
So we need you to focus on collecting significant Intel now.
We'll raid camp after we extract you.
I don't have any significant Intel.
I haven't seen the bomb.
After Wayne, they moved the drone.
You're gonna have to wear another camera.
At the very least, it'll help us plan the raid.
Did you not hear me?
They already think I'm shady.
If they see that thing, they're gonna kill me.
- They sweep the camp every day...
- Okay, listen, I know what the risk is, but remember, we're trying to keep VFF from committing mass murder.
All the work you've done,
Wayne's death, it means nothing unless we get enough information before we go in.
Look, if you're not up for it...
I can bring you in right now.
I'm fine.
I should go.
Okay.
See you in 72 hours.
Ben.
Hey.
- Thanks for this.
- Hey, I'm always happy to dispense legal advice when it's paired with a free steak.
Could we actually do something quicker?
Work is...
Yeah, I read about the Lama thing.
Whatever you want, man.
So, what can I do?
You mean if reasoning with her fails?
You have to play the game you're in.
Hardball.
Use anything you can to make her look less optimal.
Didn't you say she went through some postpartum stuff?
Do not go there, man.
I didn't say it was pretty.
Ma'am, I did the recon.
Senator Morton's chief professional passion is lobbying the FCC to approve a telecom merger.
But he does have pretty powerful motivation for supporting an American Lama.
I'll let my source tell you.
You play poker with the vice president, Nadine?
I cashed in my chips when I took this gig.
- How are you?
- Hi, Teresa.
How are you?
So good to see you.
Come, please, sit down.
Yes, well, it was just as well, because Nadine is a shark.
Teresa was gracious enough to take my call anyway.
What better source on Morton than his predecessor?
I wish I had better news.
Morton's untimely pursuit of Tibetan freedom has particularly craven motives.
His biggest donor is Gration Tech, manufacturer of heavy machinery.
They make almost half their revenue from hydraulic valve parts crucial to coal mining.
An industry that would take an enormous hit if the Stockholm Protocols were ratified.
Ma'am, I just got word from our India desk...
Madam Vice President, hi.
Sorry to interrupt.
No worries.
It's good to see you, Jay.
India wants to reopen the Stockholm Protocols.
They're demanding a reduction on all coal restrictions.
They're clearly reacting to China wavering.
That and growing protests in Delhi and Mumbai over the prospect of rising electricity costs.
Well, with India bailing, China is even less likely to ratify the climate deal.
And we have our own senator to thank for blowing it up.
Wow.
So Morton is trying to spike the deal to help one of his donors, but he's hiding behind the feel-good issue of Tibetan independence.
That's my assessment, sir, yes.
You staked your second term on taking meaningful action on climate change.
If this deal falls apart, the enemy smells weakness, works that much harder to deny any of your other priorities.
Why did I want this job again?
Your house does have a bowling alley in the basement.
So no one will care that Morton puts his donors' priorities ahead of the nation's, I mean, of-of the world?
Yeah.
No one will care.
We need to stop the bleeding.
Get India back on board, Morton back in line, before every other hack in the Senate puts his hand out and our own side falls apart.
Well, I can handle the India inducements.
As for Morton...
I rescind my earlier concerns about provoking him.
I think we all know what needs to happen.
We've been watching Ian's feed for hours, with no new sign of evidence.
On the other hand, they haven't killed him.
Yet.
Our dead friend Wayne O'Connell's been out of pocket for days now.
Ian's the new guy;
They got to be looking at him.
Yeah, but if we pull him now, there's no way we'll find the bomb.
Unless... we release O'Connell's body to his family without telling the details of his death.
Whoa.
That's a surprising notion coming from an ethics professor.
Could take the heat off Ian.
Buy him some time to find the bomb.
Can you live with that?
I'm so sorry I forgot to give you this.
Was Chloe up all night?
Thank you.
Hey, I said I'm sorry.
How could you go to the guy who officiated our wedding for legal advice?
What about your lawyer friend?
Someone from yoga who downloaded a form for me.
I didn't seek her advice, and she didn't marry us.
Well, I'm allowed to know my rights.
You really want to fight me in court for the right to leave her with a babysitter in your apartment half the time?
Who does that serve, Jay?
And you can't seriously think that you would be a better custodial parent to Chloe.
I practically was her only parent for six months when you couldn't get out of bed.
Remember that?
Because I sure as hell do!
Prime Minister Verma, let me start by saying that I am open to taking a second look at some of the protocols.
Since India will sacrifice the most, we believe it's only fair.
Just none that increase coal emissions.
The rich Western nation built on coal tells the emerging market, "It's okay when we polluted."
You find a new way."
A classic.
Look, I get it.
You promised to bring electricity to the 300 million Indians who live without it, and you think loosening coal restrictions will help you deliver.
And it will.
We have lots of people in India and lots of coal.
It's not a complicated equation.
But the majority of those without electricity live in remote rural areas, far from any kind of grid.
Indeed.
I'm well aware of that.
So let's find that new way together.
Return to the deal as is, and the U.S. will subsidize a mass scale lo-fi alternative:
Bottom-up, solar mini grid efforts to rural areas.
Get the Chinese to resuscitate the protocols, along with this new amendment, we could be amenable.
I told POTUS what this telecom merger would mean for Pennsylvania.
A thumbs-up could push it over the top, really put you on the map.
Good luck, Senator.
You're not coming?
No, no, no.
The president wanted to keep this meeting top tier... just one and two.
Number five.
Didn't make the cut.
Let's not keep the leader of the free world waiting.
Senator Morton, are you familiar with the migratory pattern of the osprey?
Um, no, sir.
They winter in South America, then travel up to 5,000 miles to their North American breeding grounds.
They settle here to eat fish from the Potomac.
I saw a few my first year, but... not many since.
My grandchildren, well... they may never see an osprey at all.
That's what scientists call shifting baseline syndrome.
Each generation accepts their version of nature, plunders it, then leaves the next generation to accept the depleted version, and so on.
Which brings me to us.
Now.
You.
Mr. President, I'm here about the telecom deal.
We'll get to that in a minute.
I know you're killing my climate deal to appease your donor.
Who is it again,
Gration Technologies?
All due respect, sir, your sources don't know what they're talking about.
I'm his source, Chandler.
Your telecom merger is up for review in two weeks.
It, rides the line on antitrust issues, on what's proper and not.
Shifting baseline syndrome.
It's everywhere these days.
Point is,
I can choose to become troubled by those issues.
Or not.
So do the right thing.
Don't screw up the climate deal that a majority of Americans support, including your constituents.
Or I will kick your ass.
Welcome to Washington, Senator.
I received your inducements, Madam Secretary.
All very generous.
But we cannot accept as long as your government endorses the American Lama.
And that's why I'm glad to report that Senator Morton had a change of heart.
We reaffirm our neutrality.
A government with conflicting opinions.
I will never understand democracy.
Well, you say "tomato,"
I say "let's ratify our climate deal."
Okay?
We'll resubmit the protocols with a new addendum for Indian solar funding.
Everybody's happy.
Planet saved.
Thank you.
There's just one more matter to settle.
Really?
Chinese Buddhist scholars have found the Dalai Lama's true reincarnation.
A two-year-old boy in Sichuan Province.
If you officially recognize him, we will gladly have the Standing Committee consider the protocols for ratification.
Ming, we-we support the PRC's right to recognize this boy as the next Lama.
Just as we support Tibet's right to recognize their own boy.
I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Disqualify the American Lama or recognize ours.
Otherwise, no deal.
Do you know the mountains that President Dalton and I had to move to put this deal back together?
All to do what's best for our children and grandchildren... and the other seven billion people on the planet, too.
But...
And you are putting it all on the line, trying to strong-arm us into endorsing some toddler that you are using as a political pawn!
Do...
You know who the real toddler is, Ming?
You.
You're the real toddler.
You are.
Well, that happened.
Yes, it most certainly did.
Are you going to see the Bhuti family today?
In a few minutes, actually.
Would you like us to try to talk them out of letting their child do the Lama tests?
No.
We are not putting our thumb on the scale.
Let's just hope the universe... gives us a break.
The Chinese officials said you will take away our citizenship if we let Gaden study as a monk.
No, the State Department would never do that.
They were just trying to intimidate you.
We heard the Chinese stopped the climate deal over of our son.
How do we know you won't try to pressure us in order
- to make your deal?
- Well, of course,
American government has policy concerns.
But it is not our place to try to influence you.
It is a difficult decision.
If your child was chosen to enlighten all people...
And to save your home...
Shouldn't you let him?
So you're actually considering giving up your child to be raised by monks?
Which is your choice.
But, effectively, you'd be choosing to abandon him.
You know that, right?
Excuse me.
You want to tell me what happened in there?
Abby wants full custody of Chloe and won't give me an inch.
It's gotten... pretty nasty.
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
You know, I went through something similar with my son, Roman.
Um...
His father and I weren't married.
And he wanted nothing to do with us, until Roman turned eight.
And then he asked for a relationship.
I think I resented the whole "prodigal father returning for the fun stuff"
after I'd done all the heavy lifting.
And I knew he didn't have money to take me to court, so...
I boxed him out.
And then one day, I was cleaning out Roman's backpack, and I found the announcement for the father-son camping trip at his school.
It was torn into pieces.
That's when I realized who was really going to be picking up the tab.
What's the status at the crash site?
Placed an anonymous call over an hour ago.
Highway Patrol should be there any minute.
With any luck... they rule Wayne's death accidental.
We just have to make sure VFF gets the word and buys the story.
Yeah.
Okay.
Call me the minute you get a ping from Ian.
You all right?
No, not really.
You know, my asset.
How 'bout you?
Well, I just heard that the Lama's been hospitalized.
Likely the beginning of the end.
I'm sorry.
Well, I got to deal with how his passing is gonna affect the planet.
China's playing with global catastrophe, and no one knows yet whether Gaden Bhuti will pass the test and be the next Lama or not.
There's no way to influence the outcome?
You mean... by doing something brazenly unethical?
Are you okay?
Really?
You have a fever?
I just have been suggesting a lot of things that aren't me lately.
Well, I'm right here.
You know, sometimes those Lama tests can take years to initiate.
Great.
Then it won't matter whether he's the Lama or not, because the planet can't wait.
There's-there's no time.
Maybe you can't put your thumb on the scale.
How 'bout you put your foot on the gas?
Transition team to O.R. 3.
Ma'am.
Transition team to O.R. 3.
Elizabeth.
I brought you these.
How very kind, Elizabeth.
If you want to say something, there's no better time than now.
I-I've been thinking about how, for Buddhists, clinging is the root of suffering.
Well, I understand that now, because I have been clinging to ensuring a future for our planet and its people.
This may even be my purpose.
That is a worthy purpose.
But the trouble is... our purposes are at odds.
If Gaden Bhuti is the Lama, Tibet has a leader.
But the Chinese will not ratify your climate deal.
And by 2050, 200 million people in your region will face losing their homes and lives from the melting Himalayan glacier.
And once gone, so will be the water supply to the Indian seat of your own government in exile.
But if.
Gaden Bhuti is not the Lama...
If the tests take years, it won't matter.
What do you ask of me, Elizabeth?
Give my purpose fair footing.
Test the American child now.
We'll accept the results... then go from there.
Jay, what are you doing here?
You cannot ambush me like this.
Don't worry.
I come in peace.
So, I just spent the week watching Tibet and China fight over a two-year-old who may or may not be the reincarnation of the Bodhisattva of compassion.
I know.
I read about it.
It's crazy.
He's this avatar for everyone's hopes and fears, even mine.
I'm clinging to Chloe like she's the last mooring of the life I knew, the life that I... that I thought made sense to me.
You're a wonderful mother.
And I'm a present and loving dad... when I'm around.
I'm gonna work on doing more of that.
But the main thing is, no matter what choices that we're making in our lives right now, she didn't choose it.
She deserves parents who respect each other and put her first, and I just...
I just want to focus on that.
So...
I'm saying yes to your agreement.
Chloe needs stability more than I need... anything.
But I hope we can keep talking about it, though.
Things can change.
I could get fired.
And then I'm coming after her with everything I've got.
Yeah, of course we can keep talking about it.
I want Chloe to think that her dad is the greatest.
So, the Dalai Lama's representatives are set to meet him today?
Yeah, in an hour.
It's the final test.
And if they recognize their master in this little American boy?
Then we are out of moves.
You should have heard me wax poetic about the ospreys to Senator Morton.
I'm sure you were very eloquent, Conrad.
No one would tell me otherwise.
This job gives you an inflated sense of your own importance, so it can be sobering when the world just does what it wants, all your fine talk be damned.
I just got word.
The Dalai Lama passed away.
His attendants are preparing to take his body back to India.
I'm sorry to hear that.
He was a great man.
Maybe even something rarer.
He was a good man.
Do they still plan on testing the child?
Well, Tibet needs a spiritual and symbolic leader now more than ever.
I hate to root against a toddler here, but the Little Buddha'd be doing the world a favor if he shanked this test.
Hey.
They're taking Ian to the chapel.
News of O'Connell's death broke this morning.
Reaction's been mixed.
Any pronouncements from the Elders?
Soldiers of God, welcome.
We'll see.
Amen.
It's been a hard morning.
We lost Wayne, a brother in the struggle.
Suspicion abounded and fell in particular on the newcomer.
Brother Ryan, join me.
There's no way we can get him out now.
Brother Ryan reminds me of when Paul washed ashore in Malta.
When the local people found him, they thought, like we did, that he must be a murderer.
Why would God punish Paul with a snakebite after a shipwreck, if he didn't have it coming?
Now we hear Wayne drove off the road to his death.
But remember, my brothers, what comes next for Paul.
What comes next?
It's good news.
Scripture says,
"But after they had looked a great while and saw no harm come to him..."
"they changed their minds and said that he was a god."
Now I'm not saying Brother Ryan is a god.
The Maltese are a fickle people.
But he has endured our judgment with patience.
We apologize.
Now... bless Brother Ryan as he takes Wayne's place on the Council of Elders and fulfills our purpose:
To bring a timely end to this decaying world!
Amen.
Amen!
He's alive, and he's a member of the Council now.
Not a bad day at the office.
Yeah, yeah.
Ma'am?
Geshe Tashi.
I am so sorry about your teacher's passing.
Thank you.
His legacy lives on in his reincarnation.
The search will continue.
So, Gaden Bhuti did not pass the test?
When Lama Dote, Lama Samten, and I met the child, he is not our teacher.
I know His Holiness had a lot of faith in your discernment, so we wish Tibet luck in its search.
The path to the new Lama often has many turns.
Before I go, may I fulfill one of the Lama's last wishes?
Can we go to the mandala?
Of course.
Yes.
Shall I ask Blake to call Minister Chen?
In a minute.
For now, will you please gather the staff?
So, where will you search next?
There is a girl in Nepal.
Or perhaps there will be no Lama.
I would find that kind of ambiguity hard to accept.
As you noted in the hospital, clinging to anything, including a vision or a political stance, is a recipe for suffering.
The Chinese exiled the Lama, but this introduced him and Tibetan culture to the world.
Whether or not autonomy comes,
Tibet lives in the hearts of many, and, so, can never die.
Perhaps in this way, the Lama did achieve his purpose.
Now other purposes can flourish, perhaps not ones beneficial only to Tibetans, but to all mankind.
Thank you.
- Ten, nine...
- Hold on.
Are you crazy?
- Are you crazy?
- It's the Project Runway finale.
- You're crazy.
- So you can DVR it!
Just stop ruining my life.
Oh, my... you know what?
You know what?
!
You are so dead!
- I-I actually didn't do it.
- You know what, Alison?
- I didn't.
- Then who did?
!
What are you...?
- Ready for the Runway?
- Of course, of course it was the other one.
Uh, no, the real world, actually.
President Dalton gave his, uh, State of the Union, like, an hour ago.
I have to be up on what the cable-verse thinks for work tomorrow.
Oh, great.
So just because you're interning for Russell Jackson, you have to stay current on how screwed-up the world is?
Guys, Mom has spent the last six months negotiating a global climate deal, and the president announced it tonight.
It's like the moon shot of our generation.
More than 200 countries committed to the Stockholm Protocols' sweeping carbon emission benchmarks.
But the crown jewel for President Dalton was getting India and China on board.
The question now:
will the treaty pass the U.S. Senate?
Ah.
Hey, look who's civically engaged.
Hey.
Do you guys think that the Senate's gonna ratify?
You mean act rationally and sacrifice minor short-term domestic economic gains for the greater good?
Oh, yeah, they always do stuff like that.
I have faith.
In the scorched-earth fight our president is willing to wage to bulldoze those who would deny reality.
Scorched earth over scorched earth?
Appropriate.
I need ice cream.
You were really playing Titanfall, weren't you?
- I mean, you know...
- Weren't you?
Huh?
If the State of the Union had just a few more explosions...
- Hello.
Who?
- I want to watch Project Runway.
Oh, God.
Uh, yeah, let him in.
Who is it?
The Grim Reaper?
Pretty much.
You sure you don't want a spoon?
Mm, no, thanks.
So, I hear you are meeting with the Dalai Lama tomorrow.
Been on my schedule for months.
I doubt you just heard.
But I did just hear from the Chinese president about it.
I'm sure that you explained to him that our policy towards Tibet has not changed, and we would never let the Chinese dictate with whom our secretary of state can or cannot meet.
President Li and I simply agreed this is a delicate time.
Often the first step toward appeasement.
The Chinese have had a bug up their ass about the Dalai Lama since the 1950s, when they first drove him from his spiritual seat in Tibet.
To them, he's a font of separatist rhetoric, hell-bent on breaking away from China, so it is indeed delicate.
Are you really mansplaining Tibetan history to me?
We need China on board for the president to deliver on his promise to fight climate change, which I know you know.
And you also know that in just five days, China's congress decides whether or not to ratify the treaty.
After that, you can go on Dancing With the Stars with the Lama for all I care.
Please, Elizabeth.
Please?
Really?
Does Conrad even know you're here?
The president says it's your call.
Look.
I get that the timing of this isn't great.
But as we know, this meeting has been on the books for some time.
And caving to Chinese pressure about it would set a terrible precedent.
That said,
I can pare back the coverage.
Try and keep the visit under the radar, I guess.
Thank you.
Good morning.
Any word from Ian?
Still radio silence.
Dead militia member and an asset gone quiet.
- Go, team.
- Yeah.
Good morning.
Good morning.
DOJ ruled that Ian's kill was justified.
Wayne O'Connell's wounds were consistent with Ian's account of the attack.
Okay.
And what about the disposition of the body?
Office of Legal Counsel wants it released to the family immediately.
And say what?
That he was killed during an FBI sting into his death cult?
We can't risk word that the investigation will get back
- to the VFF.
- That's right.
You want to pull Ian out.
I don't see how we have any other choice, unless you expect the Federal Bureau
- to disappear a body.
- Okay, look.
I have a meeting scheduled with Ian tomorrow.
Assuming he shows, I'll give him a camera.
As far as the militia's concerned,
Wayne O'Connell is just missing.
Let's give Ian more time to gather evidence, then we can pull him out, grab the drone and the bomb, and then release O'Connell's body.
The most I can get the DOJ to hold is four days.
That's how long you have to me something actionable.
Preparations for the sand mandala
- are going well.
- I don't get it.
These monks spent all week painstakingly arranging colored sand to fit this blueprint, and when, whoosh, they just sweep it away.
Wh-What's the point?
That is the point.
Everything's transitory.
Everything ends.
That's very sad.
Even that feeling, that'll pass, too.
Okay, now you're just piling on.
Just keep at it.
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Morning, ma'am.
Great morning.
Is the sand mandala
- ready to rock?
- Yes, ma'am.
Uh, I still don't get the point.
That is the point.
No.
Due respect, ma'am, not getting the point can't possibly be the point.
You can say that about anything.
Exactly.
Give over, Blake.
Okay, you know,
Buddhism clearly isn't for neurotics.
Or maybe just the opposite.
Look who that is!
Come here!
Who is this?
Who is this?
Oh, my goodness.
This is my girl.
I tell ya, staffers just keep getting younger and younger,
- don't they?
- Sorry, ma'am.
- The sitter canceled on us last minute.
- Oh, are you kidding?
She keeps me on my toes, just like her daddy.
Right, little varmint?
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.
Secretary Elizabeth McCord.
Ah, so good to see you.
- It's so good to see you.
- You are the kindest of world leaders.
Tall bird lady with lion's heart.
Thank you, Your Holiness.
You remember my assistants, Lama Samten, Lama Dote and Geshe Tashi.
You can tell them apart by their auras.
Oh.
- Buddhist humor.
- Oh!
That's...
He's...
That's...
- He's funny.
- Yeah.
Oh, now, who are you, little sister?
This is Chloe.
- Hello.
- Chloe.
Your Holiness, this...
Whoa!
She is the wisest of us all.
Yes.
Now, where is the sand mandala?
Members of the National Buddhist Center here in D.C. anticipated your arrival.
Ah.
May you be at peace.
May you be well.
May you find loving kindness.
Let this cosmic Buddha palace heal and energize the world.
May I have some tea?
Of course.
We have a masala chai that the tea snobs around here just rave about.
- Hi.
- Sorry about this.
No, it's fine.
My mom's coming for her.
- Hi, baby.
- You got her?
I really am trying my best here.
Um, listen, I was gonna give this to you a little later, but, uh, it seems appropriate.
It's an informal custody settlement agreement.
Are you serious?
You... you want sole physical custody of our child?
I want a routine for Chloe.
Yeah, but what's-what's this?
Can't we just talk about it?
Every time we set a schedule, something comes up, and she and I end up ping-ponging between offices and departments, and we cannot keep doing that.
And my lawyer friend says it's a, uh, it's a standard arrangement.
One day a week, every other weekend, and-and then we can discuss holidays.
What happened to working on the marriage?
My lawyer friend.
And we still need a custody agreement
- while we're working on the marriage.
- No.
I do not accept this.
You don't get to dictate the terms here.
Shh.
Okay.
Okay.
We should just talk about this later.
I'm sorry.
I thought you would understand.
Say good-bye to Daddy.
Good girl.
I'll see you soon, okay, honey?
See you later.
Come on.
I must request your help with a rather serious matter.
Your Holiness, you know I...
I can't discuss statecraft with you.
I'm terminal.
Pancreatic cancer.
I'm so sorry.
Everyone must die.
I have aligned my life to my purpose:
to fight for the autonomy of the Tibetan people.
And as for them,
I ask that you endorse my choice for my successor over China's.
Well, as always... the United States encourages you to achieve your goal through direct dialogue with China.
When I die, the Tibetans will lose their loudest voice in this world.
China will be emboldened to trample even more of our rights.
U.S. policy is clear.
We are officially neutral on this issue.
I die knowing that I've done everything I can for my people.
I have no regrets, Elizabeth.
Do you?
Of course I have regrets.
How could I not?
It was a rhetorical question, babe.
And now he's dying.
And I feel terrible about that.
And I feel guilty about Tibet.
Like, now it's all on me, but I... we're too... enmeshed with China, especially with this climate deal, to offend them over a battle they've-they've mostly won, right?
I mean...
Thoughts from the world renowned religious scholar?
I guess I'm preoccupied with my own regrets.
Uh, not just that the office shut down.
The bomb's still out there, to say nothing of the drone.
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
I...
It's okay.
Just... stop hogging all the self-flagellation.
Hello.
Sorry to bother you, ma'am, but are you watching the news?
I'll turn it on.
...announcement.
Breaking with hundreds of years of tradition, the Dalai Lama named his successor while still alive.
Gaden Bhuti, a two-year-old Tibetan-American boy from Delaware, son to immigrants Yonten and Sonam Bhuti...
Didn't see that coming.
Please tell me this boy isn't an American citizen, Jay.
Wish I could, but if we let him keep his citizenship or leave the country to take his new position, the Chinese will accuse us of backing the Tibetan cause.
Well, you got to hand it to the Lama.
He figured out a way to force our hand.
China will make a meal of this.
Yeah, and the appetizer will be our climate deal.
Hang on, Jay.
I have peace and light on the other line.
I got to call you back.
Namaste, Russell.
You watching this?
!
Y...
Yes.
Where did he get this bright idea?
What the hell did you say to the Lama?
!
Mr. Chen, the United States will not officially endorse any new Lama; you have my word.
How generous, Madam Secretary, but the People's Republic needs you to publicly disavow this choice.
You know we can't do that.
Not endorsing maintains our neutrality.
If the Dalai Lama is an American, then by definition, that's not neutral.
It's the United States harboring an anti-China instigator.
Ming, the boy is two.
I think your way of life will survive.
Symbols are often more potent than armies, Elizabeth.
Change your position, or I will make sure the National People's Congress Standing Committee never considers the Stockholm Protocols for approval.
Are you really going to hold the world hostage over a symbol, who's probably not even potty-trained?
I believe my position is clear.
To hell with the cooling-off period.
I want to look at officially naming China a currency manipulator.
Even hinting at that will be considered aggressive.
Look, whether we like it or not,
Tibet is a symbol of nationalism in China.
And the Dalai Lama personifies the last vestiges of Tibetan independence.
So let China look tough for a few days, and I bet that they will quietly ratify the protocols.
Well, forget the Chinese.
Now we're taking fire from our own flank.
Chandler Morton, the distinguished junior senator from Pennsylvania, just did a lap of the morning shows to express his ardent support for the Dalai Lama and his American successor.
Senator Dumbass even invited the Lama to address the Senate Foreign Relations Committee next week.
Why jeopardize the climate deal?
Morton's on record as a supporter.
The Dalai Lama's announcement last night broke the Internet.
The public moved on from sad polar bears to cute baby saviors.
The senator's just chasing that narrative to boost his profile.
Well, regardless of his motive, we still need to show China we take this seriously.
Chen won't accept a condemnation.
Morton will have to back down.
Hit 'em where it hurts, sir.
Threaten to withdraw support from your donor list.
And we provoke him, it could blow up in our face.
Look, let me find a carrot to entice the good senator.
You want to reward this punk?
If we can quietly get him off his high horse, then I will have something to point to when I talk the Chinese off theirs.
Do it, Bess.
Rewarding bad behavior it is.
Nadine, do you still play in that monthly Hill leadership poker game?
I consider it my pension fund.
You ever clean out anyone from the Pennsylvania delegation?
Well, it's a friendly game.
Are you looking for leverage on Senator Morton?
I just wanted to... offer him some alternative paths to the attention he seeks.
I'll find something.
Thank you.
Hey.
Hey.
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.
I got to be quick.
Ever since Wayne disappeared, they've got us on even tighter lockdown.
Does the Council of Elders suspect foul play?
Yeah, of course.
They got conspiracy theories on why certain squirrels show up when they do.
Since Wayne's disappearance is an actual mystery, they're going nuts;
I swear they're watching me.
Can you hang on for another 72 hours?
HQ shutting it down?
Got to release Wayne's body.
So we need you to focus on collecting significant Intel now.
We'll raid camp after we extract you.
I don't have any significant Intel.
I haven't seen the bomb.
After Wayne, they moved the drone.
You're gonna have to wear another camera.
At the very least, it'll help us plan the raid.
Uh, did you not hear me?
They already think I'm shady.
If they see that thing, they're gonna kill me.
- They sweep the camp every day...
- Okay, listen, I know what the risk is, but remember, we're trying to keep VFF from committing mass murder.
All the work you've done,
Wayne's death, it means nothing unless we get enough information before we go in.
Look, if you're not up for it...
I can bring you in right now.
I'm fine.
I should go.
Okay.
See you in 72 hours.
Ben.
Hey.
- Thanks for this.
- Hey, I'm always happy to dispense legal advice when it's paired with a free steak.
Could we actually do something quicker?
Work is...
Oh, yeah, I read about the Lama thing.
Uh, whatever you want, man.
So, what can I do?
You mean if reasoning with her fails?
You have to play the game you're in.
Hardball.
Use anything you can to make her look less optimal.
Didn't you say she went through some postpartum stuff?
Do not go there, man.
I didn't say it was pretty.
Ma'am, I did the recon.
Senator Morton's chief professional passion is lobbying the FCC to approve a telecom merger.
But he does have pretty powerful motivation for supporting an American Lama.
I'll let my source tell you.
You play poker with the vice president, Nadine?
I cashed in my chips when I took this gig.
- How are you?
- Hi, Teresa.
How are you?
So good to see you.
Come, please, sit down.
Uh, yes, well, it was just as well, because Nadine is a shark.
Teresa was gracious enough to take my call anyway.
What better source on Morton than his predecessor?
I wish I had better news.
Morton's untimely pursuit of Tibetan freedom has particularly craven motives.
His biggest donor is Gration Tech, manufacturer of heavy machinery.
They make almost half their revenue from hydraulic valve parts crucial to coal mining.
An industry that would take an enormous hit if the Stockholm Protocols were ratified.
Ma'am, I just got word from our India desk...
Oh, Madam Vice President, hi.
Sorry to interrupt.
No worries.
It's good to see you, Jay.
India wants to reopen the Stockholm Protocols.
They're demanding a reduction on all coal restrictions.
They're clearly reacting to China wavering.
That and growing protests in Delhi and Mumbai over the prospect of rising electricity costs.
Well, with India bailing, China is even less likely to ratify the climate deal.
And we have our own senator to thank for blowing it up.
Wow.
So Morton is trying to spike the deal to help one of his donors, but he's hiding behind the feel-good issue of Tibetan independence.
That's my assessment, sir, yes.
You staked your second term on taking meaningful action on climate change.
If this deal falls apart, the enemy smells weakness, works that much harder to deny any of your other priorities.
Why did I want this job again?
Your house does have a bowling alley in the basement.
So no one will care that Morton puts his donors' priorities ahead of the nation's, I mean, of-of the world?
Yeah.
No one will care.
We need to stop the bleeding.
Get India back on board, Morton back in line, before every other hack in the Senate puts his hand out and our own side falls apart.
Well, I can handle the India inducements.
As for Morton...
I rescind my earlier concerns about provoking him.
I think we all know what needs to happen.
We've been watching Ian's feed for hours, with no new sign of evidence.
On the other hand, they haven't killed him.
Yet.
Our dead friend Wayne O'Connell's been out of pocket for days now.
Ian's the new guy; they got to be looking at him.
Yeah, but if we pull him now, there's no way we'll find the bomb.
Unless... we release O'Connell's body to his family without telling the details of his death.
Whoa.
That's a surprising notion coming from an ethics professor.
Could take the heat off Ian.
Buy him some time to find the bomb.
Can you live with that?
I'm so sorry I forgot to give you this.
Was Chloe up all night?
Thank you.
Hey, I said I'm sorry.
How could you go to the guy who officiated our wedding for legal advice?
What about your lawyer friend?
Someone from yoga who downloaded a form for me.
I didn't seek her advice, and she didn't marry us.
Well, I'm allowed to know my rights.
You really want to fight me in court for the right to leave her with a babysitter in your apartment half the time?
Who does that serve, Jay?
And you can't seriously think that you would be a better custodial parent to Chloe.
I practically was her only parent for six months when you couldn't get out of bed.
Remember that?
Because I sure as hell do!
Prime Minister Verma, let me start by saying that I am open to taking a second look at some of the protocols.
Since India will sacrifice the most, we believe it's only fair.
Just none that increase coal emissions.
Ah.
The rich Western nation built on coal tells the emerging market, "It's okay when we polluted.
You find a new way."
A classic.
Look, I get it.
You promised to bring electricity to the 300 million Indians who live without it, and you think loosening coal restrictions will help you deliver.
And it will.
We have lots of people in India and lots of coal.
It's not a complicated equation.
But the majority of those without electricity live in remote rural areas, far from any kind of grid.
Indeed.
I'm well aware of that.
So let's find that new way together.
Return to the deal as is, and the U.S. will subsidize a mass scale lo-fi alternative:
bottom-up, solar mini grid efforts to rural areas.
Get the Chinese to resuscitate the protocols, along with this new amendment, we could be amenable.
I told POTUS what this telecom merger would mean for Pennsylvania.
A thumbs-up could push it over the top, really put you on the map.
Good luck, Senator.
You're not coming?
Oh, no, no, no.
The president wanted to keep this meeting top tier... just one and two.
Number five.
Didn't make the cut.
Let's not keep the leader of the free world waiting.
Senator Morton, are you familiar with the migratory pattern of the osprey?
Um, no, sir.
They winter in South America, then travel up to 5,000 miles to their North American breeding grounds.
They settle here to eat fish from the Potomac.
I saw a few my first year, but... not many since.
My grandchildren, well they may never see an osprey at all.
That's what scientists call shifting baseline syndrome.
Each generation accepts their version of nature, plunders it, then leaves the next generation to accept the depleted version, and so on.
Which brings me to us.
Now.
You.
Mr. President, I'm here about the telecom deal.
We'll get to that in a minute.
I know you're killing my climate deal to appease your donor.
Who is it again, uh,
Gration Technologies?
All due respect, sir, your sources don't know what they're talking about.
I'm his source, Chandler.
Your telecom merger is up for review in two weeks.
It, uh, rides the line on antitrust issues, on what's proper and not.
Shifting baseline syndrome.
It's everywhere these days.
Point is,
I can choose to become troubled by those issues.
Or not.
So do the right thing.
Don't screw up the climate deal that a majority of Americans support, including your constituents.
Or I will kick your ass.
Welcome to Washington, Senator.
I received your inducements, Madam Secretary.
All very generous.
But we cannot accept as long as your government endorses the American Lama.
And that's why I'm glad to report that Senator Morton had a change of heart.
We reaffirm our neutrality.
A government with conflicting opinions.
I will never understand democracy.
Well, you say "tomato,"
I say "let's ratify our climate deal."
Okay?
We'll resubmit the protocols with a new addendum for Indian solar funding.
Everybody's happy.
Planet saved.
Thank you.
There's just one more matter to settle.
Really?
Chinese Buddhist scholars have found the Dalai Lama's true reincarnation.
A two-year-old boy in Sichuan Province.
If you officially recognize him, we will gladly have the Standing Committee consider the protocols for ratification.
Ming, we-we support the PRC's right to recognize this boy as the next Lama.
Just as we support Tibet's right to recognize their own boy.
I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Disqualify the American Lama or recognize ours.
Otherwise, no deal.
Do you know the mountains that President Dalton and I had to move to put this deal back together?
All to do what's best for our children and grandchildren... oh, and the other seven billion people on the planet, too.
But...
And you are putting it all on the line, trying to strong-arm us into endorsing some toddler that you are using as a political pawn!
Do...
You know who the real toddler is, Ming?
You.
You're the real toddler.
You are.
Well, that happened.
Yes, it most certainly did.
Are you going to see the Bhuti family today?
In a few minutes, actually.
Uh, would you like us to try to talk them out of letting their child do the Lama tests?
No.
We are not putting our thumb on the scale.
Let's just hope the universe... gives us a break.
The Chinese officials said you will take away our citizenship if we let Gaden study as a monk.
Oh, no, the State Department would never do that.
They were just trying to intimidate you.
We heard the Chinese stopped the climate deal over of our son.
How do we know you won't try to pressure us in order
- to make your deal?
- Well, of course,
American government has policy concerns.
But it is not our place to try to influence you.
It is a difficult decision.
If your child was chosen to enlighten all people...
And to save your home...
Shouldn't you let him?
So you're actually considering giving up your child to be raised by monks?
Which is your choice.
But, effectively, you'd be choosing to abandon him.
You know that, right?
Excuse me.
You want to tell me what happened in there?
Abby wants full custody of Chloe and won't give me an inch.
It's gotten... pretty nasty.
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
You know, I went through something similar with my son, Roman.
Um...
His father and I weren't married.
And he wanted nothing to do with us, until Roman turned eight.
And then he asked for a relationship.
I think I resented the whole "prodigal father returning for the fun stuff"
after I'd done all the heavy lifting.
And I knew he didn't have money to take me to court, so...
I boxed him out.
And then one day, I was cleaning out Roman's backpack, and I found the announcement for the father-son camping trip at his school.
It was torn into pieces.
That's when I realized who was really going to be picking up the tab.
What's the status at the crash site?
Placed an anonymous call over an hour ago.
Highway Patrol should be there any minute.
With any luck they rule Wayne's death accidental.
We just have to make sure VFF gets the word and buys the story.
Yeah.
Okay.
Call me the minute you get a ping from Ian.
You all right?
No, not really.
You know, my asset.
How 'bout you?
Well, I just heard that the Lama's been hospitalized.
Likely the beginning of the end.
I'm sorry.
Well, I got to deal with how his passing is gonna affect the planet.
China's playing with global catastrophe, and no one knows yet whether Gaden Bhuti will pass the test and be the next Lama or not.
There's no way to influence the outcome?
You mean... by doing something brazenly unethical?
Are you okay?
Really?
You have a fever?
I just have been suggesting a lot of things that aren't me lately.
Well, I'm right here.
You know, sometimes those Lama tests can take years to initiate.
Great.
Then it won't matter whether he's the Lama or not, because the planet can't wait.
There's-there's no time.
Maybe you can't put your thumb on the scale.
How 'bout you put your foot on the gas?
Transition team to O.R. 3.
Ma'am.
Transition team to O.R. 3.
Ah, Elizabeth.
I brought you these.
Ah.
How very kind, Elizabeth.
If you want to say something, there's no better time than now.
I-I've been thinking about how, for Buddhists, clinging is the root of suffering.
Well, I understand that now, because I have been clinging to ensuring a future for our planet and its people.
This may even be my purpose.
That is a worthy purpose.
But the trouble is... our purposes are at odds.
If Gaden Bhuti is the Lama, Tibet has a leader.
But the Chinese will not ratify your climate deal.
And by 2050, 200 million people in your region will face losing their homes and lives from the melting Himalayan glacier.
And once gone, so will be the water supply to the Indian seat of your own government in exile.
But if
Gaden Bhuti is not the Lama...
If the tests take years, it won't matter.
What do you ask of me, Elizabeth?
Give my purpose fair footing.
Test the American child now.
We'll accept the results... then go from there.
Jay, what are you doing here?
You cannot ambush me like this.
Don't worry.
I come in peace.
So, I just spent the week watching Tibet and China fight over a two-year-old who may or may not be the reincarnation of the Bodhisattva of compassion.
I know.
I read about it.
It's crazy.
He's this avatar for everyone's hopes and fears, even mine.
I'm clinging to Chloe like she's the last mooring of the life I knew, the life that I... that I thought made sense to me.
You're a wonderful mother.
And I'm a present and loving dad when I'm around.
I'm gonna work on doing more of that.
But the main thing is, no matter what choices that we're making in our lives right now, she didn't choose it.
She deserves parents who respect each other and put her first, and I just...
I just want to focus on that.
So...
I'm saying yes to your agreement.
Chloe needs stability more than I need... anything.
But I hope we can keep talking about it, though.
Things can change.
I could get fired.
And then I'm coming after her with everything I've got.
Yeah, of course we can keep talking about it.
I want Chloe to think that her dad is the greatest.
So, the Dalai Lama's representatives are set to meet him today?
Uh, yeah, in an hour.
It's the final test.
And if they recognize their master in this little American boy?
Then we are out of moves.
You should have heard me wax poetic about the ospreys to Senator Morton.
Oh, I'm sure you were very eloquent, Conrad.
No one would tell me otherwise.
This job gives you an inflated sense of your own importance, so it can be sobering when the world just does what it wants, all your fine talk be damned.
I just got word.
The Dalai Lama passed away.
His attendants are preparing to take his body back to India.
I'm sorry to hear that.
He was a great man.
Maybe even something rarer.
He was a good man.
Do they still plan on testing the child?
Well, Tibet needs a spiritual and symbolic leader now more than ever.
I hate to root against a toddler here, but the Little Buddha'd be doing the world a favor if he shanked this test.
Hey.
They're taking Ian to the chapel.
News of O'Connell's death broke this morning.
Reaction's been mixed.
Any pronouncements from the Elders?
Soldiers of God, welcome.
We'll see.
Amen.
It's been a hard morning.
We lost Wayne, a brother in the struggle.
Suspicion abounded and fell in particular on the newcomer.
Brother Ryan, join me.
Uh-oh.
There's no way we can get him out now.
Brother Ryan reminds me of when Paul washed ashore in Malta.
When the local people found him, they thought, like we did, that he must be a murderer.
Why would God punish Paul with a snakebite after a shipwreck, if he didn't have it coming?
Now we hear Wayne drove off the road to his death.
But remember, my brothers, what comes next for Paul.
What comes next?
It's good news.
Scripture says,
"But after they had looked a great while and saw no harm come to him..."
"...they changed their minds and said that he was a god."
Now I'm not saying Brother Ryan is a god.
The Maltese are a fickle people.
But he has endured our judgment with patience.
We apologize.
Now... bless Brother Ryan as he takes Wayne's place on the Council of Elders and fulfills our purpose:
to bring a timely end to this decaying world!
Amen.
Amen!
He's alive, and he's a member of the Council now.
Not a bad day at the office.
Yeah, yeah.
Ma'am?
Geshe Tashi.
I am so sorry about your teacher's passing.
Thank you.
His legacy lives on in his reincarnation.
The search will continue.
So, Gaden Bhuti did not pass the test?
When Lama Dote, Lama Samten, and I met the child, we agreed: he is not our teacher.
I know His Holiness had a lot of faith in your discernment, so we wish Tibet luck in its search.
The path to the new Lama often has many turns.
Before I go, may I fulfill one of the Lama's last wishes?
Can we go to the mandala?
Of course.
Yes.
Shall I ask Blake to call Minister Chen?
In a minute.
For now, will you please gather the staff?
So, where will you search next?
There is a girl in Nepal.
Or perhaps there will be no Lama.
I would find that kind of ambiguity hard to accept.
As you noted in the hospital, clinging to anything, including a vision or a political stance, is a recipe for suffering.
The Chinese exiled the Lama, but this introduced him and Tibetan culture to the world.
Whether or not autonomy comes,
Tibet lives in the hearts of many, and, so, can never die.
Perhaps in this way, the Lama did achieve his purpose.
Now other purposes can flourish, perhaps not ones beneficial only to Tibetans, but to all mankind.
Thank you.

-I-I cannot answer that question, which is, which is technical and legal.
BRANDS:
Al Haig, Reagan's secretary of state, who'swatchingthis from the Situation Room, thought that the president's spokesman was not doing a good job, and so he literally ran from the Situation Room to the briefing room and grabbed the microphone and said...
First, uh, as you know, we are in close touch with the vice president, who is returning to Washington.
REPORTER:
Who's making the decisions for the government right now?
Who's making the decisions?
Constitutionally, gentlemen, you have the president, the vice president and the secretary of state in that order.
And should the president decide he wants to transfer the helm to the vice president, he will do so.

The trouble is,
SecretaryHaig has made a mistake.

Becausehere'sthisguy who 's flushed and out of breath, and saying "I'm in charge," and in fact he's wrong.
It made very clear that, well, nobody was in charge.
He misstated the line of presidential succession.

Reagan was amazing in the way he was able to rebound from, youknow,beingnearlykilled when he was shot.
NARRATOR:
During the entire incident,
Reaganneverofficially transfers power, butthe25thAmendment does provide a way totemporarilyhandoff power witha simpleletter to Congress.
HUGHES:
So if we have a president who's going to be temporarilyincapacitated, the president would voluntarily give up power, and then once they're in their right mind, they're back on their feet, they again give written permission
to have that power back.
NARRATOR:
The clause was most recently invoked byGeorgeW. Bush.
I'm gonna be sedated for a period of time and will, uh, transfer power to the vice president during that time.
NARRATOR:
Twice while in office,
Bushsignsoverpower to his VP,

Bothtimeswerebecause of a colonoscopy.
Asa result, Cheney now holds the record forwhatis ,in effect, theshortestpresidency in history, atotalof fourhours.

One of the cross-complainants is from an Iraqi Christian family the Church sponsored to come over here.
The Church bailed him out on orders of the archbishop.
Which is his right, maybe even his duty.
Maybe so.
The other complainant is a Muslim doctor from Sudan.
His family's in a refugee camp.
They're both here illegally, both charged with felonies, which puts them on a list.

I picked it up.
But I am not gonna take the fall for one of you guys.
What are you suggesting?
I'm not suggesting.
I'm telling.
When I signed the drugs out for a pretrial hearing, they stayed in the property safe here, in this damn office.
So instead of pointing the finger, you best get your own house in order.
Eti lyido smeshny.
What'd he say?
He's being critical.
Of what?
Of your country.
He's saying women are smarter than the men, and stronger, too.
Can't argue with that.
What'd he say now?
He want to know if you're sleeping with your partner.
That's funny.
Do you sleep with your partner?
Hey, we don't do that around here, okay?
We're working.
If you say so.
Zda-ró-vye.
All right, all right, enough already.
Look, this Rambo guy's running around, and you two are sitting here getting drunk.
We're working as well, right now.
BAEZ:
How about you tell us what's really going on with this Rambo guy?
You obviously had some kind of tip he was gonna pop his cork.
Okay, lady.
Politsiya politsiy.
"Police is police."
We had information he was upset.
About what?
He call Moscow and tell 'em that he was displeased.
Yeah, we know about that already.
Got called back for an assignment, but he didn't want to go without his girl.
We have information, too, okay?
But we're trying to string the pieces together here, fill in the blanks.
Excuse me, pretty lady.
Where's he going?
He's going to bathroom, even though I tell him to keep it.
All right, look, there's a killer running around, and you guys aren't telling us anything.
Maybe because we need to trust you first.
Fine.
Down the hatch.
Everybody down!
Stay down!
Police!
Watch it!
Vronsky!
Hands up.
Hands up!
Turn around.
On byl zdes'.
Reagan, Baez!
He was here.
Rambo was here?
Yeah.
And he got away again?
You see anyone?
Huh?
Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?
He say he don't know, but he knows.
I didn't start this, Frank.
One of them started it.
The Muslim, according to the Christian.
Well, you brought it into our world when you bailed the guy out.
First things first.
This is the first thing.
Not from where I sit.
Have you looked into the matter of Officer Macklin?
It's John Macklin now.
He left the department eight months ago.
Once a Catholic, once a cop, same thing.
It's complicated.
I'm looking into it.
Well, look faster, please.
The poor man is barely hanging on.
I would like to help, if I'm able.
You're able.
Just as you are able to ask your Christian to withdraw his complaint.
Ah... huh.
Please.
That would be wrong.
No, it would be pragmatic, and it would go a long way to putting out a fire that you poured gas on.
What if Mr. Asad won't withdraw his complaint?
Oh, I think he'll consider it.
You think?
You mean you know.
I'm confident if Mr. Khoury will, he will.
I can't.
Why not?
He looks at it as standing up for all his people.
It was a fight over cutting in line in a bagel shop, Kevin.
It would be the wrong way out, Frank.
It would be an abuse of my influence.
I'd be using the power of the faith to...
You had a hand in starting this, you have a responsibility to finish it.
I have a lot of responsibilities.
High on that list is defending the flock.
Your Eminence.
Yes, we're late.
I'll tell you what.
You get Officer Macklin's health claim put through, and also see that he gets promoted to Detective First Grade so his family can receive the pay and benefits that go along with it, then we can revisit this conversation.
You're doubling down.
I'm defending the flock.
May God bless you and keep you safe.
Thank you, Your Eminence.
Thanks for coming in, Gary.
Oh, I'm happy for the excuse to stop by and see old friends.
So, what's up?
Just following up on an issue from a case I inherited when you left the office.
Tommy Hickman?
Right.
Of course.
I thought that trial was just beginning.
It is, but we've hit a roadblock.
Evidence had been tampered with.
Are you kidding?
Someone substituted sugar for the drugs that we wanted to present at the trial.
You think Hickman got to someone in the property clerk's office?
We're talking to everyone that would have handled that evidence.
Of course, I'll get you a list of every investigator I worked with.
Well, we've spoken to all of them.
Hey, Anthony, what's going on?
Gary, uh, we've been hearing some stories about why you really left the office.
You know why I left the office, Erin.
We talked about it.
It was a tough time in my marriage.
And there are other rumors about why your marriage was in trouble.
Rumors are just rumors.
Gary, we have to ask you, did you have a substance abuse problem?
I don't see why I have to answer that,
I-I don't work here anymore.
Oh, come on, Gary.
You wouldn't take that from a skel.
Why should we take it from you?
I'm not some skel, Anthony.
I was a prosecutor at this office for ten years.
And, if I had a problem, it's over.
I'm remarried, we just had a baby.
ABETEMARCO:
Gary, you know how this looks?
Those drugs were kept in a safe in your personal office, while you were preparing for hearing.
Don't go there, you guys.
Tell me, did you steal them for your own use?
Oh, my God, how can you even ask me that?
We have to, we started trial.
Do you know what's the first thing I teach my students?
Never ask a question if you can't handle the answer.
Yeah, you also taught me, if you have an inconvenient fact, you need to get in front of it.
So you need to come clean, Gary, right now.
No, you don't.
I'm warning you.
Not just as a former colleague, but as a friend, if you start spreading dirt, it won't just get on me.
What are you talking about?
I successfully prosecuted 30 or 40 drug cases while at this office.
If you smear me, all those criminals could go free.
Is it worth it to you, just to go after that piddly little courier?
Come on, Gary, that's no kind of choice.
Let's end this conversation right now or I promise you, we'll all rue the day.
Nyet.
Mne ne nuzhny narkotiki.
Well, madam, he say he don't need any of your pain drugs.
It's American weakness.
Yeah.
Let's talk outside.
Give us a second.
Why the hell didn't you tell us you had a tip Rambo would be in the restaurant?
Classified information.
Classified my ass, we could've had the place surrounded.
Rambo wouldn't have got away again, and the witnesses would be talking to us.
We cannot share our sources with Americans.
Do you tell us everything that you know?
If one more person gets killed because you're not telling us what you know, we're gonna have a serious problem.
And I don't mean a Russian-America problem,
I mean a me and you personal problem!
Okay, Reagan, relax.
Sergei, Rambo, he went to Chechnya.
And he was involved in, uh, what we call,
"acts of extreme subjugation"
with terrorists and their families.
He come back not the same.
Meaning he snapped.
When Moscow called him back, he said he changed sides.
"Changed sides"?
Meaning he became a terrorist?
And now he's running around my city, and you don't think that's something that you should share with me?
In all probability, he's just looking for a means to escape to another country.
In all probability, he could planning his next attack right now.
That is true, he's terrorist.
We're gonna start working together before we end up facing a wholesale slaughter, you got it?
Maybe, but it is still essential to control the flow of information.
No "maybe."
My city, my country, my way.
We work together.
It's okay.
So, this is the safe where the drugs were being held before the hearing?
Yeah, only a handful of people had the combination, and Gary was one of them.
And nobody in the office knew what he was up to?
No, he was being smart about it, like addicts can be.
He knew the drugs had already been subjected to a lab analysis, so he substituted sugar every time he used so the weight and color looked the same.
And because he thought we'd never get to trial, he'd never get found out.
He says he's clean.
I think I believe him.
Well, good for him.
Meanwhile, he's left us with a big fat problem with the Hickman case.
Have we tried to do a quick and dirty plea deal?
It'd be sticky.
Sticky's what we do here.
Hickman's lawyer already senses we have a major problem.
The only deal he's gonna consider is no jail time for his client.
Erin, I don't like cutting Hickman that big of a break either, but we need to handle this as quickly and as quietly as possible.
I know, but it's too late.
The case is too high profile, and even if we make a deal, there's no guarantee that Hickman's gonna keep his mouth shut.
If it comes out that Gary tampered with evidence, every case he was involved in will be reopened.
Gary's going to prison.
And he's a friend, and a mentor to both of us.
I...
I have to say, Monica, I don't...
I know.
There are no good options.
I'm sorry, I still don't understand.
My English is not so good.
Funny, considering you went to high school in Coney Island.
Why don't you cut the crap, all right?
We know you helped Rambo get away from the crime scene.
So lose the accent and tell us where the hell he is.
If you know about his nickname, why do you think I'd help you get him?
What?
I have idea.
Great.
I'm thinking I should speak to him alone.
Do you have room with a window, no bars?
So you can hang him out the window by his ankles, is that what you're talking about?
There would be more honesty in conversation.
No, we don't do things like that around here.
My clearance rate is almost 100%.
What is yours?
Look, we make cases the right way so they stand up, you understand?
Okay.
How do you say, um... it is your funeral.
Thought we were gonna work together here.
American, you thought it would happen right away?
Okay.
Where were we?
Will you please tell the detective what you just told me?
Tell me what?
Promise you won't say I talked.
To who?
Right?
Fine.
Rambo said he just needed to go some place where he could chill and clear his system without being tracked.
What does he mean clear his system?
He's really not a guy you want to ask a lot of questions.
Clear his system?
Clear his system, you hear...?
Hey!
Hey, you see where the dumb looking Russian guy went?
How did you know he was headed back to the same restaurant?
I didn't.
It's a GPS I put on his car before.
Like the other Reagan said, trust, but verify.
What do you think he's doing here?
Don't know.
He must think we miss him.
Let's find out.
Huh?
Please.
Your presence is unhelpful and unnecessary.
Duly noted.
Where's Rambo?
I'm trying to find out, but now you're getting in the way.
Oh, we're getting in the way?
How about we lock you two up for obstructing, huh?
We'll put you in a nice small room with bars on the windows.
Okay, okay, we'll do it together.
Police is police.
Right?
Wrong.
Pokazhi mne.
What, he's in the freezer?
What'd she say?
It's passageway.
She wants you to go first.
Step aside.
Go.
5-4, detectives requesting a 10-85 forthwith at... where the hell are we anyway?
Behind the restaurant, lady.
Russian bathhouse adjacent to our previous location.
Why would Rambo come here?
LEVIN:
Clear his system, steal clothes, I.D., get a massage.
Hey, kid, hey.
You seen him?
For sure, he is here.
Reagan, once he knows he's in a corner, he gonna be much more dangerous.
BAEZ:
Should wait for emergency service.
We don't have time.
Oh, son of a bitch.
We got two in here.
10-13, two dead at the scene.
An active shooter in the building.
Where'd he go?
What'd she say, Levin?
Levin!
Where the hell did he go?
Move, get out of the way!
Police!
Police, move!
MAN:
Back there.
Back there.
Get out of the way.
Move, move!
Move it!
Which way, which way?
!
There, there!
Turn it off.
Hey.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm hit.
He's in here.
Sergei Karenin!
Police!
Sergei?
Reagan, what are you waiting for?
Shut up!
Don't be a girl!
Shut up!
Reagan?
I got him.
KGB, my ass.
Everything you wanted.
That hardly ever happens.
Including his promotion to detective with all its benefits.
What about the benefits from the World Trade Center's Health Program or the Victim's Comp Fund?
I don't control those.
But your word has weight.
You know, he had some good years on the job, and some less good ones.
What's that a code for?
Smoked and drank for decades before he got sick.
But he also worked on the pile before he got sick.
It would be pushing it to attribute his illness strictly to working on the pile.
So you're denying him?
No, I am pushing it through.
But I thought you should know... it's a favor.
Well, then, thank you, Frank.
Or it will be when I sign them.
Which, I take it, you have not yet done.
You know, I thought we should go out together and visit Macklin and his family, make a private little ceremony of it.
Oh, that's a nice idea.
Right after you pick up that phone and call your legal eagle, Mr. Sloane, and tell him to post bail for the other guy.
I'm the archbishop of New York, Frank,
I'm not a bail bondsman.
You put your thumb on the scale, now it's time to take it off.
You forcing my hand?
I've been ducking calls from Immigration and Customs and the State Department.
I don't like ducking calls, makes me feel all sweaty.
You'd really withhold benefits from this officer's family?
Hey, it was a coin toss whether he qualifies, so, I flipped the coin till it came up heads.
Like I said, as a favor to you.
But your part is private, quiet.
What you're offering in return would be public and controversial.
You chose the playing field, not me.
Uh...
I don't like this, Frank.
More to the point, I don't like you in this.
Me, either.
I'm just gonna have to live with that.
Not much choice.
I don't have all day, Your Eminence.
Do we have a deal?
Uh, can you find me Mr. Sloane, please?
ERIN:
Were you aware that quantities of heroin were removed and replaced with sugar?
Well, I became aware when you brought it to my attention, recently.
Did you take some of the drugs and replace it with sugar?
On the advice of counsel, I'm going to invoke my Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
Isn't it true that during this time, you were addicted to painkillers because of a back injury?
On the advice of counsel...
Did you transition from using painkillers to using heroin?
Again, on the advice of counsel...
Counsel, approach.
Ms. Reagan, we can spare everyone a lot of agony here by granting this witness immunity to get his full testimony in this hearing.
In what world is that fair to my client?
A prosecutor who is stealing drugs gets immunity while the regular citizen gets prison.
Ms. Reagan?
No immunity.
I'd like to continue.
Then have at it.
Mr. Falk, you were an officer of the court who swore to uphold the law, didn't you?
I did.
Did you betray that oath?
On the advice of counsel,
I invoke my...
Did you betray your friends?
No!
Your colleagues?
No!
Did you betray that oath you took?
That wasn't my intention.
But that's what happened, isn't it?
Mr. Falk?
Do you wish to invoke your Fifth Amendment again?
No, Your Honor.
I'm prepared to answer Ms. Reagan's question.
Did you betray your duty to uphold the law?
Yes.
And for that...
I am profoundly sorry.
More than you or anyone else can possibly know.
And finally, Mr. Falk, did you ever tamper with evidence in order to convict someone that was innocent?
No, Ms. Reagan.
I never planted evidence.
Every case I brought was legitimate, including the one against Mr. Hickman.
If... if I have to go to prison... like the people I've prosecuted... so be it.
At least my conscious is clear now.
DANNY:
You know, the doctors wanted both of you guys to stay here for continued observation.
This is not necessary.
LEVIN:
Moscow doctors, best in the world.
If you'd both been a little more upfront, neither of you would be going home with gunshot wounds.
Oh, please.
These are marks of honor.
Souvenirs from New York.
Oh, and to think, we were gonna stop and get you NYPD coffee mugs.
I've already took one from your desk.
Ha!
Just kidding.
If you ever come to Moscow, please let me know.
I will love to take you to Bolshoi.
So, what is this?
Potatoes au gratin.
Or French for "cheesy deliciousness."
And that's French for
"straight to your butt."
Exactly.
Made with Dubliner Irish cheddar, with an eye to the old sod.
It's the 101st anniversary of the Rising.
The what?
The Easter Rising?
Mm.
They don't teach that in school anymore, Jack.
DANNY:
They don't even give out books in school anymore.
It was the Irish, our ancestors, fighting for their independence in 1916.
And some of the family who didn't make it over here got caught up in that.
We had family who fought over there?
Mm-hmm.
As soldiers?
They weren't exactly soldiers.
They were fighting to get their country back from the British, and they called themselves "rebels."
And you know what the British called those rebels?
Micks?
Excuse me?
Terrorists.
Seriously?
ERIN:
Mm-hmm.
Bet you didn't think that term existed 100 years ago.
Actually, I didn't think it did.
So why were they called terrorists?
Because, by definition, they were.
Well, why not call them "guerillas"?
Isn't it the same thing?
JAMIE:
Well, guerilla's actually Spanish for "little war."
Their tactics are alike, but the big difference is that a terrorist will target civilians for political ends.
So, we are descended from terrorists.
Whoa...
Come on, that's a very college way of putting it.
Not terrorists the way they use the term now.
I know.
DANNY:
Right.
We have relatives who were freedom fighters, okay?
Let's just leave it at that.
Amen.
Here, here.
And one other thing:
Hardly anybody who's here is really from here.
I guess you could say we're all foreigners.
Yeah, and usually they're fleeing some kind of grief in their own country.
Some things never change.
JAMIE:
We're not perfect, but no one's come up with a version 2.0 that's better, so...
So who gets to say that they're really, truly from here?
Munsees, Algonquins, Iroquois, and a whole bunch of other tribes whose names I've forgotten, they can.
Everyone else... is an immigrant.
Here's to all us great unwashed.
Here, here.
DANNY:
Drink to that.
Bottoms up.
Here, here.
Cheers.
FRANK:

I forget where things stand with us at the, uh, favor bank.
Oh, give me a break.
You got the best institutional memory in this city.
The name John Macklin mean anything to you?
Not offhand.
He was an altar boy in my first parish.
And then, worked at the 5-7 in the Bronx.
And I have been summoned here to talk about him because...?
He's got stage 4 cancer of the trachea in the esophagus.
The doctors told him he's only got less than a month.
He'll leave behind a wife and four boys.
I'll make time to go see him.
The family feels that he got the disease working on the pile after 9/11.
What's the doctor say?
(scoffs) You know how they are.
Claim's gotten caught up in red tape.
And you think the police commissioner can untangle it and get this classified as a line of duty death.
I hope so.
You do know I get a lot of requests like this.
But not from me.
Point taken.
I'm just asking you to give it a look, see what can be done to help.

Both of them are likely.
She's not doing so good, either, but the EMTs think she'll probably survive.

Three separate reviews of Officer Macklin's claim are the same degree of muddy.
About working the pile?
No.
He worked most days for a good three weeks.
Then, what's muddy?
He drank like a fish, smoked like a chimney.
Okay.
Well...
Well what?
As far as I'm concerned, if you worked that pile and got sick, you and your family should be taken care of, end of story.
(scoffs) You're not an insurance claims adjuster.
For which, I thank God every day.
See that arms get twisted.
Yes, sir.
(tosses notepad)
There's something else.
We've got a problem off a brawl in a bagel shop.
The Archdiocese of New York got involved.
Catholic Church, fight in a bagel shop?
This is a joke, right?
I wish.
One of the cross-complainants is from an Iraqi Christian family the Church sponsored to come over here.
The Church bailed him out on orders of the archbishop.
Which is his right, maybe even his duty.
Maybe so.
The other complainant is a Muslim doctor from Sudan.
(sighs) His family's in a refugee camp.
They're both here illegally, both charged with felonies, which puts them on a list.
Hey, not our problem.
Frank, you met with the archbishop.
Not about this.
The spin is that you and the archbishop teamed up to let the Christian go free.
He didn't go free!
He made bail.
I don't set bail.
I'm not a judge.
It's not our problem.
The mayor's very proud of our status as a sanctuary city.
He feels this dents that.
Oh, please.
If the mayor wants to post bail for the Muslim detainee, let him have at it.
But I am the police commissioner of New York City, not sanctuary city.
We both knew this issue would land on our desks sooner or later.
It didn't just land.
It was placed, by the mayor.
Get it off.
Off what?
Off my desk.
How?
I don't care how.
Sure you do.
Start with City Hall, see if they got a sanctuary city rug they can sweep it under.

Come on, what do you mean you don't see nothing?
I mean, three people shot right out in front of your place, you didn't see any of it?

I don't know, but, Danny, there's two detectives from Moscow on their way here to help with the investigation.
Wait, what?

Well, is it possible it's just another clerical mistake?
No way.
It's the correct weight for the drugs.
Somebody deliberately substituted brown sugar for the heroin so we wouldn't notice the difference until the ants got in.
Anthony, I don't even know how many people put their hands on the evidence before we inherited this case.
Do we even have a paper trail?
We're putting together a list now.
It's a lot of people.
Okay, so Hickman was providing drugs to a half dozen Wall Street firms.
Is it possible that someone is paying big money to derail this case?
Anything is possible, including a mistrial.
Erin, if this gets out...
No, I know, we've got to keep this on the DL for now.
But, Anthony, there's another crime here, and someone on our end is involved with it.
You know what this is about, right?
A Christian and a Muslim walk into a bagel store?
The P.C.'s hands are tied.
He can't just tell the D.A. to release the other guy.
We didn't suggest that.
You suggested our department's turning a blind eye.
Trying to and failing.
It's not our bailiwick.
Until the P.C.'s good friend, the archbishop, weighed in.
Reagan doesn't dictate to the archdiocese.
Oh, he has his ear, though.
Well, he certainly didn't in this matter.
What are you looking for here, Garrett?
Cooperation, some ratcheting down of the rhetoric.
You guys are a broken record when it comes to trashing One PP lately.
You are barking up the wrong tree on this.
Being a sanctuary city is high on the mayor's list of priorities.
You mean it's high on the list of what the mayor loves to see when he's looking in the mirror.
Look, we didn't open this can of worms, that archbishop did.
What are you saying, I should counsel the P.C.
to lean on the archbishop?
Couldn't have said it better myself.
You know, it's this kind of politicizing that doesn't help anyone.
Maybe just once, you could stand up for something other than saving your own hide.
Are you coming to poker on Sunday?
I got a family thing.
I'll be half an hour late.
Intel says these Russian detectives are almost here.
They are.
In fact, their I.D. pictures just came through.
You ready?
Yeah.
DANNY:
Wow.
That could be the new Mr. Maria Baez.
Shut up.
I'm just saying.
Let's take a look at bachelor number two.
Mr. December, from the KGB pinup calendar.
(laughs):
No.
Putin taught him that smile personally.
(in Russian accent):
You Reagan and Baez?
(clicks keyboard)
You know, they're not supposed to let you up here from the front desk without an escort.
We expedited procedure.
I'm Levin, this is Vronsky.
BAEZ:
Good to meet you.
How was your flight?
Long, boring.
Ran out of vodka over Atlantic.
Uh... thank you.
(tosses file) Now that we got the pleasantries out of the way, how is it that you guys were on your way over here before this Rambo even went crazy and started shooting people?
First we eat, then we discuss case.
(chuckles) You want to go somewhere and have dinner?
That would be better.
On the flight, they only had peanuts and dry pretzels.
DANNY:
Excuse me, there are two people dead and one's in intensive care, so we don't give a damn how hungry you are, we're in a hurry to find this guy.
We will eat, then we will drink, and then, we will find him.
Okay.
Let's get one thing straight, okay?
You're in our country now, which means we're driving this thing and you're just along for the ride.
I don't think so, my friend.
We have crucial information to catch this man.
Great, we'd love for you to share it with us.
Please.
You cannot find him without our assistance.
And we are very hungry.
Okay, we'll eat.
Just don't expect us to pick up the tab.
Thanks for coming in on short notice, Mickey.
Sure, buddy.
Just a little confused.
Thought the Hickman trial was starting.
It is, but we ran into a problem.
This is you vouchering for the drug evidence.
Is that correct?
MICKEY:
Yeah.
I was one of the original investigators.
What's going on?
Well, half the drugs are missing now, Mickey.
Somebody pulled a switch.
What, you think it was me, my brother?
You just put yourself at the scene.
Oh, so the Puerto Rican dude must have stole the heroin.
Either sold it on the street, maybe did it himself?
This is your chance to tell it your way.
No.
Look, lady, you can drug test me right now.
Strap a polygraph on me.
I've got nothing to hide.
You have a better explanation?
Look, I know I'm just a street guy, but I followed procedure.
I made the collar, I vouchered the evidence, and when somebody in this office needed it,
I picked it up.
But I am not gonna take the fall for one of you guys.
What are you suggesting?
I'm not suggesting.
I'm telling.
When I signed the drugs out for a pretrial hearing, they stayed in the property safe here, in this damn office.
So instead of pointing the finger, you best get your own house in order.
(Russian music playing)
Eti lyido smeshny.
What'd he say?
He's being critical.
Of what?
Of your country.
He's saying women are smarter than the men, and stronger, too.
Can't argue with that.
(whispers in Russian)
What'd he say now?
He want to know if you're sleeping with your partner.
DANNY:
That's funny.
Do you sleep with your partner?
Hey, we don't do that around here, okay?
We're working.
If you say so.
Zda-ró-vye.
All right, all right, enough already.
Look, this Rambo guy's running around, and you two are sitting here getting drunk.
We're working as well, right now.
BAEZ:
How about you tell us what's really going on with this Rambo guy?
You obviously had some kind of tip he was gonna pop his cork.
LEVIN:
Okay, lady.
(vodka pours)
Politsiya politsiy.
"Police is police."
We had information he was upset.
About what?
He call Moscow and tell 'em that he was displeased.
Yeah, we know about that already.
Got called back for an assignment, but he didn't want to go without his girl.
We have information, too, okay?
But we're trying to string the pieces together here, fill in the blanks.
Excuse me, pretty lady.
(sniffs)
Where's he going?
LEVIN:
He's going to bathroom, even though I tell him to keep it.
All right, look, there's a killer running around, and you guys aren't telling us anything.
Maybe because we need to trust you first.
Fine.
Down the hatch.
(gunshots)
(screaming)
Everybody down!
Stay down!
Police!
Watch it!
LEVIN:
Vronsky!
Hands up.
Hands up!
Turn around.
On byl zdes'.
Reagan, Baez!
He was here.
Rambo was here?
Yeah.
And he got away again?
You see anyone?
Huh?
Where'd he go?
(speaks Russian) Where'd he go?
He say he don't know, but he knows.
(handcuffs rattle)
I didn't start this, Frank.
One of them started it.
The Muslim, according to the Christian.
Well, you brought it into our world when you bailed the guy out.
First things first.
This is the first thing.
Not from where I sit.
Have you looked into the matter of Officer Macklin?
It's John Macklin now.
He left the department eight months ago.
Once a Catholic, once a cop, same thing.
It's complicated.
I'm looking into it.
Well, look faster, please.
The poor man is barely hanging on.
I would like to help, if I'm able.
You're able.
Just as you are able to ask your Christian to withdraw his complaint.
Ah... huh.
Please.
That would be wrong.
No, it would be pragmatic, and it would go a long way to putting out a fire that you poured gas on.
What if Mr. Asad won't withdraw his complaint?
Oh, I think he'll consider it.
You think?
You mean you know.
I'm confident if Mr. Khoury will, he will.
I can't.
Why not?
He looks at it as standing up for all his people.
It was a fight over cutting in line in a bagel shop, Kevin.
It would be the wrong way out, Frank.
It would be an abuse of my influence.
I'd be using the power of the faith to...
You had a hand in starting this, you have a responsibility to finish it.
I have a lot of responsibilities.
High on that list is defending the flock.
(knock on door)
Your Eminence.
Yes, we're late.
I'll tell you what.
You get Officer Macklin's health claim put through, and also see that he gets promoted to Detective First Grade so his family can receive the pay and benefits that go along with it, then we can revisit this conversation.
You're doubling down.
I'm defending the flock.
May God bless you and keep you safe.
Thank you, Your Eminence.
(sighs)
ERIN:
Thanks for coming in, Gary.
Oh, I'm happy for the excuse to stop by and see old friends.
So, what's up?
Just following up on an issue from a case I inherited when you left the office.
Tommy Hickman?
Right.
Of course.
I thought that trial was just beginning.
It is, but we've hit a roadblock.
Evidence had been tampered with.
Are you kidding?
Someone substituted sugar for the drugs that we wanted to present at the trial.
You think Hickman got to someone in the property clerk's office?
We're talking to everyone that would have handled that evidence.
GARY:
Of course, I'll get you a list of every investigator I worked with.
Well, we've spoken to all of them.
Hey, Anthony, what's going on?
(door closes)
Gary, uh, we've been hearing some stories about why you really left the office.
You know why I left the office, Erin.
We talked about it.
It was a tough time in my marriage.
And there are other rumors about why your marriage was in trouble.
Rumors are just rumors.
Gary, we have to ask you, did you have a substance abuse problem?
(scoffs) I don't see why I have to answer that,
I-I don't work here anymore.
Oh, come on, Gary.
You wouldn't take that from a skel.
Why should we take it from you?
I'm not some skel, Anthony.
I was a prosecutor at this office for ten years.
And, if I had a problem, it's over.
I'm remarried, we just had a baby.
ABETEMARCO:
Gary, you know how this looks?
Those drugs were kept in a safe in your personal office, while you were preparing for hearing.
Don't go there, you guys.
Tell me, did you steal them for your own use?
Oh, my God, how can you even ask me that?
We have to, we started trial.
Do you know what's the first thing I teach my students?
Never ask a question if you can't handle the answer.
Yeah, you also taught me, if you have an inconvenient fact, you need to get in front of it.
So you need to come clean, Gary, right now.
No, you don't.
I'm warning you.
Not just as a former colleague, but as a friend, if you start spreading dirt, it won't just get on me.
What are you talking about?
I successfully prosecuted 30 or 40 drug cases while at this office.
If you smear me, all those criminals could go free.
Is it worth it to you, just to go after that piddly little courier?
Come on, Gary, that's no kind of choice.
Let's end this conversation right now or I promise you, we'll all rue the day.
(door opens)
VRONSKY:
Nyet.
Mne ne nuzhny narkotiki.
LEVIN:
Well, madam, he say he don't need any of your pain drugs.
It's American weakness.
Yeah.
Let's talk outside.
Give us a second.
Why the hell didn't you tell us you had a tip Rambo would be in the restaurant?
Classified information.
Classified my ass, we could've had the place surrounded.
Rambo wouldn't have got away again, and the witnesses would be talking to us.
We cannot share our sources with Americans.
Do you tell us everything that you know?
If one more person gets killed because you're not telling us what you know, we're gonna have a serious problem.
And I don't mean a Russian-America problem,
I mean a me and you personal problem!
Okay, Reagan, relax.
Sergei, Rambo, he went to Chechnya.
And he was involved in, uh, what we call,
"acts of extreme subjugation"
with terrorists and their families.
He come back not the same.
Meaning he snapped.
When Moscow called him back, he said he changed sides.
"Changed sides"?
Meaning he became a terrorist?
And now he's running around my city, and you don't think that's something that you should share with me?
In all probability, he's just looking for a means to escape to another country.
In all probability, he could planning his next attack right now.
That is true, he's terrorist.
We're gonna start working together before we end up facing a wholesale slaughter, you got it?
Maybe, but it is still essential to control the flow of information.
No "maybe."
My city, my country, my way.
We work together.
(speaks Russian)
It's okay.
So, this is the safe where the drugs were being held before the hearing?
Yeah, only a handful of people had the combination, and Gary was one of them.
And nobody in the office knew what he was up to?
No, he was being smart about it, like addicts can be.
He knew the drugs had already been subjected to a lab analysis, so he substituted sugar every time he used so the weight and color looked the same.
And because he thought we'd never get to trial, he'd never get found out.
He says he's clean.
I think I believe him.
Well, good for him.
Meanwhile, he's left us with a big fat problem with the Hickman case.
Have we tried to do a quick and dirty plea deal?
It'd be sticky.
Sticky's what we do here.
Hickman's lawyer already senses we have a major problem.
The only deal he's gonna consider is no jail time for his client.
Erin, I don't like cutting Hickman that big of a break either, but we need to handle this as quickly and as quietly as possible.
I know, but it's too late.
The case is too high profile, and even if we make a deal, there's no guarantee that Hickman's gonna keep his mouth shut.
If it comes out that Gary tampered with evidence, every case he was involved in will be reopened.
Gary's going to prison.
And he's a friend, and a mentor to both of us.
I...
I have to say, Monica, I don't...
I know.
There are no good options.
(in Russian accent):
I'm sorry, I still don't understand.
My English is not so good.
Funny, considering you went to high school in Coney Island.
Why don't you cut the crap, all right?
We know you helped Rambo get away from the crime scene.
So lose the accent and tell us where the hell he is.
(tapping on glass)
(without accent):
If you know about his nickname, why do you think I'd help you get him?
(sighs)
What?
I have idea.
Great.
I'm thinking I should speak to him alone.
Do you have room with a window, no bars?
So you can hang him out the window by his ankles, is that what you're talking about?
There would be more honesty in conversation.
No, we don't do things like that around here.
My clearance rate is almost 100%.
What is yours?
Look, we make cases the right way so they stand up, you understand?
Okay.
How do you say, um... it is your funeral.
(sighs)
Thought we were gonna work together here.
American, you thought it would happen right away?
(sighs)
Okay.
Where were we?
Will you please tell the detective what you just told me?
Tell me what?
Promise you won't say I talked.
To who?
Right?
Fine.
Rambo said he just needed to go some place where he could chill and clear his system without being tracked.
What does he mean clear his system?
He's really not a guy you want to ask a lot of questions.
Clear his system?
Clear his system, you hear...?
Hey!
Hey, you see where the dumb looking Russian guy went?
(scoffs)
BAEZ:
How did you know he was headed back to the same restaurant?
I didn't.
It's a GPS I put on his car before.
Like the other Reagan said, trust, but verify.
(sighs)
What do you think he's doing here?
Don't know.
He must think we miss him.
Let's find out.
(speaking Russian)
Huh?
(speaks Russian)
Please.
Your presence is unhelpful and unnecessary.
(chuckles) Duly noted.
Where's Rambo?
I'm trying to find out, but now you're getting in the way.
Oh, we're getting in the way?
How about we lock you two up for obstructing, huh?
We'll put you in a nice small room with bars on the windows.
Okay, okay, we'll do it together.
Police is police.
Right?
Wrong.
Pokazhi mne.
What, he's in the freezer?
(speaking Russian)
What'd she say?
It's passageway.
She wants you to go first.
(sighs) Step aside.
Go.
(clears throat)
5-4, detectives requesting a 10-85 forthwith at... where the hell are we anyway?
Behind the restaurant, lady.
(men laughing)
Russian bathhouse adjacent to our previous location.
Why would Rambo come here?
LEVIN:
Clear his system, steal clothes, I.D., get a massage.
Hey, kid, hey.
You seen him?
(Levin yells in Russian)
LEVIN:
For sure, he is here.
Reagan, once he knows he's in a corner, he gonna be much more dangerous.
BAEZ:
Should wait for emergency service.
We don't have time.
Oh, son of a bitch.
We got two in here.
10-13, two dead at the scene.
An active shooter in the building.
Where'd he go?
(yells in Russian)
What'd she say, Levin?
Levin!
Where the hell did he go?
(gunshots)
(women screaming)
(gunshots) Move, get out of the way!
Police!
(screaming continues)
Police, move!
MAN:
Back there.
Back there.
Get out of the way.
Move, move!
(women screaming) Move it!
Which way, which way?
!
MAN:
There, there!
(steam hissing)
(whispers):
Turn it off.
(steam hisses)
DANNY:
Hey.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm hit.
He's in here.
Sergei Karenin!
Police!
(coughs)
Sergei?
Reagan, what are you waiting for?
Shut up!
Don't be a girl!
Shut up!
BAEZ:
Reagan?
I got him.
KGB, my ass.
Everything you wanted.
That hardly ever happens.
Including his promotion to detective with all its benefits.
What about the benefits from the World Trade Center's Health Program or the Victim's Comp Fund?
I don't control those.
But your word has weight.
You know, he had some good years on the job, and some less good ones.
What's that a code for?
Smoked and drank for decades before he got sick.
But he also worked on the pile before he got sick.
It would be pushing it to attribute his illness strictly to working on the pile.
So you're denying him?
No, I am pushing it through.
But I thought you should know... it's a favor.
Well, then, thank you, Frank.
Or it will be when I sign them.
Which, I take it, you have not yet done.
You know, I thought we should go out together and visit Macklin and his family, make a private little ceremony of it.
Oh, that's a nice idea.
Right after you pick up that phone and call your legal eagle, Mr. Sloane, and tell him to post bail for the other guy.
I'm the archbishop of New York, Frank,
I'm not a bail bondsman.
You put your thumb on the scale, now it's time to take it off.
You forcing my hand?
I've been ducking calls from Immigration and Customs and the State Department.
I don't like ducking calls, makes me feel all sweaty.
You'd really withhold benefits from this officer's family?
Hey, it was a coin toss whether he qualifies, so, I flipped the coin till it came up heads.
Like I said, as a favor to you.
But your part is private, quiet.
What you're offering in return would be public and controversial.
You chose the playing field, not me.
Uh...
I don't like this, Frank.
More to the point, I don't like you in this.
Me, either.
I'm just gonna have to live with that.
Not much choice.
I don't have all day, Your Eminence.
Do we have a deal?
(line beeps)
Uh, can you find me Mr. Sloane, please?
(clears throat)
ERIN:
Were you aware that quantities of heroin were removed and replaced with sugar?
Well, I became aware when you brought it to my attention, recently.
Did you take some of the drugs and replace it with sugar?
On the advice of counsel, I'm going to invoke my Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
Isn't it true that during this time, you were addicted to painkillers because of a back injury?
On the advice of counsel...
ERIN:
Did you transition from using painkillers to using heroin?
Again, on the advice of counsel...
Counsel, approach.
Ms. Reagan, we can spare everyone a lot of agony here by granting this witness immunity to get his full testimony in this hearing.
In what world is that fair to my client?
A prosecutor who is stealing drugs gets immunity while the regular citizen gets prison.
Ms. Reagan?
No immunity.
I'd like to continue.
Then have at it.
Mr. Falk, you were an officer of the court who swore to uphold the law, didn't you?
I did.
Did you betray that oath?
On the advice of counsel,
I invoke my...
Did you betray your friends?
No!
Your colleagues?
No!
Did you betray that oath you took?
That wasn't my intention.
But that's what happened, isn't it?
(sighs)
JUDGE:
Mr. Falk?
Do you wish to invoke your Fifth Amendment again?
(voice breaking):
No, Your Honor.
I'm prepared to answer Ms. Reagan's question.
Did you betray your duty to uphold the law?
(cries):
Yes.
And for that...
I am profoundly sorry.
More than you or anyone else can possibly know.
And finally, Mr. Falk, did you ever tamper with evidence in order to convict someone that was innocent?
No, Ms. Reagan.
I never planted evidence.
Every case I brought was legitimate, including the one against Mr. Hickman.
If... if I have to go to prison... like the people I've prosecuted... so be it.
At least my conscious is clear now.
DANNY:
You know, the doctors wanted both of you guys to stay here for continued observation.
VRONSKY:
This is not necessary.
LEVIN:
Moscow doctors, best in the world.
If you'd both been a little more upfront, neither of you would be going home with gunshot wounds.
Oh, please.
These are marks of honor.
Souvenirs from New York.
Oh, and to think, we were gonna stop and get you NYPD coffee mugs.
(laughs) I've already took one from your desk.
Ha!
Just kidding.
(Levin groans)
If you ever come to Moscow, please let me know.
I will love to take you to Bolshoi.
So, what is this?
Potatoes au gratin.
Or French for "cheesy deliciousness."
(all chuckle) And that's French for
"straight to your butt."
(chuckles) Exactly.
Made with Dubliner Irish cheddar, with an eye to the old sod.
It's the 101st anniversary of the Rising.
The what?
The Easter Rising?
Mm.
They don't teach that in school anymore, Jack.
DANNY:
They don't even give out books in school anymore.
(all laugh) It was the Irish, our ancestors, fighting for their independence in 1916.
And some of the family who didn't make it over here got caught up in that.
We had family who fought over there?
Mm-hmm.
As soldiers?
They weren't exactly soldiers.
They were fighting to get their country back from the British, and they called themselves "rebels."
And you know what the British called those rebels?
Micks?
Excuse me?
(Jamie laughs)
Terrorists.
Seriously?
ERIN:
Mm-hmm.
Bet you didn't think that term existed 100 years ago.
Actually, I didn't think it did.
So why were they called terrorists?
Because, by definition, they were.
Well, why not call them "guerillas"?
Isn't it the same thing?
JAMIE:
Well, guerilla's actually Spanish for "little war."
Their tactics are alike, but the big difference is that a terrorist will target civilians for political ends.
So, we are descended from terrorists.
Whoa...
Come on, that's a very college way of putting it.
FRANK:
Not terrorists the way they use the term now.
I know.
DANNY:
Right.
We have relatives who were freedom fighters, okay?
Let's just leave it at that.
Amen.
Here, here.
And one other thing:
Hardly anybody who's here is really from here.
I guess you could say we're all foreigners.
Yeah, and usually they're fleeing some kind of grief in their own country.
Some things never change.
JAMIE:
We're not perfect, but no one's come up with a version 2.0 that's better, so...
So who gets to say that they're really, truly from here?
Munsees, Algonquins, Iroquois, and a whole bunch of other tribes whose names I've forgotten, they can.
Everyone else... is an immigrant.
Here's to all us great unwashed.
Here, here.
DANNY:
Drink to that.
ERIN:
Bottoms up.
Here, here.
Cheers.
FRANK:
Here, here.

What are you doing in a Parish Church?
You ever spend time in one of your precinct houses?
Sure.
Have I answered your question?
In your way.
This an exercise in humility or just for show?
What good's humility if you don't make a show of it?
I mean, how's anyone gonna notice?
You're really on your game today.
I forget where things stand with us at the, uh, favor bank.
Oh, give me a break.
You got the best institutional memory in this city.
The name John Macklin mean anything to you?
Not offhand.
He was an altar boy in my first parish.
And then, worked at the 5-7 in the Bronx.
And I have been summoned here to talk about him because...?
He's got stage 4 cancer of the trachea in the esophagus.
The doctors told him he's only got less than a month.
He'll leave behind a wife and four boys.
I'll make time to go see him.
The family feels that he got the disease working on the pile after 9/11.
What's the doctor say?
You know how they are.
Claim's gotten caught up in red tape.
And you think the police commissioner can untangle it and get this classified as a line of duty death.
I hope so.
You do know I get a lot of requests like this.
But not from me.
Point taken.
I'm just asking you to give it a look, see what can be done to help.
McLaughlin.
Uh, Macklin.
M-A-C-K.
Got it.
I'd be in your debt.
No.
We'd be even because you would say
I've been gifted with the opportunity to serve my church.
You know me too well.
I don't think we're in any danger of that.
What do you say, Mullhearn?
You know, working in the property clerk's office, living the dream.
Yeah, well, I called ahead.
I'm picking up the drug evidence for the Hickman case.
The, uh, Wall Street drug courier thing?
Yeah.
Trial starts this afternoon.
So, let's get to it, all right?
They said it'd be ready.
All right, all right.
- I ain't got all day.
- All right.
What the hell?
There a problem?
Well, there's ants all over this thing.
Who knew that they liked heroin that much?
They don't.
They like brown sugar.
Someone's gotten into this.
Hey, Anthony, don't look at me.
We've lost things before, but this is right where it was supposed to be.
Yeah, maybe so, but this evidence has been tampered with.
Hey!
Police!
Hey, break it up!
Hey!
It's over, it's over!
Hey, calm down, calm down.
Hey!
It's over.
You, what happened here?
One minute, I'm behind the counter, I'm filling orders, and the next, these two are going at it like a couple of animals.
All right, what's up, guys?
This lunatic pulled a knife on me.
- Who you calling a lunatic?
- You grabbed the knife first!
What are you talking about?
- You grabbed it!
- All right.
All right, you boys need to calm down or you're both getting locked up, you understand?
This man tried to kill me.
I want him charged with murderous assault.
- Yeah, you mean felony assault.
- However you say it,
- he's the mad dog.
- He needs to be locked away!
All right, both of you need to calm down now.
I want him charged!
I want him charged, as well!
All right, cuff 'em up.
That's it, you're both going to jail.
What the hell, Baez?
Go around the block for a hot dog,
I come back, it's World War III.
Male, white, with a gun, approximately 50-years-of-age, approached the female victim while she was walking with her son and just started shooting.
And what about these two?
Two male victims got shot trying to protect her.
Both of them are likely.
She's not doing so good, either, but the EMTs think she'll probably survive.
Is she able to talk to us?
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Miss?
Detective Reagan, this is Detective Baez.
What can you tell us about the man who shot you?
Sergei, he's lost his mind.
So you know him?
He got a call.
He wanted me to go with him to Russia and leave my son.
And when I... when I say no, he gets his gun and...
That's your little boy over there?
Okay, we're gonna take care of him and you, all right?
But first, you got to tell us about this Sergei guy.
All right, do you know where he lives?
Do you know where we could find him?
He-he could be anywhere.
Please,
I must tell you, he was with KGB and-and Special Forces in Chechnya.
We can handle him, all right?
Don't worry about us.
No, no, you're not understanding.
They call him Rambo.
He will kill anyone, any time.
If you are lucky, you never find him.

*Blue Bloods* Season 07 Episode 21 "Foreign Interference"
Three separate reviews of Officer Macklin's claim are the same degree of muddy.
About working the pile?
No.
He worked most days for a good three weeks.
Then, what's muddy?
He drank like a fish, smoked like a chimney.
Okay.
Well...
Well what?
As far as I'm concerned, if you worked that pile and got sick, you and your family should be taken care of, end of story.
You're not an insurance claims adjuster.
For which, I thank God every day.
See that arms get twisted.
Yes, sir.
There's something else.
We've got a problem off a brawl in a bagel shop.
The Archdiocese of New York got involved.
Catholic Church, fight in a bagel shop?
This is a joke, right?
I wish.
One of the cross-complainants is from an Iraqi Christian family the Church sponsored to come over here.
The Church bailed him out on orders of the archbishop.
Which is his right, maybe even his duty.
Maybe so.
The other complainant is a Muslim doctor from Sudan.
His family's in a refugee camp.
They're both here illegally, both charged with felonies, which puts them on a list.
Hey, not our problem.
Frank, you met with the archbishop.
Not about this.
The spin is that you and the archbishop teamed up to let the Christian go free.
He didn't go free!
He made bail.
I don't set bail.
I'm not a judge.
It's not our problem.
The mayor's very proud of our status as a sanctuary city.
He feels this dents that.
Oh, please.
If the mayor wants to post bail for the Muslim detainee, let him have at it.
But I am the police commissioner of New York City, not sanctuary city.
We both knew this issue would land on our desks sooner or later.
It didn't just land.
It was placed, by the mayor.
Get it off.
Off what?
Off my desk.
How?
I don't care how.
Sure you do.
Start with City Hall, see if they got a sanctuary city rug they can sweep it under.
I don't see nothing.
Come on, what do you mean you don't see nothing?
I mean, three people shot right out in front of your place, you didn't see any of it?
We were very busy with the customers.
A dozen shots rang out.
You didn't hear anything?
You didn't see which way the shooter ran, nothing?
I had lot of orders.
Bred kakoy to.
Wow, how much Russian do you speak?
That's all I know.
What do you know?
Intel confirmed this Rambo guy, Sergei Karenin, was here legally on a diplomatic visa.
The part about the KGB and the Special Forces is true, as well.
Where is he now?
6-4 squad went to his apartment.
The place is cleared out.
Car's abandoned, his phone is dead.
How do you say "in the wind" in Russian?
Well, somebody's got to be helping him.
I don't know, but, Danny, there's two detectives from Moscow on their way here to help with the investigation.
Wait, what?
Since when do we work with the Russians?
We don't even have extradition with them.
There's something called a
- mutual legal assistance treaty,
- Oh, my God.
where we trade help with other cases.
If we're looking for someone over there, and the powers that be say we should be trying to get along.
Okay, but this just happened.
You said those guys are already on their way.
How could that be?
Yeah, hinky to me, too.
All I know is that we're supposed to cooperate.
Ay-yi-yi.
What's the matter?
We got to talk now.
- Right now?
- It's important.
I couldn't call ahead.
You've been in court the whole time.
Ms. Reagan, are we ready to proceed?
Your Honor, may we approach?
Yes.
What's going on?
We need a break.
We're having trouble putting our hands on an exhibit for the case.
Well, this is an epic mess.
After three years, our key evidence is gone?
I got our people up there right now asking questions.
Well, is it possible it's just another clerical mistake?
No way.
It's the correct weight for the drugs.
Somebody deliberately substituted brown sugar for the heroin so we wouldn't notice the difference until the ants got in.
Anthony, I don't even know how many people put their hands on the evidence before we inherited this case.
Do we even have a paper trail?
We're putting together a list now.
It's a lot of people.
Okay, so Hickman was providing drugs to a half dozen Wall Street firms.
Is it possible that someone is paying big money to derail this case?
Anything is possible, including a mistrial.
Erin, if this gets out...
No, I know, we've got to keep this on the DL for now.
But, Anthony, there's another crime here, and someone on our end is involved with it.
You know what this is about, right?
A Christian and a Muslim walk into a bagel store?
The P.C.'s hands are tied.
He can't just tell the D.A. to release the other guy.
We didn't suggest that.
You suggested our department's turning a blind eye.
Trying to and failing.
It's not our bailiwick.
Until the P.C.'s good friend, the Archbishop, weighed in.
Reagan doesn't dictate to the Archdiocese.
Oh, he has his ear, though.
Well, he certainly didn't in this matter.
What are you looking for here, Garrett?
Cooperation, some ratcheting down of the Rhetoric.
You guys are a broken record when it comes to trashing One PP lately.
You are barking up the wrong tree on this.
Being a sanctuary city is high on the mayor's list of priorities.
You mean it's high on the list of what the mayor loves to see when he's looking in the mirror.
Look, we didn't open this can of worms, that archbishop did.
What are you saying, I should counsel the P.C.
to lean on the archbishop?
Couldn't have said it better myself.
You know, it's this kind of politicizing that doesn't help anyone.
Maybe just once, you could stand up for something other than saving your own hide.
Are you coming to poker on Sunday?
I got a family thing.
I'll be half an hour late.
Intel says these Russian detectives are almost here.
They are.
In fact, their I.D. pictures just came through.
You ready?
Yeah.
Wow.
That could be the new Mr. Maria Baez.
Shut up.
I'm just saying.
Let's take a look at bachelor number two.
Mr. December, from the KGB pinup calendar.
No.
Putin taught him that smile personally.
You Reagan and Baez?
You know, they're not supposed to let you up here from the front desk without an escort.
We expedited procedure.
I'm Levin, this is Vronsky.
Good to meet you.
How was your flight?
Long, boring.
Ran out of vodka over Atlantic.
Uh... thank you.
Now that we got the pleasantries out of the way, how is it that you guys were on your way over here before this Rambo even went crazy and started shooting people?
First we eat, then we discuss case.
You want to go somewhere and have dinner?
That would be better.
On the flight, they only had peanuts and dry pretzels.
Excuse me, there are two people dead and one's in intensive care, so we don't give a damn how hungry you are, we're in a hurry to find this guy.
We will eat, then we will drink, and then, we will find him.
- Okay.
- Let's get one thing straight, okay?
You're in our country now, which means we're driving this thing and you're just along for the ride.
I don't think so, my friend.
We have crucial information to catch this man.
Great, - we'd love for you to share it with us.
Please.
You cannot find him without our assistance.
And we are very hungry.
Okay, we'll eat.
Just don't expect us to pick up the tab.
Thanks for coming in on short notice, Mickey.
Sure, buddy.
Just a little confused.
Thought the Hickman trial was starting.
It is, but we ran into a problem.
This is you vouchering for the drug evidence.
- Is that correct?
- Yeah.
I was one of the original investigators.
What's going on?
Well, half the drugs are missing now, Mickey.
Somebody pulled a switch.
What, you think it was me, my brother?
You just put yourself at the scene.
Oh, so the Puerto Rican dude must have stole the heroin.
Either sold it on the street, maybe did it himself?
This is your chance to tell it your way.
No.
Look, lady, you can drug test me right now.
Strap a polygraph on me.
I've got nothing to hide.
You have a better explanation?
Look, I know I'm just a street guy, but I followed procedure.
I made the collar, I vouchered the evidence, and when somebody in this office needed it,
I picked it up.
But I am not gonna take the fall
- for one of you guys.
- What are you suggesting?
I'm not suggesting.
I'm telling.
When I signed the drugs out for a pretrial hearing, they stayed in the property safe here, in this damn office.
So instead of pointing the finger, you best get your own house in order.

Eti lyido smeshny.
What'd he say?
He's being critical.
Of what?
Of your country.
He's saying women are smarter than the men, and stronger, too.
Can't argue with that.
What'd he say now?
He want to know if you're sleeping with your partner.
That's funny.
Do you sleep with your partner?
Hey, we don't do that around here, okay?
We're working.
If you say so.
Zda-ró-vye.
All right, all right, enough already.
Look, this Rambo guy's running around, and you two are sitting here getting drunk.
We're working as well, right now.
How about you tell us what's really going on with this Rambo guy?
You obviously had some kind of tip he was gonna pop his cork.
Okay, lady.
Politsiya politsiy.
"Police is police."
We had information he was upset.
About what?
He call Moscow and tell 'em that he was displeased.
Yeah, we know about that already.
Got called back for an assignment, but he didn't want to go without his girl.
We have information, too, okay?
But we're trying to string the pieces together here, fill in the blanks.
Excuse me, pretty lady.
Where's he going?
He's going to bathroom, even though I tell him to keep it.
All right, look, there's a killer running around, and you guys aren't telling us anything.
Maybe because we need to trust you first.
Fine.
Down the hatch.
Everybody down!
Stay down!
Police!
Watch it!
Vronsky!
Hands up.
Hands up!
Turn around.
On byl zdes'.
Reagan, Baez!
He was here.
- Rambo was here?
- Yeah.
And he got away again?
You see anyone?
Huh?
Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?
He say he don't know, but he knows.
I didn't start this, Frank.
One of them started it.
The Muslim, according to the Christian.
Well, you brought it into our world when you bailed the guy out.
First things first.
This is the first thing.
Not from where I sit.
Have you looked into the matter of Officer Macklin?
It's John Macklin now.
He left the department eight months ago.
Once a Catholic, once a cop, same thing.
It's complicated.
I'm looking into it.
Well, look faster, please.
The poor man is barely hanging on.
I would like to help, if I'm able.
You're able.
Just as you are able to ask your Christian to withdraw his complaint.
Ah... huh.
Please.
That would be wrong.
No, it would be pragmatic, and it would go a long way to putting out a fire that you poured gas on.
What if Mr. Asad won't withdraw his complaint?
Oh, I think he'll consider it.
You think?
You mean you know.
I'm confident if Mr. Khoury will, he will.
I can't.
Why not?
He looks at it as standing up for all his people.
It was a fight over cutting in line in a bagel shop, Kevin.
It would be the wrong way out, Frank.
It would be an abuse of my influence.
I'd be using the power of the faith to...
You had a hand in starting this, you have a responsibility to finish it.
I have a lot of responsibilities.
High on that list is defending the flock.
Your Eminence.
Yes, we're late.
I'll tell you what.
You get Officer Macklin's health claim put through, and also see that he gets promoted to Detective First Grade so his family can receive the pay and benefits that go along with it, then we can revisit this conversation.
You're doubling down.
I'm defending the flock.
May God bless you and keep you safe.
Thank you, Your Eminence.
Thanks for coming in, Gary.
Oh, I'm happy for the excuse to stop by and see old friends.
So, what's up?
Just following up on an issue from a case I inherited when you left the office.
Tommy Hickman?
Right.
Of course.
I thought that trial was just beginning.
It is, but we've hit a roadblock.
Evidence had been tampered with.
Are you kidding?
Someone substituted sugar for the drugs that we wanted to present at the trial.
You think Hickman got to someone in the property clerk's office?
We're talking to everyone that would have handled that evidence.
Of course, I'll get you a list of every investigator I worked with.
Well, we've spoken to all of them.
Hey, Anthony, what's going on?
Gary, uh, we've been hearing some stories about why you really left the office.
You know why I left the office, Erin.
We talked about it.
It was a tough time in my marriage.
And there are other rumors about why your marriage was in trouble.
Rumors are just rumors.
Gary, we have to ask you, did you have a substance abuse problem?
I don't see why I have to answer that,
I-I don't work here anymore.
Oh, come on, Gary.
You wouldn't take that from a skel.
Why should we take it from you?
I'm not some skel, Anthony.
I was a prosecutor at this office for ten years.
And, if I had a problem, it's over.
I'm remarried, we just had a baby.
Gary, you know how this looks?
Those drugs were kept in a safe in your personal office, while you were preparing for hearing.
Don't go there, you guys.
Tell me, did you steal them for your own use?
Oh, my God, how can you even ask me that?
We have to, we started trial.
Do you know what's the first thing I teach my students?
Never ask a question if you can't handle the answer.
Yeah, you also taught me, if you have an inconvenient fact, you need to get in front of it.
So you need to come clean, Gary, right now.
No, you don't.
I'm warning you.
Not just as a former colleague, but as a friend, if you start spreading dirt, it won't just get on me.
What are you talking about?
I successfully prosecuted 30 or 40 drug cases while at this office.
If you smear me, all those criminals could go free.
Is it worth it to you, just to go after
- that piddly little courier?
- Come on, Gary,
- that's no kind of choice.
- Let's end this conversation right now or I promise you, we'll all rue the day.
Nyet.
Mne Ne nuzhny narkotiki.
Well, madam, he say he don't need any of your pain drugs.
It's American weakness.
Yeah.
Let's talk outside.
Give us a second.
Why the hell didn't you tell us you had a tip Rambo would be in the restaurant?
Classified information.
Classified my ass, we could've had the place surrounded.
Rambo wouldn't have got away again, and the witnesses would be talking to us.
We cannot share our sources with Americans.
Do you tell us everything that you know?
If one more person gets killed because you're not telling us what you know, we're gonna have a serious problem.
And I don't mean a Russian-America problem,
I mean a me and you personal problem!
Okay, Reagan, relax.
Sergei, Rambo, he went to Chechnya.
And he was involved in, uh, what we call,
"acts of extreme subjugation"
with terrorists and their families.
He come back not the same.
Meaning he snapped.
When Moscow called him back, he said he changed sides.
"Changed sides"?
Meaning he became a terrorist?
And now he's running around my city, and you don't think that's something that you should share with me?
In all probability, he's just looking for a means
- to escape to another country.
- In all probability, he could planning his next attack right now.
That is true, he's terrorist.
We're gonna start working together before we end up facing a wholesale slaughter, you got it?
Maybe, but it is still essential to control the flow of information.
No "maybe""
My city, my country, my way.
We work together.
It's okay.
So, this is the safe where the drugs were being held before the hearing?
Yeah, only a handful of people had the combination, and Gary was one of them.
And nobody in the office knew what he was up to?
No, he was being smart about it, like addicts can be.
He knew the drugs had already been subjected to a lab analysis, so he substituted sugar every time he used so the weight and color looked the same.
And because he thought we'd never get to trial, he'd never get found out.
He says he's clean.
I think I believe him.
Well, good for him.
Meanwhile, he's left us with a big fat problem with the Hickman case.
Have we tried to do a quick and dirty plea deal?
It'd be sticky.
Sticky's what we do here.
Hickman's lawyer already senses we have a major problem.
The only deal he's gonna consider is no jail time for his client.
Erin, I don't like cutting Hickman that big of a break either, but we need to handle this as quickly and as quietly as possible.
I know, but it's too late.
The case is too high profile, and even if we make a deal, there's no guarantee that Hickman's gonna keep his mouth shut.
If it comes out that Gary tampered with evidence, every case he was involved in will be reopened.
Gary's going to prison.
And he's a friend, and a mentor to both of us.
I...
I have to say, Monica, I don't...
I know.
There are no good options.
I'm sorry, I still don't understand.
My English is not so good.
Funny, considering you went to high school in Coney Island.
Why don't you cut the crap, all right?
We know you helped Rambo get away from the crime scene.
So lose the accent and tell us where the hell he is.
If you know about his nickname, why do you think I'd help you get him?
What?
I have idea.
Great.
I'm thinking I should speak to him alone.
Do you have room with a window, no bars?
So you can hang him out the window by his ankles, is that what you're talking about?
There would be more honesty in conversation.
No, we don't do things like that around here.
My clearance rate is almost 100%.
What is yours?
Look, we make cases the right way so they stand up, you understand?
Okay.
How do you say, um... it is your funeral.
Thought we were gonna work together here.
American, you thought it would happen right away?
Okay.
Where were we?
Will you please tell the detective what you just told me?
Tell me what?
Promise you won't say I talked.
To who?
Right?
Fine.
Rambo said he just needed to go some place where he could chill and clear his system without being tracked.
What does he mean clear his system?
He's really not a guy you want to ask a lot of questions.
Clear his system?
Clear his system, you hear...?
Hey!
Hey, you see where the dumb looking Russian guy went?
How did you know he was headed back to the same restaurant?
I didn't.
It's a GPS I put on his car before.
Like the other Reagan said, trust, but verify.
What do you think he's doing here?
Don't know.
He must think we miss him.
Let's find out.
Huh?
Please.
Your presence is unhelpful and unnecessary.
Duly noted.
Where's Rambo?
I'm trying to find out, but now you're getting in the way.
Oh, we're getting in the way?
How about we lock you two up for obstructing, huh?
We'll put you in a nice small room with bars on the windows.
Okay, okay, we'll do it together.
Police is police.
Right?
Wrong.
Pokazhi mne.
What, he's in the freezer?
What'd she say?
It's passageway.
She wants you to go first.
Step aside.
Go.
5-4, detectives requesting a 10-85 forthwith at... where the hell are we anyway?
Behind the restaurant, lady.
Russian bathhouse adjacent to our previous location.
Why would Rambo come here?
Clear his system, steal clothes, I.D., get a massage.
Hey, kid, hey.
You seen him?
For sure, he is here.
Reagan, once he knows he's in a corner, he gonna be much more dangerous.
Should wait for emergency service.
We don't have time.
Oh, son of a bitch.
We got two in here.
10-13, two dead at the scene.
An active shooter in the building.
Where'd he go?
What'd she say, Levin?
Levin!
Where the hell did he go?
Move, get out of the way!
Police!
- Police, move!
- Back there.
- Back there.
- Get out of the way.
Move, move!
Move it!
Which way, which way?
!
There, there!
Turn it off.
Hey.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm hit.
He's in here.
Sergei Karenin!
Police!
Sergei?
Reagan, what are you waiting for?
Shut up!
- Don't be a girl!
- Shut up!
Reagan?
I got him.
KGB, my ass.
Everything you wanted.
That hardly ever happens.
Including his promotion to detective with all its benefits.
What about the benefits from the World Trade Center's Health Program or the Victim's Comp Fund?
I don't control those.
But your word has weight.
You know, he had some good years on the job, and some less good ones.
What's that a code for?
Smoked and drank for decades before he got sick.
But he also worked on the pile before he got sick.
It would be pushing it to attribute his illness strictly to working on the pile.
So you're denying him?
No, I am pushing it through.
But I thought you should know... it's a favor.
Well, then, thank you, Frank.
Or it will be when I sign them.
Which, I take it, you have not yet done.
You know, I thought we should go out together and visit Macklin and his family, make a private little ceremony of it.
Oh, that's a nice idea.
Right after you pick up that phone and call your legal eagle, Mr. Sloane, and tell him to post bail for the other guy.
I'm the archbishop of New York, Frank,
I'm not a bail bondsman.
You put your thumb on the scale, now it's time to take it off.
You forcing my hand?
I've been ducking calls from Immigration and Customs and the State Department.
I don't like ducking calls, makes me feel all sweaty.
You'd really withhold benefits from this officer's family?
Hey, it was a coin toss whether he qualifies, so, I flipped the coin till it came up heads.
Like I said, as a favor to you.
But your part is private, quiet.
What you're offering in return would be public and controversial.
You chose the playing field, not me.
Uh...
I don't like this, Frank.
More to the point, I don't like you in this.
Me, either.
I'm just gonna have to live with that.
Not much choice.
I don't have all day, Your Eminence.
Do we have a deal?
Uh, can you find me Mr. Sloane, please?
Were you aware that quantities of heroin were removed and replaced with sugar?
Well, I became aware when you brought it to my attention, recently.
Did you take some of the drugs and replace it with sugar?
On the advice of counsel, I'm going to invoke my Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
Isn't it true that during this time, you were addicted to painkillers because of a back injury?
On the advice of counsel...
Did you transition from using painkillers to using heroin?
Again, on the advice of counsel...
Counsel, approach.
Ms. Reagan, we can spare everyone a lot of agony here by granting this witness immunity to get his full testimony in this hearing.
In what world is that fair to my client?
A prosecutor who is stealing drugs gets immunity while the regular citizen gets prison.
Ms. Reagan?
No immunity.
I'd like to continue.
Then have at it.
Mr. Falk, you were an officer of the court who swore to uphold the law, didn't you?
I did.
Did you betray that oath?
On the advice of counsel,
I invoke my...
Did you betray your friends?
No!
- Your colleagues?
- No!
Did you betray that oath you took?
That wasn't my intention.
But that's what happened, isn't it?
Mr. Falk?
Do you wish to invoke your Fifth Amendment again?
No, Your Honor.
I'm prepared to answer Ms. Reagan's question.
Did you betray your duty to uphold the law?
Yes.
And for that...
I am profoundly sorry.
More than you or anyone else can possibly know.
And finally, Mr. Falk, did you ever tamper with evidence in order to convict someone that was innocent?
No, Ms. Reagan.
I never planted evidence.
Every case I brought was legitimate, including the one against Mr. Hickman.
If... if I have to go to prison... like the people I've prosecuted... so be it.
At least my conscious is clear now.
You know, the doctors wanted both of you guys to stay here for continued observation.
This is not necessary.
Moscow doctors, best in the world.
If you'd both been a little more upfront, neither of you would be going home with gunshot wounds.
Oh, please.
These are marks of honor.
Souvenirs from New York.
Oh, and to think, we were gonna stop and get you NYPD coffee mugs.
I've already took one from your desk.
Ha!
Just kidding.
If you ever come to Moscow, please let me know.
I will love to take you to Bolshoi.
So, what is this?
Potatoes Au gratin.
Or French for "cheesy deliciousness."
And that's French for
"straight to your butt""
Exactly.
Made with Dubliner Irish cheddar, with an eye to the old sod.
It's the 101st anniversary of the Rising.
The what?
- The Easter Rising?
- Mm.
They don't teach that in school anymore, Jack.
They don't even give out books in school anymore.
It was the Irish, our ancestors, fighting for their independence in 1916.
And some of the family who didn't make it over here got caught up in that.
We had family who fought over there?
Mm-hmm.
- As soldiers?
- They weren't exactly soldiers.
They were fighting to get their country back from the British, and they called themselves "Rebels."
And you know what the British called those Rebels?
Micks?
Excuse me?
Terrorists.
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.
Bet you didn't think that term existed 100 years ago.
Actually, I didn't think it did.
So why were they called terrorists?
Because, by definition, they were.
Well, why not call them "guerillas"?
Isn't it the same thing?
Well, guerilla's actually Spanish for "little war."
Their tactics are alike, but the big difference is that a terrorist will target civilians for political ends.
So, we are descended from terrorists.
Whoa...
Come on, that's a very college way of putting it.
Not terrorists the way they use the term now.
- I know.
- Right.
We have relatives who were freedom fighters, okay?
Let's just leave it at that.
- Amen.
- Here, here.
And one other thing:
hardly anybody who's here is really from here.
I guess you could say we're all foreigners.
Yeah, and usually they're fleeing some kind of grief in their own country.
- Some things never change.
- We're not perfect, but no one's come up with a version 2.0 that's better, so...
So who gets to say that they're really, truly from here?
Munsees, Algonquins, Iroquois, and a whole bunch of other tribes whose names I've forgotten, they can.
Everyone else... is an immigrant.
Here's to all us great unwashed.
- Here, here.
- Drink to that.
Bottoms up.
Here, here.
- Cheers.
- Here, here.

What are you doing in a Parish Church?
You ever spend time in one of your precinct houses?
Sure.
Have I answered your question?
In your way.
This an exercise in humility or just for show?
What good's humility if you don't make a show of it?
I mean, how's anyone gonna notice?
You're really on your game today.
KEARNS:
I forget where things stand with us at the, uh, favor bank.
Oh, give me a break.
You got the best institutional memory in this city.
The name John Macklin mean anything to you?
Not offhand.
He was an altar boy in my first parish.
And then, worked at the 5-7 in the Bronx.
And I have been summoned here to talk about him because...?
He's got stage 4 cancer of the trachea in the esophagus.
The doctors told him he's only got less than a month.
He'll leave behind a wife and four boys.
I'll make time to go see him.
The family feels that he got the disease working on the pile after 9/11.
What's the doctor say?
(scoffs) You know how they are.
Claim's gotten caught up in red tape.
And you think the police commissioner can untangle it and get this classified as a line of duty death.
I hope so.
You do know I get a lot of requests like this.
But not from me.
Point taken.
I'm just asking you to give it a look, see what can be done to help.
McLaughlin.
Uh, Macklin.
M-A-C-K.
Got it.
I'd be in your debt.
No.
We'd be even because you would say
I've been gifted with the opportunity to serve my church.
You know me too well.
I don't think we're in any danger of that.
What do you say, Mullhearn?
You know, working in the property clerk's office, living the dream.
Yeah, well, I called ahead.
I'm picking up the drug evidence for the Hickman case.
The, uh, Wall Street drug courier thing?
Yeah.
Trial starts this afternoon.
So, let's get to it, all right?
They said it'd be ready.
All right, all right.
- ABETEMARCO:
I ain't got all day.
- All right.
What the hell?
There a problem?
Well, there's ants all over this thing.
Who knew that they liked heroin that much?
They don't.
They like brown sugar.
Someone's gotten into this.
Hey, Anthony, don't look at me.
We've lost things before, but this is right where it was supposed to be.
Yeah, maybe so, but this evidence has been tampered with.
(siren wailing)
Hey!
Police!
Hey, break it up!
Hey!
It's over, it's over!
Hey, calm down, calm down.
Hey!
It's over.
You, what happened here?
One minute, I'm behind the counter, I'm filling orders, and the next, these two are going at it like a couple of animals.
All right, what's up, guys?
This lunatic pulled a knife on me.
- Who you calling a lunatic?
- You grabbed the knife first!
What are you talking about?
- You grabbed it!
- All right.
All right, you boys need to calm down or you're both getting locked up, you understand?
This man tried to kill me.
I want him charged with murderous assault.
- Yeah, you mean felony assault.
- However you say it,
- he's the mad dog.
- He needs to be locked away!
All right, both of you need to calm down now.
I want him charged!
I want him charged, as well!
All right, cuff 'em up.
That's it, you're both going to jail.
(handcuffs tighten)
DANNY:
What the hell, Baez?
Go around the block for a hot dog,
I come back, it's World War III.
Male, white, with a gun, approximately 50-years-of-age, approached the female victim while she was walking with her son and just started shooting.
And what about these two?
BAEZ:
Two male victims got shot trying to protect her.
Both of them are likely.
She's not doing so good, either, but the EMTs think she'll probably survive.
DANNY:
Is she able to talk to us?
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Miss?
Detective Reagan, this is Detective Baez.
What can you tell us about the man who shot you?
Sergei, he's lost his mind.
So you know him?
He got a call.
He wanted me to go with him to Russia and leave my son.
And when I... when I say no, he gets his gun and...
That's your little boy over there?
Okay, we're gonna take care of him and you, all right?
But first, you got to tell us about this Sergei guy.
All right, do you know where he lives?
Do you know where we could find him?
He-he could be anywhere.
Please,
I must tell you, he was with KGB and-and Special Forces in Chechnya.
We can handle him, all right?
Don't worry about us.
No, no, you're not understanding.
They call him Rambo.
He will kill anyone, any time.
If you are lucky, you never find him.

*Blue Bloods* Season 07 Episode 21 "Foreign Interference"
Three separate reviews of Officer Macklin's claim are the same degree of muddy.
About working the pile?
No.
He worked most days for a good three weeks.
Then, what's muddy?
He drank like a fish, smoked like a chimney.
Okay.
Well...
Well what?
As far as I'm concerned, if you worked that pile and got sick, you and your family should be taken care of, end of story.
(scoffs) You're not an insurance claims adjuster.
For which, I thank God every day.
See that arms get twisted.
Yes, sir.
(tosses notepad)
There's something else.
We've got a problem off a brawl in a bagel shop.
The Archdiocese of New York got involved.
Catholic Church, fight in a bagel shop?
This is a joke, right?
I wish.
One of the cross-complainants is from an Iraqi Christian family the Church sponsored to come over here.
The Church bailed him out on orders of the archbishop.
Which is his right, maybe even his duty.
Maybe so.
The other complainant is a Muslim doctor from Sudan.
(sighs) His family's in a refugee camp.
They're both here illegally, both charged with felonies, which puts them on a list.
Hey, not our problem.
Frank, you met with the archbishop.
Not about this.
The spin is that you and the archbishop teamed up to let the Christian go free.
He didn't go free!
He made bail.
I don't set bail.
I'm not a judge.
It's not our problem.
The mayor's very proud of our status as a sanctuary city.
He feels this dents that.
Oh, please.
If the mayor wants to post bail for the Muslim detainee, let him have at it.
But I am the police commissioner of New York City, not sanctuary city.
We both knew this issue would land on our desks sooner or later.
It didn't just land.
It was placed, by the mayor.
Get it off.
Off what?
Off my desk.
How?
I don't care how.
Sure you do.
Start with City Hall, see if they got a sanctuary city rug they can sweep it under.
(in Russian accent):
I don't see nothing.
Come on, what do you mean you don't see nothing?
I mean, three people shot right out in front of your place, you didn't see any of it?
We were very busy with the customers.
A dozen shots rang out.
You didn't hear anything?
You didn't see which way the shooter ran, nothing?
I had lot of orders.
Bred kakoy to.
Wow, how much Russian do you speak?
That's all I know.
What do you know?
Intel confirmed this Rambo guy, Sergei Karenin, was here legally on a diplomatic visa.
The part about the KGB and the Special Forces is true, as well.
Where is he now?
6-4 squad went to his apartment.
The place is cleared out.
Car's abandoned, his phone is dead.
How do you say "in the wind" in Russian?
Well, somebody's got to be helping him.
I don't know, but, Danny, there's two detectives from Moscow on their way here to help with the investigation.
Wait, what?
Since when do we work with the Russians?
We don't even have extradition with them.
There's something called a
- mutual legal assistance treaty,
- Oh, my God.
where we trade help with other cases.
If we're looking for someone over there, and the powers that be say we should be trying to get along.
Okay, but this just happened.
You said those guys are already on their way.
How could that be?
Yeah, hinky to me, too.
All I know is that we're supposed to cooperate.
Ay-yi-yi.
What's the matter?
We got to talk now.
- Right now?
- It's important.
I couldn't call ahead.
You've been in court the whole time.
(whispers indistinctly)
Ms. Reagan, are we ready to proceed?
Your Honor, may we approach?
Yes.
What's going on?
We need a break.
We're having trouble putting our hands on an exhibit for the case.
(sighs)
Well, this is an epic mess.
After three years, our key evidence is gone?
I got our people up there right now asking questions.
Well, is it possible it's just another clerical mistake?
No way.
It's the correct weight for the drugs.
Somebody deliberately substituted brown sugar for the heroin so we wouldn't notice the difference until the ants got in.
Anthony, I don't even know how many people put their hands on the evidence before we inherited this case.
Do we even have a paper trail?
We're putting together a list now.
It's a lot of people.
Okay, so Hickman was providing drugs to a half dozen Wall Street firms.
Is it possible that someone is paying big money to derail this case?
Anything is possible, including a mistrial.
Erin, if this gets out...
No, I know, we've got to keep this on the DL for now.
But, Anthony, there's another crime here, and someone on our end is involved with it.
You know what this is about, right?
A Christian and a Muslim walk into a bagel store?
The P.C.'s hands are tied.
He can't just tell the D.A. to release the other guy.
We didn't suggest that.
You suggested our department's turning a blind eye.
Trying to and failing.
It's not our bailiwick.
Until the P.C.'s good friend, the Archbishop, weighed in.
Reagan doesn't dictate to the Archdiocese.
Oh, he has his ear, though.
Well, he certainly didn't in this matter.
What are you looking for here, Garrett?
Cooperation, some ratcheting down of the Rhetoric.
You guys are a broken record when it comes to trashing One PP lately.
You are barking up the wrong tree on this.
Being a sanctuary city is high on the mayor's list of priorities.
You mean it's high on the list of what the mayor loves to see when he's looking in the mirror.
Look, we didn't open this can of worms, that archbishop did.
What are you saying, I should counsel the P.C.
to lean on the archbishop?
Couldn't have said it better myself.
You know, it's this kind of politicizing that doesn't help anyone.
Maybe just once, you could stand up for something other than saving your own hide.
Are you coming to poker on Sunday?
I got a family thing.
I'll be half an hour late.
Intel says these Russian detectives are almost here.
They are.
In fact, their I.D. pictures just came through.
You ready?
Yeah.
DANNY:
Wow.
That could be the new Mr. Maria Baez.
Shut up.
I'm just saying.
Let's take a look at bachelor number two.
Mr. December, from the KGB pinup calendar.
(laughs) No.
Putin taught him that smile personally.
(in Russian accent):
You Reagan and Baez?
(clicks keyboard)
You know, they're not supposed to let you up here from the front desk without an escort.
We expedited procedure.
I'm Levin, this is Vronsky.
BAEZ:
Good to meet you.
How was your flight?
Long, boring.
Ran out of vodka over Atlantic.
Uh... thank you.
(tosses file) Now that we got the pleasantries out of the way, how is it that you guys were on your way over here before this Rambo even went crazy and started shooting people?
First we eat, then we discuss case.
(chuckles)
You want to go somewhere and have dinner?
That would be better.
On the flight, they only had peanuts and dry pretzels.
DANNY:
Excuse me, there are two people dead and one's in intensive care, so we don't give a damn how hungry you are, we're in a hurry to find this guy.
We will eat, then we will drink, and then, we will find him.
- Okay.
- Let's get one thing straight, okay?
You're in our country now, which means we're driving this thing and you're just along for the ride.
I don't think so, my friend.
We have crucial information to catch this man.
Great, - we'd love for you to share it with us.
Please.
You cannot find him without our assistance.
And we are very hungry.
Okay, we'll eat.
Just don't expect us to pick up the tab.
Thanks for coming in on short notice, Mickey.
Sure, buddy.
Just a little confused.
Thought the Hickman trial was starting.
It is, but we ran into a problem.
This is you vouchering for the drug evidence.
Is that correct?
MICKEY:
Yeah.
I was one of the original investigators.
What's going on?
Well, half the drugs are missing now, Mickey.
Somebody pulled a switch.
What, you think it was me, my brother?
You just put yourself at the scene.
Oh, so the Puerto Rican dude must have stole the heroin.
Either sold it on the street, maybe did it himself?
This is your chance to tell it your way.
No.
Look, lady, you can drug test me right now.
Strap a polygraph on me.
I've got nothing to hide.
You have a better explanation?
Look, I know I'm just a street guy, but I followed procedure.
I made the collar, I vouchered the evidence, and when somebody in this office needed it,
I picked it up.
But I am not gonna take the fall
- for one of you guys.
- What are you suggesting?
I'm not suggesting.
I'm telling.
When I signed the drugs out for a pretrial hearing, they stayed in the property safe here, in this damn office.
So instead of pointing the finger, you best get your own house in order.

What'd he say?
He's being critical.
Of what?
Of your country.
He's saying women are smarter than the men, and stronger, too.

He want to know if you're sleeping with your partner.

We're working as well, right now.

How about you tell us what's really going on with this Rambo guy?
You obviously had some kind of tip he was gonna pop his cork.
LEVIN:
Okay, lady. (vodka pours)
Politsiya politsiy.
"Police is police."
We had information he was upset.
About what?
He call Moscow and tell 'em that he was displeased.
Yeah, we know about that already.
Got called back for an assignment, but he didn't want to go without his girl.
We have information, too, okay?
But we're trying to string the pieces together here, fill in the blanks.
Excuse me, pretty lady.
(sniffs)
Where's he going?
LEVIN:
He's going to bathroom, even though I tell him to keep it.
All right, look, there's a killer running around, and you guys aren't telling us anything.
Maybe because we need to trust you first.
Fine.
Down the hatch.

Everybody down!
Stay down!

Watch it!
LEVIN:

Hands up.

Turn around.

Reagan, Baez!
He was here.
- Rambo was here?
- Yeah.
And he got away again?
You see anyone?
Huh?
Where'd he go?
(speaks Russian) Where'd he go?
He say he don't know, but he knows.
(handcuffs rattle)
I didn't start this, Frank.
One of them started it.
The Muslim, according to the Christian.
Well, you brought it into our world when you bailed the guy out.
First things first.
This is the first thing.
Not from where I sit.
Have you looked into the matter of Officer Macklin?
It's John Macklin now.
He left the department eight months ago.
Once a Catholic, once a cop, same thing.
It's complicated.
I'm looking into it.
Well, look faster, please.
The poor man is barely hanging on.
I would like to help, if I'm able.
You're able.
Just as you are able to ask your Christian to withdraw his complaint.
Ah... huh.
Please.
That would be wrong.
No, it would be pragmatic, and it would go a long way to putting out a fire that you poured gas on.
What if Mr. Asad won't withdraw his complaint?
Oh, I think he'll consider it.
You think?
You mean you know.
I'm confident if Mr. Khoury will, he will.
I can't.
Why not?
He looks at it as standing up for all his people.
It was a fight over cutting in line in a bagel shop, Kevin.
It would be the wrong way out, Frank.
It would be an abuse of my influence.
I'd be using the power of the faith to...
You had a hand in starting this, you have a responsibility to finish it.
I have a lot of responsibilities.
High on that list is defending the flock.
(knock on door)
Your Eminence.
Yes, we're late.
I'll tell you what.
You get Officer Macklin's health claim put through, and also see that he gets promoted to Detective First Grade so his family can receive the pay and benefits that go along with it, then we can revisit this conversation.
You're doubling down.
I'm defending the flock.
May God bless you and keep you safe.
Thank you, Your Eminence.
(sighs)
ERIN:
Thanks for coming in, Gary.
Oh, I'm happy for the excuse to stop by and see old friends.
So, what's up?
Just following up on an issue from a case I inherited when you left the office.
Tommy Hickman?
Right.
Of course.
I thought that trial was just beginning.
It is, but we've hit a roadblock.
Evidence had been tampered with.
Are you kidding?
Someone substituted sugar for the drugs that we wanted to present at the trial.
You think Hickman got to someone in the property clerk's office?
We're talking to everyone that would have handled that evidence.
GARY:
Of course, I'll get you a list of every investigator I worked with.
Well, we've spoken to all of them.
Hey, Anthony, what's going on?
(door closes)
Gary, uh, we've been hearing some stories about why you really left the office.
You know why I left the office, Erin.
We talked about it.
It was a tough time in my marriage.
And there are other rumors about why your marriage was in trouble.
Rumors are just rumors.
Gary, we have to ask you, did you have a substance abuse problem?
(scoffs) I don't see why I have to answer that,
I-I don't work here anymore.
Oh, come on, Gary.
You wouldn't take that from a skel.
Why should we take it from you?
I'm not some skel, Anthony.
I was a prosecutor at this office for ten years.
And, if I had a problem, it's over.
I'm remarried, we just had a baby.
ABETEMARCO:
Gary, you know how this looks?
Those drugs were kept in a safe in your personal office, while you were preparing for hearing.
Don't go there, you guys.
Tell me, did you steal them for your own use?
Oh, my God, how can you even ask me that?
We have to, we started trial.
Do you know what's the first thing I teach my students?
Never ask a question if you can't handle the answer.
Yeah, you also taught me, if you have an inconvenient fact, you need to get in front of it.
So you need to come clean, Gary, right now.
No, you don't.
I'm warning you.
Not just as a former colleague, but as a friend, if you start spreading dirt, it won't just get on me.
What are you talking about?
I successfully prosecuted 30 or 40 drug cases while at this office.
If you smear me, all those criminals could go free.
Is it worth it to you, just to go after
- that piddly little courier?
- Come on, Gary,
- that's no kind of choice.
- Let's end this conversation right now or I promise you, we'll all rue the day.
(door opens)
VRONSKY:
Nyet.
Mne Ne nuzhny narkotiki.
LEVIN:
Well, madam, he say he don't need any of your pain drugs.
It's American weakness.
Yeah.
Let's talk outside.
Give us a second.
Why the hell didn't you tell us you had a tip Rambo would be in the restaurant?
Classified information.
Classified my ass, we could've had the place surrounded.
Rambo wouldn't have got away again, and the witnesses would be talking to us.
We cannot share our sources with Americans.
Do you tell us everything that you know?
If one more person gets killed because you're not telling us what you know, we're gonna have a serious problem.
And I don't mean a Russian-America problem,
I mean a me and you personal problem!
Okay, Reagan, relax.
Sergei, Rambo, he went to Chechnya.
And he was involved in, uh, what we call,
"acts of extreme subjugation"
with terrorists and their families.
He come back not the same.
Meaning he snapped.
When Moscow called him back, he said he changed sides.
"Changed sides"?
Meaning he became a terrorist?
And now he's running around my city, and you don't think that's something that you should share with me?
In all probability, he's just looking for a means
- to escape to another country.
- In all probability, he could planning his next attack right now.
That is true, he's terrorist.
We're gonna start working together before we end up facing a wholesale slaughter, you got it?
Maybe, but it is still essential to control the flow of information.
No "maybe""
My city, my country, my way.
We work together.
(speaks Russian)
It's okay.
So, this is the safe where the drugs were being held before the hearing?
Yeah, only a handful of people had the combination, and Gary was one of them.
And nobody in the office knew what he was up to?
No, he was being smart about it, like addicts can be.
He knew the drugs had already been subjected to a lab analysis, so he substituted sugar every time he used so the weight and color looked the same.
And because he thought we'd never get to trial, he'd never get found out.
He says he's clean.
I think I believe him.
Well, good for him.
Meanwhile, he's left us with a big fat problem with the Hickman case.
Have we tried to do a quick and dirty plea deal?
It'd be sticky.
Sticky's what we do here.
Hickman's lawyer already senses we have a major problem.
The only deal he's gonna consider is no jail time for his client.
Erin, I don't like cutting Hickman that big of a break either, but we need to handle this as quickly and as quietly as possible.
I know, but it's too late.
The case is too high profile, and even if we make a deal, there's no guarantee that Hickman's gonna keep his mouth shut.
If it comes out that Gary tampered with evidence, every case he was involved in will be reopened.
Gary's going to prison.
And he's a friend, and a mentor to both of us.
I...
I have to say, Monica, I don't...
I know.
There are no good options.
(in Russian accent):
I'm sorry, I still don't understand.
My English is not so good.
Funny, considering you went to high school in Coney Island.
Why don't you cut the crap, all right?
We know you helped Rambo get away from the crime scene.
So lose the accent and tell us where the hell he is.
(tapping on glass)
(without accent):
If you know about his nickname, why do you think I'd help you get him?
(sighs)
What?
I have idea.
Great.
I'm thinking I should speak to him alone.
Do you have room with a window, no bars?
So you can hang him out the window by his ankles, is that what you're talking about?
There would be more honesty in conversation.
No, we don't do things like that around here.
My clearance rate is almost 100%.
What is yours?
Look, we make cases the right way so they stand up, you understand?
Okay.
How do you say, um... it is your funeral.
(sighs)
Thought we were gonna work together here.
American, you thought it would happen right away?
(sighs)
Okay.
Where were we?
Will you please tell the detective what you just told me?
Tell me what?
Promise you won't say I talked.
To who?
Right?
Fine.
Rambo said he just needed to go some place where he could chill and clear his system without being tracked.
What does he mean clear his system?
He's really not a guy you want to ask a lot of questions.
Clear his system?
Clear his system, you hear...?
Hey!
Hey, you see where the dumb looking Russian guy went?
(scoffs)
BAEZ:
How did you know he was headed back to the same restaurant?
I didn't.
It's a GPS I put on his car before.
Like the other Reagan said, trust, but verify.
(sighs)
What do you think he's doing here?
Don't know.
He must think we miss him.
Let's find out.
(speaking Russian)
Huh?
(speaks Russian)
Please.
Your presence is unhelpful and unnecessary.
(chuckles) Duly noted.
Where's Rambo?
I'm trying to find out, but now you're getting in the way.
Oh, we're getting in the way?
How about we lock you two up for obstructing, huh?
We'll put you in a nice small room with bars on the windows.
Okay, okay, we'll do it together.
Police is police.
Right?
Wrong.
Pokazhi mne.
What, he's in the freezer?

What'd she say?
It's passageway.
She wants you to go first.

Go.

5-4, detectives requesting a 10-85 forthwith at... where the hell are we anyway?
Behind the restaurant, lady.

Russian bathhouse adjacent to our previous location.
Why would Rambo come here?
LEVIN:
Clear his system, steal clothes, I.D., get a massage.
Hey, kid, hey.
You seen him?

LEVIN:
For sure, he is here.
Reagan, once he knows he's in a corner, he gonna be much more dangerous.
BAEZ:
Should wait for emergency service.
We don't have time.
Oh, son of a bitch.
We got two in here.
10-13, two dead at the scene.
An active shooter in the building.
Where'd he go?

What'd she say, Levin?
Levin!
Where the hell did he go?

- MAN:
Back there.
- Back there.
- Get out of the way.
Move, move!
- (women screaming)
- Move it!
Which way, which way?
!
MAN:
There, there!
(steam hissing)
(whispers):
Turn it off.
(steam hisses)
DANNY:
Hey.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm hit.
He's in here.
Sergei Karenin!
Police!
(coughs)
Sergei?
Reagan, what are you waiting for?
Shut up!
- Don't be a girl!
- Shut up!
BAEZ:
Reagan?
I got him.
KGB, my ass.
Everything you wanted.
That hardly ever happens.
Including his promotion to detective with all its benefits.
What about the benefits from the World Trade Center's Health Program or the Victim's Comp Fund?
I don't control those.
But your word has weight.
You know, he had some good years on the job, and some less good ones.
What's that a code for?
Smoked and drank for decades before he got sick.
But he also worked on the pile before he got sick.
It would be pushing it to attribute his illness strictly to working on the pile.
So you're denying him?
No, I am pushing it through.
But I thought you should know... it's a favor.
Well, then, thank you, Frank.
Or it will be when I sign them.
Which, I take it, you have not yet done.
You know, I thought we should go out together and visit Macklin and his family, make a private little ceremony of it.
Oh, that's a nice idea.
Right after you pick up that phone and call your legal eagle, Mr. Sloane, and tell him to post bail for the other guy.
I'm the archbishop of New York, Frank,
I'm not a bail bondsman.
You put your thumb on the scale, now it's time to take it off.
You forcing my hand?
I've been ducking calls from Immigration and Customs and the State Department.
I don't like ducking calls, makes me feel all sweaty.
You'd really withhold benefits from this officer's family?
Hey, it was a coin toss whether he qualifies, so, I flipped the coin till it came up heads.
Like I said, as a favor to you.
But your part is private, quiet.
What you're offering in return would be public and controversial.
You chose the playing field, not me.
Uh...
I don't like this, Frank.
More to the point, I don't like you in this.
Me, either.
I'm just gonna have to live with that.
Not much choice.
I don't have all day, Your Eminence.
Do we have a deal?
(line beeps)
Uh, can you find me Mr. Sloane, please?
(clears throat)
ERIN:
Were you aware that quantities of heroin were removed and replaced with sugar?
Well, I became aware when you brought it to my attention, recently.
Did you take some of the drugs and replace it with sugar?
On the advice of counsel, I'm going to invoke my Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
Isn't it true that during this time, you were addicted to painkillers because of a back injury?
On the advice of counsel...
ERIN:
Did you transition from using painkillers to using heroin?
Again, on the advice of counsel...
Counsel, approach.
Ms. Reagan, we can spare everyone a lot of agony here by granting this witness immunity to get his full testimony in this hearing.
In what world is that fair to my client?
A prosecutor who is stealing drugs gets immunity while the regular citizen gets prison.
Ms. Reagan?
No immunity.
I'd like to continue.
Then have at it.
Mr. Falk, you were an officer of the court who swore to uphold the law, didn't you?
I did.
Did you betray that oath?
On the advice of counsel,
I invoke my...
Did you betray your friends?
No!
- Your colleagues?
- No!
Did you betray that oath you took?
That wasn't my intention.
But that's what happened, isn't it?
(sighs)
JUDGE:
Mr. Falk?
Do you wish to invoke your Fifth Amendment again?
(voice breaking):
No, Your Honor.
I'm prepared to answer Ms. Reagan's question.
Did you betray your duty to uphold the law?
(cries):
Yes.
And for that...
I am profoundly sorry.
More than you or anyone else can possibly know.
And finally, Mr. Falk, did you ever tamper with evidence in order to convict someone that was innocent?
No, Ms. Reagan.
I never planted evidence.
Every case I brought was legitimate, including the one against Mr. Hickman.
If... if I have to go to prison... like the people I've prosecuted... so be it.
At least my conscious is clear now.
DANNY:
You know, the doctors wanted both of you guys to stay here for continued observation.
VRONSKY:
This is not necessary.
LEVIN:
Moscow doctors, best in the world.
If you'd both been a little more upfront, neither of you would be going home with gunshot wounds.
Oh, please.
These are marks of honor.
Souvenirs from New York.
Oh, and to think, we were gonna stop and get you NYPD coffee mugs.
(laughs) I've already took one from your desk.
Ha!
Just kidding.
(Levin groans)
If you ever come to Moscow, please let me know.
I will love to take you to Bolshoi.
So, what is this?
Potatoes Au gratin.
Or French for "cheesy deliciousness."
(all chuckle) And that's French for
"straight to your butt""
(chuckles) Exactly.
Made with Dubliner Irish cheddar, with an eye to the old sod.
It's the 101st anniversary of the Rising.
The what?
- The Easter Rising?
- Mm.
They don't teach that in school anymore, Jack.
DANNY:
They don't even give out books in school anymore.
(all laugh) It was the Irish, our ancestors, fighting for their independence in 1916.
And some of the family who didn't make it over here got caught up in that.
We had family who fought over there?
Mm-hmm.
- As soldiers?
- They weren't exactly soldiers.
They were fighting to get their country back from the British, and they called themselves "Rebels."
And you know what the British called those Rebels?
Micks?
Excuse me?
(Jamie laughs)
Terrorists.
Seriously?
ERIN:
Mm-hmm.
Bet you didn't think that term existed 100 years ago.
Actually, I didn't think it did.
So why were they called terrorists?
Because, by definition, they were.
Well, why not call them "guerillas"?
Isn't it the same thing?
JAMIE:
Well, guerilla's actually Spanish for "little war."
Their tactics are alike, but the big difference is that a terrorist will target civilians for political ends.
So, we are descended from terrorists.
Whoa...
Come on, that's a very college way of putting it.
FRANK:
Not terrorists the way they use the term now.
- I know.
- DANNY:
Right.
We have relatives who were freedom fighters, okay?
Let's just leave it at that.
- Amen.
- Here, here.
And one other thing:
hardly anybody who's here is really from here.
I guess you could say we're all foreigners.
Yeah, and usually they're fleeing some kind of grief in their own country.
- Some things never change.
- JAMIE:
We're not perfect, but no one's come up with a version 2.0 that's better, so...
So who gets to say that they're really, truly from here?
Munsees, Algonquins, Iroquois, and a whole bunch of other tribes whose names I've forgotten, they can.
Everyone else... is an immigrant.
Here's to all us great unwashed.
- Here, here.
- DANNY:
Drink to that.
ERIN:
Bottoms up.
Here, here.
- Cheers.
- FRANK:
Here, here. (Henry chuckles)

What are you doing in a parish church?
You ever spend time in one of your precinct houses?
Sure.
Have I answered your question?
In your way.
This an exercise in humility or just for show?
What good's humility if you don't make a show of it?
I mean, how's anyone gonna notice?
You're really on your game today.
I forget where things stand with us at the, favor bank.
Give me a break.
You got the best institutional memory in this city.
The name John Macklin mean anything to you?
Not offhand.
He was an altar boy in my first parish.
And then, worked at the 5-7 in the Bronx.
And I have been summoned here to talk about him because...?
He's got stage 4 cancer of the trachea in the esophagus.
The doctors told him he's only got less than a month.
He'll leave behind a wife and four boys.
I'll make time to go see him.
The family feels that he got the disease working on the pile after 9/11.
What's the doctor say?
You know how they are.
Claim's gotten caught up in red tape.
And you think the police commissioner can untangle it and get this classified as a line of duty death.
I hope so.
You do know I get a lot of requests like this.
But not from me.
Point taken.
I'm just asking you to give it a look, see what can be done to help.
McLaughlin.
Macklin.
M-A-C-K.
Got it.
I'd be in your debt.
No.
We'd be even because you would say
I've been gifted with the opportunity to serve my church.
You know me too well.
I don't think we're in any danger of that.
What do you say, Mullhearn?
You know, working in the property clerk's office, living the dream.
Yeah, well, I called ahead.
I'm picking up the drug evidence for the Hickman case.
The, Wall Street drug courier thing?
Yeah.
Trial starts this afternoon.
So, let's get to it, all right?
They said it'd be ready.
All right, all right.
I ain't got all day.
All right.
What the hell?
There a problem?
Well, there's ants all over this thing.
Who knew that they liked heroin that much?
They don't.
They like brown sugar.
Someone's gotten into this.
Hey, Anthony, don't look at me.
We've lost things before, but this is right where it was supposed to be.
Yeah, maybe so, but this evidence has been tampered with.
Hey!
Police!
Hey, break it up!
Hey!
It's over, it's over!
Hey, calm down, calm down.
Hey!
It's over.
You, what happened here?
One minute, I'm behind the counter, I'm filling orders, and the next, these two are going at it like a couple of animals.
All right, what's up, guys?
This lunatic pulled a knife on me.
Who you calling a lunatic?
You grabbed the knife first!
What are you talking about?
You grabbed it!
All right.
All right, you boys need to calm down or you're both getting locked up, you understand?
This man tried to kill me.
I want him charged with murderous assault.
Yeah, you mean felony assault.
However you say it, he's the mad dog.
He needs to be locked away!
All right, both of you need to calm down now.
I want him charged!
I want him charged, as well!
All right, cuff 'em up.
That's it, you're both going to jail.
What the hell, Baez?
Go around the block for a hot dog,
I come back, it's World War III.
Male, white, with a gun, approximately 50-years-of-age, approached the female victim while she was walking with her son and just started shooting.
And what about these two?
Two male victims got shot trying to protect her.
Both of them are likely.
She's not doing so good, either, but the EMTs think she'll probably survive.
Is she able to talk to us?
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Miss?
Detective Reagan, this is Detective Baez.
What can you tell us about the man who shot you?
Sergei, he's lost his mind.
So you know him?
He got a call.
He wanted me to go with him to Russia and leave my son.
And when I... when I say no, he gets his gun and...
That's your little boy over there?
Okay, we're gonna take care of him and you, all right?
But first, you got to tell us about this Sergei guy.
All right, do you know where he lives?
Do you know where we could find him?
He-he could be anywhere.
Please,
I must tell you, he was with KGB and-and Special Forces in Chechnya.
We can handle him, all right?
Don't worry about us.
No, no, you're not understanding.
They call him Rambo.
He will kill anyone, any time.
If you are lucky, you never find him.
Three separate reviews of Officer Macklin's claim are the same degree of muddy.
About working the pile?
No.
He worked most days for a good three weeks.
Then, what's muddy?
He drank like a fish, smoked like a chimney.
Okay.
Well...
Well what?
As far as I'm concerned, if you worked that pile and got sick, you and your family should be taken care of, end of story.
You're not an insurance claims adjuster.
For which, I thank God every day.
See that arms get twisted.
Yes, sir.
There's something else.
We've got a problem off a brawl in a bagel shop.
The Archdiocese of New York got involved.
Catholic Church, fight in a bagel shop?
This is a joke, right?
I wish.
One of the cross-complainants is from an Iraqi Christian family the Church sponsored to come over here.
The Church bailed him out on orders of the archbishop.
Which is his right, maybe even his duty.
Maybe so.
The other complainant is a Muslim doctor from Sudan.
His family's in a refugee camp.
They're both here illegally, both charged with felonies, which puts them on a list.
Hey, not our problem.
Frank, you met with the archbishop.
Not about this.
The spin is that you and the archbishop teamed up to let the Christian go free.
He didn't go free!
He made bail.
I don't set bail.
I'm not a judge.
It's not our problem.
The mayor's very proud of our status as a sanctuary city.
He feels this dents that.
Please.
If the mayor wants to post bail for the Muslim detainee, let him have at it.
But I am the police commissioner of New York City, not sanctuary city.
We both knew this issue would land on our desks sooner or later.
It didn't just land.
It was placed, by the mayor.
Get it off.
Off what?
Off my desk.
How?
I don't care how.
Sure you do.
Start with City Hall, see if they got a sanctuary city rug they can sweep it under.
I don't see nothing.
Come on, what do you mean you don't see nothing?
I mean, three people shot right out in front of your place, you didn't see any of it?
We were very busy with the customers.
A dozen shots rang out.
You didn't hear anything?
You didn't see which way the shooter ran, nothing?
I had lot of orders.
Bred kakoy to.
Wow, how much Russian do you speak?
That's all I know.
What do you know?
Intel confirmed this Rambo guy, Sergei Karenin, was here legally on a diplomatic visa.
The part about the KGB and the Special Forces is true, as well.
Where is he now?
6-4 squad went to his apartment.
The place is cleared out.
Car's abandoned, his phone is dead.
How do you say "in the wind" in Russian?
Well, somebody's got to be helping him.
I don't know, but, Danny, there's two detectives from Moscow on their way here to help with the investigation.
Wait, what?
Since when do we work with the Russians?
We don't even have extradition with them.
There's something called a mutual legal assistance treaty.
My God.
Where we trade help with other cases.
If we're looking for someone over there, and the powers that be say we should be trying to get along.
Okay, but this just happened.
You said those guys are already on their way.
How could that be?
Yeah, hinky to me, too.
All I know is that we're supposed to cooperate.
Ay-yi-yi.
What's the matter?
We got to talk now.
Right now?
It's important.
I couldn't call ahead.
You've been in court the whole time.
Ms. Reagan, are we ready to proceed?
Your Honor, may we approach?
Yes.
What's going on?
We need a break.
We're having trouble putting our hands on an exhibit for the case.
Well, this is an epic mess.
After three years, our key evidence is gone?
I got our people up there right now asking questions.
Well, is it possible it's just another clerical mistake?
No way.
It's the correct weight for the drugs.
Somebody deliberately substituted brown sugar for the heroin so we wouldn't notice the difference until the ants got in.
Anthony, I don't even know how many people put their hands on the evidence before we inherited this case.
Do we even have a paper trail?
We're putting together a list now.
It's a lot of people.
Okay, so Hickman was providing drugs to a half dozen Wall Street firms.
Is it possible that someone is paying big money to derail this case?
Anything is possible, including a mistrial.
Erin, if this gets out...
No, I know, we've got to keep this on the DL for now.
But, Anthony, there's another crime here, and someone on our end is involved with it.
You know what this is about, right?
A Christian and a Muslim walk into a bagel store?
The P.C.'s hands are tied.
He can't just tell the D.A. to release the other guy.
We didn't suggest that.
You suggested our department's turning a blind eye.
Trying to and failing.
It's not our bailiwick.
Until the P.C.'s good friend, the archbishop, weighed in.
Reagan doesn't dictate to the archdiocese.
He has his ear, though.
Well, he certainly didn't in this matter.
What are you looking for here, Garrett?
Cooperation, some ratcheting down of the rhetoric.
You guys are a broken record when it comes to trashing One PP lately.
You are barking up the wrong tree on this.
Being a sanctuary city is high on the mayor's list of priorities.
You mean it's high on the list of what the mayor loves to see when he's looking in the mirror.
Look, we didn't open this can of worms, that archbishop did.
What are you saying, I should counsel the P.C.
to lean on the archbishop?
Couldn't have said it better myself.
You know, it's this kind of politicizing that doesn't help anyone.
Maybe just once, you could stand up for something other than saving your own hide.
Are you coming to poker on Sunday?
I got a family thing.
I'll be half an hour late.
Intel says these Russian detectives are almost here.
They are.
In fact, their I.D. pictures just came through.
You ready?
Yeah.
Wow.
That could be the new Mr. Maria Baez.
Shut up.
I'm just saying.
Let's take a look at bachelor number two.
Mr. December, from the KGB pinup calendar.
No.
Putin taught him that smile personally.
You Reagan and Baez?
You know, they're not supposed to let you up here from the front desk without an escort.
We expedited procedure.
I'm Levin, this is Vronsky.
Good to meet you.
How was your flight?
Long, boring.
Ran out of vodka over Atlantic.
Thank you.
Now that we got the pleasantries out of the way, how is it that you guys were on your way over here before this Rambo even went crazy and started shooting people?
First we eat, then we discuss case.
You want to go somewhere and have dinner?
That would be better.
On the flight, they only had peanuts and dry pretzels.
Excuse me, there are two people dead and one's in intensive care, so we don't give a damn how hungry you are, we're in a hurry to find this guy.
We will eat, then we will drink, and then, we will find him.
Okay.
Let's get one thing straight, okay?
You're in our country now, which means we're driving this thing and you're just along for the ride.
I don't think so, my friend.
We have crucial information to catch this man.
Great, we'd love for you to share it with us.
Please.
You cannot find him without our assistance.
And we are very hungry.
Okay, we'll eat.
Just don't expect us to pick up the tab.
Thanks for coming in on short notice, Mickey.
Sure, buddy.
Just a little confused.
Thought the Hickman trial was starting.
It is, but we ran into a problem.
This is you vouchering for the drug evidence.
- Is that correct?
- Yeah.
I was one of the original investigators.
What's going on?
Well, half the drugs are missing now, Mickey.
Somebody pulled a switch.
What, you think it was me, my brother?
You just put yourself at the scene.
So the Puerto Rican dude must have stole the heroin.
Either sold it on the street, maybe did it himself?
This is your chance to tell it your way.
No.
Look, lady, you can drug test me right now.
Strap a polygraph on me.
I've got nothing to hide.
You have a better explanation?
Look, I know I'm just a street guy, but I followed procedure.
I made the collar, I vouchered the evidence, and when somebody in this office needed it,
I picked it up.
But I am not gonna take the fall for one of you guys.
What are you suggesting?
I'm not suggesting.
I'm telling.
When I signed the drugs out for a pretrial hearing, they stayed in the property safe here, in this damn office.
So instead of pointing the finger, you best get your own house in order.
Eti lyido smeshny.
What'd he say?
He's being critical.
Of what?
Of your country.
He's saying women are smarter than the men, and stronger, too.
Can't argue with that.
What'd he say now?
He want to know if you're sleeping with your partner.
That's funny.
Do you sleep with your partner?
Hey, we don't do that around here, okay?
We're working.
If you say so.
Zda-ró-vye.
All right, all right, enough already.
Look, this Rambo guy's running around, and you two are sitting here getting drunk.
We're working as well, right now.
How about you tell us what's really going on with this Rambo guy?
You obviously had some kind of tip he was gonna pop his cork.
Okay, lady.
Politsiya politsiy.
"Police is police."
We had information he was upset.
About what?
He call Moscow and tell 'em that he was displeased.
Yeah, we know about that already.
Got called back for an assignment, but he didn't want to go without his girl.
We have information, too, okay?
But we're trying to string the pieces together here, fill in the blanks.
Excuse me, pretty lady.
Where's he going?
He's going to bathroom, even though I tell him to keep it.
All right, look, there's a killer running around, and you guys aren't telling us anything.
Maybe because we need to trust you first.
Fine.
Down the hatch.
Everybody down!
Stay down!
Police!
Watch it!
Vronsky!
Hands up.
Hands up!
Turn around.
On byl zdes'.
Reagan, Baez!
He was here.
Rambo was here?
Yeah.
And he got away again?
You see anyone?
Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?
He say he don't know, but he knows.
I didn't start this, Frank.
One of them started it.
The Muslim, according to the Christian.
Well, you brought it into our world when you bailed the guy out.
First things first.
This is the first thing.
Not from where I sit.
Have you looked into the matter of Officer Macklin?
It's John Macklin now.
He left the department eight months ago.
Once a Catholic, once a cop, same thing.
It's complicated.
I'm looking into it.
Well, look faster, please.
The poor man is barely hanging on.
I would like to help, if I'm able.
You're able.
Just as you are able to ask your Christian to withdraw his complaint.
Please.
That would be wrong.
No, it would be pragmatic, and it would go a long way to putting out a fire that you poured gas on.
What if Mr. Asad won't withdraw his complaint?
I think he'll consider it.
You think?
You mean you know.
I'm confident if Mr. Khoury will, he will.
I can't.
Why not?
He looks at it as standing up for all his people.
It was a fight over cutting in line in a bagel shop, Kevin.
It would be the wrong way out, Frank.
It would be an abuse of my influence.
I'd be using the power of the faith to...
You had a hand in starting this, you have a responsibility to finish it.
I have a lot of responsibilities.
High on that list is defending the flock.
Your Eminence.
Yes, we're late.
I'll tell you what.
You get Officer Macklin's health claim put through, and also see that he gets promoted to Detective First Grade so his family can receive the pay and benefits that go along with it, then we can revisit this conversation.
You're doubling down.
I'm defending the flock.
May God bless you and keep you safe.
Thank you, Your Eminence.
Thanks for coming in, Gary.
I'm happy for the excuse to stop by and see old friends.
So, what's up?
Just following up on an issue from a case I inherited when you left the office.
Tommy Hickman?
Right.
Of course.
I thought that trial was just beginning.
It is, but we've hit a roadblock.
Evidence had been tampered with.
Are you kidding?
Someone substituted sugar for the drugs that we wanted to present at the trial.
You think Hickman got to someone in the property clerk's office?
We're talking to everyone that would have handled that evidence.
Of course, I'll get you a list of every investigator I worked with.
Well, we've spoken to all of them.
Hey, Anthony, what's going on?
Gary, we've been hearing some stories about why you really left the office.
You know why I left the office, Erin.
We talked about it.
It was a tough time in my marriage.
And there are other rumors about why your marriage was in trouble.
Rumors are just rumors.
Gary, we have to ask you, did you have a substance abuse problem?
I don't see why I have to answer that,
I-I don't work here anymore.
Come on, Gary.
You wouldn't take that from a skel.
Why should we take it from you?
I'm not some skel, Anthony.
I was a prosecutor at this office for ten years.
And, if I had a problem, it's over.
I'm remarried, we just had a baby.
Gary, you know how this looks?
Those drugs were kept in a safe in your personal office, while you were preparing for hearing.
Don't go there, you guys.
Tell me, did you steal them for your own use?
My God, how can you even ask me that?
We have to, we started trial.
Do you know what's the first thing I teach my students?
Never ask a question if you can't handle the answer.
Yeah, you also taught me, if you have an inconvenient fact, you need to get in front of it.
So you need to come clean, Gary, right now.
No, you don't.
I'm warning you.
Not just as a former colleague, but as a friend, if you start spreading dirt, it won't just get on me.
What are you talking about?
I successfully prosecuted 30 or 40 drug cases while at this office.
If you smear me, all those criminals could go free.
Is it worth it to you, just to go after that piddly little courier?
Come on, Gary, that's no kind of choice.
Let's end this conversation right now or I promise you, we'll all rue the day.
Nyet.
Mne ne nuzhny narkotiki.
Well, madam, he say he don't need any of your pain drugs.
It's American weakness.
Yeah.
Let's talk outside.
Give us a second.
Why the hell didn't you tell us you had a tip Rambo would be in the restaurant?
Classified information.
Classified my ass, we could've had the place surrounded.
Rambo wouldn't have got away again, and the witnesses would be talking to us.
We cannot share our sources with Americans.
Do you tell us everything that you know?
If one more person gets killed because you're not telling us what you know, we're gonna have a serious problem.
And I don't mean a Russian-America problem,
I mean a me and you personal problem!
Okay, Reagan, relax.
Sergei, Rambo, he went to Chechnya.
And he was involved in, what we call,
"acts of extreme subjugation"
with terrorists and their families.
He come back not the same.
Meaning he snapped.
When Moscow called him back, he said he changed sides.
"Changed sides"?
Meaning he became a terrorist?
And now he's running around my city, and you don't think that's something that you should share with me?
In all probability, he's just looking for a means to escape to another country.
In all probability, he could planning his next attack right now.
That is true, he's terrorist.
We're gonna start working together before we end up facing a wholesale slaughter, you got it?
Maybe, but it is still essential to control the flow of information.
No "maybe."
My city, my country, my way.
We work together.
It's okay.
So, this is the safe where the drugs were being held before the hearing?
Yeah, only a handful of people had the combination, and Gary was one of them.
And nobody in the office knew what he was up to?
No, he was being smart about it, like addicts can be.
He knew the drugs had already been subjected to a lab analysis, so he substituted sugar every time he used so the weight and color looked the same.
And because he thought we'd never get to trial, he'd never get found out.
He says he's clean.
I think I believe him.
Well, good for him.
Meanwhile, he's left us with a big fat problem with the Hickman case.
Have we tried to do a quick and dirty plea deal?
It'd be sticky.
Sticky's what we do here.
Hickman's lawyer already senses we have a major problem.
The only deal he's gonna consider is no jail time for his client.
Erin, I don't like cutting Hickman that big of a break either, but we need to handle this as quickly and as quietly as possible.
I know, but it's too late.
The case is too high profile, and even if we make a deal, there's no guarantee that Hickman's gonna keep his mouth shut.
If it comes out that Gary tampered with evidence, every case he was involved in will be reopened.
Gary's going to prison.
And he's a friend, and a mentor to both of us.
I...
I have to say, Monica, I don't...
I know.
There are no good options.
I'm sorry, I still don't understand.
My English is not so good.
Funny, considering you went to high school in Coney Island.
Why don't you cut the crap, all right?
We know you helped Rambo get away from the crime scene.
So lose the accent and tell us where the hell he is.
If you know about his nickname, why do you think I'd help you get him?
What?
I have idea.
Great.
I'm thinking I should speak to him alone.
Do you have room with a window, no bars?
So you can hang him out the window by his ankles, is that what you're talking about?
There would be more honesty in conversation.
No, we don't do things like that around here.
My clearance rate is almost 100%.
What is yours?
Look, we make cases the right way so they stand up, you understand?
Okay.
How do you say, um... it is your funeral.
Thought we were gonna work together here.
American, you thought it would happen right away?
Okay.
Where were we?
Will you please tell the detective what you just told me?
Tell me what?
Promise you won't say I talked.
To who?
Right?
Fine.
Rambo said he just needed to go some place where he could chill and clear his system without being tracked.
What does he mean clear his system?
He's really not a guy you want to ask a lot of questions.
Clear his system?
Clear his system, you hear...?
Hey!
Hey, you see where the dumb looking Russian guy went?
How did you know he was headed back to the same restaurant?
I didn't.
It's a GPS I put on his car before.
Like the other Reagan said, trust, but verify.
What do you think he's doing here?
Don't know.
He must think we miss him.
Let's find out.
Please.
Your presence is unhelpful and unnecessary.
Duly noted.
Where's Rambo?
I'm trying to find out, but now you're getting in the way.
We're getting in the way?
How about we lock you two up for obstructing?
We'll put you in a nice small room with bars on the windows.
Okay, okay, we'll do it together.
Police is police.
Right?
Wrong.
Pokazhi mne.
What, he's in the freezer?
What'd she say?
It's passageway.
She wants you to go first.
Step aside.
Go.
5-4, detectives requesting a 10-85 forthwith at... where the hell are we anyway?
Behind the restaurant, lady.
Russian bathhouse adjacent to our previous location.
Why would Rambo come here?
Clear his system, steal clothes, I.D., get a massage.
Hey, kid, hey.
You seen him?
For sure, he is here.
Reagan, once he knows he's in a corner, he gonna be much more dangerous.
Should wait for emergency service.
We don't have time.
Son of a bitch.
We got two in here.
10-13, two dead at the scene.
An active shooter in the building.
Where'd he go?
What'd she say, Levin?
Levin!
Where the hell did he go?
Move, get out of the way!
Police!
- Police, move!
- Back there.
Back there.
Get out of the way.
Move, move!
Move it!
Which way, which way?
!
There, there!
Turn it off.
Hey.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm hit.
He's in here.
Sergei Karenin!
Police!
Sergei?
Reagan, what are you waiting for?
Shut up!
Don't be a girl!
Shut up!
Reagan?
I got him.
KGB, my ass.
Everything you wanted.
That hardly ever happens.
Including his promotion to detective with all its benefits.
What about the benefits from the World Trade Center's Health Program or the Victim's Comp Fund?
I don't control those.
But your word has weight.
You know, he had some good years on the job, and some less good ones.
What's that a code for?
Smoked and drank for decades before he got sick.
But he also worked on the pile before he got sick.
It would be pushing it to attribute his illness strictly to working on the pile.
So you're denying him?
No, I am pushing it through.
But I thought you should know... it's a favor.
Well, then, thank you, Frank.
Or it will be when I sign them.
Which, I take it, you have not yet done.
You know, I thought we should go out together and visit Macklin and his family, make a private little ceremony of it.
That's a nice idea.
Right after you pick up that phone and call your legal eagle, Mr. Sloane, and tell him to post bail for the other guy.
I'm the archbishop of New York, Frank,
I'm not a bail bondsman.
You put your thumb on the scale, now it's time to take it off.
You forcing my hand?
I've been ducking calls from Immigration and Customs and the State Department.
I don't like ducking calls, makes me feel all sweaty.
You'd really withhold benefits from this officer's family?
Hey, it was a coin toss whether he qualifies, so, I flipped the coin till it came up heads.
Like I said, as a favor to you.
But your part is private, quiet.
What you're offering in return would be public and controversial.
You chose the playing field, not me.
I don't like this, Frank.
More to the point, I don't like you in this.
Me, either.
I'm just gonna have to live with that.
Not much choice.
I don't have all day, Your Eminence.
Do we have a deal?
Can you find me Mr. Sloane, please?
Were you aware that quantities of heroin were removed and replaced with sugar?
Well, I became aware when you brought it to my attention, recently.
Did you take some of the drugs and replace it with sugar?
On the advice of counsel, I'm going to invoke my Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
Isn't it true that during this time, you were addicted to painkillers because of a back injury?
On the advice of counsel...
Did you transition from using painkillers to using heroin?
Again, on the advice of counsel...
Counsel, approach.
Ms. Reagan, we can spare everyone a lot of agony here by granting this witness immunity to get his full testimony in this hearing.
In what world is that fair to my client?
A prosecutor who is stealing drugs gets immunity while the regular citizen gets prison.
Ms. Reagan?
No immunity.
I'd like to continue.
Then have at it.
Mr. Falk, you were an officer of the court who swore to uphold the law, didn't you?
I did.
Did you betray that oath?
On the advice of counsel,
I invoke my...
Did you betray your friends?
No!
Your colleagues?
No!
Did you betray that oath you took?
That wasn't my intention.
But that's what happened, isn't it?
Mr. Falk?
Do you wish to invoke your Fifth Amendment again?
No, Your Honor.
I'm prepared to answer Ms. Reagan's question.
Did you betray your duty to uphold the law?
Yes.
And for that...
I am profoundly sorry.
More than you or anyone else can possibly know.
And finally, Mr. Falk, did you ever tamper with evidence in order to convict someone that was innocent?
No, Ms. Reagan.
I never planted evidence.
Every case I brought was legitimate, including the one against Mr. Hickman.
If... if I have to go to prison... like the people I've prosecuted... so be it.
At least my conscious is clear now.
You know, the doctors wanted both of you guys to stay here for continued observation.
This is not necessary.
Moscow doctors, best in the world.
If you'd both been a little more upfront, neither of you would be going home with gunshot wounds.
Please.
These are marks of honor.
Souvenirs from New York.
And to think, we were gonna stop and get you NYPD coffee mugs.
I've already took one from your desk.
Ha!
Just kidding.
If you ever come to Moscow, please let me know.
I will love to take you to Bolshoi.
So, what is this?
Potatoes au gratin.
Or French for "cheesy deliciousness."
And that's French for
"straight to your butt."
Exactly.
Made with Dubliner Irish cheddar, with an eye to the old sod.
It's the 101st anniversary of the Rising.
The what?
The Easter Rising?
They don't teach that in school anymore, Jack.
They don't even give out books in school anymore.
It was the Irish, our ancestors, fighting for their independence in 1916.
And some of the family who didn't make it over here got caught up in that.
We had family who fought over there?
As soldiers?
They weren't exactly soldiers.
They were fighting to get their country back from the British, and they called themselves "rebels."
And you know what the British called those rebels?
Micks?
Excuse me?
Terrorists.
Seriously?
Bet you didn't think that term existed 100 years ago.
Actually, I didn't think it did.
So why were they called terrorists?
Because, by definition, they were.
Well, why not call them "guerillas"?
Isn't it the same thing?
Well, guerilla's actually Spanish for "little war."
Their tactics are alike, but the big difference is that a terrorist will target civilians for political ends.
So, we are descended from terrorists.
Whoa...
Come on, that's a very college way of putting it.
Not terrorists the way they use the term now.
- I know.
- Right.
We have relatives who were freedom fighters, okay?
Let's just leave it at that.
Amen.
Here, here.
Hardly anybody who's here is really from here.
I guess you could say we're all foreigners.
Yeah, and usually they're fleeing some kind of grief in their own country.
- Some things never change.
- We're not perfect, but no one's come up with a version 2.0 that's better, so...
So who gets to say that they're really, truly from here?
Munsees, Algonquins, Iroquois, and a whole bunch of other tribes whose names I've forgotten, they can.
Everyone else... is an immigrant.
Here's to all us great unwashed.
- Here, here.
- Drink to that.
Bottoms up.

You're really on your game today.
KEARNS:
I forget where things stand with us at the, uh, favor bank.
Oh, give me a break.
You got the best institutional memory in this city.
The name John Macklin mean anything to you?
Not offhand.
He was an altar boy in my first parish.
And then, worked at the 5-7 in the Bronx.
And I have been summoned here to talk about him because...?
He's got stage 4 cancer of the trachea in the esophagus.
The doctors told him he's only got less than a month.
He'll leave behind a wife and four boys.
I'll make time to go see him.
The family feels that he got the disease working on the pile after 9/11.
What's the doctor say?
(scoffs) You know how they are.
Claim's gotten caught up in red tape.
And you think the police commissioner can untangle it and get this classified as a line of duty death.
I hope so.
You do know I get a lot of requests like this.
But not from me.
Point taken.
I'm just asking you to give it a look, see what can be done to help.
McLaughlin.
Uh, Macklin.
M-A-C-K.
Got it.
I'd be in your debt.
No.

You know me too well.
I don't think we're in any danger of that.
What do you say, Mullhearn?
You know, working in the property clerk's office, living the dream.
Yeah, well, I called ahead.
I'm picking up the drug evidence for the Hickman case.
The, uh, Wall Street drug courier thing?
Yeah.
Trial starts this afternoon.
So, let's get to it, all right?
They said it'd be ready.
All right, all right.
ABETEMARCO:

All right.

Well, there's ants all over this thing.
Who knew that they liked heroin that much?
They don't.
They like brown sugar.
Someone's gotten into this.
Hey, Anthony, don't look at me.
We've lost things before, but this is right where it was supposed to be.
Yeah, maybe so, but this evidence has been tampered with.

Hey, break it up!
Hey!

You grabbed the knife first!
What are you talking about?
You grabbed it!
All right.
All right, you boys need to calm down or you're both getting locked up, you understand?

Male, white, with a gun, approximately 50-years-of-age, approached the female victim while she was walking with her son and just started shooting.
And what about these two?
BAEZ:
Two male victims got shot trying to protect her.
Both of them are likely.
She's not doing so good, either, but the EMTs think she'll probably survive.
DANNY:
Is she able to talk to us?
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Miss?
Detective Reagan, this is Detective Baez.
What can you tell us about the man who shot you?
Sergei, he's lost his mind.

He got a call.
He wanted me to go with him to Russia and leave my son.
And when I... when I say no, he gets his gun and...
That's your little boy over there?

But first, you got to tell us about this Sergei guy.

Three separate reviews of Officer Macklin's claim are the same degree of muddy.
About working the pile?
No.
He worked most days for a good three weeks.
Then, what's muddy?
He drank like a fish, smoked like a chimney.
Okay.
Well...
Well what?
As far as I'm concerned, if you worked that pile and got sick, you and your family should be taken care of, end of story.
(scoffs) You're not an insurance claims adjuster.
For which, I thank God every day.
See that arms get twisted.
Yes, sir.
(tosses notepad)
There's something else.
We've got a problem off a brawl in a bagel shop.
The Archdiocese of New York got involved.
Catholic Church, fight in a bagel shop?
This is a joke, right?
I wish.
One of the cross-complainants is from an Iraqi Christian family the Church sponsored to come over here.
The Church bailed him out on orders of the archbishop.
Which is his right, maybe even his duty.
Maybe so.
The other complainant is a Muslim doctor from Sudan.
(sighs) His family's in a refugee camp.
They're both here illegally, both charged with felonies, which puts them on a list.
Hey, not our problem.
Frank, you met with the archbishop.
Not about this.
The spin is that you and the archbishop teamed up to let the Christian go free.
He didn't go free!
He made bail.
I don't set bail.
I'm not a judge.
It's not our problem.
The mayor's very proud of our status as a sanctuary city.
He feels this dents that.
Oh, please.
If the mayor wants to post bail for the Muslim detainee, let him have at it.
But I am the police commissioner of New York City, not sanctuary city.
We both knew this issue would land on our desks sooner or later.
It didn't just land.
It was placed, by the mayor.
Get it off.
Off what?
Off my desk.
How?
I don't care how.
Sure you do.
Start with City Hall, see if they got a sanctuary city rug they can sweep it under.
(in Russian accent):
I don't see nothing.
Come on, what do you mean you don't see nothing?
I mean, three people shot right out in front of your place, you didn't see any of it?
We were very busy with the customers.
A dozen shots rang out.
You didn't hear anything?
You didn't see which way the shooter ran, nothing?
I had lot of orders.
Bred kakoy to.
Wow, how much Russian do you speak?
That's all I know.
What do you know?
Intel confirmed this Rambo guy, Sergei Karenin, was here legally on a diplomatic visa.
The part about the KGB and the Special Forces is true, as well.
Where is he now?
6-4 squad went to his apartment.
The place is cleared out.
Car's abandoned, his phone is dead.
How do you say "in the wind" in Russian?
Well, somebody's got to be helping him.
I don't know, but, Danny, there's two detectives from Moscow on their way here to help with the investigation.
Wait, what?
Since when do we work with the Russians?
We don't even have extradition with them.
There's something called a mutual legal assistance treaty.
Oh, my God.
Where we trade help with other cases.
If we're looking for someone over there, and the powers that be say we should be trying to get along.
Okay, but this just happened.
You said those guys are already on their way.
How could that be?
Yeah, hinky to me, too.
All I know is that we're supposed to cooperate.
Ay-yi-yi.
What's the matter?
We got to talk now.
Right now?
It's important.
I couldn't call ahead.
You've been in court the whole time.
(whispers indistinctly)
Ms. Reagan, are we ready to proceed?
Your Honor, may we approach?
Yes.
What's going on?
We need a break.
We're having trouble putting our hands on an exhibit for the case.
(sighs)
Well, this is an epic mess.
After three years, our key evidence is gone?
I got our people up there right now asking questions.
Well, is it possible it's just another clerical mistake?
No way.
It's the correct weight for the drugs.
Somebody deliberately substituted brown sugar for the heroin so we wouldn't notice the difference until the ants got in.
Anthony, I don't even know how many people put their hands on the evidence before we inherited this case.
Do we even have a paper trail?
We're putting together a list now.
It's a lot of people.
Okay, so Hickman was providing drugs to a half dozen Wall Street firms.
Is it possible that someone is paying big money to derail this case?
Anything is possible, including a mistrial.
Erin, if this gets out...
No, I know, we've got to keep this on the DL for now.
But, Anthony, there's another crime here, and someone on our end is involved with it.
You know what this is about, right?
A Christian and a Muslim walk into a bagel store?
The P.C.'s hands are tied.
He can't just tell the D.A. to release the other guy.
We didn't suggest that.
You suggested our department's turning a blind eye.
Trying to and failing.
It's not our bailiwick.
Until the P.C.'s good friend, the archbishop, weighed in.
Reagan doesn't dictate to the archdiocese.
Oh, he has his ear, though.
Well, he certainly didn't in this matter.
What are you looking for here, Garrett?
Cooperation, some ratcheting down of the rhetoric.
You guys are a broken record when it comes to trashing One PP lately.
You are barking up the wrong tree on this.
Being a sanctuary city is high on the mayor's list of priorities.
You mean it's high on the list of what the mayor loves to see when he's looking in the mirror.
Look, we didn't open this can of worms, that archbishop did.
What are you saying, I should counsel the P.C.
to lean on the archbishop?
Couldn't have said it better myself.
You know, it's this kind of politicizing that doesn't help anyone.
Maybe just once, you could stand up for something other than saving your own hide.
Are you coming to poker on Sunday?
I got a family thing.
I'll be half an hour late.
Intel says these Russian detectives are almost here.
They are.
In fact, their I.D. pictures just came through.
You ready?
Yeah.

Wow.
That could be the new Mr. Maria Baez.
Shut up.
I'm just saying.
Let's take a look at bachelor number two.

No.
Putin taught him that smile personally.

You know, they're not supposed to let you up here from the front desk without an escort.
We expedited procedure.
I'm Levin, this is Vronsky.
BAEZ:
Good to meet you.
How was your flight?
Long, boring.
Ran out of vodka over Atlantic.
Uh... thank you.
(tosses file) Now that we got the pleasantries out of the way, how is it that you guys were on your way over here before this Rambo even went crazy and started shooting people?
First we eat, then we discuss case.
(chuckles) You want to go somewhere and have dinner?
That would be better.
On the flight, they only had peanuts and dry pretzels.
DANNY:
Excuse me, there are two people dead and one's in intensive care, so we don't give a damn how hungry you are, we're in a hurry to find this guy.
We will eat, then we will drink, and then, we will find him.
Okay.
Let's get one thing straight, okay?
You're in our country now, which means we're driving this thing and you're just along for the ride.
I don't think so, my friend.
We have crucial information to catch this man.
Great, we'd love for you to share it with us.
Please.
You cannot find him without our assistance.
And we are very hungry.
Okay, we'll eat.
Just don't expect us to pick up the tab.
Thanks for coming in on short notice, Mickey.
Sure, buddy.
Just a little confused.
Thought the Hickman trial was starting.
It is, but we ran into a problem.
This is you vouchering for the drug evidence.
Is that correct?
MICKEY:
Yeah.
I was one of the original investigators.
What's going on?
Well, half the drugs are missing now, Mickey.
Somebody pulled a switch.
What, you think it was me, my brother?
You just put yourself at the scene.
Oh, so the Puerto Rican dude must have stole the heroin.
Either sold it on the street, maybe did it himself?
This is your chance to tell it your way.
No.
Look, lady, you can drug test me right now.
Strap a polygraph on me.
I've got nothing to hide.
You have a better explanation?
Look, I know I'm just a street guy, but I followed procedure.
I made the collar, I vouchered the evidence, and when somebody in this office needed it,
I picked it up.
But I am not gonna take the fall for one of you guys.
What are you suggesting?
I'm not suggesting.
I'm telling.
When I signed the drugs out for a pretrial hearing, they stayed in the property safe here, in this damn office.
So instead of pointing the finger, you best get your own house in order.

What'd he say now?
He want to know if you're sleeping with your partner.
DANNY:
That's funny.
Do you sleep with your partner?
Hey, we don't do that around here, okay?
We're working.
If you say so.
Zda-ró-vye.
All right, all right, enough already.
Look, this Rambo guy's running around, and you two are sitting here getting drunk.
We're working as well, right now.

How about you tell us what's really going on with this Rambo guy?
You obviously had some kind of tip he was gonna pop his cork.
LEVIN:
Okay, lady.
(vodka pours)
Politsiya politsiy.
"Police is police."
We had information he was upset.
About what?
He call Moscow and tell 'em that he was displeased.
Yeah, we know about that already.
Got called back for an assignment, but he didn't want to go without his girl.
We have information, too, okay?
But we're trying to string the pieces together here, fill in the blanks.
Excuse me, pretty lady.
(sniffs)
Where's he going?
LEVIN:
He's going to bathroom, even though I tell him to keep it.
All right, look, there's a killer running around, and you guys aren't telling us anything.
Maybe because we need to trust you first.
Fine.
Down the hatch.

Everybody down!
Stay down!

Watch it!
LEVIN:
Vronsky!
Hands up.
Hands up!
Turn around.

He was here.
Rambo was here?
Yeah.
And he got away again?
You see anyone?
Huh?
Where'd he go?
(speaks Russian) Where'd he go?
He say he don't know, but he knows.
(handcuffs rattle)
I didn't start this, Frank.
One of them started it.
The Muslim, according to the Christian.
Well, you brought it into our world when you bailed the guy out.
First things first.
This is the first thing.
Not from where I sit.
Have you looked into the matter of Officer Macklin?
It's John Macklin now.
He left the department eight months ago.
Once a Catholic, once a cop, same thing.
It's complicated.
I'm looking into it.
Well, look faster, please.
The poor man is barely hanging on.
I would like to help, if I'm able.
You're able.
Just as you are able to ask your Christian to withdraw his complaint.
Ah... huh.
Please.
That would be wrong.
No, it would be pragmatic, and it would go a long way to putting out a fire that you poured gas on.
What if Mr. Asad won't withdraw his complaint?
Oh, I think he'll consider it.
You think?
You mean you know.
I'm confident if Mr. Khoury will, he will.
I can't.
Why not?
He looks at it as standing up for all his people.
It was a fight over cutting in line in a bagel shop, Kevin.
It would be the wrong way out, Frank.
It would be an abuse of my influence.
I'd be using the power of the faith to...
You had a hand in starting this, you have a responsibility to finish it.
I have a lot of responsibilities.
High on that list is defending the flock.
(knock on door)
Your Eminence.
Yes, we're late.
I'll tell you what.
You get Officer Macklin's health claim put through, and also see that he gets promoted to Detective First Grade so his family can receive the pay and benefits that go along with it, then we can revisit this conversation.
You're doubling down.
I'm defending the flock.
May God bless you and keep you safe.
Thank you, Your Eminence.
(sighs)
ERIN:
Thanks for coming in, Gary.
Oh, I'm happy for the excuse to stop by and see old friends.
So, what's up?
Just following up on an issue from a case I inherited when you left the office.
Tommy Hickman?
Right.
Of course.
I thought that trial was just beginning.
It is, but we've hit a roadblock.
Evidence had been tampered with.
Are you kidding?
Someone substituted sugar for the drugs that we wanted to present at the trial.
You think Hickman got to someone in the property clerk's office?
We're talking to everyone that would have handled that evidence.
GARY:
Of course, I'll get you a list of every investigator I worked with.
Well, we've spoken to all of them.
Hey, Anthony, what's going on?
(door closes)
Gary, uh, we've been hearing some stories about why you really left the office.
You know why I left the office, Erin.
We talked about it.
It was a tough time in my marriage.
And there are other rumors about why your marriage was in trouble.
Rumors are just rumors.
Gary, we have to ask you, did you have a substance abuse problem?
(scoffs) I don't see why I have to answer that,
I-I don't work here anymore.
Oh, come on, Gary.
You wouldn't take that from a skel.
Why should we take it from you?
I'm not some skel, Anthony.
I was a prosecutor at this office for ten years.
And, if I had a problem, it's over.
I'm remarried, we just had a baby.
ABETEMARCO:
Gary, you know how this looks?
Those drugs were kept in a safe in your personal office, while you were preparing for hearing.
Don't go there, you guys.
Tell me, did you steal them for your own use?
Oh, my God, how can you even ask me that?
We have to, we started trial.
Do you know what's the first thing I teach my students?
Never ask a question if you can't handle the answer.
Yeah, you also taught me, if you have an inconvenient fact, you need to get in front of it.
So you need to come clean, Gary, right now.
No, you don't.
I'm warning you.
Not just as a former colleague, but as a friend, if you start spreading dirt, it won't just get on me.
What are you talking about?
I successfully prosecuted 30 or 40 drug cases while at this office.
If you smear me, all those criminals could go free.
Is it worth it to you, just to go after that piddly little courier?
Come on, Gary, that's no kind of choice.
Let's end this conversation right now or I promise you, we'll all rue the day.
(door opens)
VRONSKY:
Nyet.
Mne Ne nuzhny narkotiki.
LEVIN:
Well, madam, he say he don't need any of your pain drugs.
It's American weakness.
Yeah.
Let's talk outside.
Give us a second.
Why the hell didn't you tell us you had a tip Rambo would be in the restaurant?
Classified information.
Classified my ass, we could've had the place surrounded.
Rambo wouldn't have got away again, and the witnesses would be talking to us.
We cannot share our sources with Americans.
Do you tell us everything that you know?
If one more person gets killed because you're not telling us what you know, we're gonna have a serious problem.
And I don't mean a Russian-America problem,
I mean a me and you personal problem!
Okay, Reagan, relax.
Sergei, Rambo, he went to Chechnya.
And he was involved in, uh, what we call,
"acts of extreme subjugation"
with terrorists and their families.
He come back not the same.
Meaning he snapped.
When Moscow called him back, he said he changed sides.
"Changed sides"?
Meaning he became a terrorist?
And now he's running around my city, and you don't think that's something that you should share with me?
In all probability, he's just looking for a means to escape to another country.
In all probability, he could planning his next attack right now.
That is true, he's terrorist.
We're gonna start working together before we end up facing a wholesale slaughter, you got it?
Maybe, but it is still essential to control the flow of information.
No "maybe""
My city, my country, my way.
We work together.
(speaks Russian)
It's okay.
So, this is the safe where the drugs were being held before the hearing?
Yeah, only a handful of people had the combination, and Gary was one of them.
And nobody in the office knew what he was up to?
No, he was being smart about it, like addicts can be.
He knew the drugs had already been subjected to a lab analysis, so he substituted sugar every time he used so the weight and color looked the same.
And because he thought we'd never get to trial, he'd never get found out.
He says he's clean.
I think I believe him.
Well, good for him.
Meanwhile, he's left us with a big fat problem with the Hickman case.
Have we tried to do a quick and dirty plea deal?
It'd be sticky.
Sticky's what we do here.
Hickman's lawyer already senses we have a major problem.
The only deal he's gonna consider is no jail time for his client.
Erin, I don't like cutting Hickman that big of a break either, but we need to handle this as quickly and as quietly as possible.
I know, but it's too late.
The case is too high profile, and even if we make a deal, there's no guarantee that Hickman's gonna keep his mouth shut.
If it comes out that Gary tampered with evidence, every case he was involved in will be reopened.
Gary's going to prison.
And he's a friend, and a mentor to both of us.
I...
I have to say, Monica, I don't...
I know.
There are no good options.
(in Russian accent):
I'm sorry, I still don't understand.
My English is not so good.
Funny, considering you went to high school in Coney Island.
Why don't you cut the crap, all right?
We know you helped Rambo get away from the crime scene.
So lose the accent and tell us where the hell he is.
(tapping on glass)
(without accent):
If you know about his nickname, why do you think I'd help you get him?
(sighs)
What?
I have idea.
Great.
I'm thinking I should speak to him alone.
Do you have room with a window, no bars?
So you can hang him out the window by his ankles, is that what you're talking about?
There would be more honesty in conversation.
No, we don't do things like that around here.
My clearance rate is almost 100%.
What is yours?
Look, we make cases the right way so they stand up, you understand?
Okay.
How do you say, um... it is your funeral.
(sighs)
Thought we were gonna work together here.
American, you thought it would happen right away?
(sighs)
Okay.
Where were we?
Will you please tell the detective what you just told me?
Tell me what?
Promise you won't say I talked.
To who?
Right?
Fine.
Rambo said he just needed to go some place where he could chill and clear his system without being tracked.
What does he mean clear his system?
He's really not a guy you want to ask a lot of questions.
Clear his system?
Clear his system, you hear...?
Hey!
Hey, you see where the dumb looking Russian guy went?
(scoffs)
BAEZ:
How did you know he was headed back to the same restaurant?
I didn't.
It's a GPS I put on his car before.
Like the other Reagan said, trust, but verify.
(sighs)
What do you think he's doing here?
Don't know.
He must think we miss him.
Let's find out.
(speaking Russian)
Huh?
(speaks Russian)
Please.
Your presence is unhelpful and unnecessary.
(chuckles) Duly noted.
Where's Rambo?
I'm trying to find out, but now you're getting in the way.
Oh, we're getting in the way?
How about we lock you two up for obstructing, huh?
We'll put you in a nice small room with bars on the windows.
Okay, okay, we'll do it together.
Police is police.
Right?
Wrong.
Pokazhi mne.
What, he's in the freezer?
(speaking Russian)
What'd she say?
It's passageway.
She wants you to go first.
(sighs) Step aside.
Go.
(clears throat)
5-4, detectives requesting a 10-85 forthwith at... where the hell are we anyway?
Behind the restaurant, lady.
(men laughing)
Russian bathhouse adjacent to our previous location.
Why would Rambo come here?
LEVIN:
Clear his system, steal clothes, I.D., get a massage.
Hey, kid, hey.
You seen him?
(Levin yells in Russian)
LEVIN:
For sure, he is here.
Reagan, once he knows he's in a corner, he gonna be much more dangerous.
BAEZ:
Should wait for emergency service.
We don't have time.
Oh, son of a bitch.
We got two in here.
10-13, two dead at the scene.
An active shooter in the building.
Where'd he go?
(yells in Russian)
What'd she say, Levin?
Levin!
Where the hell did he go?
(gunshots)
(women screaming)
(gunshots) Move, get out of the way!
Police!
(screaming continues)
Police, move!
MAN:
Back there.
Back there.
Get out of the way.
Move, move!
(women screaming) Move it!
Which way, which way?
!
MAN:
There, there!
(steam hissing)
(whispers):
Turn it off.
(steam hisses)
DANNY:
Hey.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm hit.
He's in here.
Sergei Karenin!
Police!
(coughs)
Sergei?
Reagan, what are you waiting for?
Shut up!
Don't be a girl!
Shut up!
BAEZ:
Reagan?
I got him.
KGB, my ass.
Everything you wanted.
That hardly ever happens.
Including his promotion to detective with all its benefits.
What about the benefits from the World Trade Center's Health Program or the Victim's Comp Fund?
I don't control those.
But your word has weight.
You know, he had some good years on the job, and some less good ones.
What's that a code for?
Smoked and drank for decades before he got sick.
But he also worked on the pile before he got sick.
It would be pushing it to attribute his illness strictly to working on the pile.
So you're denying him?
No, I am pushing it through.
But I thought you should know... it's a favor.
Well, then, thank you, Frank.
Or it will be when I sign them.
Which, I take it, you have not yet done.
You know, I thought we should go out together and visit Macklin and his family, make a private little ceremony of it.
Oh, that's a nice idea.
Right after you pick up that phone and call your legal eagle, Mr. Sloane, and tell him to post bail for the other guy.
I'm the archbishop of New York, Frank,
I'm not a bail bondsman.
You put your thumb on the scale, now it's time to take it off.
You forcing my hand?
I've been ducking calls from Immigration and Customs and the State Department.
I don't like ducking calls, makes me feel all sweaty.
You'd really withhold benefits from this officer's family?
Hey, it was a coin toss whether he qualifies, so, I flipped the coin till it came up heads.
Like I said, as a favor to you.
But your part is private, quiet.
What you're offering in return would be public and controversial.
You chose the playing field, not me.
Uh...
I don't like this, Frank.
More to the point, I don't like you in this.
Me, either.
I'm just gonna have to live with that.
Not much choice.
I don't have all day, Your Eminence.
Do we have a deal?
(line beeps)
Uh, can you find me Mr. Sloane, please?
(clears throat)
ERIN:
Were you aware that quantities of heroin were removed and replaced with sugar?
Well, I became aware when you brought it to my attention, recently.
Did you take some of the drugs and replace it with sugar?
On the advice of counsel, I'm going to invoke my Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
Isn't it true that during this time, you were addicted to painkillers because of a back injury?
On the advice of counsel...
ERIN:
Did you transition from using painkillers to using heroin?
Again, on the advice of counsel...
Counsel, approach.
Ms. Reagan, we can spare everyone a lot of agony here by granting this witness immunity to get his full testimony in this hearing.
In what world is that fair to my client?
A prosecutor who is stealing drugs gets immunity while the regular citizen gets prison.
Ms. Reagan?
No immunity.
I'd like to continue.
Then have at it.
Mr. Falk, you were an officer of the court who swore to uphold the law, didn't you?
I did.
Did you betray that oath?
On the advice of counsel,
I invoke my...
Did you betray your friends?
No!
- Your colleagues?
- No!
Did you betray that oath you took?
That wasn't my intention.
But that's what happened, isn't it?
(sighs)
JUDGE:
Mr. Falk?
Do you wish to invoke your Fifth Amendment again?
(voice breaking):
No, Your Honor.
I'm prepared to answer Ms. Reagan's question.
Did you betray your duty to uphold the law?
(cries):
Yes.
And for that...
I am profoundly sorry.
More than you or anyone else can possibly know.
And finally, Mr. Falk, did you ever tamper with evidence in order to convict someone that was innocent?
No, Ms. Reagan.
I never planted evidence.
Every case I brought was legitimate, including the one against Mr. Hickman.
If... if I have to go to prison... like the people I've prosecuted... so be it.
At least my conscious is clear now.
DANNY:
You know, the doctors wanted both of you guys to stay here for continued observation.
VRONSKY:
This is not necessary.
LEVIN:
Moscow doctors, best in the world.
If you'd both been a little more upfront, neither of you would be going home with gunshot wounds.
Oh, please.
These are marks of honor.
Souvenirs from New York.
Oh, and to think, we were gonna stop and get you NYPD coffee mugs.
(laughs) I've already took one from your desk.
Ha!
Just kidding.
(Levin groans)
If you ever come to Moscow, please let me know.
I will love to take you to Bolshoi.
So, what is this?
Potatoes Au gratin.
Or French for "cheesy deliciousness."
(all chuckle) And that's French for
"straight to your butt""
(chuckles) Exactly.
Made with Dubliner Irish cheddar, with an eye to the old sod.
It's the 101st anniversary of the Rising.
The what?
The Easter Rising?
Mm.
They don't teach that in school anymore, Jack.
DANNY:
They don't even give out books in school anymore.
(all laugh) It was the Irish, our ancestors, fighting for their independence in 1916.
And some of the family who didn't make it over here got caught up in that.
We had family who fought over there?
Mm-hmm.
As soldiers?
They weren't exactly soldiers.
They were fighting to get their country back from the British, and they called themselves "rebels."
And you know what the British called those rebels?
Micks?
Excuse me?
(Jamie laughs)
Terrorists.
Seriously?
ERIN:
Mm-hmm.
Bet you didn't think that term existed 100 years ago.
Actually, I didn't think it did.
So why were they called terrorists?
Because, by definition, they were.
Well, why not call them "guerillas"?
Isn't it the same thing?
JAMIE:
Well, guerilla's actually Spanish for "little war."
Their tactics are alike, but the big difference is that a terrorist will target civilians for political ends.
So, we are descended from terrorists.
Whoa...
Come on, that's a very college way of putting it.
FRANK:
Not terrorists the way they use the term now.
I know.
DANNY:
Right.
We have relatives who were freedom fighters, okay?
Let's just leave it at that.
Amen.
Here, here.
And one other thing:
hardly anybody who's here is really from here.
I guess you could say we're all foreigners.
Yeah, and usually they're fleeing some kind of grief in their own country.
Some things never change.
JAMIE:
We're not perfect, but no one's come up with a version 2.0 that's better, so...
So who gets to say that they're really, truly from here?
Munsees, Algonquins, Iroquois, and a whole bunch of other tribes whose names I've forgotten, they can.
Everyone else... is an immigrant.
Here's to all us great unwashed.
Here, here.
DANNY:
Drink to that.
ERIN:
Bottoms up.
Here, here.
Cheers.
FRANK:
Here, here.
(Henry chuckles)
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
It has been over 24 hours since the Centers for Disease Control and the National Guard quarantined Angels Memorial Hospital... here in Downtown.
This could be the worst U.S. viral outbreak in years.
Comparisons are being drawn to SARS in '03, or the H1N1 flu pandemic in '09.
Sources are reporting that six people have died, with many more sick.
CDC officials are working around the clock to determine the source of the virus, stop its spread, and find a treatment.
If you think you've been exposed, please call the number on your screen.
Symptoms include high fever, spontaneous bruising, bleeding, and loss of mental capacity.
Can't just leave her like this.
She's not a piece of medical waste.
No.
She's not.
Yeah, she, uh... she wanted me to take yoga with her.
You and yoga.
Yeah.
She said it would mellow him out.
Hmm.
It didn't seem to work for her, though, did it?
Definitely not.
I miss her.
Me too.
Me too.
_
Feeling okay?
You care so much now.
What's that supposed to mean?
Of course I care.
Is that why you called the foster care people on me?
I called them, Ariel, because you are 13 and you need a home.
Well, I guess I don't need a home now, do I?
Everyone that gets this dies.
I'm going to figure this out.
If anyone thought this could be figured out, there wouldn't be men with guns everywhere.
Listen to me.
Sometimes...
Sometimes things happen to us that can make us smaller, but sometimes it can make you bigger.
I need you to choose bigger right now.
Whatever that means.
Ariel.
Ariel, please come back.
Ariel!
What'd I miss?
Reddick is having a meeting we weren't invited to.
It's us against them.
And we're not losing another one of us.
No, we are not.
So... what do we know?
Yolanda was infected.
48 hours later, she's dead.
By divine virtue, cast into hell Satan.
Of the five known people Yolanda came in contact with, four are dead.
Including Heather.
Ow!
Yolanda also infected Alicia Dias, who's the only one still alive from the first circle of exposure.
Yeah, she's the one who infected my waiting area.
Which started the second circle of exposure.
Ow!
You inject like a first-year.
Yeah.
It's now 1:51 a.m.
Patients in the second circle, including Elliot, Mario, Malaya, and Ariel, have about 10 hours left to live.
And what don't we know?
The identity of patient zero, who could be the key to the cure.
Where did Yolanda get sick?
She doesn't have any registered address.
She had to live somewhere.
Maybe Alicia knows.
Doctors, you better get in here.
_
_
Ativan is in.
Alicia!
Alicia?
Can you hear me?
Alicia.
- Is she conscious?
- Her blood pressure's tanking.
Alicia, can you hear me?
- Alicia.
- Malaya!
Give her pressors.
- Ask her where Yolanda lived!
- Right now?
Why?
'Cause your life depends on it.
Malaya!
Ask her!
Alicia, where did your friend Yolanda live?
Raul Gomez.
- Where?
- Arlington Heights.
Arlington Heights, good.
Look up a Raul Gomez from Arlington Heights.
- Check that address.
- Already on it.
I'm going with you.
It's not a discussion.
We need the Level One suits.
Raul?
Raul, are you in there?
That's one of our vans.
What's it doing here?
The CDC keeps strains in this container when in transport to the lab facility.
It's empty.
They must've stolen it while in transit then accidentally infected themselves.
That's why Gareth's keeping secrets.
They lost the virus.
All right, we got to find this container.
What's it look like?
Small Plexiglass box with tumbler locks, about the size of a shoe box.
Lights don't work.
Raul?
Raul?
Are you here?
Something's not right.
You mean like the blood all over the floor?
There's something here.
That's part of the container.
That means we're at ground zero of the virus.
But where's the rest of the container?
Garbage truck!
Ugh.
Here.
This label means that the virus was in the third phase of testing.
What does that mean?
Part one is the virus, part two is antibodies to the strain, and part three is...
The vaccine.
Wait.
Are you saying that Reddick has a possible cure?
What was that?
Where'd that coming from?
Raul?
Raul!
Are you here?
Raul?
Leanne!
Get off of her!
Leanne!
_
Get those people back!
_
How bad is it?
You should see the other guy.
Leanne, you may not be infected.
Sure.
A patient with a highly aggressive fluid-borne contagion drips his blood into my open wound...
I'm sure you're right.
It should've been me.
Then I'd be the one worrying, and you'd be the one headed to the tent.
I'm not worried.
We're gonna figure this out.
Hey, step back, sir!
That's my house!
Move back off the curb!
Move!
If anyone thought we could figure this out, there wouldn't be men with guns everywhere.
_
I saw the sample container, Gareth.
There's a vaccine in the works.
Potential vaccine.
We need rapid blood tests on everyone.
Anybody with symptoms comes with us.
- And get a respirator on.
- You lied to us.
You knew this virus came from the CDC.
- You knew that there was no...
- We knew... that we had a stolen vehicle, and we were handling it.
You, however... you broke quarantine,
- and you got another doctor infected.
- Handling it?
People are dying, and you have the vaccine!
It is pre-clinical.
The animal testing, it has gotten very mixed results.
We both know how hard it is to test a virus like this on animals.
Millions of people get the flu.
How many of their pets get it?
Zero.
The answer is no.
I'm sorry, Ethan.
- It's not over yet.
- What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna go call in a favor.
Hey, what's your temp?
It's up... but not too bad.
- Any abdominal pain yet?
- Would you shut up?
You're the patient right now.
We're all the patients now.
Oh, my God.
He's just a kid.
How are you feeling?
It's okay to be scared.
- I'm not scared.
- Really?
Well, what's your secret?
Because...
I'm terrified.
I've been through worse.
What, bubonic plague?
Smallpox.
Ah.
Yeah, I had Black Death once, but it turned out to be bad Mexican food.
Leanne?
- Dr. Rorish.
- Stand back.
Let me talk to her, please.
- I'm not moving.
- Me neither.
This isn't necessary, okay?
Just everyone calm down.
I'm okay.
Thanks.
Is it true?
I don't...
I don't have any symptoms.
I'm fine... so far.
Mama... you look like a pineapple in that thing.
Me?
You look like a... you look great.
Jesse, make a joke.
I can't.
Leanne...
You know, Dr. Rorish says that you can be... scared and brave at the same time.
Dr. Rorish?
Why doesn't Leanne have one of those space suits on?
I was feeling a little left out.
How's everyone doing?
You okay?
Ariel.
You're sick, too, aren't you?
Don't worry.
We're gonna be okay.
I know when someone's lying to me, you know.
I will never lie to you.
You can count on that.
I feel like I'm making a deal with the devil.
Technically, you're making a deal with an angel.
What's going on?
They found me a new heart.
- And it's in Los Angeles.
- What about the quarantine?
I'm having it flown in by ambu-flight.
They drop it on the roof and go.
Should be fine.
Thank God.
Some good news.
Have you been able to find out anything about Jeremy?
No, I'm...
I'm sorry.
Still no word from inside the quarantine tent.
_
How did you get in here?
I thought Reddick ordered all...
I talked to General Hutchens.
The vaccine's on the way.
And our people can come back in here now.
Dr. Willis!
Oh, this is the best part.
Who do you think you are?
Just a girl, standing in front of a boy,
- asking him to love her.
- What?
Not a big movie fan?
Who have no idea what you're dealing with.
This vaccine has never been tested.
She's losing her airway!
Dr. Pineda, bring the ultrasound.
- Pulse is thready.
- No, no, no, no.
She's drowning in her own sputum.
- I need a laryngoscope.
- Breathe, Ariel, breathe.
- I need an intubation tray.
- No, no, no.
If we intubate, she may never get off the vent.
Her airway's not intact.
Then suction her.
She can do it, Ethan.
She's a tough kid.
Okay, hold the meds.
Suction.
Ariel, look.
Look at me, look at me.
Okay, don't take your eyes off me, okay?
All right, I want you to just breathe.
That's it.
Through your nose, just breathe.
Okay, this is a little bit scary, but just breathe.
Okay, I'm right here with you.
Just breathe.
Slow down.
It's okay.
Almost done.
Breathe slowly.
You've got this.
Sats and pressure are up.
There we go.
That's it.
That was great.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
You want to know why I went over your head?
'Cause there's a brave young girl over there fighting for her life, and you're watching from a window seat.
Willis, listen to me.
Gretchen thinks that the animal testing was compromised because of biology, but... there were fatalities.
In some cases, the vaccine, it sped up the progression of the virus.
If it can kill a pig, it can kill a human.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I understand.
The vaccine is too risky to test on a child.
But you can test it on me.
Breathing is labored.
His lungs are filled with fluid.
- His pulse is weak.
- Come on, Bill.
Hang in there.
- The chopper's coming.
- I hope you're right.
Take this patient back to his room.
This is my department.
I'm prepping my patient for surgery, so you step back.
The transport helicopter, it's not coming.
It can't.
You know that.
We're not prisoners!
Dr. Campbell, I-I understand you're taking this personally because of the loss of your colleague.
But this is a federal quarantine.
There is a reason that we...
No pulse.
I'm starting compressions.
- Get the crash cart over there.
- Give me a hand.
Come on, Bill.
Ready.
Clear.
No pulse.
Do it again.
Clear.
No pulse.
Come on, Bill!
Come on, come on, Bill.
- Come on.
Shock him again, Rollie.
- He's flatlining.
Shock him again, Rollie.
Shock him!
Will, we cannot get an impulse on dead myocardium!
You know that!
Come on.
His heart is gone.
Dr. Campbell, I'm sorry.
Gareth, the vaccine is here.
Time of death... 8:37 a.m.
I'm fine.
Obviously.
Mind if I say something?
Yes.
Of all the doctors at Angels... you're the one I aspire to be.
Watching you is... is a lesson in being the calm in the storm but not the storm.
- Until now.
- No.
Now you taught me it's okay to be human, too.
_
I don't want you taking the vaccine, Leanne.
You heard them.
It's dangerous.
You said Ariel doesn't belong to anyone.
We seem to have that in common.
There's no one waiting at home for me, Jesse.
Don't... don't say that.
That's not true.
It is true.
Maybe that's why I'm here... to test this antidote so that other people could live.
People at the start of their lives.
You think you don't belong to anyone?
I mean, how can you say that to me?
You belong to me, Leanne, just as much as I belong to you.
Tu eres mi familia!
Entiendes?
Tu eres mi familia.
Sí, entiendo.
Entiendo.
Leanne, you ready?
Yes.
Jesse...
I love you, too.
Come on.
If there's even a chance that I could save someone's life... save her life...
I have to try.
It's in.
I want updates on vitals and serial blood samples every 15 minutes.
Now that you've done it, there's a protocol to follow.
Ms. Chislett... your father suffered an aortic rupture.
Um, his heart stopped.
- No.
- We, um...
- Anna...
- No, no, no.
I-I-I don't understand.
- We're so sorry.
Your father died.
- No, no, no!
No, y-you told me there was a heart!
- You said that there was a heart.
- Yes, th-there was a heart.
But because of the quarantine, we couldn't get it in the hospital.
I'm sorry.
No, I-I need Jeremy!
I-I want to see Jeremy!
Please?
Ms. Chislett, I-I'm very sorry, but Jeremy... he's in the quarantine tent.
- I-I want to see Jeremy, please!
- You can't see...
- You can't see him right now.
- I don't care!
- I'm sorry.
- Please, I just want to see Jeremy!
- No, no, no.
- No!
- Anna, please, please.
Listen to me.
- Please!
Look at me.
Anna, look at me.
I know how alone you feel right now, I do.
But you are not alone.
Trust me.
Now, we need you to be strong for Jeremy, okay?
_
Hello?
I'm right here, Elliot.
Mom?
Is that you?
No, Elliot.
It's Malaya.
I don't feel so great.
I'll increase your fluid rate.
Mom?
Is that you?
Yes, honey.
It's Mom.
_
I'll get this right off to the lab.
I've been living in a graveyard these last four years.
I don't want her to die alone.
What do you mean, "a graveyard"?
I haven't been in my sweet children's room in all these years.
They're frozen in time, exactly as they were.
Ariel has been sleeping... on a sofa in my home.
And not 20 feet away, there are 2 unused beds.
What the hell is wrong with me?
Am I that afraid of those memories?
Maybe it's not the memories you're afraid of.
Maybe it's... replacing them... with something new, because that might be a betrayal.
Leanne?
I, uh...
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
- It's not working!
- We need more time!
Temperature's 103.
That's higher than it was 15 minutes ago.
If she was going to respond to the vaccine, she would've by now.
I told you all that the vaccine wasn't ready, but you insisted on raising this false hope.
You should've known better.
So, now what?
Dr. Reed will take blood samples of the exposed back to our lab in Atlanta to generate new immunoglobulins and refine the vaccine.
I'm so sorry.
What are you saying?
What about our people?
Right now, we've contained the outbreak.
The last circle of exposure is confined to that hot-zone tent.
It is nearly impossible to find a cure within the incubation period.
We'll make them as comfortable as we can.
I'm sorry.
Did he just say that...
We can't save them.
Gretchen!
Don't go back.
I know you're upset.
I'm really sorry, but there is nothing more we can do.
There is something we can do.
- We can test the samples ourselves.
- Oh.
You said the original vaccine was derived from a person with a natural immunity.
What if we can find someone within our exposure circles with a similar immunity to this strain?
The chances of that are so slim.
Yes, they're slim to none, I know.
But it's better than what happens if you go.
Where are you techs?
You're lookin' at them.
We're not giving up yet.
There are hundreds of samples.
This is your whole team?
You ever worked in a hospital during a code black?
This is the only team you need.
Okay.
Anna?
I have someone who'd like to see you.
Anna, God, it's good to see you.
Jeremy!
What?
Dad, he...
He didn't make it.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I wish I...
I wish I could be there with you.
You will be.
You... you have to be.
I can't lose you, too.
I'm here.
I am right here, and I'm gonna be okay.
And I am gonna watch you walk down the aisle in that beautiful dress.
And I'm...
I'm gonna read you those vows that I-I still have to write.
And we are gonna live a long, happy life together, okay?
I love you.
- I need some help over here!
- Jeremy?
Jeremy?
Jeremy, what's happening?
He's got blood in his airway.
His pulse is dropping.
We need suction, now!
Mario, w-what's happening?
- Hang in there, Jeremy.
- Mario, talk to me.
Come on, I need that suction n...
What do you got?
Severe hyperkalemia with EKG changes.
Already got meds.
Okay, he needs dialysis now.
- We already checked.
- There aren't any more machines.
- He's in V-tach.
- Peritoneal dialysis.
We can use the lining of his abdomen to filter his blood.
I need a PD kit!
I'll get it myself.
Here you go.
Okay.
And here's the catheter.
All right.
And making the incision.
Go ahead and place the catheter.
Starting flow now.
It's not working.
We lost pulse.
Start compressions please,
- and push another amp of calcium.
- Okay.
- I'll bag.
- Great.
- Elliot.
- Mario, stay with your patient.
Don't stop compressions.
Dr. Pineda, keep bagging.
Anybody?
Come on, Elliot.
I need some...
Okay, come on, Elliot.
I can't see the cords!
I can help.
Okay.
Go to that cart right over there and get me a lighted stylet.
It... it's a long wire with a light on the end of it.
It looks like a-a-a book light.
- Like this?
- That's it.
Bring it over.
Great.
Take it out.
- I'm scared.
- Don't be scared.
We can do this together, okay?
Hold that.
- I want you to look at me.
- Okay.
Look me in the eyes.
Don't be scared.
We've got this.
Look at me.
We're gonna do this together, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay?
What I want you to do, Ariel, see this,
- see the light on the end of it?
- Yeah, yeah.
I want you to follow the light when I put it down his throat.
Okay.
Pulse check.
No pulse.
Pushing one more amp.
I can't.
You take over.
Okay.
- Okay, I see the light.
- Okay.
Okay.
Now... squeeze it gently.
No, ge-gently.
- Okay, about every five or six seconds.
- Okay.
Squeeze.
Three, four, five.
Three, four, five.
Squeeze.
Two, three, four, five.
Squeeze.
Two, three, four, five.
Squeeze.
Two, three four, five.
Squeeze.
Two...
- Three, four...
- Please, please, please.
... five.
Bilateral breath sounds.
You did it.
You saved him.
No.
You saved him.
Give me another pulse check?
Pulse check.
- Got a pulse.
- He's stabilizing.
We're not even halfway through the samples.
It's been over two hours.
I have to go.
No, no.
We need another hour.
I'm really sorry.
I have to get on that plane.
Willis.
I found something.
Look at these two here.
Both of these colors... they're matching.
Is he right?
Is it a match?
Damn right, it's a match.
Right?
Looks like a match to me.
It's a m... it's a...
It's a match.
It's a match.
- Have you seen Anna?
- No, she was just here.
I need to get in.
I need to see my fiancé.
Ma'am, I can't let you in.
No one goes in this room.
Please, please.
- I want to see Jeremy.
- I can't let you in.
Stand aside, Private.
That's an order.
Respectfully, Colonel, you're not my C.O.
Move now.
- Anna!
- Hey!
Stop right there!
- I said stop!
- No, no, no, no!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
No!
Stop, stop right now!
Back up!
Back up!
Oh, my God.
Was that a gunshot?
Mario, what's going on?
I can't see anything.
Dr. Rorish.
Dr. Rorish!
Mario!
Leanne!
- Ariel, you need to get back to your...
- No, I am not leaving her.
We'll take care of her.
No, I promise I won't get in the way, please!
I need pressors over here!
Are you okay?
No, Leanne!
Please look at me.
Please look at me.
Open your eyes, please.
Please open your eyes.
It's okay, it's okay.
Please, please open your eyes.
It's okay, it's okay.
Please, please.
Scalpel and thoracotomy tray now!
Gloves!
We need gloves!
Slide into three.
Dr. Kean, airway.
Still no pulse.
Continue compressions until I'm cutting.
Tube is in.
Rib spreader, please.
Well, then, more people are gonna die.
Okay, that's enough.
You got to tell them to put their weapons down and let us through.
What the hell happened?
You should be on a plane to Atlanta.
Your soldier shot someone.
She's in Center Stage right now.
- What?
- There's a man in that tent who has the antibodies to fight this virus.
And we're going in there and draw his blood so we can synthesize the antibodies.
We can stop this whole thing.
It ends right now.
Nobody else gets hurt.
Nobody else dies.
It's true.
We can save everyone.
Stand down, Private.
Go.
Thank you.
Go!
Come on.
Mama says... you either come here to die or to get one last miracle.
You want a miracle today?
You be the miracle.
Noa, grab those heavy scissors.
You're gonna cut through this rib.
Come on.
Come on.
I can't get through.
Okay, here.
Let me help you.
All right, open it up.
Dr. Kean, pericardium's filling with blood.
Heart can't beat.
What's your next move?
Cut through the pericardium and find the bleed.
Exactly.
All right, let's do it.
Dr. Leighton, cut.
Found the bleed.
It's a hole in the left atrium.
I've got 3-0.
Tying down now.
Work fast, now.
Tack it.
Here we go.
Got it.
Come on.
Be the miracle.
Be the miracle.
Be the miracle.
Cardiac activity.
Somebody call CT surg.
Pedro Chavez!
I need Pedro Chavez.
I'll do the ulterior cut-down.
Sir... are you ready to save your son?
Follow me.
I'll do a venous on Leanne.
What's going on?
We don't have time to synthesize the antibodies into a serum.
You got the same blood type.
We're gonna do a person-to-person transfusion.
Put his antibodies into her system.
What do you need from me?
4-0 prolene, I.V. bags.
Let's go.
Where is Ariel?
Where's Ariel?
She's right there.
She's next.
You're gonna be okay, daddy.
You guys, too.
Can I get a hand with Dr. Savetti?
Somebody help Dr. Pineda!
Lay her down!
Let's go!
Hey, there's my girl.
Hey.
Is everyone okay?
Always the hero.
We didn't lose anyone else.
Oh, thank God.
How you feeling?
As bad as you look.
Someone else is here to see you.
I'm glad you're here.
Even if I did have to catch a deadly virus.
Shut up.
Still not flirting.
Right.
Leanne, that torn femoral you sent up made it through surgery.
Awesome.
... On the rapid infuser when we land.
My patient needs a trauma panel and a head CT.
I say it's an A-fib with aberrancy.
I say V-tach.
Dr. Rorish, which is it?
Oh, AV dissociation with a capture beat.
- That's V-tach.
- Ah!
Told you.
Type and cross him in Four.
I need a 5-0 nylon.
Don't even think about it.
Go home.
We're in Code Black.
- Hello, residents.
- Good night, Risa.
I'm Jesse Sallander, senior ER nurse.
But for the next three years,
I'm your mama.
Hey.
- Time to get up.
- I don't want to get up.
Everybody goes to school.
Come on.
I'll see you downstairs.
Near Nagerkoil...
Hey, I'm driving!
(Song playing)
Don't be mean.
A kiss is all I asked.
No way.
Hey, please!
Just one kiss...
Like this.
I Promise.
- Fraudster
What do you call this?
That was just rehearsal.
- Really?
Hey, Rhino!
Why did you use the room freshener?
Boss, Sadhana is here.
Taunting me, are you?
You always over use the perfume!
That's Victoria Secret Line's Perfume.
You bought it from the local store, right?
Country attar packed in a fancy way.
This your Victoria Secret?
What about you?
You use the local ingredients and sell it as international cuisine.
Hey!
Don't make fun of my recipe.
I have won awards.
I was given the best...
Enter... something like that.
That's Entrepreneur.
- Exactly.
Forget it...
Let me come to the point.
You are one among the top 25 upcoming stars selected by a weekly magazine.
I wrote the article about you.
Let me read it out.
Chef Arun.
Age: 25
He lost his eyesight at the age of 15.
That didn't stop this self reliant man... from mastering the art of cooking.
Traditional Indian cuisines...
To Italian, Mexican cuisines...
Chef, the food is superb.
- Thank you.
Varun is one of the best visually challenged chefs...
Stop... stop
I feel shy to hear my own success story.
Will you please keep the book and leave?
You are taunting me too much.
Bye.
Thank you.
Don't mention.
Rhino!
Bake it.
Who is it?
Is the restaurant closed?
Yes.
Sorry.
The closing time is 10:30 PM.
An elderly man on the platform told that he was hungry.
He asked me if he can have something to eat.
There is no other hotel nearby.
That's why...
Please wait.
Let me check.
Somehow I managed this with the leftovers.
Take it.
Sorry for disturbing you...
I didn't know about your condition.
Nothing to sympathize.
This is my restaurant.
This is my job.
Okay.
Thanks.
You can visit the elderly man if you would like to.
He is nearby.
Hang on.
Let me close the restaurant.
He is here.
Take it.
Thank you very much.
I'll leave.
Shall I drop you somewhere?
Thanks.
I've a knowledge of every nook and corner of this locality.
Bye.
Your article by Sadhana is very good, isn't it?
It requires a big heart to appreciate you
- Mom.
Get me chappathis.
Despite owning a restaurant
You are still eating mom's food.
I know where this conversation will end.
Don't be boring.
Okay?
Welcome.
Did the elderly man ask for food, today as well?
No.
But, how did you know that it was me?
Your deodorant brand is Nivea, right?
You are awesome.
I forgot to pay the bill, yesterday.
How much was it?
- It's Okay.
If I get the money
The credit for the good deeds will go to you.
No need.
Sorry.
How about getting some credits today?
You told that the elderly man didn't ask for food.
It's not a big deal to find a hungry man in our city.
One moment.
I'm Deepa.
I work in a clothing store in a shopping mall.
I'm Varun.
Cutting, baking, boiling and frying things.
This is my profession.
Did you just extend your hand?
What?
For an introduction?
No.
Sorry.
I forget this all the time!
It's okay.
No.
Let's start from the beginning.
Hi, I'm Varun.
Deepa.
Varun...
Excuse me.
Have it.
- Thank you very much.
Shall we leave?
Here...
With no control
Somehow, I am becoming you.
Without the eyes laying sight...
I am becoming like you.
The fiber of my life shines colorfully.
While killing me with fondness...
Love is getting kindled...
Sight is going beyond the eyes.
(Are you) The flower of inner sun, or my penance?
Is this love or enemity?
Hey, love has become my eyes...
And is withholding your beauty.
Your fragrance has become my way
And brings me closer to you.
A storm is galloping like a horse...
And my heart has climbed aboard and vanished.
Even robbery becomes just...
When my wish steals you away.
Where is your father?
Has he absconded?
He isn't picking my calls.
He can't run away from us.
If he doesn't meet us tomorrow
Things may turn ugly.
- Who's that, Deepa?
Someone I know.
Any problem, Deepa?
No.
Nothing.
Are you the woman past desires, The one ruling all my desires?
Are you the one to rope the moon in your forehead?
You became the enchanted forest in one single flower, my lady
Are you the one to pour nectar on that day?
The thought of you approaches me and burns my soul.
I lost my loneliness.
I lost myself in your thoughts.
You are my companion.
I like Varun a lot.
But he will tease if I tell him.
Which is why...
You are a friend who knows him well.
He will not get a better partner than you.
A storm is galloping like a horse...
And my heart has climbed aboard and vanished.
Even robbery becomes just...
When my wish steals you away.
Hey, love has become my eyes...
And is withholding your beauty.
Your fragrance has become my way
And brings me closer to you.
Siri, time?
Siri, call Deepa.
Hi, Deepa.
I'm waiting for you.
Where are you?
'Sadhana Calling'.
Deepa.
What happened?
Is something wrong?
I can help you only if you tell me.
Please, Deepa.
Tell me.
What's it?
My sister fell in love with a guy.
His family is quite well off.
But, they still accepted their wedding.
Since it was my sister's wish...
My father spent more than he could afford
He got her married in a grand way.
She is happy with her life.
But she forgot us.
The money we had borrowed for the wedding... led us... into endless troubles.
To help my dad,
I started working.
Even after 2 years
We couldn't clear even a chunk of the loan.
Dealing with the money-lenders has become a struggle of our daily life.
But...
Today...
Today?
Some thugs came home... and insulted us very badly.
They said...
If you can't repay the loan,
Ask your daughter to...
Unable to hear such things, my dad...
In a haste...
He promised to clear the loan... in 2 days.
I surely know that it's not possible.
Either...
We leave the city.
Or...
My family should...
Don't be foolish, Deepa.
Even the man with a million rupees on loan is sitting happily.
Please, Varun!
You could have asked me.
No.
I just felt like sharing it with you.
So, I did.
I have some savings.
I don't have immediate expenses lined up.
I will lend it to you.
- Please.
Don't Varun.
You are the only friend that I have left.
I don't want your name in the moneylender's list.
Forget this issue.
Also ask your dad not to borrow any money for your wedding.
Because I have no demands from my side.
Don't get me wrong that I'm... taking advantage of your situation.
I was actually waiting for you today...
To propose.
All these arrangements were meant for that.
Deepa.
I'm visually challenged.
If that's the reason for your silence...
You can tell me frankly.
We can drop this right now.
And remain friends.
Other than that...
There can be no reason for rejecting me.
Because...
I'm handsome...
Charming...
I know it myself.
Hey!
You did laugh, didn't you?
I didn't.
Don't you think that we have reached here a bit early today?
Don't play around, Varun.
It's getting late.
It's not fair to leave me halfway.
I'm going to be with you throughout my life.
Okay, bye.
Won't you send me off with a kiss?
- Here?
!
No.
Here.
Bye.
Deepa.
Say hello to my father-in-law!
Severe head injury.
But now he is alright.
Since he is under heavy medications
It may take a few days for him to gain consciousness.
Let him stay in the hospital till then.
He will recover soon.
Thanks, doctor.
At what age did your son lose his eyesight?
When he was 15.
All of a sudden he had a high fever.
It continued for 2 weeks.
He started losing his vision slowly.
Doctors diagnosed him with...
Retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative eye disease.
But none of those treatments helped.
We checked his eyes now
His retina is responding to light.
The ophthalmologist will be visiting tomorrow.
Let's see what he has to say.
Varun has light perception.
Surgery may help him get his vision back.
So...
- There's nothing to think about, doctor.
If Varun can get his sight back...
We will manage any expense.
Please go on and make necessary arrangements.
- Sure.
What's wrong with you?
I know what I'm doing.
The way my son saw me before 10 years
The way he likes to see me.
That's exactly how I'm dressed up.
He will cry out asking if this is what he got his vision back for!
You are jealous.
He won't even be able to identify you.
Shall I stick a mustache?
Mom!
Mom!
- Sir.
Please sit.
It's a hospital.
- Where is my mom?
She will be here.
- Who are you?
Varun!
- Mom!
Where were you?
I have no clue.
What is happening?
Nothing.
You are in a hospital.
You met with an accident.
Varun, please don't strain.
Be calm.
You were hit by a car while getting back from the restaurant.
How long have I been kept here?
It's been 3 weeks.
What?
!
Stay calm.
You are alright now.
In fact there is a surprising.
You've had an eye surgery.
You are going to get your sight back!
Your bandages will be removed today.
Can you please be clear?
- Doctor is here.
What is he saying?
He has isn't able to understand what's happening.
He is tensed.
Nothing to worry, Mr.Varun.
You are absolutely fine.
Just relax.
Open your eyes, slowly.
Varun, give it a try.
Slowly...
Try...
Are you able to see?
Can you see?
One.
Two.
- Yes!
Varun!
I was scared!
Let him take rest.
I'll come back later.
It's Sadhana.
Mom.
Did anyone come to visit me?
who do you mean?
We are all here.
My friend.
Which friend?
Did anyone by the name Deepa visit me?
Deepa?
No.
No one like that had come.
Where is my phone?
Did she call me?
I need to talk to her immediately.
I'll leave.
Sadhana, wait.
Where are you going?
He is asking about someone called Deepa.
I asked for my phone.
I need to talk to Deepa immediately.
I need to see her.
What is this?
Sadhana was the one who took care of you.
You didn't even talk to her.
I will talk to her, later.
I need to talk to Deepa now.
Will you give my phone?
What do you think you are doing?
We have been praying for your recovery...
We have spent a lot of money and waited.
You must be happy for getting your vision back.
You are reciting someone random woman's name!
- What did you say?
What?
- You spent what?
Yes, we spent a lot of money.
So, what?
How much?
Why do you want to know?
Just tell me.
Apart from our savings, we have borrowed some.
Varun!
- Varun, stop!
Your eyes are very sensitive to light now.
It will take some time to get used to excessive light.
You will have to use spectacles.
- Okay, doctor.
'Calling Deepa'.
Varun.
Think practically.
You say that she used to come to the restaurant everyday.
But you don't know what she looks like.
You neither have her photo nor her address.
How do we search for her?
I promised to help her.
She must have pinned her hopes on me.
Would she have any idea about my accident?
She would have thought that I had cheated her.
There is no wrong from your side.
Don't think too much.
Varun.
Excuse me.
Do you remember the girl who used to come with me?
Everyday I see lot of people.
Thank you.
Tell me if you see her.
No idea.
Is there any employee named Deepa?
No one here.
Any news of a suicide due to debts?
Deepa, say hello to my father-in-law.
Lets go.
Varun.
Varun, look at me.
I have never seen you so down.
Please don't be like this.
You won't understand, Sadhana.
Forget it.
Don't say that!
I know you very well.
We have been friends for 7 years now.
I know how you'd feel even without you telling it to me.
And in the same way...
I hope you can understand how I'm feeling.
Varun.
Shall we lodge a police complaint?
No, dad.
It will create more problems.
Damodharan, from Chetpet, and his family, commits suicide owing to mounting pressure from debts.
Damodharan, his wife Pushpa, and 14-year-old son Aravindh... committed suicide by consuming poison today.
The police are investigating the incident.
The locked house...
Mom.
Look at me.
Please.
Mom.
I don't like to see you being upset because of me.
Getting back your vision is a big thing.
You must be very happy.
Instead...
Why are you upset like this about this random girl?
I know, my fault.
Sorry.
Now, please smile for me.
I'm telling you again...
Sadhana is deeply in love with you.
When you were hospitalised...
I know.
I will talk to her.
What I meant is...
More than the one we love...
The one whom we love...
The one who loves us...
No, no...
It's okay.
Leave it, mom.
I get the point.
Have a seat, Sadhana.
Will you like to have anything?
Don't suddenly flip into a totally different person.
Be normal.
Only that suits you.
Okay.
I have to tell you the truth.
Since you were coming, I didn't even use room freshener.
Okay.
Let me get to the point.
If you still love her, I totally understand.
Don't take any decision just because your parents are forcing you.
You don't have to tell me 'you like me' just because someone is asking you to.
Will it be okay if it comes from me?
It's not like I have to like you with an effort now.
I've always liked you.
But I never felt that you could be the one for me.
But now that I think of it, it all makes sense.
I like you, Sadhana.
Really?
A small word said in passing...
It is chilly, it is true, listen.
You added sweetness to what you spoke.
My feminity is stunned.
Should I blush away?
Or climb up high to touch the clouds?
Should I yearn even more
Or look for more words to speak?
With the wishes as a garland...
Shall I go around you all day long?
A small word said in passing
It is chilly, it is true, listen
You added sweetness to what you spoke
My masculinity is stunned.
Should I say slowly
Or increase the speed?
Should I leave after saying or pause right there?
Should I pinch at the love that was said
Or should I lose myself to the love that was grabbed by my hands
I realize today that there may be a thousand changes to the sight.
I see myself through your eyes conveying love.
I am seeing you with a pouring love... that I have collected.
I am gently bringing to your ears the words I collected slowly.
I put my hands out to get a raindrop...
It remained just as a drizzle.
Today, you are a downpour from up above... that drenches all my heart.
A small word said in passing...
It is chilly, it is true, listen.
You added sweetness to what you spoke.
My feminity is stunned.
Should I blush away?
Or climb up high to touch the clouds?
Should I yearn even more
Or look for more words to speak?
With the wishes as a garland...
Shall I go around you all day long?
Rhino.
I'll close the restaurant.
Mom wants you home; you leave.
Okay.
Sorry, sir.
We are closed.
Someone named Varun...
I'm Varun.
And you are?
Your eyesight?
I had lost it earlier.
After a surgery now...
Sir, who are you?
Do you remember Deepa?
Sir!
I'm her father.
Why did you let us down like that!
Sir, what do you mean?
Didn't Deepa come now?
Where is Deepa?
She told us happily that you offered to help us with the money, that all our problems will go away...
She sounded so happy...
But you were seen no where.
I kept telling her we should leave the city.
But she did not listen.
She was confident that you would come back... and asked me to wait.
How many days do we give excuses?
The moneylenders have kidnapped my daughter.
They are threatening to kill my daughter
If we don't clear all our debts.
What do you mean?
I want my daughter back.
Alive.
Alive.
- Sir...
Please get up.
Please.
Don't cry.
We will rescue Deepa for sure.
They are very dangerous people.
If we go to the police...
They will not think twice to kill my daughter.
Nothing of that sort will happen.
Give me a day's time.
Please.
Come.
Have a seat.
How much do you owe them now?
Going to have your morning coffee with Sadhana?
I have to invite my close friend.
I will be able to meet him only if I go now.
So...
Bye.
Hello.
Okay.
He asked me to come in.
My daughter!
- Stop!
Don't hurt her.
Have you brought the money?
Who is that?
!
Who is the that?
!
He is someone I know.
Just give him the money.
They might hurt her.
Give it to him.
- How much have you brought?
How much?
- It's not cash.
It's jewellery.
Jewellery?
Are you mocking me?
I asked for cash.
Are you trying to trap me with the jewels?
Oldie, looks like you don't want your daughter back alive!
Leave her!
Time out!
Collect her pieces and go!
The jewels are worth more than the money they owe you!
Don't rush.
Let her go!
Please!
Take it and leave her!
Don't hurt my daughter!
Let her go!
Deepa!
Had you given the money, you would've saved a life.
Trying to be a hero, are you?
Go to hell!
You moron, I'll kill you!
If you even think of going to the police...
You will be inviting trouble for yourself.
Deepa.
Varun...
Varun...
Stop.
What happened?
Where were you?
What happened?
Every last piece of gold jewellery bought for the wedding is missing!
I called you N number of times.
Aunt told that you left the house this morning with a bag.
All the jewels are missing.
And you turn up like this now!
What happened?
Mom...
Deepa...
- Her again?
Why bring her up again?
What happened?
Deepa's dad met me yesterday.
He said Deepa was kidnapped and asked for my help.
So...
So, I took the jewels to save her.
But everything went wrong.
They looted the jewels...
- What?
!
I couldn't save Deepa either.
If you can't forget her.
If you are so attached to her.
Why am I even here?
Why is this wedding happening?
Sadhana, please.
I did ask you.
If you weren't able to forget her, I was ready to step away.
You kept nodding your head and expressing interests in me, and now you are after her.
You took the wedding chain as well, didn't you?
Had you saved her, Would you tied it around her neck and married her?
Mom, ask her to keep quiet.
Why should I stay quiet?
Sadhana, be calm.
It's not necessary anymore.
I will leave.
I'm not ready to get mislead by him any further.
I'm sorry, aunt.
I don't want this wedding.
- Sadhana!
Mom, let's go.
'Who?
What?
When?
'
'Swathi was hanging out with her friends'.
'2 twilight thieves arrested.'
Sadhana.
Sadhana.
Is the article ready?
I want to take off for 10 days.
Leave for 10 days?
You people are hopeless!
If you think of going to the police...
You are inviting trouble for yourself!
I'm hungry.
Please help me.
Sorry.
Don't run!
Catch him!
Stop there.
Yesterday night, on the Kanyakumari- Nagercoil highway... a man was found dead after being hit by an unidentified vehicle.
His age is presumed to be about 50.
As we had asked Inspector Arivazhagan of Kanyakumari...
A man who was walking on the highway was hit by a vehicle and died on the spot.
The man had no identity card or phone on him.
So we were unable to get his details.
Investigation is going on now.
Those who know any detail about him can approach the Kanyakumari police station.
I'm going to Kanyakumari for an urgent work.
I'll call once I'm done with it.
Inform dad.
Stop!
Why are you going?
A man was found dead in the Kanyakumari-Nagercoil highway.
Either we run away from the city,
Or the whole family...
Why are you so worried after coming to Kanyakumari?
Any problem?
You said wanted to visit police station as well?
Nothing.
I'm going to meet my friend.
Sir.
Yes.
- I'm from Chennai.
2 days ago, a man was found dead in a road accident in Kanyakumari.
Yes.
How do you know him?
Actually...
Then why do you want to know about him?
Sir, I'm from the media.
You guys want news 24/7!
Why do you torture us for that?
There is a guy called Panju.
He is dealing with this case.
Go meet him.
Thank you, sir.
Give him the keys.
Don't drink and drive.
Got it?
- Okay, sir.
Sorry, sir.
- Bye.
He is a relative of the MLA.
Won't you enquire all these things in advance?
I will be careful hereafter,Sir.
Have you caught a single proper case till now?
It doesn't make a difference either way...
It's my mistake to have become a cop.
Don't go and drag another problematic case just because I said this now.
Get a case that will bring honours to the station and me.
Bring something that brings cheers to me and the station.
Definitely, sir.
You will repent for all these.
Sir, I am waiting for you.
Who are you?
- I'm Varun.
I'm a program producer in Q TV.
You would have heard about the show.
'Crime:
Why?
What?
When?
'
No, I haven't.
A very important thing.
Perumal, one strong tea.
Sir, tea.
Yes.
- Sir.
A guy was found dead in a road accident in Kanyakumari-Nagercoil highway recently...
I want some details regarding that case.
Why do you want to know?
I'm working on a program about unsolved death cases caused by road accidents.
Did anyone come in search of this man?
In some cases, people come searching immediately.
At other times, they come a bit late.
But no one has come in search of this man so far.
What about his body?
We are done with postmortem and other formalities.
Won't you wait till someone comes to identify the person?
There is neither a mortuary big enough nor the Government funds large enough to do that.
If no one comes in search of the dead person, we proceed with the formalities.
If anyone comes after that, we will verify with a photo.
If we have any of their belongings, we return them.
That's it.
Perumal, add this to my outstanding credit.
Your credit amount is never settled.
Sir, won't you enquire about the vehicle driver?
It's possible only with camera surveillance.
If no one comes in search of them...
We will cross-check with other police stations for 'person missing' cases.
Or else, we mark it as an unidentified man dead in a hit-and-run incident, and close the case.
Sir.
This is the concept of our program.
To find out who these unidentified dead people in these accidents are, and to find the culprit behind these incidents.
Congratulations.
You have come to the right place.
You will get all the details that you need.
- Sir.
I'm sure you are going to find it all here.
You are the hero of our program.
- Hey.
I'm already fed up with this job.
Don't irritate me.
Get lost.
Please.
Have some patience.
Such road accidents are very high in number.
Many cases get closed without finding any details about the victim.
As you mentioned...
There is neither the time nor the funds from the Government.
But there will be at least one person bothered about the dead guy.
We have to find that person...
And make sure the information reaches them.
This is the concept of our program.
It has an emotional content.
Give it a thought.
Think about it.
It's my mistake to have had a tea without getting you one.
Have a tea in my credit.
Perumal...
Sir.
If this program becomes a hit, your photo will become viral on social media.
People will praise you as the ideal cop.
After which... promotion, salary hike...
- Get lost.
Panju Sir!
Panju Sir!
How long will you be an underdog?
When will you rise to occasion?
I'm going to pee.
Step aside.
Sir.
Okay, Sir.
Greetings.
Inspector asked to come here.
Didn't you bring your gun?
I wonder how you will manage without it!
Go upstairs.
Hey, crow!
Perumal, one strong tea.
Make it two.
- Okay, Sir.
What's up, Sir?
Would you like to have any fried snacks?
No tension!
I gave an idea to change your image altogether.
Now it's upto you.
I'm scared of the risk involved.
Moreover, it's a TV program...
What's the risk?
You are a cop investigating a case.
As a TV channel, we will support you.
If everything falls in place...
We will get the content.
And you... will get the respect and dignity from the public, that is missing at the police station.
Only you have come here.
What about the rest of the crew?
Initially, I will read the case thoroughly.
I'll then deeply investigate it.
The crew will then arrive.
Perumal, make a note in Sir's credit list.
Didn't the victim have any sort of ID or visiting card on him?
Had it been there, you wouldn't have had to come here.
This is a tourist spot.
Was the victim a tourist?
Was he on an official trip?
Or he was just trespassing?
Was it a death by accident?
Or did it he commit suicide?
I have no clue.
No local person was able to identify him.
One thing is for sure.
You are real serious about this case now.
You seem to trust me.
I'll solve this case just for that.
Madam.
Take this.
'Catch if he drinks' app has been installed in it.
If your husband drinks alcohol in a local wine shop, or anywhere else, the app will send you a text.
Yes.
Okay?
There he is.
I'm coming to get you!
Reserve a special cell for me.
I'll be right back after stabbing him!
Poor husband.
Can one man be the reason for destroying another?
The curse of husbands will not spare you.
Be careful.
- It's okay.
Is the inspector's phone ready?
It is ready.
- Give it.
Do you know the old actor 'Bagavathar'?
Yes.
- This is belongs his era.
Why is he still using it?
May be he has his sentiments about it.
We can fix that then.
I'll fix wifi, bluetooth, and all features in this.
Why would you do that!
So he can track all my activities and be a pain?
Give me the phone.
Get the money from him.
If the phone conks off again, take it to the museum.
Please don't bring it to my shop.
I'll pass the message to the inspector.
Panju, if the victim was an outsider,
He should have stayed in a hotel or at a lodge.
Why don't we enquire there.
I now know why we seem to set well together.
You speak my mind.
Well done.
Come on.
An enquiry.
- Yes, Sir.
Before 18th of September...
Did this guy stay here?
No, Sir.
Are you sure?
Or do you want confirm with someone else?
I'm sure.
He is not our guest.
Panju, this is where I stay.
Please come.
Do you know him?
No.
Take a closer look.
He was staying here.
I'm sure that he didn't stay here.
How are you so sure?
I never forget any guest's face.
I can even remember a guest who stayed with us 10 years ago.
Do you know him?
No.
Give the key for room number 205.
Why?
He is staying here.
Give the key.
We are investigating trusting people like this!
Come.
He was staying here for a while.
What happened to him?
Don't bother about it.
Since when was he staying here?
They vacated last week.
THEY vacated?
How many people?
This guy, and another man with you.
What was the other man's age?
- Probably within 30.
Take the register and look for the entry.
Here.
This one?
SIRI, call.
98942-83-834.
The phone number, address, and other information from the lodge are fake.
The number is registered on a fake company's name.
They have been using it illegally.
The SIM had been active till his death.
Now it's not in use.
What about the incoming and outgoing call details?
Not too many calls.
But there are repeated calls from a number.
The number that ends with 333.
I enquired about that as well.
That's also illegal.
Not in use.
Did you get information about the other guy in the lodge?
We didn't get enough details about him.
There is just one window open for investigation now.
We have to find the one who killed him in the accident.
Our program's main concept is to find information about the unidentified dead people.
We can enquire about the rest later.
Looks like I often have to remind you who's the cop.
I'm the deciding authority here.
But finding the vehicle involved in the accident is also is a tough task...
Exactly.
Come with me.
Based on the postmortem report, the impact suggests that... it's clear that the vehicle involved in the accident is a car.
There were shattered glass pieces all over.
That must be of the car's windshield.
If it was an outsider, he couldn't have left the town without changing it.
The same applies to a local person as well.
What if it was a local person...
And he has his car hidden without changing the windshield?
Okay, you leave.
Investigate this case in your pattern.
Or try a cookery show instead.
Don't ask for my help.
- Sir, chill...
I was just giving an opinion.
You are the leader of this case.
Forget about it.
Tell me about the next step.
Start the bike.
What?
I don't know to ride a bike.
I have to do that as well?
Greetings, Sir.
Greetings.
I want all the details of windshield repairs that have been done since the 18th.
Okay, Sir.
I'll check it.
Also I need the address of nearby workshops.
Okay, Sir.
List of people who had changed the wind shield.
Yes, Sir.
Yes, it was an accident.
A coconut fell from the tree at full speed and shattered the glass.
Repair cost me 4000 rupees.
This car?
Did you replace a damaged windshield?
- Yes.
How did it get damaged?
Some kids broke it while playing cricket on the streets.
Mohan.
- Welcome, Sir.
I want the details of those who have changed windshields.
Here it is, Sir.
A car from Dindigul has been here for a windshield change.
Let's enquire.
This is the number.
Siri, call...
I'm dead serious in the middle of this,
You are always poking the phone in my face saying 'Siri...'
Can't you even dial a number?
Sorry, Sir.
I'm used to it.
Yes, a minor accident.
So I changed the windshield.
I had even filed an FIR to claim insurance.
Do you want the FIR number?
It's okay.
Not necessary.
Thanks.
Are we taking the right path?
Only some places are left.
Let's hope for the best.
Come.
Panju.
Who is it?
Manoj?
Yes.
Yes, that's me.
And you are?
We are coming from Kanyakumari police station.
We want some details.
Is there a problem?
Shall we talk inside?
Okay, come in.
Who has kept this here?
- Don't change it's position...
If you change it, he will get hurt later.
Thanks.
And you are?
He has come with me.
Take your seat.
Tell me.
The car parked outside...
Is it yours?
Yes.
You have changed the windshield of the car on the 19th.
How did it break?
Why do you want to know about that?
A small enquiry.
Tell me.
Some drunkards pelted stones on it as I'd parked it outside.
So I covered it and parked inside later.
You seem to have changed the glass in a hurry.
Small shards of broken glass pieces are still there.
Sir...
I'm a blind man.
How would I know such details about the car?
Am I the one driving the car?
Who drives it?
My driver.
Until a couple of months ago.
After that?
He didn't maintain.
the car properly
Also, I didn't use it much.
So I had to relieve him from his job.
No one used the car after that.
I take an auto or cab if necessary.
So...
No one has used the car for 2 months now?
Yes.
Anything else?
We will contact if anything else needed.
I have some work now.
So... 2 thugs came home...
Your sight?
Greetings, Sir.
- You are Moorthy, right?
Sculptor Manoj's Driver?
I was working as his driver 2 months ago.
Didn't you continue after that?
No, Sir.
Don't lie.
You have driven his car and got it into an accident on the 18th.
I'm working here for the past 2 months.
It has been while since I last saw Mr.Manoj.
Why would I drive his car?
Manoj said that you were fired because of you didn't maintain the car properly.
I was his driver for 3 years.
If that was true, he could've fired me long ago.
My current employer verified with him before giving me this job.
You can cross-check if needed.
If it wasn't you, who would've driven the car?
I thought that he was going to sell the car.
He didn't say anything when I asked him.
One day, I saw a lady driving his car.
I heard that she was staying with him.
I presumed that that might be the reason for firing me.
Do you know her?
No.
I have not seen her while I was working for him.
How did she look like?
She was young, fair, and stylish.
Age?
She was a young lady.
Would you able to identify her?
I can't be very sure.
We will enquire again if required.
Give me your number.
You mustn't leave the town now.
Okay, Sir.
Yes, aunt.
How are you?
I'm okay.
Tell me.
What's the matter?
Did Varun call you?
I have deleted his number.
Why would he call me?
Even if he calls, I'm not ready to talk to him.
Please.
Don't get furious.
Even when he had was blind, he was peaceful.
Now everything has turned upside-down.
Why are you telling me this?
Varun left for Kanyakumari all of a sudden.
He didn't share any further details.
He has not been picking my calls either.
I'm confused.
And worried.
So I called you.
Sorry, aunt.
Don't call me hereafter regarding him.
I'll get it repaired.
This Alphonse can fix all phones, don't worry.
Okay.
I'll leave.
Bye.
Welcome.
- Did you get any information?
No call from the number you mentioned got completed.
From Manoj's number?
Yes.
Unless the call gets completed, I can't find the number Manoj has been dialling.
I checked the date you mentioned.
After the 17th, there are no incoming or outgoing calls to and from the number.
But before the 17th, calls have been made and received to and from a specific number.
I eve have it written down somewhere.
Here it is.
7599... 447333.
333...
A number that ends with 333.
Details of this number?
You said the the victim of the accident got calls from a number?
Is it the same number?
Let me check.
Yes.
It's the same number.
The number we got from the lodge, Manoj's number, and this number.
There's some connection definitely.
Sir.
Moorthy, how are you?
- I'm fine.
Did our car met with an accident?
Why do you ask?
The cops are torturing me, Sir.
They are accusing me of that accident, that I drove the car.
What did you say?
That I am no longer working for you.
I told them that the lady with you drives your car.
How did you...
Why did you blabber all that?
Don't you have any sense?
- Sir!
Fool!
Manoj, tell us the truth at least now.
Who was with you?
What actually happened?
Who is it?
The same cops who came yesterday.
Tell me what happened.
I did tell you that nothing happened.
Please leave.
If nothing had happened... there is no need for you to get furious.
Manoj!
Manoj!
Manoj, open the door!
Open the door!
Hello!
Where are you going?
You can't leave the place without answering us.
I have no obligations to do so.
I'll tell what I have to tell at the police station.
I'm a cop myself!
You can tell me.
- Auto!
Why is he so adamant?
I don't know.
Start the bike.
Come on.
I'm dead!
Though I wasn't a super-cop, I was at least called a mediocre one.
I might lose that even identity now, because of you!
Keep going, Panju.
Will you drive recklessly just because you are cop?
Can't you be careful?
Where is your helmet?
Let's go, Panju.
Sorry, man.
Idiot.
He went inside!
How do I always find one like this!
Hey!
Inspector Arivazhagan?
Yes.
Are you Inspector Arivazhagan?
Yes.
Tell me.
Are you Inspector Arivazhagan?
Indeed I am.
Tell me.
Are you really Inspector Arivazhagan?
Who is this at my station, questioning me?
Hey, Panju!
Sir!
- Come here!
Sir?
Find out what this man wants.
Okay, Sir.
Come.
Did I really speak to the Inspector?
Yes.
Why are you bugging us?
Tell me, is he really Inspector Arivazhagan?
Yes, he is.
You came so furiously to meet this very same Arivazhagan.
Manoj.
Manoj, please relax.
I can understand that you are in some trouble.
Your car was involved in the accident.
The person with you must have driven the car.
Your intention of saving her is not wrong.
But a life has been lost.
Don't get scared, Manoj.
We are not dealing this case officially.
Only if you tell the truth, we can save you and your friend.
Just like this, a guy came to help.
The penalty I paid for it is 20 lakh rupees.
To whom did you give?
Inspector Arivazhagan.
What do you mean?
!
That who he said he was.
Last week, my girlfriend Ashwini and I had gone for a drive.
Go away.
Just one kiss like this.
Fraudster!
What do you call this then?
This was just a rehearsal.
Suddenly, she thought she saw someone standing on the road and she swerved the car away in one quick movement.
Ashwini!
What happened?
Ashwini!
Ashwini!
Where are you?
What happened?
What happened?
I killed a guy, Manoj.
Come, Ashwini.
Let's go.
I convinced her somehow and got her home.
All this happened because... some idiot had placed a scarecrow in the middle of the road.
I consoled her that it was not her fault.
But she kept crying.
We couldn't sleep out of fear.
The calling ball rang at 5 AM.
Who is it, Ashwini?
At this time?
Police!
A policeman has come!
Inspector Arivazhagan.
Can I come in?
He got in and started threatening us.
The car being involved in the accident...
Ashwini having driven it...
The windshield of the car having broken...
He seemed to know everything.
He threatened that he had evidence for it all.
Ashwini and I...
Ashwini immediately pleaded guilty.
Ashwini is an NRI, right?
Yes, Sir.
- Hit-and-run case.
If an FIR is filed, she can't go back.
You must help us!
Please, Sir!
I ensure that a case is not filed.
But if any of his relative create a problem, we need to silence them.
That will cost you.
No, Manoj.
Sir, I killed him.
I accept my fault.
Keep quiet, Ashwini!
Sir...
What should we do?
Manoj.
Where is Ashwini now?
She didn't like me bribing the cop.
She felt guilty and left the same day.
I don't know where she went or what she is doing now.
I could not contact her either.
Seeing everything that is happening now,
I'm worried about her safety!
She should be safe, Manoj.
Is Ashwini's number?
7599... 44... 7333?
Yes!
How do you know it?
We will explain.
If we need to find Ashwini...
We need some details about her.
Since when do you know Ashwini?
Recently...
Not too long ago...
She came to see my sculptures.
We became friends.
You said Ashwini was an NRI?
Yes.
From Singapore.
She has some ancestral property near Nagercoil.
She had come to sell it.
Was she staying with you?
At first she was staying outside.
As we got closer...
She came here and stayed with me.
I was happy every single moment that I spent with her.
She loved me as well.
But everything turned up-side-down in one night.
Maybe Ashwini has gone back to Singapore.
Do you have that contact number?
Her E-mail ID, Facebook ID, or something like that?
No.
- Nothing?
So you had kept punching a number no longer in use!
Manoj...
Do you have any photo of you and her together?
No, I don't.
What will I do with the photos?
The few photos that we did take are on her phone.
Any of your relatives or friends who have seen Ashwini?
No.
Have you seen any of her friends or relatives?
No.
Where is that ancestral place that you mentioned?
I don't know.
- What?
What were you doing with her without knowing anything?
Manoj...
Have you both gone out somewhere together?
Sometimes we used to go for a night drive.
Mostly we like solitude.
Hmmm...
Enjoyment in solitude...
Please think about it...
Haven't you gone out anywhere together?
On my birthday...
We went to a temple and had lunch outside.
Which restaurant?
Beach Walk.
- When is your birthday?
September 12th.
Okay, Manoj.
We will try to find Ashwini.
You don't get scared.
Thank you.
Don't go to the police station again.
You may end up in an even bigger trouble.
Not all cops will be honest like me.
Got it?
Panju.
If 333 number is Ashwini's...
The victim is related to Ashwini.
But, Ashwini... has not shared that detail with Manoj.
So, our next target is...
Ashwini.
Go to September 12th.
Lunch time.
Panju.
That camera.
Play this camera's footage.
Play the other one.
- Done?
No, Sir.
I'll take care.
- Panju.
They will leave now.
I assure you.
Varun.
- Sir.
Please wait.
We are checking, right?
- What is this?
Wait.
What is this?
Nothing, Sir.
Why are they hitting the waiter?
It's nothing serious..
- Hey...
I want the answer.
- Sir...
He had been taking photos of the women coming to the restaurant discreetly...
A customer noticed it.
He was caught.
When everyone started hitting him, he escaped.
If we report it to the police, our restaurant will get a bad name...
So we handled the situation and let it go.
Where is he now?
Is nobody there in the neighbouring house?
No idea, Sir.
The guy who was working at Beach Walk restaurant.
His name is Dinesh.
It's him.
Yes.
He was working in some hotel.
- Where is he?
I don't know, Sir.
He should be somewhere around.
Thanks.
(boys chattering)
Sorry, Sir.
Please throw the ball.
I just said sorry.
Throw the ball, Sir.
Oh, here you are!
Met him?
They came searching for you.
Hey, stop!
Hey!
This fellow...
Hello, Sir.
- Where are you?
I am chasing an accused in high speed, Sir!
I'll talk later.
I can't even catch such a slow-runner!
I...
Varun!
Idiot!
Will you keep breaking rules just because you are a cop?
You are always interfering a responsible cop on duty!
Get lost!
Leave me!
I said leave me!
Why are you after me?
What do you want?
Sir, leave me!
Leave me, Sir!
What wrong did I do?
Sir...
- Got it?
Sir!
There's nothing in it.
Please give it.
Stay quiet.
Unlock it.
- Leave me!
Give me the phone!
- Hey...
Unlock it!
Sir!
- Stay quiet!
Leave me!
- Panju...
When is Manoj's birthday?
- September 12th.
He keeps annoying!
Don't move!
Won't you leave?
Sir...
Stay quiet!
Sadhana!
What are you doing here?
How did you come here?
Are you still after her?
I wonder why I came running for you!
Your mom is worried about you, wondering where you are, what you are doing...
And here you are, roaming behind your lover.
Don't talk nonsense without knowing about the situation!
This is Ashwini.
Are you trying to act wise by changing her name?
I know that it's Deepa.
I can never forget that face.
You were all intimate with her at the restaurant!
If you knew Deepa all along...
Why didn't you mention it when I was searching for her?
Yes, it's my mistake.
Big mistake!
I should have found he, gotten her married to you, and blessed you both.
It's my mistake.
Please forgive me.
You will never change.
You will go completely mad roaming behind her!
Please don't blabber without knowing the situation.
There's nothing complex to understand.
Please, Sadhana!
I'm already terribly confused.
You are actually very clear.
Only I am confused and running behind you repeatedly...
What's happening here?
But...
I have seen many fraudsters.
But you have tricked a cop for your own selfish, personal reasons.
Panju...
- You easily decided that a person like me will be a constable forever, that you can take full advantage of me!
Can't blame you.
My face is made to look like that!
Had I not known the truth even now,
I would be roaming with you dreaming of becoming a TV celebrity.
Mister...
- You almost got me fired from my job!
We couldn't have made such a progress in this case without you!
You would have gotten nowhere had I not come.
Panju, the case has made a big progress.
Our work starts only now!
Our work?
I won't even have you on my Facebook friend list.
Enough!
We started this case to find the details of the dead man.
But this case has reached new heights now.
If we are able to nab her,
You will be in the limelight.
She is really a journalist.
If we solve this case perfectly,
The cover page of her magazine Vikatan will bear your photo.
This face?
Cover page?
Manoj.
Why is he sobbing like this?
How many shocks in the truth can he bear to hear in a day?
He will be normal in a while.
You left him to sob alone?
- What do you want me to do?
He is crying by himself.
You should be the one to console him.
Go.
- Not again!
So, she has been selectively cheating blind men.
They have to be blind...
They must believe her stories.
Must be ready to give the money she asks.
She targets those people.
in the name of love...
And made a clean sweep.
If my instincts are right, even now... she should be cheating someone...
Call Priya.
Priya...
Where are you?
You, are one sneaky lady.
A small, loveable vampire.
You are a feisty flood, in a body that is opaque like glass.
You, are one sneaky lady.
A small, loveable vampire
You are a brilliant player, who plays very casually.
Oh, you...
Smart, sneaky girl!
Oh, you...
Smart, sneaky girl!
Oh, you...
Smart, sneaky girl!
Manoj.
Based on what you said...
After cheating me as Deepa...
She didn't take much time to meet you as Ashwini.
She has met you even when I was still at the hospital.
So, she might've chosen Manoj as the next target after you much earlier.
Yes.
So we must find out the way she finds these blind people.
Yes.
Apart from Manoj and I being blind...
What is common between us?
A blind man is cooking...
That made people to come to my restaurant.
That gave me publicity.
That helped my business as well.
Yes.
I have even written about him.
Manoj...
Has there been any newspaper article or TV news about you?
I'm not all that famous.
I'm just a simple man.
She will not come after a simple man.
- Exactly!
You are successful in your field.
You must have gotten some recognition.
You must have been received some awards.
Or any ceremonies that you have presided over as a chief guest...
Something like of that sort?
You could have spared the biscuit.
Looks like Vijay Awards memento.
What is it Varun?
Tamilnadu Entrepreneur's Association for the Specially Abled.
Hey!
Didn't they give you an award last year?
This is the chronological list of awardees with the criteria.
Check if it has their contact details.
Superb.
Exclude other disabled persons, now...
Only blind members...
Details of award winners and those without an award...
The members of this list must be her target.
These are the ones who got cheated, and ones who are about to get cheated.
This is the list.
So the job is simple.
All we need to do is to contact them, and ask them, if a girl cheated...
If we ask them if they've been cheated by a girl... our progress will end there, since half the people would have no idea that they've been cheated, and even if they know, they will not acknowledge it.
Keeping aside all of that...
Assuming that she is cheating someone on the list right now...
The moment we contact him, she will abscond.
And after that, we can never find her.
So, she should not know that we are after her.
But we have to nab her.
How is that possible?
These guys are in various towns and cities.
How can we go everywhere?
There is a way.
Our student reporters are present everywhere.
This is a small assignment for them.
Will it work out?
Definitely.
I'm calling from the Trichy women's prison.
Where is she?
- Erode.
So she has been is caught in our radar!
Her name is neither Deepa nor Ashwini.
It is Vasundhara.
Her native is Trichy.
She worked in a jewellery shop there.
She duplicated the jewels that don't sell...
And stole the original.
She was caught red-handed one day.
From the May of 2013 to the November of 2013, she was imprisoned at Trichy Jail.
Her father is no more.
Her mother passed away when she was in prison.
Any relatives?
One maternal uncle, Ravi.
Do you want to see who that is?
Look.
So it's a well-planned and executed ordeal.
But the mastermind behind all of this is
Vasundhara.
I am not able to, Vikram.
You know that my parents are no more.
My brother is all I have.
Why does he have all these problems!
You could have told me in advance.
Never-ending problems...
Hospital atmosphere...
Smell of medicines...
Amidst all of this, the happiness that I have left is when I'm away from all these.
and spend some time with you.
Do you want to me to cry that time also?
What do doctors have to say?
Before the tumor grows further, a liver transplant has to be done.
There is no enough time to wait for a suitable donor.
The only option left is to arrange for an organ illegally through an agent.
But...
It's very expensive.
I have lost hope fully!
My brother...
Don't say that now...
I'm here to help you.
I'll be there for you.
Listen.
I'm expecting a payment this week.
Give me 2 to 3 days.
I'll somehow arrange for the money.
No.
No, Vikram.
- Don't talk like an idiot.
This is your brother's life.
That's the priority now.
You proceed with arrangements for the transplant.
We will take care of the rest later.
Priya.
Thank you so much.
A boat load of lies, in those big beautiful eyes of yours.
You girl, are an anaconda in the disguise of an innocent child.
So...
What's the next plan?
Erode.
Are we going by bus or by train?
Go!
Go fast.
Are you sure it's Vikram?
Yes, I'm tracking the number you gave.
It's displaying that he is just in the car in front of yours.
Varun, what are you doing?
- Leave me!
I'll kill her!
Listen.
- Hey!
Don't do anything silly.
Don't move.
Everything will go in vain if you go there now.
We can't prove anything with what we have found out so far.
Have some patience.
She has a new scapegoat.
All we have to do is to catch her red-handed.
At least we have to know what they are talking
Or do you want to sit here and issue parking tickets?
Let's do that also.
Give me the Bluetooth earpiece.
Why?
- I'll tell you, give it to me.
Wait here.
Where...
Juice will do?
Hello.
- Yes, Sadhana.
Don't talk.
Stay on line.
Had you not been here, I would have helpless.
How will I ever repay you Vikram?
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
- Hey.
Why are you so formal?
I'll get the money tomorrow.
You focus on the arrangements.
Are you done with the hospital arrangements?
I came here after paying the advance amount.
My brother's friends are with him at the hospital.
He is repeatedly asking to meet you.
Once the transplantation is done,
I will be the first person to meet him.
She is cooking a story to rob him.
Priya?
Are you crying?
Thanks for being there, Vikram.
Be strong.
I'll be there for you.
Your company is all I need.
Everything will go smoothly.
Who is this woman?
!
Even I want to fall in love with her!
I'll pay.
What's your lover Vasundhara saying?
Start, start...
Go closer!
Follow them.
You, moron!
We have to take the other route now.
Move...
- Idiot.
- We lost them!
Panju, call Alphonse.
I'm not able to reach him.
Bye.
- Bye.
Who is it?
- It's me.
Why did you come here?
Did anyone see you?
I took the backside stairs.
None saw me.
An important matter.
So...
Whatever it is, you should have just called me.
Varun is here.
In Erode.
- Varun?
The chef from Chennai.
So what?
He might have come for some official work.
No.
He has come searching for you.
They have seen you at the hotel with Vikram.
I heard the girl with him address you as 'Vasundhara.'
Then they followed you in a car.
I diverted them.
I think they know everything.
They come targeting us.
We shouldn't take further risks.
Drop Vikram.
Let's go.
What?
Listen to me.
Let's leave this right here and go.
This won't work anymore, Vasundhara.
You always talk negatively!
Aren't you ashamed?
People will keep chasing us if we run.
They will stop only if we make them run instead.
Tomorrow, by this time, we have the money in hand.
Nothing should stop that.
Understood?
You are the reason for all these!
We can't get any money from Varun.
All his money has been spent on his eye surgery.
Everything has messed up.
we have to leave empty-handed now!
Forget it.
We can't expect all our attempts to be successful.
One or two might go out of our hands.
Okay.
What's next?
I'll tell you.
And listen...
Give us our share.
What are you saying, uncle?
We won't get any money.
And you are talking about a share!
Look...
From spying on Varun and drafting a plan for you, there has been no mistake from our side.
If the plan messes up in the last minute...
We can't help that.
- Hey...
You will get your share if the plan go as anticipated.
Or else...
The loss is for everyone.
If you'd properly given our share earlier, why would I demand now?
You always take the major share.
What we get is just the leftovers.
If we don't get even that now, should we beg?
Look!
I'm the one who gets directly involved.
I'm the one who takes the maximum risk.
You and him...
You will not get caught for sure.
If I get caught...
I'm done.
Don't cry like a kid.
Go and see what needs to be done.
If Vasundhara gets to know, we will get into trouble.
The chances of her knowing are very low.
She is with Manoj now.
She will not search for us.
This is the only opportunity we will get.
If we continue like this...
She will treat us like dogs forever.
We can't gain anything from being like that.
Don't think too much.
I have planned everything.
Talk your girl, Divya.
She has to come.
She must not disclose these details to anyone.
Got it?
Where were you?
You weren't in Kanyakumari for the past 2 days...
Since we had no work here, we had gone to Kerala.
What is your Manoj saying?
You left me alone with him, and went on a vacation?
You said that if we lure Manoj with money and wealth, we can easily trap him.
He is least bothered about it.
He is sticking to me like a leech and torturing me.
What sort of background work have you done?
He is in love with me.
You have easily dealt many men before this.
This guy doesn't even stand a chance.
You are being a bit restless.
Fetch me some water.
Deal with him with some patience.
If it doesn't work out... we'll change the plan.
Thomas.
Get me my handbag from the backseat, please.
There is a pen inside.
This one?
- Open the cap.
Thanks.
Vasundhara!
- I can sense that you both involved in something.
What's it?
Vasundhara...
- Tell me, what is it?
It will not take any time for me to poke this into your throat!
(stuttering)
Ravi drafted the plan.
We went to Chennai to meet Varun...
Ravi sold all the jewels... we looted from Varun.
Ravi... has all the money.
Sorry.
I'm very sorry.
If uncle has taken such a step...
I'm the one to be blamed.
I thought that if you had too much money, you will spend it all on alcohol and other such nonsense.
I have saved a share separately for you.
I did for a good reason.
But it has gone wrong.
Let Manoj's deal get finished.
I'll give your fair share.
Only if we are united, we can cheat others.
If we cheat amongst ourselves, we will not prosper.
Got it?
Don't share this with uncle.
I'll draft a plan for Manoj and let you know.
Let's go to the hospital and then leave.
In the route from Kanyakumari to Nagercoil, these 3 trees are our mark.
You wait here.
I'll give a missed call while I come close...
You set a scarecrow looking like a human in the middle of the road.
I'll hit the scarecrow, and act as though I'd hit a man.
Then you have to lie on the road like a dead man.
Definitely he will get scared.
He will try to run away from the spot.
Then you clear the spot, and leave the place.
The plan is perfect.
Hey, please...
Ashwini, what happened?
!
What happened?
Tell me!
Ashwini!
What happened?
Where are you?
Ashwini, where are you?
Ashwini!
Ashwini, what happened?
He's dead, Manoj.
Come, Ashwini.
Let's go.
Let's not stay here.
Who is it, Ashwini?
Inspector Arivazhagan.
Can I come in?
Sir, I killed him.
I accept my doing.
Do you know how many years of jail for a hit-and-run case?
Keep quiet, Ashwini.
Sir...
What should I do?
I'll tell you.
I'll miss you, Manoj.
Be careful.
I'll be awaiting your call.
Call me soon.
A beautiful plotter One who cannot be controlled whatsoever.
You are a small secret That hits away with ease the balls life throws at you.
A beautiful plotter One who cannot be controlled whatsoever.
A chameleon in the disguise of a cute barbie doll.
Ravi is nowhere to be seen.
His phone is not reachable.
Did he inform you?
Did he call you?
Get me my bag from the backseat.
Get it.
Oh, you ....
Smart, sneaky girl!
Oh, you ....
Smart, sneaky girl!
Oh, you ....
Smart, sneaky girl!
He will not return.
Varun knows everything.
If he'd come here to catch me, even after seeing me, why didn't he come to me?
Why should he follow me?
That simple means, he has no concrete evidence so far.
He won't get any evidence hereafter as well.
But...
The important thing is that he should not reach Vikram at any point.
Vikram.
- Priya.
I guess you can sense that I'm not fine.
Priya, don't worry.
I am not able to...
My mind is not at peace.
Tomorrow, everything should go well.
The organ dealer should properly arrange everything.
The transplant for my brother should go well.
With all these things running in my mind,
I'm not able to stay normal.
I don't think I can stay alone here.
If you are with me,
I'll feel better.
I've been feeling the same way since I dropped you.
I shouldn't have left you alone.
I'll come there right away.
I'll be with you till everything ends well.
Okay?
Thanks, Vikram.
Sir.
- Hey!
Where had you gone?
- My phone fell into the water
Can't you pick the phone?
Don't shout without knowing what happened.
- What happened?
Did someone die?
- Worse than that!
- What?
I'm using the phone that fell into a commode.
Alphonse...
- Look how he is responding...
He is screaming at me.
- Ignore him.
Did you trace their location?
- Shall we leave?
Okay.
AKG service apartment is Vikram's location.
Vasundhara's phone shows the same location.
They must be together.
Let's go.
Panju.
Panju.
407.
- Sir.
You seem to be very clear about what you need.
I'm the confused one running after you repeatedly.
Driver.
Start.
Go...
Hey!
She has swept his account clean.
Thank you.
She did see us, right?
Yes.
She must have cracked our plan!
Everything's gone!
Don't unnecessarily get tensed.
We have to catch her now.
That is important.
Okay.
Go...
Stop.
- Why are you stopping the car?
Who are you?
- Quick.
- Sadhana, go.
I'm a cop.
We are in a hurry chasing an accused!
I'm a cop.
- This person is seriously injured!
It's an important case.
At least tell us where the hospital is.
It's within a kilometer.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go fast!
Is everything okay, Alphonse?
Yes.
But you keep following them properly.
Madam, speed up.
Please.
What's happening there?
Nothing.
You keep tracking.
He is taking a left.
Where are you going?
Go straight!
We have almost reached the hospital.
Okay, go.
Idiots!
Take a left.
- Shut up.
We are caught up in some issue.
I'll call you again.
Hang up.
Is your phone in within the network range, Vikram?
Not sure.
I'll have to check.
After Vikram withdraws money from the bank, take the Perundurai route.
After reaching the outskirts,
Take off of the highway and drive the car into a deserted area.
I'll scream and pretend to be panicking.
Vikram will get tensed.
Hit him then, and push him off the car.
We leave with the money like it is a kidnap drama.
We both will escape.
Driver.
Where are you going?
- What happened?
Not sure.
He is taking the wrong route.
Where are you going?
Go back to the main road.
I'm telling you to turn back!
Why are you taking the wrong route?
Not this hospital.
Please go straight.
- Are you kidding me?
!
Please go straight.
- Don't you want to save him?
Get down!
Get down!
Varun, get down.
Sadhana, open the door.
Go straight.
Who are you guys?
!
Go straight.
Pick up the phone!
Varun.
Get in, fast!
Let's go!
Go!
Call Alphonse and find out where she is.
Panju...
Panju...
Panju!
What happened?
Drive to a hospital!
Stop the car!
Why?
- Do as I say!
Take Panju to the hospital.
And you?
I have to catch her.
- Are you mad?
Hey...
You go.
Sadhana, go!
Vikram, he...
Turn the car back!
This is Varun.
- How many times do I call you!
Where are they?
- I'm not able to track either of their numbers.
Both numbers are switched off.
- Okay.
Track my number.
- Your number?
Your number?
Why are you talking nonsense?
I said 'track my number.'
Did you?
Yes.
On Perundurai road...
It is showing some location off the main road
You are moving in the right direction.
Priya, what happened?
Vikram!
- Why has he stopped the car?
I don't know.
- Where are we?
I've have no clue.
- Priya!
Priya!
- Leave me!
Leave me!
- Leave her!
Priya, where are you?
Priya!
Priya!
Priya, are you there?
Hey, leave her!
Priya...
Give that.
Leave her!
Priya!
Take all the money you need.
Please let her go!
Priya...
You, are one sneaky lady.
A small, loveable vampire.
You are a feisty flood, in a body that is opaque like glass.
You, are one sneaky lady.
A small, loveable vampire.
You are a brilliant player, who plays very casually.
Oh, you...
Smart, sneaky girl!
Oh, you...
Smart, sneaky girl!
Oh, you...
Smart, sneaky girl!
Leave.
Leave that.
Do you love her very much?
It is said 'Love is blind.'
She looted us all, taking advantage of that.
Don't get fooled by such women.
Tie it properly...
What are you doing?
By deceiving visually challenged people with love,
Vasundhara, who has been charged with financial forgery is being investigated by the police.
We chased Vasundhara for many days regarding this case.
We are collecting the details of the money lost by the victims.
What a man!
Thank you very much.
Your news has taken over every news channel.
You are the pride of our district!
Thank you.
- Congrats, constable sir.
Thank you, Sir.
Super, dude!
One cop like you in a town is enough to stop fraudsters.
Thank you.
- You are great!
Is it your felicitation ceremony or mine?
You have achieved a great thing.
You've got all the accolades that I should have for my service for 37 years of service today!
Sir...
I just did my job.
People giving the praise...
The photos of the victims have been recovered from Vasundhara's phone.
Is that you?
That is definitely you!
Why would you take a picture that close to her!
Dear...
She is already jailed.
Your anger still not subsided?
!
Varun, I'm coming for you.
- Rita.
Rita!
Aw come on, guys!
Come on, I'm not in the mood!
This isn't funny!
This isn't even clever!
Dammit Randy, I'll buy you a new carpet all right?
Sorry.
Hey if you wanted to scare me you could've tied me up better.
Okay.
Okay.
Come on.
Hello?
Hello?
Can anyone hear me?
I'm trapped in a cabin somewhere,
I don't really know where it is.
I'm uh, surrounded by...
Trees.
Uh, mayday.
I don't know where I am, please, if anyone can hear me, please help.
Think, think, okay.
Picked up Rita, okay, I had a drink.
I had two drinks.
Then uh, then I came home.
Did I get home?
Was I drunk?
No, no, no, no, no, no, come on, come on, come on.
Don't lose it, all right?
Okay, all right.
Okay, good.
Let's see what...
Okay.
Of course.
Hello?
Hello?
- Lester.
- Who is this?
- Your friends call you les.
- Who is this?
Look mister, please, I need help, I'm trapped in a cabin and I have no idea where I am.
I think maybe if you GPS it, though, you'll be able to find me.
- It's going to be very difficult if you keep interrupting', les.
Now calm down, can you do that?
- Yes, yes.
- Good, now how 'bout you take a seat right there?
- Yes.
- You know all about comfort, don't you?
Complacency, ease, goin' out on the town dressed to the nines and such.
Allow me to introduce myself.
You may call me wolf.
- Wolf?
Wolf like the guy on CNN?
- Yeah, just like the guy on CNN.
I have brought you here, Lester.
- You brought me here?
You brought me here?
What the hell for?
- Would you hush up?
I know we about your situation.
- Look, I'll pay you whatever you want.
My family will give you whatever you want.
Hello?
Wolf?
- I was hopin' i wouldn't have to pull some cuyon parlor trick to keep ya here, Lester.
You rushed my hand.
As I was sayin' before you interrupted, it makes conversation very difficult.
- Just tell me what you want.
- That's the first time you ever been scared for your life, isn't it silver spoon?
- Silver spoon?
I'll give you silver spoon, you psycho.
Why don't you come in here and I'll knock you so hard.
My family is going to sue your ass.
Do you get that?
My uncle is a Jewish lawyer, my friend, that means jail time!
You could get real acquainted with bubba.
- Feel like a big man now?
Now you tried to rush off before i could tell you the rules.
Now in ever sport, there's rules.
Ready to listen?
- Yes.
- Tres bon.
You are here les because you have sinned.
Well you committed the worst sin a boy like you can commit.
Irre-sponsi-bili-Ty.
You've wasted your life.
That's all you is, a middle manager at papa's company.
Still livin' in the glory days of your frat house.
Women's objects, classic that's an awful nice watch you're wearin'.
Daddy get that, too?
When a boy like you lives the way he does, there's poison in his life.
I'm the anti-venom.
- What are you talking about?
- Manhood.
Les, you know the Indians, they had these rituals where they send their boys off in the woods to survive.
And when they came back and if they came back,
they earned the right to be called a man.
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- You will learn les.
Sacrifice, honor, pain...
These ain't catch phrases no more.
It is your new life.
- What is this?
- Les, if you try to leave the cabin, I'll kill you.
And if by some miracle you get past me, the wilderness will kill you.
Now there's only one way off this mountain, so you best listen closely.
You have to man-up les, not a mindless, wanna-be jock, but a real man, a
who can take care of hisself.
A man who can take a hit and keep moving.
Oh I will help you do that, les.
I will help.
I will just as soon end you, too.
You see, I am the hunter...
But I dare not even call you prey, no, not yet.
Prey presents a challenge.
So help me god, by the end of this, you will present me with a challenge.
Try to break the rules and I'll end you.
Run down that path again, find out.
Now, you have the rest of the day to settle in.
Use it.
The hunt is on.
- Come on, can do this.
If anyone is out there, please respond.
If anyone is out there, please respond.
If anyone can hear me, please respond.
Wolf!
Where are the boots?
What?
- You did a very bad thing yesterday, tryin' to escape.
- You tried to shoot me.
- I shot at you.
Big difference, let me assure you.
- You were here last night.
Why didn't you just finish it then, tough guy?
If you're some hotshot hunter, why didn't you just kill me?
- Listen, you find yourself in a tootaloo, you ain't gotta call nobody.
It's up to you to figure it out.
- I find myself in a what?
- You're gonna slowly freeze to death.
Now shut up and listen to me.
- Okay.
- There's a safe, no doubt you found it by now.
- I saw it, yeah.
- Inside the cabin somewhere is the combination.
You oughtta get to gettin'.
- Find the combo?
All right and after you amuse yourself watching me tear this place apart, what then?
What are you gonna do?
Kill me?
Why don't you just come in here and face me like a man?
Or are you too scared, huh?
Why don't you come in here so that I can pound your little face in?
I'm tired of your game, asshole.
Run, run, run, run.
- Les?
If you're there, pick up.
- I'm here, wolf.
Where are you friend?
I've got my gun back.
- I have to admit, I'm right proud of you, boy.
You must feel like a big boy, goin' break the eggs and such.
- Come on wolf, let's do this.
Let's do this, I'm waitin' for you, wolf.
Come on, come and kill me!
- Well,
- what's your endgame, wolf?
Do you honestly think you can just keep me here and get away with it?
- How's Rita?
- Rita?
- Your girlfriend?
- You have her?
- Relax, I'm askin' about her, ain't I?
How is she, doin' good?
- Shut up.
- Yeah, that's the twisted thing about our culture, we don't believe in honor.
It's a word without meanin' that some of the marines use in their commercials.
That's about it.
- Rita's just fine.
- Don't kid yourself.
She just busted into tears just a few night ago.
- When I get out of here, I'm gonna put a bullet through your skull.
- That's a bold assumption.
When you get out?
Try if.
The wolf ain't done hurting'.
- I don't think so.
I'll sit right here and wait for you.
- That's too bad.
I just left a little present for you by the shed.
- Oh, come on baby.
That's good.
That's good, that's good.
Yes!
Yes!
Hey!
Okay, okay.
Fire.
Fire.
The ability to start and maintain a fire is crucial to a marine's survival in the cold weather theater.
Too bad I'm not a marine.
You will need kindling, an ignition source, fuel for the fire, a steady oxygen flow and a means by which to...
I'm gonna die.
All right, now you listen to me.
If you want some prey and if you're some hotshot hunter, then you're gonna have to keep me alive.
Now tell me how to start the fire.
I know you can see me.
Hey, you see that?
Tell me how to start the fire.
- I gave you dinner, now you want me to cook it for you, too?
Aren't you so suave?
- Look, you want to keep me alive.
More sporting.
- You don't know nothin' about sporting'.
- Maybe, but I can take a few guesses about you.
You aren't from around here, I can guess that.
Not with that stupid hillbilly accent of yours which means you trained to stay up here.
You're good with guns and survival.
The manual you gave me is from the marines, not to mention that little bit about commercials.
So you're a marine, or were, at least.
You know you're probably some washed out old guy talkin' 'bout the glory days of 'nam who likes stalking rich kids!
You're just havin' fun with me, aren't ya?
My dad is probably dumping ransom money into some offshore account and any day now a helicopter is going to land and save me and you're just screwin' with me til then.
Yeah, this, this is nothing but a ransom.
You're a thief and that's all that it is.
- Wanna eat?
- Oh why yes, please, mister wolf.
I'll jump through whatever hoops you want me to.
I'll sing and I'll dance for you, too.
Hey!
Hey, stop!
Hey!
Hey, stop!
Stop!
Wait!
Hold on a minute.
Hey, easy.
Look...
I was taken.
I'm just looking for a way out of here.
Do you speak English?
Easy, easy, easy, calm down, calm down.
All right, all right, all right, all right.
Okay, okay.
All right.
Sorry buddy.
It's all right.
Do you know English?
- Yes.
- Oh thank god.
Okay.
Okay, I just...
I'm stuck here.
I mean I was put here.
All right.
I just, there's a cabin.
Hey, what?
All right, easy, easy.
It's cool, it's cool.
I woke up in a chair and I...
Do you know how to cook?
Then I saw a sheep in the tree.
I tried to cut it down the best I could.
I think I saw you.
- I was trying to sneak around.
- Ah, when did you wake up?
- About two days ago.
- Sounds about right.
Do you have your own cabin somewhere around here or?
- No, he made a snow shelter for me.
That's where I've been.
He told me how to make a fire and a spear.
- Whoa, hold on, you can make a fire?
- Yeah.
- If you can make fire, then we can cook.
We can eat, come on, come on, let's go.
- Why did he give you a cabin?
- Well, he wanted to teach me to be a real man, you know?
Be all tough and cool and manly.
- No, why did he give you a cabin and I get a hole in the ground?
- I don't know.
Maybe he doesn't, i mean, you know, maybe he doesn't like your kind.
- My kind?
- Well yeah, you're Mexican, right?
- Are you serious?
- Yeah I'm serious.
Look, he's trying to teach you a lesson, so what lesson is he trying to teach you?
I mean are you allowed to be here?
- Oh wow.
- No, it's cool.
I'm cool.
Look, I'm from the oc, I got like two Mexican friends, they got like a hundred legal cousins.
- Oh you have two Mexican friends?
Multicultural.
You think I'm here because I'm Mexican?
You're a jackass.
He told me that I need to stand up for myself.
- Oh.
My bad.
I am starving.
I am sopping wet.
And I am freezing.
Well, start us some fire.
Do you need help?
- I want you to go away.
- What?
- If you see how to make fire, I'm not useful to you.
You can throw me out.
- Come on, you've gotta be kidding.
I'm not going to do anything like that.
- Do you want to eat?
- All right.
Cool your jets.
You're out there right now, aren't you?
You're watching us.
Why'd you send her here, wolf?
Ah, you can probably see me right now.
Why is she here?
For whatever reason, she isn't gonna stick around long.
I'll figure it out.
- It ain't hard.
- What did you say?
- I say it ain't hard to figure out.
I sent her there to kill you.
- Why doesn't that surprise me?
I can't tell, wolf.
I can't tell if you're trying to kill me or tryin' to help me.
- Well then, I better send you a clear message.
- Yeah, and what's that?
Wolf?
Wolf?
- Oc?
- Hmm?
- You're from orange county?
- Yeah.
- I had family there once, they've moved back.
I was trying to get an internship...
- how did you get my boots?
- Hmm?
- You were wearing my boots.
Those boots.
How did you get them?
- I don't understand.
- You know...
Two days ago, I was a different guy.
You see that's the weird thing,
I don't know who I am anymore.
And I sure as hell don't know who you are.
- My name is Viviana.
- I didn't ask.
I said how did you get my boots?
- Those aren't your boots.
- Why did he send you?
Shut up!
Why did wolf send you?
- He gave me the boots.
- Start talkin' Viviana.
- I told you he gave me the boots.
- You know I never touched one of these things, but I think if I can gut a sheep then I can gut you, too.
- No!
He told me that i needed to kill that, that I need to take your things and I would die if I didn't action for myself.
- You?
You kill me?
You kill me?
- No, no I
- ah, shut up!
Are you enjoying the show?
Huh?
- Are you out of your mind?
- Well you're here to kill me, so I guess it's pretty fair.
We're gonna die out here, do you know that?
Sorry.
- Yeah, sure, it's all forgiven.
- I see it, but I don't believe it.
Is that Lester workin'?
I mean is he actually workin'?
- Laugh it up, funny man.
- Oh I am, i am enjoyin' the show.
Especially the show last night.
Let me give you some advice since you're new to all this.
Next time you wanna scare someone, use fire.
The thought of their skin peeling' back and bubbling' up, ah, it's especially effective.
- You know, I never touched a woman until last night?
You made me do it, wolf.
- Rita, oh Rita would disagree.
- I never hit her.
- Nah, you never touched Rita in your life.
No, it was all them other whores you couldn't keep your hands off of.
All them other ladies you've been, what do your friends call it?
Stabbin'.
- It doesn't matter, I'm gonna fix it.
- Well now i guess I shore hope you do get off this mountain because it would be a sight to see.
You crawling' back on your little worm belly oh, begging' forgiveness.
Please, baby, please, I swear it was a moment of weakness.
- Well what about you, huh?
Kidnapping some innocent Mexican girl and throwing her on top of a mountain.
That isn't too gentlemanly, wolf.
- Touche.
But let's not forget that this whole exercise we're doin' out here is about you growin'.
- I still think it's a ransom.
I think my dad is paying you off and any day now, a helicopter is going to land and save me.
- Is that so?
Why you out here loppin' up trees not a lot definitive 'bout what you're doin' out here.
I spent so much time chopping' up wood so you could stay warm.
- I need to be ready for my trip back home.
- Well if that's the case,
I got a proper pair of boots for ya.
- And I'm sure there's no catch.
- Just a little walk, 'bout a mile or so north.
I left 'em near a cabin.
- Oh I think I'll stay right here.
- Bon chance.
- What's all this?
Expedient snow shoes?
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's do it.
- Just do it.
Okay here, no, no, no, no.
Let me...
- no, we just.
Just give me one second.
It's just that you have to do a double knot here.
- Yeah, well there's a way of doing a double knot and that's just silly.
- This is another knot.
- Fine, it's a double knot.
- Hey, so about last night I'm...
- let's try them, okay?
Come on.
- Oh, oh, oh.
Come here.
Come here!
- What is the matter with you?
That was completely unnecessary.
- I'll take the bait.
- I really don't think...
- you don't think what?
All right, I see that's the place.
- This doesn't feel right.
- Of course it doesn't.
- Please don't go in there.
- Look, I didn't walk all the way out here just for the fun of it, all right?
Just stay down.
- Listen to me.
- What?
What?
Keep a lookout.
- You won't get far.
- I'm not staying here.
- I told you it was a bad idea to go there and I'm telling you it's a bad idea to leave now.
- Look, he can't track us in the dark, all right?
That gives us the advantage, okay?
Gives us a head start.
- I don't wanna go.
- Okay, I don't wanna end up like those guys in the cabin.
You have to tell me how to make a fire.
Please.
- What's with the watch?
- Viviana, if i can't make a fire, then I'm going to freeze to death.
- You will anyway.
You're leaving at night.
This is so stupid.
- No, staying here, that is stupid.
- Leaving at night, that's worse.
- Tell me how to make a fire.
- Tell me about the watch.
- I don't have time for games.
God!
Why you?
The watch was a present from my old man all right?
When I got my first job, but i got fired soon afterwards so he let me keep it to remind myself.
- As a reminder of what?
- Of the time.
Jesus are you stupid?
As a reminder that i screw up everything.
- You have a battery in your lantern.
- Yeah.
- I'll give you some of this.
- Steel wool?
- Yeah.
You rub them together.
- That's cool.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Come on!
Oh god, no.
Oh god.
I'm sorry, god, for...
Everything.
I'm sorry, dad, for being a...
A terrible son.
I'm sorry Rita.
I'm sorry.
Screw it.
Come on.
Viviana!
Viviana!
Help!
- Oh my god, Lester, are you okay?
- Oh god, it hurts.
- What hurts?
Oh!
- Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
I'm freezing, I'm freezing.
I'm no use.
- It's okay.
Oh my god.
- No, don't touch.
- I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
- Don't, don't touch it, all right?
- I'm sorry.
Is an idiot.
- I have no idea what you said, but I'm sure that I deserve it.
All right, you son of a bitch.
- Busy night?
- I've learned my lesson.
- Well mother nature's a tough bitch sometimes.
You gotta watch out for her.
- Why didn't you shoot me?
- It takes a big man to crawl a mile on the snow with a hole in his leg.
Seriously, that's tough.
How's it treatin' ya?
- I'm going to strangle you.
- You got there.
Now I remember once on a huntin' trip, I busted my ankle...
- I'm going to enjoy the look on your face when they shove that needle in your arm.
I'm gonna sit back with the biggest smile.
- I remember once on a huntin' trip,
I busted my ankle now.
I was a long shot off in the woods with no one around...
- stop with the anecdotes!
Wolf, I'm sorry.
- How is your supplies doin'?
- I don't know, why?
- Well, you shouldn't be worried about threats, and much more about a certain combination lock.
- Combination?
- There's a safe in the closet.
- And you never look how to open it?
Where do you want me to start?
- I don't care.
- Okay.
I'll start outside.
- Viviana!
- Did you find it?
- No, Viviana, get back inside!
- What?
- Just get back inside!
Please, now!
Come on!
- I'm coming.
- Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
- What happened?
- Nothing, I just i had a bad feeling.
What?
- I had a bad feeling yesterday and you walked off.
- Really, really?
That's the productive thing to say?
- I was trying to help.
- Well, okay then, excuse me.
I'm Viviana, I'm so smart and strong and I can handle wolf by myself, that's fine.
- I was still looking for the combo.
- Yep, nice and sturdy, just how I like ya.
Viviana!
Oh Viviana.
Look what I got.
Oh no, what am i gonna do with this?
Fine.
Guess who found the combination?
Oh, come on.
Oh yes.
Oh my god.
Oh.
Oh Jesus.
Mmm.
Thank you wolf.
- We should have opened this sooner.
- Oh yeah.
Ouch.
- You need to take off your pants.
- No.
- How am I supposed to put the bandage on?
- Just put it on top.
Ow, be careful.
- I'm trying.
- Ah, it hurts!
- Shut up!
- What?
- You hear that?
Do you hear that?
- No way.
- Yeah!
- I was right.
- I don't see anything.
- Hey!
- Where is it?
- Hey!
Help!
Wolf!
Wolf!
Okay, you said he gave you things.
- He left instructions for me.
- Did you meet him?
If we're gonna beat him, we have to do it at his own game.
- He's a very dangerous man.
- He's a dangerous man?
Get out of town, no kidding.
- Would you stop doing that?
- Doing what?
- Talking like that.
- All right, all right, all right, all right.
Okay.
- He thinks that what he's doing is right.
- Yeah, well not dying is right for me, so I'm gonna do that.
- I woke up in a snow cave.
- Okay.
- That's our exit.
We need to leave now, we'll make a snow shelter.
- Okay.
Okay, who built your snow cave?
- He did.
- Oh, and how are we supposed to build it?
- We have the manual.
- Okay, we have the manual.
All right, now all we need is 100 marines, a pickax, some shovels, a bulldozer would be nice.
Okay, look, he's trained, we're not.
That manual, it might as well be in Chinese.
- It doesn't matter, i survived there for two nights.
I know we can do this.
- Look, I tried this once before, okay?
Look what happened.
I almost died and this time, we might not be so lucky.
- You left by yourself and you left at night.
This time we're leaving together and it's daytime.
We can walk as far as we can and then we'll find a place to build a snow cave.
- How am I supposed to trudge in knee-deep snow with this?
- I'm gonna help you.
You have to listen to me, Lester.
This is our only chance.
For the first time, we're gonna be one step ahead of him.
You said it before, we have to beat him at his own game.
This is it, Lester.
If someone's in fact looking for you, he won't let them save you.
He will kill you.
And now that the weather is changing, we'll have a chance.
He won't be able to track us.
- Just give me a minute.
Okay.
How do you want to do this?
- Together.
I though white people go camping all the time.
Don't you?
- Racist.
Here you go.
All right, it says that we need to criss-cross the branches for the roof.
All right.
- And then we need younger ones.
- More?
- Yeah, and make them longer.
- Longer?
Okay.
- So they go from one side to the other.
- All right, all right.
- Hey.
You can't.
Tell me about her.
Lester?
- Hmm?
- You have a girlfriend.
- Yeah.
- Is she pretty?
- She's gorgeous.
- Does she take good care of you?
- Yeah, she does.
- She's a lucky girl.
- I wouldn't say so.
Viviana!
Viviana!
Viviana wake up!
The fire's almost out!
- What?
- It's almost dead.
- Light the sticks.
- They won't light, they won't light, they're too cold.
I need your steel wool.
- We used mine last, where's yours?
- Oh no.
I left it at the cabin.
Oh sh...
- What does it say?
No, what are you doing?
- Look, we have no choice, all right?
- Yeah, we need it!
- We need a fire.
- Is it working?
- There we go.
There we go, it's catchin', it's catching.
- Do you hear that?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Our tracks, our tracks he's spot our tracks.
Okay we need to split up.
Go, go, go, go, go.
Go.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
- Lester!
- Look.
- Oh, okay, come on.
- Viviana, hey, we gotta Viviana?
Viviana?
Wake up.
Viviana please.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Please Viviana, wake up.
Viviana!
Viviana wake up!
No, no please.
Please, I don't know what to do.
Please tell me what to do.
Viviana, please don't, please don't, please don't go.
Please don't go.
Please I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do, please tell me what to do.
Please.
Please, I don't want to be alone.
Please don't leave me here alone.
Oh, boy.
Oh, no I was only 16.
And my dad comes up to me and says,
"i worked to build my company so you need to learn"
"how to do the same."
So he made me get a job.
And I looked and i looked and I looked and all I could find was
that stupid hot dog joint.
With the hats, you know?
Oh, those stupid, stupid hot dog hats.
And that's where I got a job.
Oh.
I was so mad at him about it.
You know, wasting my time wearing a wiener hat.
Like that was supposed to teach me to be a business man.
And dad's all telling me about how I need to start from the bottom and work my way up and how tough he had it when he started his company.
So what I did...
There was this uh, there was this girl who worked at the earring shop.
So I started flirting with her, this cute little thing, too.
And I got her to give me a piercing for free.
Just to get back at him, you know?
So I come home with this thing in my ear and he's all, "what the hell is that?"
And I go dad, I'm gay!
God, you shouldda seen him.
Oh god.
He was so pissed, he was so pissed.
Oh, he took away my car and my phone and I'm all like dad, how am i supposed to get to work now?
Oh, god.
Pretending I'm gay just to get to him, you know?
So of course I got fired.
I only worked there a week.
And I didn't get a job until after college.
I wouldn't even have gotten in if it wasn't for the strings he pulled.
Now I'm workin' for him.
Ah.
Man.
Maybe it wasn't worth it, you know?
Maybe it' wasn't.
Oh god.
Ah sh...
Oh
Ow.
Dad, please help me!
Please help me!
I want to go home.
I want to go home.
I wanna go home.
I want to go home.
I'm still alive wolf.
I'm still here.
- Les.
She did a number on my ribs, I'll tell you what.
Breathin' gettin' hard.
- Did you hear me?
- You know about Theodore Roosevelt?
- I'm listening.
- 26th president of these United States.
He carved the canal at Panama.
Charged San Juan hill.
He was a man's man.
You know what he said, les?
He said if it weren't for the time he spent in the wilderness, he'd never had the courage to become president.
And mother nature couldn't even kill him.
It was said death had to take him sleeping', 'cause otherwise he wouldda put up a fight.
- And what's this supposed to teach me?
- You remind me of 'im.
It seems mother nature ain't gonna kill you, neither.
You crawled back twice now.
That's more than most folks would ever do.
I figure it's best time I come around, stop in for a visit.
- Is that supposed to scare me, wolf?
- Why's you fightin' so hard for such a miserable life?
- Because I just started living it.
- Well Lester, you can ambush me.
Now Lester, I thought after all you'd been through, you'd put up more of a fight.
What a disappointment.
Runnin' ain't gonna save you, boy!
- Rita.
Rita!
Aw come on, guys!
Come on, I'm not in the mood!
This isn't funny!
This isn't even clever!
Dammit Randy, I'll buy you a new carpet all right?
Sorry.
Hey if you wanted to scare me you could've tied me up better.
Okay.
Okay.
Come on.
Hello?
Hello?
Can anyone hear me?
I'm trapped in a cabin somewhere,
I don't really know where it is.
I'm uh, surrounded by...
Trees.
Uh, mayday.
I don't know where I am, please, if anyone can hear me, please help.
Think, think, okay.
Picked up Rita, okay, I had a drink.
I had two drinks.
Then uh, then I came home.
Did I get home?
Was I drunk?
No, no, no, no, no, no, come on, come on, come on.
Don't lose it, all right?
Okay, all right.
Okay, good.
Let's see what...
Okay.
Of course.
Hello?
Hello?
- Lester.
- Who is this?
- Your friends call you les.
- Who is this?
Look mister, please, I need help, I'm trapped in a cabin and I have no idea where I am.
I think maybe if you GPS it, though, you'll be able to find me.
- It's going to be very difficult if you keep interrupting', les.
Now calm down, can you do that?
- Yes, yes.
- Good, now how 'bout you take a seat right there?
- Yes.
- You know all about comfort, don't you?
Complacency, ease, goin' out on the town dressed to the nines and such.
Allow me to introduce myself.
You may call me wolf.
- Wolf?
Wolf like the guy on CNN?
- Yeah, just like the guy on CNN.
I have brought you here, Lester.
- You brought me here?
You brought me here?
What the hell for?
- Would you hush up?
I know we about your situation.
- Look, I'll pay you whatever you want.
My family will give you whatever you want.
Hello?
Wolf?
- I was hopin' I wouldn't have to pull some cuyon parlor trick to keep ya here, Lester.
You rushed my hand.
As I was sayin' before you interrupted, it makes conversation very difficult.
- Just tell me what you want.
- That's the first time you ever been scared for your life, isn't it silver spoon?
- Silver spoon?
I'll give you silver spoon, you psycho.
Why don't you come in here and I'll knock you so hard.
My family is going to sue your ass.
Do you get that?
My uncle is a Jewish lawyer, my friend, that means jail time!
You could get real acquainted with bubba.
- Feel like a big man now?
Now you tried to rush off before I could tell you the rules.
Now in ever sport, there's rules.
Ready to listen?
- Yes.
- Tres bon.
You are here les because you have sinned.
Well you committed the worst sin a boy like you can commit.
Irre-sponsi-bili-Ty.
You've wasted your life.
That's all you is, a middle manager at papa's company.
Still livin' in the glory days of your frat house.
Women's objects, classic that's an awful nice watch you're wearin'.
Daddy get that, too?
When a boy like you lives the way he does, there's poison in his life.
I'm the anti-venom.
- What are you talking about?
- Manhood.
Les, you know the Indians, they had these rituals where they send their boys off in the woods to survive.
And when they came back and if they came back,
they earned the right to be called a man.
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- You will learn les.
Sacrifice, honor, pain...
These ain't catch phrases no more.
It is your new life.
- What is this?
- Les, if you try to leave the cabin, I'll kill you.
And if by some miracle you get past me, the wilderness will kill you.
Now there's only one way off this mountain, so you best listen closely.
You have to man-up les, not a mindless, wanna-be jock, but a real man, a
who can take care of hisself.
A man who can take a hit and keep moving.
Oh I will help you do that, les.
I will help.
I will just as soon end you, too.
You see, I am the hunter...
But I dare not even call you prey, no, not yet.
Prey presents a challenge.
So help me god, by the end of this, you will present me with a challenge.
Try to break the rules and I'll end you.
Run down that path again, find out.
Now, you have the rest of the day to settle in.
Use it.
The hunt is on.
- Come on, can do this.
If anyone is out there, please respond.
If anyone is out there, please respond.
If anyone can hear me, please respond.
Wolf!
Where are the boots?
What?
- You did a very bad thing yesterday, tryin' to escape.
- You tried to shoot me.
- I shot at you.
Big difference, let me assure you.
- You were here last night.
Why didn't you just finish it then, tough guy?
If you're some hotshot hunter, why didn't you just kill me?
- Listen, you find yourself in a tootaloo, you ain't gotta call nobody.
It's up to you to figure it out.
- I find myself in a what?
- You're gonna slowly freeze to death.
Now shut up and listen to me.
- Okay.
- There's a safe, no doubt you found it by now.
- I saw it, yeah.
- Inside the cabin somewhere is the combination.
You oughtta get to gettin'.
- Find the combo?
All right and after you amuse yourself watching me tear this place apart, what then?
What are you gonna do?
Kill me?
Why don't you just come in here and face me like a man?
Or are you too scared, huh?
Why don't you come in here so that I can pound your little face in?
I'm tired of your game, asshole.
Run, run, run, run.
- Les?
If you're there, pick up.
- I'm here, wolf.
Where are you friend?
I've got my gun back.
- I have to admit, I'm right proud of you, boy.
You must feel like a big boy, goin' break the eggs and such.
- Come on wolf, let's do this.
Let's do this, I'm waitin' for you, wolf.
Come on, come and kill me!
- Well,
- what's your endgame, wolf?
Do you honestly think you can just keep me here and get away with it?
- How's Rita?
- Rita?
- Your girlfriend?
- You have her?
- Relax, I'm askin' about her, ain't I?
How is she, doin' good?
- Shut up.
- Yeah, that's the twisted thing about our culture, we don't believe in honor.
It's a word without meanin' that some of the marines use in their commercials.
That's about it.
- Rita's just fine.
- Don't kid yourself.
She just busted into tears just a few night ago.
- When I get out of here, I'm gonna put a bullet through your skull.
- That's a bold assumption.
When you get out?
Try if.
The wolf ain't done hurting'.
- I don't think so.
I'll sit right here and wait for you.
- That's too bad.
I just left a little present for you by the shed.
- Oh, come on baby.
That's good.
That's good, that's good.
Yes!
Yes!
Hey!
Okay, okay.
Fire.
Fire.
The ability to start and maintain a fire is crucial to a marine's survival in the cold weather theater.
Too bad I'm not a marine.
You will need kindling, an ignition source, fuel for the fire, a steady oxygen flow and a means by which to...
I'm gonna die.
All right, now you listen to me.
If you want some prey and if you're some hotshot hunter, then you're gonna have to keep me alive.
Now tell me how to start the fire.
I know you can see me.
Hey, you see that?
Tell me how to start the fire.
- I gave you dinner, now you want me to cook it for you, too?
Aren't you so suave?
- Look, you want to keep me alive.
More sporting.
- You don't know nothin' about sporting'.
- Maybe, but I can take a few guesses about you.
You aren't from around here, I can guess that.
Not with that stupid hillbilly accent of yours which means you trained to stay up here.
You're good with guns and survival.
The manual you gave me is from the marines, not to mention that little bit about commercials.
So you're a marine, or were, at least.
You know you're probably some washed out old guy talkin' 'bout the glory days of 'Nam who likes stalking rich kids!
You're just havin' fun with me, aren't ya?
My dad is probably dumping ransom money into some offshore account and any day now a helicopter is going to land and save me and you're just screwin' with me til then.
Yeah, this, this is nothing but a ransom.
You're a thief and that's all that it is.
- Wanna eat?
- Oh why yes, please, mister wolf.
I'll jump through whatever hoops you want me to.
I'll sing and I'll dance for you, too.
Hey!
Hey, stop!
Hey!
Hey, stop!
Stop!
Wait!
Hold on a minute.
Hey, easy.
Look...
I was taken.
I'm just looking for a way out of here.
Do you speak English?
Easy, easy, easy, calm down, calm down.
All right, all right, all right, all right.
Okay, okay.
All right.
Sorry buddy.
It's all right.
Do you know English?
- Yes.
- Oh thank god.
Okay.
Okay, I just...
I'm stuck here.
I mean I was put here.
All right.
I just, there's a cabin.
Hey, what?
All right, easy, easy.
It's cool, it's cool.
I woke up in a chair and I...
Do you know how to cook?
Then I saw a sheep in the tree.
I tried to cut it down the best I could.
I think I saw you.
- I was trying to sneak around.
- Ah, when did you wake up?
- About two days ago.
- Sounds about right.
Do you have your own cabin somewhere around here or?
- No, he made a snow shelter for me.
That's where I've been.
He told me how to make a fire and a spear.
- Whoa, hold on, you can make a fire?
- Yeah.
- If you can make fire, then we can cook.
We can eat, come on, come on, let's go.
- Why did he give you a cabin?
- Well, he wanted to teach me to be a real man, you know?
Be all tough and cool and manly.
- No, why did he give you a cabin and I get a hole in the ground?
- I don't know.
Maybe he doesn't, I mean, you know, maybe he doesn't like your kind.
- My kind?
- Well yeah, you're Mexican, right?
- Are you serious?
- Yeah I'm serious.
Look, he's trying to teach you a lesson, so what lesson is he trying to teach you?
I mean are you allowed to be here?
- Oh wow.
- No, it's cool.
I'm cool.
Look, I'm from the OC, I got like two Mexican friends, they got like a hundred legal cousins.
- Oh you have two Mexican friends?
Multicultural.
You think I'm here because I'm Mexican?
You're a jackass.
He told me that I need to stand up for myself.
- Oh.
My bad.
I am starving.
I am sopping wet.
And I am freezing.
Well, start us some fire.
Do you need help?
- I want you to go away.
- What?
- If you see how to make fire, I'm not useful to you.
You can throw me out.
- Come on, you've gotta be kidding.
I'm not going to do anything like that.
- Do you want to eat?
- All right.
Cool your jets.
You're out there right now, aren't you?
You're watching us.
Why'd you send her here, wolf?
Ah, you can probably see me right now.
Why is she here?
For whatever reason, she isn't gonna stick around long.
I'll figure it out.
- It ain't hard.
- What did you say?
- I say it ain't hard to figure out.
I sent her there to kill you.
- Why doesn't that surprise me?
I can't tell, wolf.
I can't tell if you're trying to kill me or tryin' to help me.
- Well then, I better send you a clear message.
- Yeah, and what's that?
Wolf?
Wolf?
- OC?
- Hmm?
- You're from orange county?
- Yeah.
- I had family there once, they've moved back.
I was trying to get an internship...
- how did you get my boots?
- Hmm?
- You were wearing my boots.
Those boots.
How did you get them?
- I don't understand.
- You know...
Two days ago, I was a different guy.
You see that's the weird thing,
I don't know who I am anymore.
And I sure as hell don't know who you are.
- My name is Viviana.
- I didn't ask.
I said how did you get my boots?
- Those aren't your boots.
- Why did he send you?
Shut up!
Why did wolf send you?
- He gave me the boots.
- Start talkin' Viviana.
- I told you he gave me the boots.
- You know I never touched one of these things, but I think if I can gut a sheep then I can gut you, too.
- No!
He told me that I needed to kill that, that I need to take your things and I would die if I didn't action for myself.
- You?
You kill me?
You kill me?
- No, no I
- ah, shut up!
Are you enjoying the show?
Huh?
- Are you out of your mind?
- Well you're here to kill me, so I guess it's pretty fair.
We're gonna die out here, do you know that?
Sorry.
- Yeah, sure, it's all forgiven.
- I see it, but I don't believe it.
Is that Lester workin'?
I mean is he actually workin'?
- Laugh it up, funny man.
- Oh I am, I am enjoyin' the show.
Especially the show last night.
Let me give you some advice since you're new to all this.
Next time you wanna scare someone, use fire.
The thought of their skin peeling' back and bubbling' up, ah, it's especially effective.
- You know, I never touched a woman until last night?
You made me do it, wolf.
- Rita, oh Rita would disagree.
- I never hit her.
- Nah, you never touched Rita in your life.
No, it was all them other whores you couldn't keep your hands off of.
All them other ladies you've been, what do your friends call it?
Stabbin'.
- It doesn't matter, I'm gonna fix it.
- Well now I guess I shore hope you do get off this mountain because it would be a sight to see.
You crawling' back on your little worm belly oh, begging' forgiveness.
Please, baby, please, I swear it was a moment of weakness.
- Well what about you, huh?
Kidnapping some innocent Mexican girl and throwing her on top of a mountain.
That isn't too gentlemanly, wolf.
- Touche.
But let's not forget that this whole exercise we're doin' out here is about you growin'.
- I still think it's a ransom.
I think my dad is paying you off and any day now, a helicopter is going to land and save me.
- Is that so?
Why you out here loppin' up trees not a lot definitive 'bout what you're doin' out here.
I spent so much time chopping' up wood so you could stay warm.
- I need to be ready for my trip back home.
- Well if that's the case,
I got a proper pair of boots for ya.
- And I'm sure there's no catch.
- Just a little walk, 'bout a mile or so north.
I left 'em near a cabin.
- Oh I think I'll stay right here.
- Bon chance.
- What's all this?
Expedient snow shoes?
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's do it.
- Just do it.
Okay here, no, no, no, no.
Let me...
- no, we just.
Just give me one second.
It's just that you have to do a double knot here.
- Yeah, well there's a way of doing a double knot and that's just silly.
- This is another knot.
- Fine, it's a double knot.
- Hey, so about last night I'm...
- let's try them, okay?
Come on.
- Oh, oh, oh.
Come here.
Come here!
- What is the matter with you?
That was completely unnecessary.
- I'll take the bait.
- I really don't think...
- you don't think what?
All right, I see that's the place.
- This doesn't feel right.
- Of course it doesn't.
- Please don't go in there.
- Look, I didn't walk all the way out here just for the fun of it, all right?
Just stay down.
- Listen to me.
- What?
What?
Keep a lookout.
- You won't get far.
- I'm not staying here.
- I told you it was a bad idea to go there and I'm telling you it's a bad idea to leave now.
- Look, he can't track us in the dark, all right?
That gives us the advantage, okay?
Gives us a head start.
- I don't wanna go.
- Okay, I don't wanna end up like those guys in the cabin.
You have to tell me how to make a fire.
Please.
- What's with the watch?
- Viviana, if I can't make a fire, then I'm going to freeze to death.
- You will anyway.
You're leaving at night.
This is so stupid.
- No, staying here, that is stupid.
- Leaving at night, that's worse.
- Tell me how to make a fire.
- Tell me about the watch.
- I don't have time for games.
God!
Why you?
The watch was a present from my old man all right?
When I got my first job, but I got fired soon afterwards so he let me keep it to remind myself.
- As a reminder of what?
- Of the time.
Jesus are you stupid?
As a reminder that I screw up everything.
- You have a battery in your lantern.
- Yeah.
- I'll give you some of this.
- Steel wool?
- Yeah.
You rub them together.
- That's cool.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Come on!
Oh god, no.
Oh god.
I'm sorry, god, for...
Everything.
I'm sorry, dad, for being a...
A terrible son.
I'm sorry Rita.
I'm sorry.
Screw it.
Come on.
Viviana!
Viviana!
Help!
- Oh my god, Lester, are you okay?
- Oh god, it hurts.
- What hurts?
Oh!
- Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
I'm freezing, I'm freezing.
I'm no use.
- It's okay.
Oh my god.
- No, don't touch.
- I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
- Don't, don't touch it, all right?
- I'm sorry.
Is an idiot.
- I have no idea what you said, but I'm sure that I deserve it.
All right, you son of a bitch.
- Busy night?
- I've learned my lesson.
- Well mother nature's a tough bitch sometimes.
You gotta watch out for her.
- Why didn't you shoot me?
- It takes a big man to crawl a mile on the snow with a hole in his leg.
Seriously, that's tough.
How's it treatin' ya?
- I'm going to strangle you.
- You got there.
Now I remember once on a huntin' trip, I busted my ankle...
- I'm going to enjoy the look on your face when they shove that needle in your arm.
I'm gonna sit back with the biggest smile.
- I remember once on a huntin' trip,
I busted my ankle now.
I was a long shot off in the woods with no one around...
- stop with the anecdotes!
Wolf, I'm sorry.
- How is your supplies doin'?
- I don't know, why?
- Well, you shouldn't be worried about threats, and much more about a certain combination lock.
- Combination?
- There's a safe in the closet.
- And you never look how to open it?
Where do you want me to start?
- I don't care.
- Okay.
I'll start outside.
- Viviana!
- Did you find it?
- No, Viviana, get back inside!
- What?
- Just get back inside!
Please, now!
Come on!
- I'm coming.
- Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
- What happened?
- Nothing, I just I had a bad feeling.
What?
- I had a bad feeling yesterday and you walked off.
- Really, really?
That's the productive thing to say?
- I was trying to help.
- Well, okay then, excuse me.
I'm Viviana, I'm so smart and strong and I can handle wolf by myself, that's fine.
- I was still looking for the combo.
- Yep, nice and sturdy, just how I like ya.
Viviana!
Oh Viviana.
Look what I got.
Oh no, what am I gonna do with this?
Fine.
Guess who found the combination?
Oh, come on.
Oh yes.
Oh my god.
Oh.
Oh Jesus.
Mmm.
Thank you wolf.
- We should have opened this sooner.
- Oh yeah.
Ouch.
- You need to take off your pants.
- No.
- How am I supposed to put the bandage on?
- Just put it on top.
Ow, be careful.
- I'm trying.
- Ah, it hurts!
- Shut up!
- What?
- You hear that?
Do you hear that?
- No way.
- Yeah!
- I was right.
- I don't see anything.
- Hey!
- Where is it?
- Hey!
Help!
Wolf!
Wolf!
Okay, you said he gave you things.
- He left instructions for me.
- Did you meet him?
If we're gonna beat him, we have to do it at his own game.
- He's a very dangerous man.
- He's a dangerous man?
Get out of town, no kidding.
- Would you stop doing that?
- Doing what?
- Talking like that.
- All right, all right, all right, all right.
Okay.
- He thinks that what he's doing is right.
- Yeah, well not dying is right for me, so I'm gonna do that.
- I woke up in a snow cave.
- Okay.
- That's our exit.
We need to leave now, we'll make a snow shelter.
- Okay.
Okay, who built your snow cave?
- He did.
- Oh, and how are we supposed to build it?
- We have the manual.
- Okay, we have the manual.
All right, now all we need is 100 marines, a pickax, some shovels, a bulldozer would be nice.
Okay, look, he's trained, we're not.
That manual, it might as well be in Chinese.
- It doesn't matter, I survived there for two nights.
I know we can do this.
- Look, I tried this once before, okay?
Look what happened.
I almost died and this time, we might not be so lucky.
- You left by yourself and you left at night.
This time we're leaving together and it's daytime.
We can walk as far as we can and then we'll find a place to build a snow cave.
- How am I supposed to trudge in knee-deep snow with this?
- I'm gonna help you.
You have to listen to me, Lester.
This is our only chance.
For the first time, we're gonna be one step ahead of him.
You said it before, we have to beat him at his own game.
This is it, Lester.
If someone's in fact looking for you, he won't let them save you.
He will kill you.
And now that the weather is changing, we'll have a chance.
He won't be able to track us.
- Just give me a minute.
Okay.
How do you want to do this?
- Together.
I though white people go camping all the time.
Don't you?
- Racist.
Here you go.
All right, it says that we need to Criss-cross the branches for the roof.
All right.
- And then we need younger ones.
- More?
- Yeah, and make them longer.
- Longer?
Okay.
- So they go from one side to the other.
- All right, all right.
- Hey.
You can't.
Tell me about her.
Lester?
- Hmm?
- You have a girlfriend.
- Yeah.
- Is she pretty?
- She's gorgeous.
- Does she take good care of you?
- Yeah, she does.
- She's a lucky girl.
- I wouldn't say so.
Viviana!
Viviana!
Viviana wake up!
The fire's almost out!
- What?
- It's almost dead.
- Light the sticks.
- They won't light, they won't light, they're too cold.
I need your steel wool.
- We used mine last, where's yours?
- Oh no.
I left it at the cabin.
Oh sh...
- What does it say?
No, what are you doing?
- Look, we have no choice, all right?
- Yeah, we need it!
- We need a fire.
- Is it working?
- There we go.
There we go, it's catchin', it's catching.
- Do you hear that?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Our tracks, our tracks he's spot our tracks.
Okay we need to split up.
Go, go, go, go, go.
Go.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
- Lester!
- Look.
- Oh, okay, come on.
- Viviana, hey, we gotta Viviana?
Viviana?
Wake up.
Viviana please.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Please Viviana, wake up.
Viviana!
Viviana wake up!
No, no please.
Please, I don't know what to do.
Please tell me what to do.
Viviana, please don't, please don't, please don't go.
Please don't go.
Please I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do, please tell me what to do.
Please.
Please, I don't want to be alone.
Please don't leave me here alone.
Oh, boy.
Oh, no I was only 16.
And my dad comes up to me and says,
"I worked to build my company so you need to learn
"how to do the same."
So he made me get a job.
And I looked and I looked and I looked and all I could find was
that stupid hot dog joint.
With the hats, you know?
Oh, those stupid, stupid hot dog hats.
And that's where I got a job.
Oh.
I was so mad at him about it.
You know, wasting my time wearing a wiener hat.
Like that was supposed to teach me to be a business man.
And dad's all telling me about how I need to start from the bottom and work my way up and how tough he had it when he started his company.
So what I did...
There was this uh, there was this girl who worked at the earring shop.
So I started flirting with her, this cute little thing, too.
And I got her to give me a piercing for free.
Just to get back at him, you know?
So I come home with this thing in my ear and he's all, "what the hell is that?"
And I go dad, I'm gay!
God, you shouldda seen him.
Oh god.
He was so pissed, he was so pissed.
Oh, he took away my car and my phone and I'm all like dad, how am I supposed to get to work now?
Oh, god.
Pretending I'm gay just to get to him, you know?
So of course I got fired.
I only worked there a week.
And I didn't get a job until after college.
I wouldn't even have gotten in if it wasn't for the strings he pulled.
Now I'm workin' for him.
Ah.
Man.
Maybe it wasn't worth it, you know?
Maybe it' wasn't.
Oh god.
Ah sh...
Oh
Ow.
Dad, please help me!
Please help me!
I want to go home.
I want to go home.
I wanna go home.
I want to go home.
I'm still alive wolf.
I'm still here.
- Les.
She did a number on my ribs, I'll tell you what.
Breathin' gettin' hard.
- Did you hear me?
- You know about Theodore Roosevelt?
- I'm listening.
- 26th president of these United States.
He carved the canal at Panama.
Charged San Juan hill.
He was a man's man.
You know what he said, les?
He said if it weren't for the time he spent in the wilderness, he'd never had the courage to become president.
And mother nature couldn't even kill him.
It was said death had to take him sleeping', 'cause otherwise he wouldda put up a fight.
- And what's this supposed to teach me?
- You remind me of 'im.
It seems mother nature ain't gonna kill you, neither.
You crawled back twice now.
That's more than most folks would ever do.
I figure it's best time I come around, stop in for a visit.
- Is that supposed to scare me, wolf?
- Why's you fightin' so hard for such a miserable life?
- Because I just started living it.
- Well Lester, you can ambush me.
Now Lester, I thought after all you'd been through, you'd put up more of a fight.
What a disappointment.
Runnin' ain't gonna save you, boy!
Rita.
Rita!
Aw come on, guys!
Come on, I'm not in the mood!
This isn't funny!
This isn't even clever!
Dammit Randy, I'll buy you a new carpet all right?
Sorry.
Hey if you wanted to scare me you could've tied me up better.
Okay.
Okay.
Come on.
Hello?
Hello?
Can anyone hear me?
I'm trapped in a cabin somewhere,
I don't really know where it is.
I'm surrounded by...
Trees.
Mayday.
I don't know where I am, please, if anyone can hear me, please help.
Think, think, okay.
Picked up Rita, okay, I had a drink.
I had two drinks.
Then then I came home.
Did I get home?
Was I drunk?
No, no, no, no, no, no, come on, come on, come on.
Don't lose it, all right?
Okay, all right.
Okay, good.
Let's see what...
Okay.
Of course.
Hello?
Hello?
Lester.
Who is this?
Your friends call you les.
Who is this?
Look mister, please, I need help, I'm trapped in a cabin and I have no idea where I am.
I think maybe if you GPS it, though, you'll be able to find me.
It's going to be very difficult if you keep interrupting', les.
Now calm down, can you do that?
Yes, yes.
Good, now how 'bout you take a seat right there?
Yes.
You know all about comfort, don't you?
Complacency, ease, goin' out on the town dressed to the nines and such.
Allow me to introduce myself.
You may call me wolf.
Wolf?
Wolf like the guy on CNN?
Yeah, just like the guy on CNN.
I have brought you here, Lester.
You brought me here?
What the hell for?
Would you hush up?
I know we about your situation.
Look, I'll pay you whatever you want.
My family will give you whatever you want.
Hello?
Wolf?
I was hopin' i wouldn't have to pull some cuyon parlor trick to keep ya here, Lester.
You rushed my hand.
As I was sayin' before you interrupted, it makes conversation very difficult.
Just tell me what you want.
That's the first time you ever been scared for your life, isn't it silver spoon?
Silver spoon?
I'll give you silver spoon, you psycho.
Why don't you come in here and I'll knock you so hard.
My family is going to sue your ass.
Do you get that?
My uncle is a Jewish lawyer, my friend, that means jail time!
You could get real acquainted with bubba.
Feel like a big man now?
Now you tried to rush off before i could tell you the rules.
Now in ever sport, there's rules.
Ready to listen?
Yes.
Tres bon.
You are here les because you have sinned.
Well you committed the worst sin a boy like you can commit.
Irre-sponsi-bili-Ty.
You've wasted your life.
That's all you is, a middle manager at papa's company.
Still livin' in the glory days of your frat house.
Women's objects, classic that's an awful nice watch you're wearin'.
Daddy get that, too?
When a boy like you lives the way he does, there's poison in his life.
I'm the anti-venom.
What are you talking about?
Manhood.
Les, you know the Indians, they had these rituals where they send their boys off in the woods to survive.
And when they came back and if they came back, they earned the right to be called a man.
You've gotta be kidding me.
You will learn les.
Sacrifice, honor, pain...
These ain't catch phrases no more.
It is your new life.
What is this?
Les, if you try to leave the cabin, I'll kill you.
And if by some miracle you get past me, the wilderness will kill you.
Now there's only one way off this mountain, so you best listen closely.
You have to man-up les, not a mindless, wanna-be jock, but a real man, a who can take care of hisself.
A man who can take a hit and keep moving.
I will help you do that, les.
I will help.
I will just as soon end you, too.
You see, I am the hunter...
But I dare not even call you prey, no, not yet.
Prey presents a challenge.
So help me god, by the end of this, you will present me with a challenge.
Try to break the rules and I'll end you.
Run down that path again, find out.
Now, you have the rest of the day to settle in.
Use it.
The hunt is on.
Come on, can do this.
If anyone is out there, please respond.
If anyone is out there, please respond.
If anyone can hear me, please respond.
Wolf!
Where are the boots?

w w w . z o o c i n e . o r g
What?
You did a very bad thing yesterday, tryin' to escape.
You tried to shoot me.
I shot at you.
Big difference, let me assure you.
You were here last night.
Why didn't you just finish it then, tough guy?
If you're some hotshot hunter, why didn't you just kill me?
Listen, you find yourself in a tootaloo, you ain't gotta call nobody.
It's up to you to figure it out.
I find myself in a what?
You're gonna slowly freeze to death.
Now shut up and listen to me.
Okay.
There's a safe, no doubt you found it by now.
I saw it, yeah.
Inside the cabin somewhere is the combination.
You oughtta get to gettin'.
Find the combo?
All right and after you amuse yourself watching me tear this place apart, what then?
What are you gonna do?
Kill me?
Why don't you just come in here and face me like a man?
Or are you too scared?
Why don't you come in here so that I can pound your little face in?
I'm tired of your game, asshole.
Run, run, run, run.
Les?
If you're there, pick up.
I'm here, wolf.
Where are you friend?
I've got my gun back.
I have to admit, I'm right proud of you, boy.
You must feel like a big boy, goin' break the eggs and such.
Come on wolf, let's do this.
Let's do this, I'm waitin' for you, wolf.
Come on, come and kill me!
Well, what's your endgame, wolf?
Do you honestly think you can just keep me here and get away with it?
How's Rita?
Rita?
Your girlfriend?
You have her?
Relax, I'm askin' about her, ain't I?
How is she, doin' good?
Shut up.
Yeah, that's the twisted thing about our culture, we don't believe in honor.
It's a word without meaning' that some of the marines use in their commercials.
That's about it.
Rita's just fine.
Don't kid yourself.
She just busted into tears just a few night ago.
When I get out of here, I'm gonna put a bullet through your skull.
That's a bold assumption.
When you get out?
Try if.
The wolf ain't done hurting'.
I don't think so.
I'll sit right here and wait for you.
That's too bad.
I just left a little present for you by the shed.
Come on baby.
That's good.
That's good, that's good.
Yes!
Yes!
Hey!
Okay, okay.
Fire.
Fire.
The ability to start and maintain a fire is crucial to a marine's survival in the cold weather theater.
Too bad I'm not a marine.
You will need kindling, an ignition source, fuel for the fire, a steady oxygen flow and a means by which to...
I'm gonna die.
All right, now you listen to me.
If you want some prey and if you're some hotshot hunter, then you're gonna have to keep me alive.
Now tell me how to start the fire.
I know you can see me.
Hey, you see that?
Tell me how to start the fire.
I gave you dinner, now you want me to cook it for you, too?
Aren't you so suave?
Look, you want to keep me alive.
More sporting.
You don't know nothin' about sporting'.
Maybe, but I can take a few guesses about you.
You aren't from around here, I can guess that.
Not with that stupid hillbilly accent of yours which means you trained to stay up here.
You're good with guns and survival.
The manual you gave me is from the marines, not to mention that little bit about commercials.
So you're a marine, or were, at least.
You know you're probably some washed out old guy talkin' 'bout the glory days of 'nam who likes stalking rich kids!
You're just havin' fun with me, aren't ya?
My dad is probably dumping ransom money into some offshore account and any day now a helicopter is going to land and save me and you're just screwin' with me til then.
Yeah, this, this is nothing but a ransom.
You're a thief and that's all that it is.
Wanna eat?
Why yes, please, mister wolf.
I'll jump through whatever hoops you want me to.
I'll sing and I'll dance for you, too.
Hey!
Hey, stop!
Hey!
Hey, stop!
Stop!
Wait!
Hold on a minute.
Hey, easy.
Look...
I was taken.
I'm just looking for a way out of here.
Do you speak English?
Easy, easy, easy, calm down, calm down.
All right, all right, all right, all right.
Okay, okay.
All right.
Sorry buddy.
It's all right.
Do you know English?
Yes.
Thank god.
Okay.
Okay, I just...
I'm stuck here.
I mean I was put here.
All right.
I just, there's a cabin.
Hey, what?
All right, easy, easy.
It's cool, it's cool.
I woke up in a chair and I...
Do you know how to cook?
Then I saw a sheep in the tree.
I tried to cut it down the best I could.
I think I saw you.
I was trying to sneak around.
When did you wake up?
About two days ago.
Sounds about right.
Do you have your own cabin somewhere around here or?
No, he made a snow shelter for me.
That's where I've been.
He told me how to make a fire and a spear.
Whoa, hold on, you can make a fire?
Yeah.
If you can make fire, then we can cook.
We can eat, come on, come on, let's go.
Why did he give you a cabin?
Well, he wanted to teach me to be a real man, you know?
Be all tough and cool and manly.
No, why did he give you a cabin and I get a hole in the ground?
I don't know.
Maybe he doesn't, i mean, you know, maybe he doesn't like your kind.
My kind?
Well yeah, you're Mexican, right?
Are you serious?
Yeah I'm serious.
Look, he's trying to teach you a lesson, so what lesson is he trying to teach you?
I mean are you allowed to be here?
No, it's cool.
I'm cool.
Look, I'm from the oc, I got like two Mexican friends, they got like a hundred legal cousins.
You have two Mexican friends?
Multicultural.
You think I'm here because I'm Mexican?
You're a jackass.
He told me that I need to stand up for myself.
My bad.
I am starving.
I am sopping wet.
And I am freezing.
Well, start us some fire.
Do you need help?
I want you to go away.
What?
If you see how to make fire, I'm not useful to you.
You can throw me out.
Come on, you've gotta be kidding.
I'm not going to do anything like that.
Do you want to eat?
All right.
Cool your jets.
You're out there right now, aren't you?
You're watching us.
Why'd you send her here, wolf?
You can probably see me right now.
Why is she here?
For whatever reason, she isn't gonna stick around long.
I'll figure it out.
It ain't hard.
What did you say?
I say it ain't hard to figure out.
I sent her there to kill you.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I can't tell, wolf.
I can't tell if you're trying to kill me or tryin' to help me.
Well then, I better send you a clear message.
Yeah, and what's that?
Wolf?
Wolf?
Oc?
You're from orange county?
Yeah.
I had family there once, they've moved back.
I was trying to get an internship how did you get my boots?
You were wearing my boots.
Those boots.
How did you get them?
I don't understand.
You know...
Two days ago, I was a different guy.
You see that's the weird thing,
I don't know who I am anymore.
And I sure as hell don't know who you are.
My name is Viviana.
I didn't ask.
I said how did you get my boots?
Those aren't your boots.
Why did he send you?
Shut up!
Why did wolf send you?
He gave me the boots.
Start talkin' Viviana.
I told you he gave me the boots.
You know I never touched one of these things, but I think if I can gut a sheep then I can gut you, too.
No!
He told me that i needed to kill that, that I need to take your things and I would die if I didn't action for myself.
You?
You kill me?
You kill me?
No, no I shut up!
Are you enjoying the show?
Are you out of your mind?
Well you're here to kill me, so I guess it's pretty fair.
We're gonna die out here, do you know that?
Sorry.
Yeah, sure, it's all forgiven.
I see it, but I don't believe it.
Is that Lester workin'?
I mean is he actually workin'?
Laugh it up, funny man.
I am, i am enjoyin' the show.
Especially the show last night.
Let me give you some advice since you're new to all this.
Next time you wanna scare someone, use fire.
The thought of their skin peeling' back and bubbling' up, it's especially effective.
You know, I never touched a woman until last night?
You made me do it, wolf.
Rita, Rita would disagree.
I never hit her.
Nah, you never touched Rita in your life.
No, it was all them other whores you couldn't keep your hands off of.
All them other ladies you've been, what do your friends call it?
Stabbin'.
It doesn't matter, I'm gonna fix it.
Well now i guess I shore hope you do get off this mountain because it would be a sight to see.
You crawling' back on your little worm belly beggin' forgiveness.
Please, baby, please, I swear it was a moment of weakness.
Well what about you?
Kidnapping some innocent Mexican girl and throwing her on top of a mountain.
That isn't too gentlemanly, wolf.
Touche.
But let's not forget that this whole exercise we're doin' out here is about you growin'.
I still think it's a ransom.
I think my dad is paying you off and any day now, a helicopter is going to land and save me.
Is that so?
Why you out here loppin' up trees not a lot definitive 'bout what you're doin' out here.
I spent so much time choppin' up wood so you could stay warm.
I need to be ready for my trip back home.
Well if that's the case,
I got a proper pair of boots for ya.
And I'm sure there's no catch.
Just a little walk, 'bout a mile or so north.
I left 'em near a cabin.
I think I'll stay right here.
Bon chance.
What's all this?
Expedient snow shoes?
- Let's do it.
- Just do it.
Okay here, no, no, no, no.
Let me... no, we just.
Just give me one second.
It's just that you have to do a double knot here.
Yeah, well there's a way of doing a double knot and that's just silly.
This is another knot.
Fine, it's a double knot.
Hey, so about last night I'm... let's try them, okay?
Come on.
Come here.
Come here!
What is the matter with you?
That was completely unnecessary.
I'll take the bait.
I really don't think you don't think what?
All right, I see that's the place.
This doesn't feel right.
Of course it doesn't.
Please don't go in there.
Look, I didn't walk all the way out here just for the fun of it, all right?
Just stay down.
Listen to me.
What?
What?
Keep a lookout.
You won't get far.
I'm not staying here.
I told you it was a bad idea to go there and I'm telling you it's a bad idea to leave now.
Look, he can't track us in the dark, all right?
That gives us the advantage, okay?
Gives us a head start.
I don't wanna go.
Okay, I don't wanna end up like those guys in the cabin.
You have to tell me how to make a fire.
Please.
What's with the watch?
Viviana, if i can't make a fire, then I'm going to freeze to death.
You will anyway.
You're leaving at night.
This is so stupid.
No, staying here, that is stupid.
Leaving at night, that's worse.
Tell me how to make a fire.
Tell me about the watch.
I don't have time for games.
God!
Why you?
The watch was a present from my old man all right?
When I got my first job, but i got fired soon afterwards so he let me keep it to remind myself.
As a reminder of what?
Of the time.
Jesus are you stupid?
As a reminder that i screw up everything.
You have a battery in your lantern.
Yeah.
I'll give you some of this.
Steel wool?
Yeah.
You rub them together.
That's cool.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Come on!
God, no.
God.
I'm sorry, god, for...
Everything.
I'm sorry, dad, for being a...
A terrible son.
I'm sorry Rita.
I'm sorry.
Screw it.
Come on.
Viviana!
Viviana!
Help!
My god, Lester, are you okay?
God, it hurts.
What hurts?
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
I'm freezing, I'm freezing.
I'm no use.
It's okay.
My god.
- No, don't touch.
- I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Don't, don't touch it, all right?
I'm sorry.
Is an idiot.
I have no idea what you said, but I'm sure that I deserve it.
All right, you son of a bitch.
Busy night?
I've learned my lesson.
Well mother nature's a tough bitch sometimes.
You gotta watch out for her.
Why didn't you shoot me?
It takes a big man to crawl a mile on the snow with a hole in his leg.
Seriously, that's tough.
How's it treatin' ya?
I'm going to strangle you.
You got there.
Now I remember once on a huntin' trip, I busted my ankle...
I'm going to enjoy the look on your face when they shove that needle in your arm.
I'm gonna sit back with the biggest smile.
I remember once on a huntin' trip, I busted my ankle now.
I was a long shot off in the woods with no one around... stop with the anecdotes!
Wolf, I'm sorry.
How is your supplies doin'?
I don't know, why?
Well, you shouldn't be worried about threats, and much more about a certain combination lock.
Combination?
There's a safe in the closet.
And you never look how to open it?
Where do you want me to start?
I don't care.
Okay.
I'll start outside.
Viviana!
Did you find it?
No, Viviana, get back inside!
What?
Just get back inside!
Please, now!
Come on!
I'm coming.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
What happened?
Nothing, I just i had a bad feeling.
What?
I had a bad feeling yesterday and you walked off.
Really, really?
That's the productive thing to say?
I was trying to help.
Well, okay then, excuse me.
I'm Viviana, I'm so smart and strong and I can handle wolf by myself, that's fine.
I was still looking for the combo.
Yep, nice and sturdy, just how I like ya.
Viviana!
Viviana.
Look what I got.
No, what am i gonna do with this?
Fine.
Guess who found the combination?
Come on.
Yes.
My god.
Jesus.
Thank you wolf.
We should have opened this sooner.
Yeah.
Ouch.
You need to take off your pants.
No.
How am I supposed to put the bandage on?
Just put it on top.
Be careful.
I'm trying.
- It hurts!
- Shut up!
What?
You hear that?
Do you hear that?
No way.
Yeah!
I was right.
I don't see anything.
- Where is it?
- Hey!
Help!
Wolf!
Wolf!
Okay, you said he gave you things.
He left instructions for me.
Did you meet him?
If we're gonna beat him, we have to do it at his own game.
He's a very dangerous man.
He's a dangerous man?
Get out of town, no kidding.
Would you stop doing that?
Doing what?
Talking like that.
All right, all right, all right, all right.
Okay.
He thinks that what he's doing is right.
Yeah, well not dying is right for me, so I'm gonna do that.
I woke up in a snow cave.
Okay.
That's our exit.
We need to leave now, we'll make a snow shelter.
Okay.
Okay, who built your snow cave?
He did.
And how are we supposed to build it?
We have the manual.
Okay, we have the manual.
All right, now all we need is 100 marines, a pickax, some shovels, a bulldozer would be nice.
Okay, look, he's trained, we're not.
That manual, it might as well be in Chinese.
It doesn't matter, i survived there for two nights.
I know we can do this.
Look, I tried this once before, okay?
Look what happened.
I almost died and this time, we might not be so lucky.
You left by yourself and you left at night.
This time we're leaving together and it's daytime.
We can walk as far as we can and then we'll find a place to build a snow cave.
How am I supposed to trudge in knee-deep snow with this?
I'm gonna help you.
You have to listen to me, Lester.
This is our only chance.
For the first time, we're gonna be one step ahead of him.
You said it before, we have to beat him at his own game.
This is it, Lester.
If someone's in fact looking for you, he won't let them save you.
He will kill you.
And now that the weather is changing, we'll have a chance.
He won't be able to track us.
Just give me a minute.
Okay.
How do you want to do this?
Together.
I though white people go camping all the time.
Don't you?
Racist.
Here you go.
All right, it says that we need to criss-cross the branches for the roof.
All right.
And then we need younger ones.
- More?
- Yeah, and make them longer.
Longer?
Okay.
So they go from one side to the other.
All right, all right.
Hey.
You can't.
Tell me about her.
Lester?
You have a girlfriend.
Yeah.
Is she pretty?
She's gorgeous.
Does she take good care of you?
Yeah, she does.
She's a lucky girl.
I wouldn't say so.
Viviana!
Viviana!
Viviana wake up!
The fire's almost out!
What?
It's almost dead.
Light the sticks.
They won't light, they won't light, they're too cold.
I need your steel wool.
We used mine last, where's yours?
No.
I left it at the cabin.
What does it say?
No, what are you doing?
Look, we have no choice, all right?
- Yeah, we need it!
We need a fire.
Is it working?
There we go.
There we go, it's catchin', it's catching.
Do you hear that?
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Our tracks, our tracks he's spot our tracks.
Okay we need to split up.
Go, go, go, go, go.
Go.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Lester!
Look.
Okay, come on.
Viviana, hey, we gotta Viviana?
Viviana?
Wake up.
Viviana please.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Please Viviana, wake up.
Viviana!
Viviana wake up!
No, no please.
Please, I don't know what to do.
Please tell me what to do.
Viviana, please don't, please don't, please don't go.
Please don't go.
Please I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do, please tell me what to do.
Please.
Please, I don't want to be alone.
Please don't leave me here alone.
Boy.
No I was only 16.
And my dad comes up to me and says,
"i worked to build my company so you need to learn"
"how to do the same."
So he made me get a job.
And I looked and i looked and I looked and all I could find was that stupid hot dog joint.
With the hats, you know?
Those stupid, stupid hot dog hats.
And that's where I got a job.
I was so mad at him about it.
You know, wasting my time wearing a wiener hat.
Like that was supposed to teach me to be a business man.
And dad's all telling me about how I need to start from the bottom and work my way up and how tough he had it when he started his company.
So what I did...
There was this there was this girl who worked at the earring shop.
So I started flirting with her, this cute little thing, too.
And I got her to give me a piercing for free.
Just to get back at him, you know?
So I come home with this thing in my ear and he's all, "what the hell is that?"
And I go dad, I'm gay!
God, you shouldda seen him.
God.
He was so pissed, he was so pissed.
He took away my car and my phone and I'm all like dad, how am i supposed to get to work now?
God.
Pretending I'm gay just to get to him, you know?
So of course I got fired.
I only worked there a week.
And I didn't get a job until after college.
I wouldn't even have gotten in if it wasn't for the strings he pulled.
Now I'm workin' for him.
Man.
Maybe it wasn't worth it, you know?
Maybe it' wasn't.
God.
Dad, please help me!
Please help me!
I want to go home.
I want to go home.
I wanna go home.
I want to go home.
I'm still alive wolf.
I'm still here.
Les.
She did a number on my ribs, I'll tell you what.
Breathin' gettin' hard.
Did you hear me?
You know about Theodore Roosevelt?
I'm listening.
26th president of these United States.
He carved the canal at Panama.
Charged San Juan hill.
He was a man's man.
You know what he said, les?
He said if it weren't for the time he spent in the wilderness, he'd never had the courage to become president.
And mother nature couldn't even kill him.
It was said death had to take him sleeping', 'cause otherwise he wouldda put up a fight.
And what's this supposed to teach me?
You remind me of 'im.
It seems mother nature ain't gonna kill you, neither.
You crawled back twice now.
That's more than most folks would ever do.
I figure it's best time I come around, stop in for a visit.
Is that supposed to scare me, wolf?
Why's you fightin' so hard for such a miserable life?
Because I just started living it.
Well Lester, you can ambush me.
Now Lester, I thought after all you'd been through, you'd put up more of a fight.
What a disappointment.
Runnin' ain't gonna save you, boy!
- Hey.
- Hey.
- How was work?
- (sighs) I hate the lunch shift.
It's always foreign tourists, and they never tip.
Some day when I have money, I'm gonna travel to all their countries and stiff every last one of 'em.
My day sucked, too.
I went to 3A to fix his ceiling fan, and he doesn't know my name.
Can you believe 3A doesn't know my name?
Where'd the fancy cookies come from?
I swiped 'em from Adam's.
I was particularly generous last night, so I figured he owed me.
It really is tit for tat with you, isn't it?
- Yummy.
- Let me try.
Mmm.
They are yummy.
There's an interesting flavor in the background.
(smacking lips)
- Is it mint?
- I don't think so.
Carob?
No.
Carob's more like crappy chocolate.
Oh.
Maybe they're gluten-free.
Ugh.
People ask for gluten-free at the restaurant all the time.
I always lie and say I watched the chef de-glute it myself.
What is gluten anyway?
If I'm not mistaken, it's a chemical compound derived from the ass of the wheat plant, which is the glute.
Why do you make up facts?
Why can't you just say, "I don't know"?
(mouth full):
I don't know.
You realize I was, like, 20 years old before I found out carrots don't make your hair grow?
I got you to eat carrots, didn't I?
My point is my whole life, you did nothing but lie to me.
I lied 'cause I love you.
You lied because you're Bonnie Plunkett.
Oh, honey, I'm not really Bonnie Plunkett.
I knew it!
♪ ♪
(slowly):
Your skin is so amazing.
It's like... porcelain... but not toilet porcelain.
Tea cup porcelain.
I love your voice.
It is so soothing.
Yeah.
Sometimes I just listen to myself and I'm soothed.
- Oh, my God!
- What?
I was just hit by an intense wave of love for you.
You're my mom!
Get in here.
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Of course.
What would chairs look like if our knees bent the other way?
That was the best shower of my entire life.
I felt every drop of water meander down my body in little rivulets.
Rivulets.
Great word.
Look at this.
(laughs) Rivulets.
What?
This courtyard is a missed opportunity.
You're right.
What?
This should be a transitional space.
(snaps her fingers)
I mean, you're out there in the world, you're stressed, you're worried.
And before you get to your apartment, you have to walk through here.
Something should whisper... (whispering): "You're almost home."
Wind chimes?
Yes!
Wind chimes!
(gasps) Ooh, Adam has some hanging on his balcony.
I'll do something tricky with my tongue and an ice cube and take 'em.
I bet you're gonna marry him.
I bet I am, too.
Oh, God.
You're gonna marry Adam, and I'm gonna be here all alone.
That's not true.
You're not gonna be able to afford this place without me.
You're right.
I'm sad now.
Me, too.
(sighs)
I know.
Let's skip.
- Skip?
- Yeah.
It's impossible to be sad if you're skipping.
Hey!
It's working!
(chuckles)
Come on.
What is that?
- Skipping.
- No, it's not.
That's a w...
Woman having a seizure.
How can you not know how to skip?
My mother never taught me!
Shame on her!
Now, step.
Hop.
Step.
Hop.
Step.
- (whimpering)
- Hop.
- Step.
Hop.
- Hop.
- Step.
Hop.

Hop.
Step.
- Oh.
- Oh!

Hop!
(both whooping, clamoring)
Look at me!
I got it!
Oh!
I can skip!
I can skip!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, we better go to the meeting.
(panting)
- Let's skip there!
- (gasps)
We so have to do that.
(both laughing, clamoring)
CHRISTY:
We forgot our purses.
(panting) 4,007, 4,008, 4,009, 4,010.
4,010 skips from our apartment to the meeting.
And for every one of them, I wish that I had a sports bra.
(laughing)
Oh.
I mean, I keep waiting for my life to get easier, but these last few weeks, I feel like
I've been in a bottomless pit of sadness.
(quietly):
She should skip.
Anyway, sorry for being such a downer lately.
Thanks for listening.
Who else would like to share?
Hi.
I'm Bonnie.
I'm an alcoholic.
ALL:
Hi, Bonnie.
First of all, I want to apologize for being late 'cause you are all very important to me.
Even this woman who I've never seen before.
- What is your name?
- June.
You are very important to me, and that is a lovely name.
Thank you?
That hasn't been the case for most of my life.
I was important to me.
My daughter, of course, sometimes, was important to me,
but not much else.
But this...
This...
This is important to me.
And I guess it's kind of hitting me right now as I'm talking in my soothing voice.
Two years into my fifth time getting sober,
I finally get it.
I want to be here.
And for that, I need to thank you.
And you and you and you and you and June.
I'd like to follow that if I may.
Okay.
Hi.
I'm Christy.
I'm an alcoholic.
ALL:
Hi, Christy.
Picking up on what she said,
I want to talk about what I had for lunch today.
I usually just get a green salad, but today, I got a Chinese chicken salad.
Which I've always been suspicious of because, how does a Mandarin orange work in a salad?
But here's the thing... it does.
And so do the cashews.
And so do the wontons.
You see where I'm going here, man.
If an orange and a cashew can work together in a salad, why can't different kinds of people work together in the world?
I made her.
Now, you're probably wondering,
"Why a salad?
Why not soup?"
And to that I say, don't get hung up on the metaphor.
I could do this whole thing all over again with soup.
You keep coming back, June.
Thank you.
Remember what I told you.
Right.
I love that woman!
Where's Marjorie?
She and Victor went out to dinner for their wedding anniversary.
Oh!
Oh, that is so nice.
That means they'll be having old-people sex.
Ugh.
JILL:
Damn it!
All the cupcakes are gone.
How the hell am I supposed to stay sober without cupcakes?
Relax.
I've got artishional cookies.
Artisanal.
I think it's artishional.
I know for a fact it's artisanal.
I don't like your blouse.
Ooh, I'll take one.
Give me.
Mmm.
- Mmm.
- (sniffles)
I'm gonna sponsor June.
Well, I think we can all agree.
Jill has the most awesome hands.
(sighs)
Totally.
Oh, my God, yes.
Those hands are going on Instagram.
My secret:
I've never washed a dish.
Okay, three orders of bacon chili cheese fries.
ALL:
Yay!
(phone ringing)
Mm.
It's Adam.
How do I look?
Hang on.
Go.
(sultrily):
Hello.
Hi.
Uh, when you were over earlier, you didn't happen to take a bag of cookies home, did you?
Why are you talking so fast?
Okay, so you took them and you ate them.
We all did.
Who's "we"?
Me, Wendy, Jill, Christy and Wendy.
Oh, boy.
Where are you?
We're at the bistro.
Hey, you remember FM radio?
Don't I sound like FM radio?
Up next, "Nights in White Satin""
I'm coming right over.
I-I need to talk to you in person.
Wait, wait, wait, you're not breaking up with me, are you?
Is he breaking up with you on the phone?
That is messed up, Adam!
I'm not breaking up with you.
Just-just stay put.
I'll be right there.
Okay.
Bye.
What's going on?
Adam's breaking up with me.
This sounds like a job for skipping.
Uh-huh.
I guess we're skipping now.
Let's go.
(recorded):
Hi, this is Bonnie Plunkett.
My patience is limited.
Go. (beep)
Bonnie, it's Adam.
You weren't at the restaurant.
Where are you?
Please, please call me back.
BONNIE:
Eat my dust!
CHRISTY:
Oh, come on, wait up!
Oh, dear God.
(whooping, laughing)
You know, I learned how to masturbate on one of these.
(laughs)
- When you were little?
- No, just now.
(laughing)
Bonnie.
Oh, no, Adam's here.
Quick, everyone close your eyes so he can't see me.
Can't see me.
Honey, honey, we need to talk.
Don't break up with my mom.
She loves you.
And you make her nicer!
And she loves you!
I'm not here to break up with you, but we do need to talk.
Alone.
- Ooh...
- Ooh...
Jill, hold on to her horse so it doesn't get away.
So we're okay?
I am.
Honey, listen...
Mm-mm.
Time-out.
Are you sure?
The little horse already did half the work.
There's something that I have to tell you.
Okay, but, first, I want to tell you something.
Christy and I have decided that you and I are gonna get married.
I'm excited about it.
She's still struggling.
Let's put a pin in that.
Here's the thing... the cookies you took from my house were filled with pot.
- What?
- Yeah.
No.
That's not possible.
I know what pot tastes like and those did not taste like pot.
Maybe carob.
I'm really sorry, babe.
I really am.
(sighs) No!
You've got to be wrong.
There's no way.
(whooping, cheering)
(laughing)
Oh, my God, we're totally high.
(cheering, laughing)
I can't believe this.
Three years of sobriety erased, just like that.
I had five years and seven months!
(laughs)
Do you guys realize that we relapsed in our AA meeting?
(cackles)
How can you be laughing right now?
I don't know.
I'm trying to cry, but this is what's happening.
This is all your fault!
What did I do?
You knew what those cookies were.
You just wanted to get high and take us down with you!
Are you out of your mind?
You honestly think I would do that to my daughter, to my friends?
I think you're capable of anything!
I don't even know your real name!
Let me tell you something:
if I was gonna relapse,
I wouldn't do it on something as lame as pot!
And I certainly wouldn't share!
All right, everybody just take a deep breath.
Everything's gonna be fine.
And what the hell is wrong with you?
How do you leave drugs around when you're dating an addict?
I didn't leave them around.
They were in the cabinet behind my pots and pans!
I thought you hid them there 'cause you didn't want me to eat them.
I didn't want you to eat them!
I'm gonna have to go back to rehab.
At least you can afford rehab!
You know what, in a couple hours this is all gonna be over, let's all just calm down.
Don't tell us to calm down!
You don't know what we just lost or how hard it's gonna be to start over!
So just shut up!
Shut up!
I'm sorry.
I think we're being followed.
Thank you for coming.
I'm in way over my head.
No problem.
Little problem.
We were in the middle of a romantic dinner.
Victor, please.
I already took the pill, now it's wasted.
Hi, girls.
How we doing?
Bad.
Really bad.
I begged you not to answer your phone.
Go make coffee.
Happy anniversary to me.
Marjorie, I'm really high and I'm scared it's never gonna end.
I'm scared I'm gonna lose my job.
They drug test us!
We lost our sobriety.
We all have to start over.
Okay, let's calm down.
Don't say "calm down."
Christy does not like "calm down."
- Go help with the coffee.
- Yes, ma'am.
Okay, now, none of you had any idea there was pot in those cookies, right?
Right!
So, this was an accident.
This was not a choice anybody made.
Therefore, no one has lost their sobriety.
I sure feel like I lost it.
It feels like a death in the family.
Sugar or Splenda?
I'll just bring both.
Look, this sort of thing happens.
I had 11 years, I was on a cruise to Mexico,
I ordered a virgin piña colada,
I took a big gulp and realized it was as much a virgin as I was.
So what did you do?
I called the waitress an unfortunate name...
A series of names, really... (clears throat) but I didn't take another sip.
And that was it?
You didn't beat yourself up?
What for?
It was an accident.
I did try to make amends to the waitress, but she was so shook up, she jumped ship in Cancun.
What if I wake up tomorrow and I want to use?
Then you call me, you go to your meetings, you do what you've been doing for the past three years.
I'm still so sad that this happened.
Well that's a good thing.
It shows how much your sobriety means to you.
Christy, you're gonna be okay.
Thanks, Marjorie.
Bad news, Jill.
Marjorie has the most awesome hands.
How is that possible?
Let me see!
You all right?
Been better.
Sure different than it used to be.
Yeah.
I did like you teaching me how to skip.
I liked it, too.
I'm sorry I blamed you for what happened.
Thank you.
But in all fairness, it is your fault.
(grunts)
Who the hell is June?
So how are the girls?
Good.
We went to three meetings in the last 24 hours.
We cried about it at the first meeting, laughed about it at the second, and by the third, we were back to bitching about men.
(laughs)
That wasn't a joke.
Again, I am so sorry.
It's okay.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Hey, one other thing.
When we were in the park the other night, you said something about our relationship that...
It kind of caught me off guard a little bit.
Did I?
You did.
Hmm.
Well, I was pretty high.
You say things when you're high.
It doesn't mean anything.
Okay.
Then it's forgotten.
- Good.
- Yeah.
- You want to watch TV?
- I do.
I mean, sure.
Stupid pot.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- How was work?
- I hate the lunch shift.
It's always foreign tourists, and they never tip.
Some day when I have money, I'm gonna travel to all their countries and stiff every last one of 'em.
My day sucked, too.
I went to 3A to fix his ceiling fan, and he doesn't know my name.
Can you believe 3A doesn't know my name?
Where'd the fancy cookies come from?
I swiped 'em from Adam's.
I was particularly generous last night, so I figured he owed me.
It really is tit for tat with you, isn't it?
- Yummy.
- Let me try.
Mmm.
They are yummy.
There's an interesting flavor in the background.
- Is it mint?
- I don't think so.
Carob?
No.
Carob's more like crappy chocolate.
Oh.
Maybe they're gluten-free.
Ugh.
People ask for gluten-free at the restaurant all the time.
I always lie and say I watched the chef de-glute it myself.
What is gluten anyway?
If I'm not mistaken, it's a chemical compound derived from the ass of the wheat plant, which is the glute.
Why do you make up facts?
Why can't you just say, "I don't know"?
I don't know.
You realize I was, like, 20 years old before I found out carrots don't make your hair grow?
I got you to eat carrots, didn't I?
My point is my whole life, you did nothing but lie to me.
I lied 'cause I love you.
You lied because you're Bonnie Plunkett.
Oh, honey, I'm not really Bonnie Plunkett.
I knew it!
Your skin is so amazing.
It's like... porcelain... but not toilet porcelain.
Tea cup porcelain.
I love your voice.
It is so soothing.
Yeah.
Sometimes I just listen to myself and I'm soothed.
- Oh, my God!
- What?
I was just hit by an intense wave of love for you.
You're my mom!
Get in here.
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Of course.
What would chairs look like if our knees bent the other way?
That was the best shower of my entire life.
I felt every drop of water meander down my body in little rivulets.
Rivulets.
Great word.
Look at this.
Rivulets.
What?
This courtyard is a missed opportunity.
You're right.
What?
This should be a transitional space.
I mean, you're out there in the world, you're stressed, you're worried.
And before you get to your apartment, you have to walk through here.
Something should whisper...
"You're almost home."
Wind chimes?
Yes!
Wind chimes!
Ooh, Adam has some hanging on his balcony.
I'll do something tricky with my tongue and an ice cube and take 'em.
I bet you're gonna marry him.
I bet I am, too.
Oh, God.
You're gonna marry Adam, and I'm gonna be here all alone.
That's not true.
You're not gonna be able to afford this place without me.
You're right.
I'm sad now.
Me, too.
I know.
Let's skip.

Oh!

Oh, we better go to the meeting.
Let's skip there!
We so have to do that.
We forgot our purses.
4,007, 4,008, 4,009, 4,010.
4,010 skips from our apartment to the meeting.

We went to three meetings in the last 24 hours.
We cried about it at the first meeting, laughed about it at the second, and by the third, we were back to bitching about men.
That wasn't a joke.
Again, I am so sorry.
It's okay.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Hey, one other thing.
When we were in the park the other night, you said something about our relationship that...
It kind of caught me off guard a little bit.
Did I?
You did.
Hmm.
Well, I was pretty high.
You say things when you're high.
It doesn't mean anything.
Okay.
Then it's forgotten.
- Good.
- Yeah.
- You want to watch TV?
- I do.
I mean, sure.
Stupid pot.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- How was work?
- (sighs) I hate the lunch shift.
It's always foreign tourists, and they never tip.
Some day when I have money, I'm gonna travel to all their countries and stiff every last one of 'em.
My day sucked, too.
I went to 3A to fix his ceiling fan, and he doesn't know my name.
Can you believe 3A doesn't know my name?
Where'd the fancy cookies come from?
I swiped 'em from Adam's.
I was particularly generous last night, so I figured he owed me.
It really is tit for tat with you, isn't it?
- Yummy.
- Let me try.
Mmm.
They are yummy.
There's an interesting flavor in the background.
(smacking lips)
- Is it mint?
- I don't think so.
Carob?
No.
Carob's more like crappy chocolate.
Oh.
Maybe they're gluten-free.
Ugh.
People ask for gluten-free at the restaurant all the time.
I always lie and say I watched the chef de-glute it myself.
What is gluten anyway?
If I'm not mistaken, it's a chemical compound derived from the ass of the wheat plant, which is the glute.
Why do you make up facts?
Why can't you just say, "I don't know"?
(mouth full):
I don't know.
You realize I was, like, 20 years old before I found out carrots don't make your hair grow?
I got you to eat carrots, didn't I?
My point is my whole life, you did nothing but lie to me.
I lied 'cause I love you.
You lied because you're Bonnie Plunkett.
Oh, honey, I'm not really Bonnie Plunkett.
I knew it!
♪ ♪
(slowly):
Your skin is so amazing.
It's like... porcelain... but not toilet porcelain.
Tea cup porcelain.
I love your voice.
It is so soothing.
Yeah.
Sometimes I just listen to myself and I'm soothed.
- Oh, my God!
- What?
I was just hit by an intense wave of love for you.
You're my mom!
Get in here.
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Of course.
What would chairs look like if our knees bent the other way?
That was the best shower of my entire life.
I felt every drop of water meander down my body in little rivulets.
Rivulets.
Great word.
Look at this.
(laughs) Rivulets.
What?
This courtyard is a missed opportunity.
You're right.
What?
This should be a transitional space.
(snaps her fingers)
I mean, you're out there in the world, you're stressed, you're worried.
And before you get to your apartment, you have to walk through here.
Something should whisper... (whispering): "You're almost home."
Wind chimes?
Yes!
Wind chimes!
(gasps) Ooh, Adam has some hanging on his balcony.
I'll do something tricky with my tongue and an ice cube and take 'em.
I bet you're gonna marry him.
I bet I am, too.
Oh, God.
You're gonna marry Adam, and I'm gonna be here all alone.
That's not true.
You're not gonna be able to afford this place without me.
You're right.
I'm sad now.
Me, too.
(sighs)
I know.
Let's skip.
- Skip?
- Yeah.
It's impossible to be sad if you're skipping.
Hey!
It's working!
(chuckles)
Come on.
What is that?
- Skipping.
- No, it's not.
That's a w...
Woman having a seizure.
How can you not know how to skip?
My mother never taught me!
Shame on her!
Now, step.
Hop.
Step.
Hop.
Step.
- (whimpering)
- Hop.
- Step.
Hop.
- Hop.
- Step.
Hop.
- Hop.
- Step.
Hop.
Step.
- Oh.
- Oh!
- Step!
Hop!
(both whooping, clamoring)
Look at me!
I got it!
Oh!
I can skip!
I can skip!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, we better go to the meeting.
(panting)
- Let's skip there!
- (gasps)
We so have to do that.
(both laughing, clamoring)
CHRISTY:
We forgot our purses.
(panting) 4,007, 4,008, 4,009, 4,010.
4,010 skips from our apartment to the meeting.
And for every one of them, I wish that I had a sports bra.
(laughing)
Oh.
I mean, I keep waiting for my life to get easier, but these last few weeks, I feel like
I've been in a bottomless pit of sadness.
(quietly):
She should skip.
Anyway, sorry for being such a downer lately.
Thanks for listening.
Who else would like to share?
Hi.
I'm Bonnie.
I'm an alcoholic.
ALL:
Hi, Bonnie.
First of all, I want to apologize for being late 'cause you are all very important to me.
Even this woman who I've never seen before.
- What is your name?
- June.
You are very important to me, and that is a lovely name.
Thank you?
That hasn't been the case for most of my life.
I was important to me.
My daughter, of course, sometimes, was important to me,
but not much else.
But this...
This...
This is important to me.
And I guess it's kind of hitting me right now as I'm talking in my soothing voice.
Two years into my fifth time getting sober,
I finally get it.
I want to be here.
And for that, I need to thank you.
And you and you and you and you and June.
I'd like to follow that if I may.
Okay.
Hi.
I'm Christy.
I'm an alcoholic.
ALL:
Hi, Christy.
Picking up on what she said,
I want to talk about what I had for lunch today.
I usually just get a green salad, but today, I got a Chinese chicken salad.
Which I've always been suspicious of because, how does a Mandarin orange work in a salad?
But here's the thing... it does.
And so do the cashews.
And so do the wontons.
You see where I'm going here, man.
If an orange and a cashew can work together in a salad, why can't different kinds of people work together in the world?
I made her.
Now, you're probably wondering,
"Why a salad?
Why not soup?"
And to that I say, don't get hung up on the metaphor.
I could do this whole thing all over again with soup.
You keep coming back, June.
Thank you.
Remember what I told you.
Right.
I love that woman!
Where's Marjorie?
She and Victor went out to dinner for their wedding anniversary.
Oh!
Oh, that is so nice.
That means they'll be having old-people sex.
Ugh.
JILL:
Damn it!
All the cupcakes are gone.
How the hell am I supposed to stay sober without cupcakes?
Relax.
I've got artishional cookies.
Artisanal.
I think it's artishional.
I know for a fact it's artisanal.
I don't like your blouse.
Ooh, I'll take one.
Give me.
Mmm.
- Mmm.
- (sniffles)
I'm gonna sponsor June.
Well, I think we can all agree.
Jill has the most awesome hands.
(sighs)
Totally.
Oh, my God, yes.
Those hands are going on Instagram.
My secret:
I've never washed a dish.
Okay, three orders of bacon chili cheese fries.
ALL:
Yay!
(phone ringing)
Mm.
It's Adam.
How do I look?
Hang on.
Go.
(sultrily):
Hello.
Hi.
Uh, when you were over earlier, you didn't happen to take a bag of cookies home, did you?
Why are you talking so fast?
Okay, so you took them and you ate them.
We all did.
Who's "we"?
Me, Wendy, Jill, Christy and Wendy.
Oh, boy.
Where are you?
We're at the bistro.
Hey, you remember FM radio?
Don't I sound like FM radio?
Up next, "Nights in White Satin""
I'm coming right over.
I-I need to talk to you in person.
Wait, wait, wait, you're not breaking up with me, are you?
Is he breaking up with you on the phone?
That is messed up, Adam!
I'm not breaking up with you.
Just-just stay put.
I'll be right there.
Okay.
Bye.
What's going on?
Adam's breaking up with me.
This sounds like a job for skipping.
Uh-huh.
I guess we're skipping now.
Let's go.
(recorded):
Hi, this is Bonnie Plunkett.
My patience is limited.
Go. (beep)
Bonnie, it's Adam.
You weren't at the restaurant.
Where are you?
Please, please call me back.
BONNIE:
Eat my dust!
CHRISTY:
Oh, come on, wait up!
Oh, dear God.
(whooping, laughing)
You know, I learned how to masturbate on one of these.
(laughs)
- When you were little?
- No, just now.
(laughing)
Bonnie.
Oh, no, Adam's here.
Quick, everyone close your eyes so he can't see me.
Can't see me.
Honey, honey, we need to talk.
Don't break up with my mom.
She loves you.
And you make her nicer!
And she loves you!
I'm not here to break up with you, but we do need to talk.
Alone.
- Ooh...
- Ooh...
Jill, hold on to her horse so it doesn't get away.
So we're okay?
I am.
Honey, listen...
Mm-mm.
Time-out.
Are you sure?
The little horse already did half the work.
There's something that I have to tell you.
Okay, but, first, I want to tell you something.
Christy and I have decided that you and I are gonna get married.
I'm excited about it.
She's still struggling.
Let's put a pin in that.
Here's the thing... the cookies you took from my house were filled with pot.
- What?
- Yeah.
No.
That's not possible.
I know what pot tastes like and those did not taste like pot.
Maybe carob.
I'm really sorry, babe.
I really am.
(sighs) No!
You've got to be wrong.
There's no way.
(whooping, cheering)
(laughing)
Oh, my God, we're totally high.
(cheering, laughing)
I can't believe this.
Three years of sobriety erased, just like that.
I had five years and seven months!
(laughs)
Do you guys realize that we relapsed in our AA meeting?
(cackles)
How can you be laughing right now?
I don't know.
I'm trying to cry, but this is what's happening.
This is all your fault!
What did I do?
You knew what those cookies were.
You just wanted to get high and take us down with you!
Are you out of your mind?
You honestly think I would do that to my daughter, to my friends?
I think you're capable of anything!
I don't even know your real name!
Let me tell you something:
if I was gonna relapse,
I wouldn't do it on something as lame as pot!
And I certainly wouldn't share!
All right, everybody just take a deep breath.
Everything's gonna be fine.
And what the hell is wrong with you?
How do you leave drugs around when you're dating an addict?
I didn't leave them around.
They were in the cabinet behind my pots and pans!
I thought you hid them there 'cause you didn't want me to eat them.
I didn't want you to eat them!
I'm gonna have to go back to rehab.
At least you can afford rehab!
You know what, in a couple hours this is all gonna be over, let's all just calm down.
Don't tell us to calm down!
You don't know what we just lost or how hard it's gonna be to start over!
So just shut up!
Shut up!
I'm sorry.
I think we're being followed.
Thank you for coming.
I'm in way over my head.
No problem.
Little problem.
We were in the middle of a romantic dinner.
Victor, please.
I already took the pill, now it's wasted.
Hi, girls.
How we doing?
Bad.
Really bad.
I begged you not to answer your phone.
Go make coffee.
Happy anniversary to me.
Marjorie, I'm really high and I'm scared it's never gonna end.
I'm scared I'm gonna lose my job.
They drug test us!
We lost our sobriety.
We all have to start over.
Okay, let's calm down.
Don't say "calm down."
Christy does not like "calm down."
- Go help with the coffee.
- Yes, ma'am.
Okay, now, none of you had any idea there was pot in those cookies, right?
Right!
So, this was an accident.
This was not a choice anybody made.
Therefore, no one has lost their sobriety.
I sure feel like I lost it.
It feels like a death in the family.
Sugar or Splenda?
I'll just bring both.
Look, this sort of thing happens.
I had 11 years, I was on a cruise to Mexico,
I ordered a virgin piña colada,
I took a big gulp and realized it was as much a virgin as I was.
So what did you do?
I called the waitress an unfortunate name...
A series of names, really... (clears throat) but I didn't take another sip.
And that was it?
You didn't beat yourself up?
What for?
It was an accident.
I did try to make amends to the waitress, but she was so shook up, she jumped ship in Cancun.
What if I wake up tomorrow and I want to use?
Then you call me, you go to your meetings, you do what you've been doing for the past three years.
I'm still so sad that this happened.
Well that's a good thing.
It shows how much your sobriety means to you.
Christy, you're gonna be okay.
Thanks, Marjorie.
Bad news, Jill.
Marjorie has the most awesome hands.
How is that possible?
Let me see!
You all right?
Been better.
Sure different than it used to be.
Yeah.
I did like you teaching me how to skip.
I liked it, too.
I'm sorry I blamed you for what happened.
Thank you.
But in all fairness, it is your fault.
(grunts)
Who the hell is June?
So how are the girls?
Good.
We went to three meetings in the last 24 hours.
We cried about it at the first meeting, laughed about it at the second, and by the third, we were back to bitching about men.
(laughs)
That wasn't a joke.
Again, I am so sorry.
It's okay.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Hey, one other thing.
When we were in the park the other night, you said something about our relationship that...
It kind of caught me off guard a little bit.
Did I?
You did.
Hmm.
Well, I was pretty high.
You say things when you're high.
It doesn't mean anything.
Okay.
Then it's forgotten.
- Good.
- Yeah.
- You want to watch TV?
- I do.
I mean, sure.
Stupid pot.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- How was work?
- I hate the lunch shift.
It's always foreign tourists, and they never tip.
Some day when I have money, I'm gonna travel to all their countries and stiff every last one of 'em.
My day sucked, too.
I went to 3A to fix his ceiling fan, and he doesn't know my name.
Can you believe 3A doesn't know my name?
Where'd the fancy cookies come from?
I swiped 'em from Adam's.
I was particularly generous last night, so I figured he owed me.
It really is tit for tat with you, isn't it?
- Yummy.
- Let me try.
Mmm.
They are yummy.
There's an interesting flavor in the background.
- Is it mint?
- I don't think so.
Carob?
No.
Carob's more like crappy chocolate.
Oh.
Maybe they're gluten-free.
Ugh.
People ask for gluten-free at the restaurant all the time.
I always lie and say I watched the chef de-glute it myself.
What is gluten anyway?
If I'm not mistaken, it's a chemical compound derived from the ass of the wheat plant, which is the glute.
Why do you make up facts?
Why can't you just say, "I don't know"?
I don't know.
You realize I was, like, 20 years old before I found out carrots don't make your hair grow?
I got you to eat carrots, didn't I?
My point is my whole life, you did nothing but lie to me.
I lied 'cause I love you.
You lied because you're Bonnie Plunkett.
Oh, honey, I'm not really Bonnie Plunkett.

Your skin is so amazing.
It's like... porcelain... but not toilet porcelain.
Tea cup porcelain.
I love your voice.
It is so soothing.
Yeah.
Sometimes I just listen to myself and I'm soothed.
- Oh, my God!
- What?
I was just hit by an intense wave of love for you.
You're my mom!
Get in here.
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Of course.
What would chairs look like if our knees bent the other way?
That was the best shower of my entire life.
I felt every drop of water meander down my body in little rivulets.
Rivulets.
Great word.
Look at this.
Rivulets.
What?
This courtyard is a missed opportunity.
You're right.
What?
This should be a transitional space.
I mean, you're out there in the world, you're stressed, you're worried.
And before you get to your apartment, you have to walk through here.
Something should whisper...
"You're almost home."
Wind chimes?
Yes!
Wind chimes!
Ooh, Adam has some hanging on his balcony.
I'll do something tricky with my tongue and an ice cube and take 'em.
I bet you're gonna marry him.
I bet I am, too.
Oh, God.
You're gonna marry Adam, and I'm gonna be here all alone.
That's not true.
You're not gonna be able to afford this place without me.

Oh, we better go to the meeting.
Let's skip there!
We so have to do that.
We forgot our purses.
4,007, 4,008, 4,009, 4,010.
4,010 skips from our apartment to the meeting.

I ordered a virgin piña colada,
I took a big gulp and realized it was as much a virgin as I was.
So what did you do?
I called the waitress an unfortunate name...
A series of names, really... but I didn't take another sip.
And that was it?
You didn't beat yourself up?
What for?
It was an accident.
I did try to make amends to the waitress, but she was so shook up, she jumped ship in Cancun.
What if I wake up tomorrow and I want to use?
Then you call me, you go to your meetings, you do what you've been doing for the past three years.
I'm still so sad that this happened.
Well that's a good thing.
It shows how much your sobriety means to you.
Christy, you're gonna be okay.
Thanks, Marjorie.
Bad news, Jill.
Marjorie has the most awesome hands.
How is that possible?
Let me see!
You all right?
Been better.
Sure different than it used to be.
Yeah.
I did like you teaching me how to skip.
I liked it, too.
I'm sorry I blamed you for what happened.
Thank you.
But in all fairness, it is your fault.
Who the hell is June?
So how are the girls?
Good.
We went to three meetings in the last 24 hours.
We cried about it at the first meeting, laughed about it at the second, and by the third, we were back to bitching about men.
That wasn't a joke.
Again, I am so sorry.
It's okay.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Hey, one other thing.
When we were in the park the other night, you said something about our relationship that...
It kind of caught me off guard a little bit.
Did I?
You did.
Hmm.
Well, I was pretty high.
You say things when you're high.
It doesn't mean anything.
Okay.
Then it's forgotten.
- Good.
- Yeah.
- You want to watch TV?
- I do.
I mean, sure.
Stupid pot.
Go!
(inhales deeply)
Come on, Raj!
LEONARD:
You can do this!
There's no way.
What is happening?
This is an Euler's Disk.
It's a physics toy that demonstrates angular momentum, potential energy, and kinetic energy.
Aw, look at you watching sports.
We're betting to see if Koothrappali can hold his breath longer than the disk can spin.
Its weight and smoothness, along with the slight concavity of the mirror, means it can spin for a long time.
But Raj is from India, which means he's no slouch at holding his breath.
Okay, I want in.
Ten bucks says I'll lose interest before that thing stops spinning.
Hey, Sheldon, I found a great restaurant for date night.
Kind of busy right now.
Oh, an Euler's Disk!
Fun!
Yeah, we're seeing if Raj can hold his breath longer than it.
Oh.
Immature.
How ya doing?
Mm.
He's not gonna make it.
Yes, he is!
You know, deep-sea divers holding their breath for several minutes have shown elevated markers of a protein that can signal brain damage.
Yeah, see, what's happening here signals brain damage.
(muffled groaning)
My God, how long does this thing spin for?
Ha!
You're interested!
You're out ten bucks!
It's slowing down!
Dig deep!
Like when we bet you couldn't fit into Howard's pants!
(groaning)
He's not gonna make it!
Yes, he is!
Come on, Raj!
It's like your favorite movie!
You're just Waiting to Exhale!
(exhales)
Yeah!
I knew you could do it!
(panting):
And j.. and just so you know, my favorite movie... is Princess Bride.

Hello, Rajesh.
How are things by you?
Good, good.
Uh, listen, I just wanted to let you know when you get my credit card bill, it might be a little high this month.
Well, you're a grown man with a steady job.
Why wouldn't you spend all your father's money?
(chuckling):
Oh, Daddy, you're so rich and funny.
Yeah.
So what else is going on with your life?
Uh, well, I was dating a woman at the university, but we broke up.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know you are.
That's why you just bought me a new iPad.
And before you start,
I am not interested in you arranging a marriage for me.
Oh, I gave up on that a long time ago.
You did?
It's too much work.
You're an adult who can't get by without an allowance from his parents.
Women don't want that.
Wh-What are you saying, that y-you're giving up on me?
What kind of father gives up on his son?
I have six children, five of whom are married and self-sufficient.
I don't think I'm the problem.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
This is deeply hurtful.
You're also too sensitive.
Women don't want that either.
The food here's supposed to be great.
Don't fill up on chips.
Oh, I won't.
I have a trick.
I only eat equilateral triangles.
Isosceles, isosceles, oh, scalene...
You didn't see that.
Oh, look.
It's Bert, at the bar.
We should go say hi.
Why?
Because that's what you do when you see someone you know in a public place.
I have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise.
Sheldon, there's a difference between greeting a friend and following a celebrity into a bathroom.
If the judge couldn't explain it to me,
I don't see how you will.
Hi, Bert.
Hello.
Oh, hey, guys.
What brings you here?
Oh, we're having date night.
Nice.
I'm meeting someone, too.
Oh, really.
Anybody we know?
I doubt it.
I met her on G-Harmony.
That's a Web site for geologists to find love.
That's a real thing?
Yeah.
Their slogan is "We're all about dating and not the carbon-14 kind""
Well, have a lovely evening.
Thanks.
You, too.
If you think that's more fun than talking to Zachary Quinto through a stall door, you're crazy.
You know, we could've come to you guys.
You didn't have to bring the baby here.
Oh, it's okay.
It's good to get out of the house.
And the car ride puts her to sleep.
Aw, that used to work with Sheldon.
Yeah, until someone left him in the drugstore parking lot and he freaked out.
Who forgot to crack the window?
Hello!
LEONARD:
Hey.
PENNY:
Oh, someone's been shopping at Gucci.
Yeah, I saw something for Halley and I couldn't resist.
That's so sweet of you.
Yeah, it's a crushed velvet baby cape.
Oh, no, now we have two.
That must've been expensive.
Yeah, it was.
But it's my father's money and I'm mad at him.
What's going on with your dad?
And if you really want to hurt him,
I look great in Chanel.
(clears throat)
It turns out he doesn't care if I'm married or if I'm single.
He's basically given up on me.
Oh, I'm sure that's not true.
It is.
He stopped trying to find Indian girls for me to marry.
All you did was complain when he did that.
Leonard, he's hurting.
Let him feel how he feels.
Thank you, Penny.
Yeah.
Shoes, I'm a seven-and-a-half;
boots, I'm an eight.
...MSN Search,
AltaVista, and...
Ask Jeeves.
You?
Sorry, I don't have a list of defunct search engines that I miss.
Hey.
Looks like I got stood up, so I'm gonna head out.
Oh, no.
Are you sure you don't want to give her a few more minutes?
Nah, G-Harmony recommends after two hours, it's time to cut bait.
I'm so sorry.
Bert, I insist that you join us.
You really wouldn't mind?
Not at all.
Amy?
Fine with me.
Thanks.
I'll go grab a chair.
Sheldon, that was so sweet of you.
Well, I could deduce by his facial expression and body language that he was sad.
So the part where he got stood up didn't clue you in?
You want me to look at him and listen to him?
My father thinks the reason I can't make a relationship work is because I'm spoiled.
I'm sorry, is he waiting for someone to disagree?
Just because he helps me out doesn't automatically mean that I'm spoiled.
All right, how much exactly does he pay for?
Okay, I'll tell you, but please don't judge me.
He pays for my car, my rent, and my credit cards.
I'm trying, but I'm judging.
Maybe your dad's right.
Yeah, women do like a man that can support himself.
But Bernadette makes more money than Howard.
She basically supports him.
Yeah, maybe your dad's right.
Good question.
Let's see.
Infoseek,
WebCrawler, oh, HotBot.
Okay, literally any other topic.
All right.
How did you guys meet?
Actually, we met online.
Our-our first date was at a coffee shop.
Although, unlike your date, she actually showed up.
Oh, he looks sad again.
Well, I really envy your relationship.
Other than you two only having sex once a year, you're the perfect couple.
You-you know about that?
Uh, yeah, everyone at the university does.
Were you aware of this?
No.
No, I only told Leonard, Howard, Raj,
Kripke, uh, Professor Wu, Professor Klein, and a lunch lady in the cafeteria.
How everyone else found out is a mystery to me.
Why aren't you talking to me?
- Because I'm mad at you.
- Oh.
Well, now I'm sorry I asked.
Sheldon, it's humiliating.
Thanks to you, my colleagues are gossiping about our sex life.
What is there to gossip about?
We barely have one.
That's why they're doing it!
Is it safe to assume you're not speaking to me again?
If you're not answering because you're not speaking to me, perhaps we could come up with a signal!
(door slams)
That works!
You don't need your dad's money.
You can get by on your salary.
LEONARD:
Yeah.
Well, we work at the same place as you, and we've always been fine.
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Oh, please.
Look in the mirror.
You both look ten years older than I do.
PENNY:
All right.
Hang on.
We can figure this out.
Let's just go over your expenses.
How much is your rent?
I don't want to say.
Is it really that high?
I don't want to say because I don't know how much it is.
You don't how much your rent is?
My father pays for it!
Do you know how much your rent is?
!
Yeah.
Well, then double it, because my building's a lot nicer than this dump.
Do you know how much your car costs?
Not really.
Well, how much do you spend on food?
The housekeeper does the shopping.
Oh, my God, you really are spoiled.
I'm spoiled?
!
Your baby has a cape that costs $300!
I'm going to bed.
Well, wait.
This is our first fight as a couple who live together.
So?
I'm not sure of the protocol.
Television teaches us that the man's supposed to sleep on the couch, but of the two of us, you're clearly more sofa-sized.
I'm not sleeping on the couch 'cause you don't know what's private and what's not.
This isn't fair.
You've discussed aspects of our physical relationship with Penny.
That's different!
She's a close friend, not the lady in the cafeteria who cuts the crust off your sandwiches!
That lady has a name.
I don't know what it is, but one time, I accidentally called her "Mom".
Sounds like you're gonna need a cheaper place to live.
When you moved here, you didn't have a lot of money.
How'd you get by?
Well, sometimes you can get free food and Wi-Fi from the neighbors.
Just know you might have to marry one of 'em.
Hey, you guys let Stuart live with you.
Why not Raj, too?
What-what are you doing?
I...
I-I-I schlepped the baby over, I brought imported beer.
Why don't you like me?
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Well,
I thought we were best friends!
We are!
That's why I'm sad my best friend's gonna be homeless.
I'm sorry, Raj.
We really just don't have the space.
What if he lives in your garage?
What if you stop helping?
!
Guys, I'm not living in a garage!
Wait.
Why are we talking about our place when Sheldon's old room is sitting there perfectly empty?
That's a great idea.
Raj, if you need a place to stay, of course you are welcome here.
Thank you, but if I'm gonna just take advantage of my friends,
I might as well keep on relying on my father.
Okay, only if you're sure.
(quietly):
Whew.
Yeah.
(knocking) SHELDON:
Amy?
(knocking) Amy?
(knocking) Amy?
Yeah?
Not exactly the welcome wagon, but I'll take it.
What is this?
I'm mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed.
I call these circles "Zones of Privacy""
Don't Google that unless you want to see pictures of people's genitals.
This circle contains only me and you.
It represents subjects we only share with each other-- details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits.
Although, as I'm saying it,
I may need to add Dr. Fink in here.
Are you really worried about revealing secrets to Stephen Hawking?
No, I was just excited to list him as a friend.
Well, I do appreciate you working on this.
I'm sorry you were embarrassed.
And now I understand that some things are just between you and me, and in the event of redness and swelling, Dr. Fink.
What's that little dot in the middle?
That's reserved for thoughts I don't share with anyone.
Interesting.
You really have secrets you don't tell me?
Of course.
Can I hear one?
No, they're private.
Why?
Are they naughty?
A little.
Please?
Fine.
Two years ago I got my driver's license.
What?
!
Why didn't you say anything?
!
I like being chauffeured around.
It makes me feel important.
So when I got up at 4:00 a.m. to drive you across the desert to an antique train museum, I didn't have to?
No, you didn't.
But keep in mind,
I felt extremely important.
(line ringing)
(beep)
What?
!
Hello, Father.
We need to talk.
All right.
I have come to an important decision.
I will not be accepting your money anymore.
I'm a man, and I can take care of myself.
That's wonderful!
Yes, that is wonderful!
You will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled!
I am so proud of you.
Dad, I'm trying to tell you off, and you're ruining it with your delight and relief.
Sorry.
Oh, no, my grown son is going to stop spending all my money.
Where did I fail as a father?
!
Yeah, that's right.
Keep asking yourself that!
But I still love you very much, so don't cut me out of the will.
Oh, you brought your own lunch.
Good for you.
Yeah, I'm making a bunch of changes.
This morning, I fired my dog walker.
Oh.
How's the dog gonna go to the bathroom?
Uh, I gave her an Imodium.
That's tomorrow's problem.
Excuse me.
May I have your attention, please?
I have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler has become water cooler gossip.
And I just want to say, shame on all of you.
We're scientists.
Our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge, not the intimate details of other people's lives.
He's right.
And I'm sorry for the part I played in this.
Thank you, Bert.
You're a good man.
That woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out.
That doesn't paint me in the best light.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Correction:
That woman not only had vigorous coitus with Bert... she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done.
- That better?
- Not really.
All right, well, to sum up-- focus on science, keep your nose out of other people's business, and, uh, whoa, for a good time, call Bert.
What brought that on?
(sighs) Well, last night Amy was angry with me because I'd been foolishly telling people about certain personal matters.
That's understandable.
Oh, I know that now.
At first, I thought she was cranky because of her horrific menstrual cramps, but it turns out, no, she was genuinely mortified.

(knocking) SHELDON:
Amy?
(knocking) Amy?
(knocking) Amy?
Yeah?
Not exactly the welcome wagon, but I'll take it.
What is this?
I'm mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed.
I call these circles "Zones of Privacy""
Don't Google that unless you want to see pictures of people's genitals.
This circle contains only me and you.
It represents subjects we only share with each other-- details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits.
Although, as I'm saying it,
I may need to add Dr. Fink in here.
Are you really worried about revealing secrets to Stephen Hawking?
No, I was just excited to list him as a friend.
Well, I do appreciate you working on this.
I'm sorry you were embarrassed.
And now I understand that some things are just between you and me, and in the event of redness and swelling, Dr. Fink.
What's that little dot in the middle?
That's reserved for thoughts I don't share with anyone.
Interesting.
You really have secrets you don't tell me?
Of course.
Can I hear one?
No, they're private.
Why?
Are they naughty?
A little.
Please?
Fine.
Two years ago I got my driver's license.
What?
!
Why didn't you say anything?
!
I like being chauffeured around.
It makes me feel important.
So when I got up at 4:00 a.m. to drive you across the desert to an antique train museum, I didn't have to?
No, you didn't.
But keep in mind,
I felt extremely important.
(line ringing)
(beep)
What?
!
Hello, Father.
We need to talk.
All right.
I have come to an important decision.
I will not be accepting your money anymore.
I'm a man, and I can take care of myself.
That's wonderful!
Yes, that is wonderful!
You will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled!
I am so proud of you.
Dad, I'm trying to tell you off, and you're ruining it with your delight and relief.
Sorry.
Oh, no, my grown son is going to stop spending all my money.
Where did I fail as a father?
!
Yeah, that's right.
Keep asking yourself that!
But I still love you very much, so don't cut me out of the will.
Oh, you brought your own lunch.
Good for you.
Yeah, I'm making a bunch of changes.
This morning, I fired my dog walker.
Oh.
How's the dog gonna go to the bathroom?
Uh, I gave her an Imodium.
That's tomorrow's problem.
Excuse me.
May I have your attention, please?
I have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler has become water cooler gossip.
And I just want to say, shame on all of you.
We're scientists.
Our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge, not the intimate details of other people's lives.
He's right.
And I'm sorry for the part I played in this.
Thank you, Bert.
You're a good man.
That woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out.
That doesn't paint me in the best light.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Correction:
That woman not only had vigorous coitus with Bert... she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done.
- That better?
- Not really.
All right, well, to sum up-- focus on science, keep your nose out of other people's business, and, uh, whoa, for a good time, call Bert.
What brought that on?
(sighs) Well, last night Amy was angry with me because I'd been foolishly telling people about certain personal matters.
That's understandable.
Oh, I know that now.
At first, I thought she was cranky because of her horrific menstrual cramps, but it turns out, no, she was genuinely mortified.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Go!
(Inhales deeply)
Come on, raj!
Leonard:
You can do this!
There's no way.
What is happening?
This is an euler's disk.
It's a physics toy that demonstrates angular momentum, potential energy, and kinetic energy.
Aw, look at you watching sports.
We're betting to see if koothrappali can hold his breath longer than the disk can spin.
Its weight and smoothness, along with the slight concavity of the mirror, means it can spin for a long time.
But raj is from India, which means he's no slouch at holding his breath.
Okay, I want in.
Ten bucks says I'll lose interest before that thing stops spinning.
Hey, Sheldon, I found a great restaurant for date night.
Kind of busy right now.
Oh, an euler's disk!
Fun!
Yeah, we're seeing if raj can hold his breath longer than it.
Oh.
Immature.
How ya doing?
Mm.
He's not gonna make it.
Yes, he is!
You know, deep-sea divers holding their breath for several minutes have shown elevated markers of a protein that can signal brain damage.
Yeah, see, what's happening here signals brain damage.
(Muffled groaning)
My god, how long does this thing spin for?
Ha!
You're interested!
You're out ten bucks!
It's slowing down!
Dig deep!
Like when we bet you couldn't fit into Howard's pants!
(Groaning)
He's not gonna make it!
Yes, he is!
Come on, raj!
It's like your favorite movie!
You're just waiting to exhale!
(Exhales)
Yeah!
I knew you could do it!
(Panting):
And j..
And just so you know, my favorite movie...
Is Princess bride.

Hello, rajesh.
How are things by you?
Good, good.
Uh, listen, i just wanted to let you know when you get my credit card bill, it might be a little high this month.
Well, you're a grown man with a steady job.
Why wouldn't you spend all your father's money?
(Chuckling):
Oh, daddy, you're so rich and funny.
Yeah.
So what else is going on with your life?
Uh, well, I was dating a woman at the university, but we broke up.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know you are.
That's why you just bought me a new iPad.
And before you start,
I am not interested in you arranging a marriage for me.
Oh, I gave up on that a long time ago.
You did?
It's too much work.
You're an adult who can't get by without an allowance from his parents.
Women don't want that.
Wh-what are you saying, that y-you're giving up on me?
What kind of father gives up on his son?
I have six children, five of whom are married and self-sufficient.
I don't think I'm the problem.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
This is deeply hurtful.
You're also too sensitive.
Women don't want that either.
The food here's supposed to be great.
Don't fill up on chips.
Oh, I won't.
I have a trick.
I only eat equilateral triangles.
Isosceles, isosceles, oh, scalene...
You didn't see that.
Oh, look.
It's Bert, at the bar.
We should go say hi.
Why?
Because that's what you do when you see someone you know in a public place.
I have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise.
Sheldon, there's a difference between greeting a friend and following a celebrity into a bathroom.
If the judge couldn't explain it to me,
I don't see how you will.
Hi, Bert.
Hello.
Oh, hey, guys.
What brings you here?
Oh, we're having date night.
Nice.
I'm meeting someone, too.
Oh, really.
Anybody we know?
I doubt it.
I met her on g-Harmony.
That's a web site for geologists to find love.
That's a real thing?
Yeah.
Their slogan is "we're all about dating and not the carbon-14 kind."
Well, have a lovely evening.
Thanks.
You, too.
If you think that's more fun than talking to Zachary quinto through a stall door, you're crazy.
You know, we could've come to you guys.
You didn't have to bring the baby here.
Oh, it's okay.
It's good to get out of the house.
And the car ride puts her to sleep.
Aw, that used to work with Sheldon.
Yeah, until someone left him in the drugstore parking lot and he freaked out.
Who forgot to crack the window?
Hello!
Leonard:
Hey.
Penny:
Oh, someone's been shopping at Gucci.
Yeah, I saw something for halley and I couldn't resist.
That's so sweet of you.
Yeah, it's a crushed velvet baby cape.
Oh, no, now we have two.
That must've been expensive.
Yeah, it was.
But it's my father's money and I'm mad at him.
What's going on with your dad?
And if you really want to hurt him,
I look great in Chanel.
(Clears throat)
It turns out he doesn't care if I'm married or if I'm single.
He's basically given up on me.
Oh, I'm sure that's not true.
It is.
He stopped trying to find Indian girls for me to marry.
All you did was complain when he did that.
Leonard, he's hurting.
Let him feel how he feels.
Thank you, penny.
Yeah.
Shoes, I'm a seven-and-a-half;
Boots, I'm an eight.
...msn search, altavista, and... ask jeeves.
You?
Sorry, I don't have a list of defunct search engines that I miss.
Hey.
Looks like I got stood up, so I'm gonna head out.
Oh, no.
Are you sure you don't want to give her a few more minutes?
Nah, g-Harmony recommends after two hours, it's time to cut bait.
I'm so sorry.
Bert, I insist that you join us.
You really wouldn't mind?
Not at all.
Amy?
Fine with me.
Thanks.
I'll go grab a chair.
Sheldon, that was so sweet of you.
Well, I could deduce by his facial expression and body language that he was sad.
So the part where he got stood up didn't clue you in?
You want me to look at him andlistento him?
My father thinks the reason i can't make a relationship work is because I'm spoiled.
I'm sorry, is he waiting for someone to disagree?
Just because he helps me out doesn't automatically mean that I'm spoiled.
All right, how much exactly does he pay for?
Okay, I'll tell you, but please don't judge me.
He pays for my car, my rent, and my credit cards.
I'm trying, but I'm judging.
Maybe your dad's right.
Yeah, women do like a man that can support himself.
But Bernadette makes more money than Howard.
She basically supports him.
Yeah, maybe your dad's right.
Good question.
Let's see.
Infoseek, webcrawler, oh, hotbot.
Okay, literally any other topic.
All right.
How did you guys meet?
Actually, we met online.
Our-our first date was at a coffee shop.
Although, unlike your date, she actually showed up.
Oh, he looks sad again.
Well, I really envy your relationship.
Other than you two only having sex once a year, you're the perfect couple.
You-you know about that?
Uh, yeah, everyone at the university does.
Were you aware of this?
No.
No, I only told Leonard, Howard, raj, kripke, uh, professor wu, professor klein, and a lunch lady in the cafeteria.
How everyone else found out is a mystery to me.
Why aren't you talking to me?
Because I'm mad at you.
Oh.
Well, now I'm sorry I asked.
Sheldon, it's humiliating.
Thanks to you, my colleagues are gossiping about our sex life.
What is there to gossip about?
We barely have one.
That's why they're doing it!
Is it safe to assume you're not speaking to me again?
If you're not answering because you're not speaking to me, perhaps we could come up with a signal!
(Door slams)
Torrent downloaded by RARBG
That works!
You don't need your dad's money.
You can get by on your salary.
Leonard yeah.
Well, we work at the same place as you, and we've always been fine.
Koothrappali:
Oh, please.
Look in the mirror.
You both look ten years older than I do.
Penny:
All right.
Hang on.
We can figure this out.
Let's just go over your expenses.
How much is your rent?
I don't want to say.
Is it really that high?
I don't want to say because i don't know how much it is.
You don't how much your rent is?
My father pays for it!
Do you know how much your rent is?
!
Yeah.
Well, then double it, because my building's a lot nicer than this dump.
Do you know how much your car costs?
Not really.
Well, how much do you spend on food?
The housekeeper does the shopping.
Oh, my god, you really are spoiled.
I'mspoiled?
!
Your baby has a cape that costs $300!
I'm going to bed.
Well, wait.
This is our first fight as a couple who live together.
So?
I'm not sure of the protocol.
Television teaches us that the man's supposed to sleep on the couch, but of the two of us, you're clearly more sofa-sized.
I'm not sleeping on the couch 'cause you don't know what's private and what's not.
This isn't fair.
You've discussed aspects of our physical relationship with penny.
That's different!
She's a close friend, not the lady in the cafeteria who cuts the crust off your sandwiches!
That lady has a name.
I don't know what it is, but one time, i accidentally called her "mom."
Sounds like you're gonna need a cheaper place to live.
When you moved here, you didn't have a lot of money.
How'd you get by?
Well, sometimes you can get free food and Wi-Fi from the neighbors.
Just know you might have to marry one of 'em.
Hey, you guys let Stuart live with you.
Why not raj, too?
What-what are you doing?
I...
I-i-i schlepped the baby over, i brought imported beer.
Why don't you like me?
Koothrappali:
Well,
I thought we were best friends!
We are!
That's why I'm sad my best friend's gonna be homeless.
I'm sorry, raj.
We really just don't have the space.
What if he lives in your garage?
What if you stop helping?
!
Guys, I'm not living in a garage!
Wait.
Why are we talking about our place when Sheldon's old room is sitting there perfectly empty?
That's a great idea.
Raj, if you need a place to stay, of course you are welcome here.
Thank you, but if I'm gonna just take advantage of my friends,
I might as well keep on relying on my father.
Okay, only if you're sure.
(Quietly):
Whew.
Yeah.
(Knocking) Sheldon:
Amy?
(Knocking) Amy?
(Knocking) Amy?
Yeah?
Not exactly the welcome wagon, but I'll take it.
What is this?
I'm mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed.
I call these circles "zones of privacy."
Don't Google that unless you want to see pictures of people's genitals.
This circle contains only me and you.
It represents subjects we only share with each other-- details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits.
Although, as I'm saying it,
I may need to add Dr. fink in here.
Are you really worried about revealing secrets to Stephen Hawking?
No, I was just excited to list him as a friend.
Well, I do appreciate you working on this.
I'm sorry you were embarrassed.
And now I understand that some things are just between you and me, and in the event of redness and swelling, Dr. fink.
What's that little dot in the middle?
That's reserved for thoughts i don't share with anyone.
Interesting.

I don't know what it is, but one time, I accidentally called her "Mom".
Sounds like you're gonna need a cheaper place to live.
When you moved here, you didn't have a lot of money.
How'd you get by?
Well, sometimes you can get free food and Wi-Fi from the neighbors.
Just know you might have to marry one of 'em.
Hey, you guys let Stuart live with you.
Why not Raj, too?
What-what are you doing?
I...
I-I-I schlepped the baby over, I brought imported beer.
Why don't you like me?
Well,
I thought we were best friends!
We are!
That's why I'm sad my best friend's gonna be homeless.
I'm sorry, Raj.
We really just don't have the space.
What if he lives in your garage?
What if you stop helping?
!
Guys, I'm not living in a garage!
Wait.
Why are we talking about our place when Sheldon's old room is sitting there perfectly empty?
That's a great idea.
Raj, if you need a place to stay, of course you are welcome here.
Thank you, but if I'm gonna just take advantage of my friends,
I might as well keep on relying on my father.
Okay, only if you're sure.
Whew.
Yeah.
Amy?
Amy?
Amy?
Yeah?
Not exactly the welcome wagon, but I'll take it.
What is this?
I'm mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed.
I call these circles "Zones of Privacy""
Don't Google that unless you want to see pictures of people's genitals.
This circle contains only me and you.
It represents subjects we only share with each other... details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits.
Although, as I'm saying it,
I may need to add Dr. Fink in here.
Are you really worried about revealing secrets to Stephen Hawking?
No, I was just excited to list him as a friend.
Well, I do appreciate you working on this.
I'm sorry you were embarrassed.
And now I understand that some things are just between you and me, and in the event of redness and swelling, Dr. Fink.
What's that little dot in the middle?
That's reserved for thoughts I don't share with anyone.
Interesting.
You really have secrets you don't tell me?
Of course.
Can I hear one?
No, they're private.
Why?
Are they naughty?
A little.
Please?
Fine.
Two years ago I got my driver's license.
What?
!
Why didn't you say anything?
!
I like being chauffeured around.
It makes me feel important.
So when I got up at 4:00 a.m. to drive you across the desert to an antique train museum, I didn't have to?
No, you didn't.
But keep in mind,
I felt extremely important.
What?
!
Hello, Father.
We need to talk.
All right.
I have come to an important decision.
I will not be accepting your money anymore.
I'm a man, and I can take care of myself.
That's wonderful!
Yes, that is wonderful!
You will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled!
I am so proud of you.
Dad, I'm trying to tell you off, and you're ruining it with your delight and relief.
Sorry.
Oh, no, my grown son is going to stop spending all my money.
Where did I fail as a father?
!
Yeah, that's right.
Keep asking yourself that!
But I still love you very much, so don't cut me out of the will.
Oh, you brought your own lunch.
Good for you.
Yeah, I'm making a bunch of changes.
This morning, I fired my dog walker.
Oh.
How's the dog gonna go to the bathroom?
Uh, I gave her an Imodium.
That's tomorrow's problem.
Excuse me.
May I have your attention, please?
I have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler has become water cooler gossip.
And I just want to say, shame on all of you.
We're scientists.
Our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge, not the intimate details of other people's lives.
He's right.
And I'm sorry for the part I played in this.
Thank you, Bert.
You're a good man.
That woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out.
That doesn't paint me in the best light.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Correction:
That woman not only had vigorous coitus with Bert... she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done.
- That better?
- Not really.
All right, well, to sum up...
focus on science, keep your nose out of other people's business, and, uh, whoa, for a good time, call Bert.
What brought that on?
Well, last night Amy was angry with me because I'd been foolishly telling people about certain personal matters.
That's understandable.
Oh, I know that now.
At first, I thought she was cranky because of her horrific menstrual cramps, but it turns out, no, she was genuinely mortified.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Go!
Come on, Raj!
You can do this!
There's no way.
What is happening?
This is an Euler's Disk.
It's a physics toy that demonstrates angular momentum, potential energy, and kinetic energy.
Aw, look at you watching sports.
We're betting to see if Koothrappali can hold his breath longer than the disk can spin.
Its weight and smoothness, along with the slight concavity of the mirror, means it can spin for a long time.
But Raj is from India, which means he's no slouch at holding his breath.
Okay, I want in.
Ten bucks says I'll lose interest before that thing stops spinning.
Hey, Sheldon, I found a great restaurant for date night.
Kind of busy right now.
Oh, an Euler's Disk!
Fun!
Yeah, we're seeing if Raj can hold his breath longer than it.
Oh.
Immature.
How ya doing?
Mm.
He's not gonna make it.
Yes, he is!
You know, deep-sea divers holding their breath for several minutes have shown elevated markers of a protein that can signal brain damage.
Yeah, see, what's happening here signals brain damage.
My God, how long does this thing spin for?
Ha!
You're interested!
You're out ten bucks!
It's slowing down!
Dig deep!
Like when we bet you couldn't fit into Howard's pants!
He's not gonna make it!
Yes, he is!
Come on, Raj!
It's like your favorite movie!
You're just Waiting to Exhale!
Yeah!
I knew you could do it!
And j.. and just so you know, my favorite movie... is Princess Bride.

Hello, Rajesh.
How are things by you?
Good, good.
Uh, listen, I just wanted to let you know when you get my credit card bill, it might be a little high this month.
Well, you're a grown man with a steady job.
Why wouldn't you spend all your father's money?
Oh, Daddy, you're so rich and funny.
Yeah.
So what else is going on with your life?
Uh, well, I was dating a woman at the university, but we broke up.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know you are.
That's why you just bought me a new iPad.
And before you start,
I am not interested in you arranging a marriage for me.
Oh, I gave up on that a long time ago.
You did?
It's too much work.
You're an adult who can't get by without an allowance from his parents.
Women don't want that.
Wh-What are you saying, that y-you're giving up on me?
What kind of father gives up on his son?
I have six children, five of whom are married and self-sufficient.
I don't think I'm the problem.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
This is deeply hurtful.
You're also too sensitive.
Women don't want that either.
The food here's supposed to be great.
Don't fill up on chips.
Oh, I won't.
I have a trick.
I only eat equilateral triangles.
Isosceles, isosceles, oh, scalene...
You didn't see that.
Oh, look.
It's Bert, at the bar.
We should go say hi.
Why?
Because that's what you do when you see someone you know in a public place.
I have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise.
Sheldon, there's a difference between greeting a friend and following a celebrity into a bathroom.
If the judge couldn't explain it to me,
I don't see how you will.
Hi, Bert.
Hello.
Oh, hey, guys.
What brings you here?
Oh, we're having date night.
Nice.
I'm meeting someone, too.
Oh, really.
Anybody we know?
I doubt it.
I met her on G-Harmony.
That's a Web site for geologists to find love.
That's a real thing?
Yeah.
Their slogan is "We're all about dating and not the carbon-14 kind""
Well, have a lovely evening.
Thanks.
You, too.
If you think that's more fun than talking to Zachary Quinto through a stall door, you're crazy.
You know, we could've come to you guys.
You didn't have to bring the baby here.
Oh, it's okay.
It's good to get out of the house.
And the car ride puts her to sleep.
Aw, that used to work with Sheldon.
Yeah, until someone left him in the drugstore parking lot and he freaked out.
Who forgot to crack the window?
Hello!
- Hey.
- Oh, someone's been shopping at Gucci.
Yeah, I saw something for Halley and I couldn't resist.
That's so sweet of you.
Yeah, it's a crushed velvet baby cape.
Oh, no, now we have two.
That must've been expensive.
Yeah, it was.
But it's my father's money and I'm mad at him.
What's going on with your dad?
And if you really want to hurt him,
I look great in Chanel.
It turns out he doesn't care if I'm married or if I'm single.
He's basically given up on me.
Oh, I'm sure that's not true.
It is.
He stopped trying to find Indian girls for me to marry.
All you did was complain when he did that.
Leonard, he's hurting.
Let him feel how he feels.
Thank you, Penny.
Yeah.
Shoes, I'm a seven-and-a-half;
boots, I'm an eight.
...MSN Search,
AltaVista, and...
Ask Jeeves.
You?
Sorry, I don't have a list of defunct search engines that I miss.
Hey.
Looks like I got stood up, so I'm gonna head out.
Oh, no.
Are you sure you don't want to give her a few more minutes?
Nah, G-Harmony recommends after two hours, it's time to cut bait.
I'm so sorry.
Bert, I insist that you join us.
You really wouldn't mind?
Not at all.
Amy?
Fine with me.
Thanks.
I'll go grab a chair.
Sheldon, that was so sweet of you.
Well, I could deduce by his facial expression and body language that he was sad.
So the part where he got stood up didn't clue you in?
You want me to look at him and listen to him?
My father thinks the reason I can't make a relationship work is because I'm spoiled.
I'm sorry, is he waiting for someone to disagree?
Just because he helps me out doesn't automatically mean that I'm spoiled.
All right, how much exactly does he pay for?
Okay, I'll tell you, but please don't judge me.
He pays for my car, my rent, and my credit cards.
I'm trying, but I'm judging.
Maybe your dad's right.
Yeah, women do like a man that can support himself.
But Bernadette makes more money than Howard.
She basically supports him.
Yeah, maybe your dad's right.
Good question.
Let's see.
Infoseek,
WebCrawler, oh, HotBot.
Okay, literally any other topic.
All right.
How did you guys meet?
Actually, we met online.
Our-our first date was at a coffee shop.
Although, unlike your date, she actually showed up.
Oh, he looks sad again.
Well, I really envy your relationship.
Other than you two only having sex once a year, you're the perfect couple.
You-you know about that?
Uh, yeah, everyone at the university does.
Were you aware of this?
No.
No, I only told Leonard, Howard, Raj,
Kripke, uh, Professor Wu, Professor Klein, and a lunch lady in the cafeteria.
How everyone else found out is a mystery to me.
Why aren't you talking to me?
- Because I'm mad at you.
- Oh.
Well, now I'm sorry I asked.
Sheldon, it's humiliating.
Thanks to you, my colleagues are gossiping about our sex life.
What is there to gossip about?
We barely have one.
That's why they're doing it!
Is it safe to assume you're not speaking to me again?
If you're not answering because you're not speaking to me, perhaps we could come up with a signal!
That works!
You don't need your dad's money.
- You can get by on your salary.
- Yeah.
Well, we work at the same place as you, and
- we've always been fine.
- Oh, please.
Look in the mirror.
You both look ten years older than I do.
All right.
Hang on.
We can figure this out.
Let's just go over your expenses.
How much is your rent?
I don't want to say.
Is it really that high?
I don't want to say because I don't know how much it is.
You don't how much your rent is?
My father pays for it!
Do you know how much your rent is?
!
Yeah.
Well, then double it, because my building's a lot nicer than this dump.
Do you know how much your car costs?
Not really.
Well, how much do you spend on food?
The housekeeper does the shopping.
Oh, my God, you really are spoiled.
I'm spoiled?
!
Your baby has a cape that costs $300!
I'm going to bed.
Well, wait.
This is our first fight as a couple who live together.
So?
I'm not sure of the protocol.
Television teaches us that the man's supposed to sleep on the couch, but of the two of us, you're clearly more sofa-sized.
I'm not sleeping on the couch 'cause you don't know what's private and what's not.
This isn't fair.
You've discussed aspects of our physical relationship with Penny.
That's different!
She's a close friend, not the lady in the cafeteria who cuts the crust off your sandwiches!
That lady has a name.
I don't know what it is, but one time, I accidentally called her "Mom".
Sounds like you're gonna need a cheaper place to live.
When you moved here, you didn't have a lot of money.
How'd you get by?
Well, sometimes you can get free food and Wi-Fi from the neighbors.
Just know you might have to marry one of 'em.
Hey, you guys let Stuart live with you.
Why not Raj, too?
What-what are you doing?
I...
I-I-I schlepped the baby over, I brought imported beer.
Why don't you like me?
Well,

How much is your rent?
I don't want to say.
Is it really that high?
I don't want to say because I don't know how much it is.
You don't how much your rent is?
My father pays for it!
Do you know how much your rent is?
!
Yeah.
Well, then double it, because my building's a lot nicer than this dump.
Do you know how much your car costs?
Not really.
Well, how much do you spend on food?
The housekeeper does the shopping.
Oh, my God, you really are spoiled.
I'm spoiled?
!
Your baby has a cape that costs $300!
I'm going to bed.
Well, wait.
This is our first fight as a couple who live together.
So?
I'm not sure of the protocol.
Television teaches us that the man's supposed to sleep on the couch, but of the two of us, you're clearly more sofa-sized.
I'm not sleeping on the couch 'cause you don't know what's private and what's not.
This isn't fair.
You've discussed aspects of our physical relationship with Penny.
That's different!
She's a close friend, not the lady in the cafeteria who cuts the crust off your sandwiches!
That lady has a name.
I don't know what it is, but one time, I accidentally called her "Mom".
Sounds like you're gonna need a cheaper place to live.
When you moved here, you didn't have a lot of money.
How'd you get by?
Well, sometimes you can get free food and Wi-Fi from the neighbors.
Just know you might have to marry one of 'em.
Hey, you guys let Stuart live with you.
Why not Raj, too?
What-what are you doing?
I...
I-I-I schlepped the baby over, I brought imported beer.
Why don't you like me?
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Well,
I thought we were best friends!
We are!
That's why I'm sad my best friend's gonna be homeless.
I'm sorry, Raj.
We really just don't have the space.
What if he lives in your garage?
What if you stop helping?
!
Guys, I'm not living in a garage!
Wait.
Why are we talking about our place when Sheldon's old room is sitting there perfectly empty?
That's a great idea.
Raj, if you need a place to stay, of course you are welcome here.
Thank you, but if I'm gonna just take advantage of my friends,
I might as well keep on relying on my father.
Okay, only if you're sure.
(quietly):
Whew.
Yeah.
(knocking) SHELDON:
Amy?
(knocking) Amy?
(knocking) Amy?
Yeah?
Not exactly the welcome wagon, but I'll take it.
What is this?
I'm mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed.
I call these circles "Zones of Privacy""
Don't Google that unless you want to see pictures of people's genitals.
This circle contains only me and you.
It represents subjects we only share with each other... details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits.
Although, as I'm saying it,
I may need to add Dr. Fink in here.
Are you really worried about revealing secrets to Stephen Hawking?
No, I was just excited to list him as a friend.
Well, I do appreciate you working on this.
I'm sorry you were embarrassed.
And now I understand that some things are just between you and me, and in the event of redness and swelling, Dr. Fink.
What's that little dot in the middle?
That's reserved for thoughts I don't share with anyone.
Interesting.
You really have secrets you don't tell me?
Of course.
Can I hear one?
No, they're private.
Why?
Are they naughty?
A little.
Please?
Fine.
Two years ago I got my driver's license.
What?
!
Why didn't you say anything?
!
I like being chauffeured around.
It makes me feel important.
So when I got up at 4:00 a.m. to drive you across the desert to an antique train museum, I didn't have to?
No, you didn't.
But keep in mind,
I felt extremely important.
(line ringing)
(beep)
What?
!
Hello, Father.
We need to talk.
All right.
I have come to an important decision.
I will not be accepting your money anymore.
I'm a man, and I can take care of myself.
That's wonderful!
Yes, that is wonderful!
You will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled!
I am so proud of you.
Dad, I'm trying to tell you off, and you're ruining it with your delight and relief.
Sorry.
Oh, no, my grown son is going to stop spending all my money.
Where did I fail as a father?
!
Yeah, that's right.
Keep asking yourself that!
But I still love you very much, so don't cut me out of the will.
Oh, you brought your own lunch.
Good for you.
Yeah, I'm making a bunch of changes.
This morning, I fired my dog walker.
Oh.
How's the dog gonna go to the bathroom?
Uh, I gave her an Imodium.
That's tomorrow's problem.
Excuse me.
May I have your attention, please?
I have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler has become water cooler gossip.
And I just want to say, shame on all of you.
We're scientists.
Our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge, not the intimate details of other people's lives.
He's right.
And I'm sorry for the part I played in this.
Thank you, Bert.
You're a good man.
That woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out.
That doesn't paint me in the best light.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Correction:
That woman not only had vigorous coitus with Bert... she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done.
- That better?
- Not really.
All right, well, to sum up...
focus on science, keep your nose out of other people's business, and, uh, whoa, for a good time, call Bert.
What brought that on?
(sighs) Well, last night Amy was angry with me because I'd been foolishly telling people about certain personal matters.
That's understandable.
Oh, I know that now.
At first, I thought she was cranky because of her horrific menstrual cramps, but it turns out, no, she was genuinely mortified.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Go!
Come on, Raj!
- You can do this!
- There's no way.
What is happening?
This is an Euler's Disk.
It's a physics toy that demonstrates angular momentum, potential energy, and kinetic energy.
Aw, look at you watching sports.
We're betting to see if Koothrappali can hold his breath longer than the disk can spin.
Its weight and smoothness, along with the slight concavity of the mirror, means it can spinfor a long time.
But Raj is from India, which means he's no slouch at holding his breath.
Okay, I want in.
Ten bucks says I'll lose interest before that thing stops spinning.
Hey, Sheldon, I found a great restaurant for date night.
Kind of busy right now.
- Oh, an Euler's Disk!
Fun!
- Yeah, we're seeing if Raj can hold his breath longer than it.
Oh.
Immature.
How ya doing?
Mm.
He's not gonna make it.
- Yes, he is!
- You know, deep-sea divers holding their breath for several minutes have shown elevated markers of a protein that can signal brain damage.
Yeah, see, what's happening here signals brain damage.
My God, how long does this thing spin for?
Ha!
You're interested!
You're out ten bucks!
- It's slowing down!
- Dig deep!
Like when we bet you couldn't fit into Howard's pants!
- He's not gonna make it!
- Yes, he is!
Come on, Raj!
It's like your favorite movie!
You're just Waiting to Exhale!
Yeah!
I knew you could do it!
And j... and just so you know, my favorite movie... is Princess Bride.

Hello, Rajesh.
How are things by you?
Good, good.
Uh, listen, I just wanted to let you know when you get my credit card bill, it might be a little high this month.
Well, you're a grown man with a steady job.
Why wouldn't you spend all your father's money?
Oh, Daddy, you're so rich and funny.
Yeah.
So what else is going on with your life?
Uh, well, I was dating a woman at the university, but we broke up.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know you are.
That's why you just bought me a new iPad.
And before you start,
I am not interested in you arranging a marriage for me.
Oh, I gave up on that a long time ago.
You did?
It's too much work.
You're an adult who can't get by without an allowance from his parents.
Women don't want that.
Wh-What are you saying, that y-you're giving up on me?
What kind of father gives up on his son?
I have six children, five of whom are married and self-sufficient.
I don't think I'm the problem.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
This is deeply hurtful.
You're also too sensitive.
Women don't want that either.
The food here's supposed to be great.
Don't fill up on chips.
Oh, I won't.
I have a trick.
I only eat equilateral triangles.
Isosceles, isosceles, oh, scalene...
You didn't see that.
Oh, look.
It's Bert, at the bar.
We should go say hi.
Why?
Because that's what you do when you see someone you know in a public place.
I have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise.
Sheldon, there's a difference between greeting a friend and following a celebrity into a bathroom.
If the judge couldn't explain it to me,
I don't see how you will.
Hi, Bert.
Hello.
Oh, hey, guys.
What brings you here?
- Oh, we're having date night.
- Nice.
I'm meeting someone, too.
Oh, really.
Anybody we know?
I doubt it.
I met her on G-Harmony.
That's a Web site for geologists to find love.
That's a real thing?
Yeah.
Their slogan is ?
We're all about dating and not the carbon-14 kind?"
Well, have a lovely evening.
Thanks.
You, too.
If you think that's more fun than talking to Zachary Quinto through a stall door, you're crazy.
You know, we could've come to you guys.
You didn't have to bring the baby here.
Oh, it's okay.
It's good to get out of the house.
And the car ride puts her to sleep.
Aw, that used to work with Sheldon.
Yeah, until someone left him in the drugstore parking lot
- and he freaked out.
- Who forgot to crack the window?
Hello!
- Hey.
- Oh, someone's been shopping at Gucci.
Yeah, I saw something for Halley and I couldn't resist.
That's so sweet of you.
Yeah, it's a crushed velvet baby cape.
Oh, no, now we have two.
- That must've been expensive.
- Yeah, it was.
But it's my father's money and I'm mad at him.
What's going on with your dad?
And if you really want to hurt him,
I look great in Chanel.
It turns out he doesn't care if I'm married or if I'm single.
He's basically given up on me.
Oh, I'm sure that's not true.
It is.
He stopped trying to find Indian girls for me to marry.
All you did was complain when he did that.
Leonard, he's hurting.
Let him feel how he feels.
- Thank you, Penny.
- Yeah.
Shoes, I'm a seven-and-a-half;
boots, I'm an eight.
MSN Search,
AltaVista, and...
Ask Jeeves.
You?
Sorry, I don't have a list of defunct search engines that I miss.
Hey.
Looks like I got stood up, so I'm gonna head out.
Oh, no.
Are you sure you don't want to give her a few more minutes?
Nah, G-Harmony recommends after two hours, it's time to cut bait.
I'm so sorry.
Bert, I insist that you join us.
You really wouldn't mind?
Not at all.
Amy?
Fine with me.
Thanks.
I'll go grab a chair.
Sheldon, that was so sweet of you.
Well, I could deduce by his facial expression and body language that he was sad.
So the part where he got stood up didn't clue you in?
You want me to look at him and listen to him?
My father thinks the reason I can't make a relationship work is because I'm spoiled.
I'm sorry, is he waiting for someone to disagree?
Just because he helps me out doesn't automatically mean that I'm spoiled.
All right, how much exactly does he pay for?
Okay, I'll tell you, but please don't judge me.
He pays for my car, my rent, and my credit cards.
I'm trying, but I'm judging.
Maybe your dad's right.
Yeah, women do like a man that can support himself.
But Bernadette makes more money than Howard.
She basically supports him.
Yeah, maybe your dad's right.
Good question.
Let's see.
Infoseek,
WebCrawler, oh, HotBot.
Okay, literally any other topic.
All right.
How did you guys meet?
Actually, we met online.
Our-our first date was at a coffee shop.
Although, unlike your date, she actually showed up.
Oh, he looks sad again.
Well, I really envy your relationship.
Other than you two only having sex once a year, you're the perfect couple.
You-you know about that?
Uh, yeah, everyone at the university does.
Were you aware of this?
No.
No, I only told Leonard, Howard, Raj,
Kripke, uh, Professor Wu, Professor Klein, and a lunch lady in the cafeteria.
How everyone else found out is a mystery to me.
Why aren't you talking to me?
- Because I'm mad at you.
- Oh.
Well, now I'm sorry I asked.
Sheldon, it's humiliating.
Thanks to you, my colleagues are gossiping about our sex life.
What is there to gossip about?
We barely have one.
That's why they're doing it!
Is it safe to assume you're not speaking to me again?
If you're not answering because you're not speaking to me, perhaps we could come up with a signal!
That works!
You don't need your dad's money.
- You can get by on your salary.
- Yeah.
Well, we work at the same place as you, and
- we've always been fine.
- Oh, please.
Look in the mirror.
You both look ten years older than I do.
All right.
Hang on.
We can figure this out.
Let's just go over your expenses.
How much is your rent?
I don't want to say.
Is it really that high?
I don't want to say because I don't know how much it is.

Our-our first date was at a coffee shop.
Although, unlike your date, she actually showed up.
Oh, he looks sad again.
Well, I really envy your relationship.
Other than you two only having sex once a year, you're the perfect couple.
You-you know about that?
Uh, yeah, everyone at the university does.
Were you aware of this?
No.
No, I only told Leonard, Howard, Raj,
Kripke, uh, Professor Wu, Professor Klein, and a lunch lady in the cafeteria.
How everyone else found out is a mystery to me.
Why aren't you talking to me?
- Because I'm mad at you.
- Oh.
Well, now I'm sorry I asked.
Sheldon, it's humiliating.
Thanks to you, my colleagues are gossiping about our sex life.
What is there to gossip about?
We barely have one.
That's why they're doing it!
Is it safe to assume you're not speaking to me again?
If you're not answering because you're not speaking to me, perhaps we could come up with a signal!
(door slams)
That works!
You don't need your dad's money.
- You can get by on your salary.
- LEONARD:
Yeah.
Well, we work at the same place as you, and
- we've always been fine.
- KOOTHRAPPALI:
Oh, please.
Look in the mirror.
You both look ten years older than I do.
PENNY:
All right.
Hang on.
We can figure this out.
Let's just go over your expenses.
How much is your rent?
I don't want to say.
Is it really that high?
I don't want to say because I don't know how much it is.
You don't how much your rent is?
My father pays for it!
Do you know how much your rent is?
!
- Yeah.
- Well, then double it, because my building's a lot nicer than this dump.
Do you know how much your car costs?
Not really.
Well, how much do you spend on food?
The housekeeper does the shopping.
Oh, my God, you really are spoiled.
I'm spoiled?
!
Your baby has a cape that costs $300!
I'm going to bed.
Well, wait.
This is our first fight as a couple who live together.
So?
I'm not sure of the protocol.
Television teaches us that the man's supposed to sleep on the couch, but of the two of us, you're clearly more sofa-sized.
I'm not sleeping on the couch 'cause you don't know what's private and what's not.
This isn't fair.
You've discussed aspects of our physical relationship with Penny.
That's different!
She's a close friend, not the lady in the cafeteria who cuts the crust off your sandwiches!
That lady has a name.
I don't know what it is, but one time, I accidentally called her?
Mom?
Sounds like you're gonna need a cheaper place to live.
When you moved here, you didn't have a lot of money.
How'd you get by?
Well, sometimes you can get free food and Wi-Fi from the neighbors.
Just know, you might have to marry one of 'em.
Hey, you guys let Stuart live with you.
Why not Raj, too?
What-what are you doing?
I...
I-I-I schlepped the baby over, I brought imported beer.
Why don't you like me?
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Well, I thought we were best friends!
We are!
That's why I'm sad my best friend's gonna be homeless.
I'm sorry, Raj.
We really just don't have the space.
What if he lives in your garage?
What if you stop helping?
!
Guys, I'm not living in a garage!
Wait.
Why are we talking about our place when Sheldon's old room is sitting there perfectly empty?
That's a great idea.
Raj, if you need a place to stay, of course you are welcome here.
Thank you, but if I'm gonna just take advantage of my friends,
I might as well keep on relying on my father.
Okay, only if you're sure.
- (quietly):
Whew.
- Yeah.
(knocking) SHELDON:
Amy?
(knocking) Amy?
- (knocking) Amy?
- Yeah?
Not exactly the welcome wagon, but I'll take it.
What is this?
I'm mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed.
I call these circles ?
Zones of Privacy?"
Don't Google that unless you want to see pictures of people's genitals.
This circle contains only me and you.
It represents subjects we only share with each other...
Details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits.
Although, as I'm saying it,
I may need to add Dr. Fink in here.
Are you really worried about revealing secrets to Stephen Hawking?
No, I was just excited to list him as a friend.
Well, I do appreciate you working on this.
I'm sorry you were embarrassed.
And now I understand that some things are just between you and me, and in the event of redness and swelling, Dr. Fink.
What's that little dot in the middle?
That's reserved for thoughts I don't share with anyone.
Interesting.
You really have secrets you don't tell me?
Of course.
Can I hear one?
No, they're private.
Why?
Are they naughty?
A little.
Please?
Fine.
Two years ago...
I got my driver's license.
What?
!
Why didn't you say anything?
!
I like being chauffeured around.
It makes me feel important.
So when I got up at 4:00 a.m. to drive you across the desert to an Antique Train Museum, I didn't have to?
No, you didn't.
But keep in mind,
I felt extremely important.
(line ringing)
(beep)
What?
!
Hello, Father.
We need to talk.
All right.
I have come to an important decision.
I will not be accepting your money anymore.
I'm a man, and I can take care of myself.
That's wonderful!
Yes, that is wonderful!
You will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled!
I am so proud of you.
Dad, I'm trying to tell you off, and you're ruining it with your delight and relief.
Sorry.
Oh, no, my grown son is going to stop spending all my money.
Where did I fail as a father?
!
Yeah, that's right.
Keep asking yourself that!
But I still love you very much, so don't cut me out of the will.
Oh, you brought your own lunch.
Good for you.
Yeah, I'm making a bunch of changes.
This morning, I fired my dog walker.
Oh.
How's the dog gonna go to the bathroom?
Uh, I gave her an Imodium.
That's tomorrow's problem.
Excuse me.
May I have your attention, please?
I have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler has become water cooler gossip.
And I just want to say, shame on all of you.
We're scientists.
Our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge, not the intimate details of other people's lives.
He's right.
And I'm sorry for the part I played in this.
Thank you, Bert.
You're a good man.
That woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out.
That doesn't paint me in the best light.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Correction:
That woman not only had vigorous coitus with Bert... she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done.
- That better?
- Not really.
All right, well, to sum up...
Focus on science, keep your nose out of other people's business, and, uh, whoa, for a good time, call Bert.
What brought that on?
(sighs) Well, last night Amy was angry with me because I'd been foolishly telling people about certain personal matters.
That's understandable.
Oh, I know that now.
At first, I thought she was cranky because of her horrific menstrual cramps, but... it turns out, no, she was genuinely mortified.

ARCHIE:
Previously on Riverdale...
You know that SoDale contract?
It was awarded to Andrews Construction.
Mr. Andrews still doesn't know that Daddy is the buyer?
I asked around about those bruisers going after your crew.
Pretty sure we both know who has business in Montreal.
Hiram, why would he even...
Maybe he got a whiff of your little romance with Freddy Andrews?
When my father got arrested,
I made a pact to become a better person.
You're the bravest of them all, Ethel Muggs.
You hate the Blossoms and now Polly is pregnant with his baby.
Polly is moving home.
I will not be party to raising a child that has Blossom blood.
JUGHEAD:
Thicker than blood.
More precious than oil.
Riverdale's big business is maple syrup.
Since the town's founding, one family has controlled its lucrative syrup trade, the Blossoms.
They were a part of the fabric of our daily lives...
Rich or poor, old or young, we consumed Blossom syrup by the bucket.
That sickly, sweet smell was inescapable.
The death of Jason Blossom precipitated a crisis.
With the heir apparent gone, who would inherit the family business one day?
Certainly not Cheryl.
It was a question that brought the wolves to Riverdale.
And now, the Blossoms were circling the wagons against possible attack, from within their own ranks.
BETTY:
Polly won't answer my calls or e-mails.
I mean, I get that she doesn't want to talk to my dad, but what did I do wrong?
JUGHEAD:
Nothing.
We'll figure it out.
Come here.
[DOOR OPENS]
Up and at 'em, breakfast is ready.
I'm not hungry.
Oh, enough is enough, Elizabeth, we have a big week ahead of us.
The Blossoms have always been a thorn in our side, ever since, according to your milquetoast father,
Great-Grandpappy Blossom killed Great-Grandpappy Cooper.
Well, it's about time someone brings them to heel.
I'm writing a searing, no-holds-barred takedown of their clan.
And you think that's going to bring Polly home?
Maybe, maybe not, but it'll make me feel better.
Word has it that the Blossom board of trustees has descended upon Riverdale like a cabal of vampires.
Why?
Now, that's a story.
I just need to find a way in.
HERMIONE:
The lawyers are coming over this week to take our statements for your dad's hearing.
We're both gonna have to testify on your father's behalf.
What if they ask about what he did?
Embezzling all that money?
Am I going to have to lie?
Well... [SIGHS] We might have to shade the truth a bit, Ronnie.
Mom?
Baby, I have just made a mess of things.
Your father found out about Fred and me.
Someone went to him before I got a chance to say anything...
Oh, my God, Dad knows?
Yes, and on top of that, the Blossoms are still after the drive-in land, and Fred still doesn't know that we own it.
Maybe it's time you tell Mr. Andrews the truth.
And risk having him walk off the project?
We've bet everything we have on the SoDale construction.
Mom, this is a small, gossipy town.
You need to tell Fred about the land before someone else does.
[TUNING GUITAR]
Archie.
If music be the food of love, play on, play on.
Did you know this week's the official start of maple syrup season?
I...
No, I didn't.
Well, it is.
And every year, we host a tree-tapping ceremony, a tradition that honors the Blossom bloodline.
Our heritage.
Sounds cool.
It is.
Beyond.
It's also incredibly exclusive.
Family and inner circle only.
Wanna be my date?
The maple-tapping's something Jason and I have done together since we could walk.
It was our extra-special thing.
But I...
I can't face it alone.
If you came, as my escort,
I think I could get through it.
Cheryl, I would love to help, but I have a girlfriend.
Maybe invite Kevin?
Or Reggie?
You don't get it, do you?
I don't want Kevin or Reggie.
I want you.
You defended me to Sheriff Keller when not even my parents would.
Never mind, I'm sorry I asked.
Cheryl, hold on.
"They put me in a wooden box as I desperately opposed.
But all my screaming was for naught.
My mouth had been sewn closed.
Curled up in bed was just a girl.
Needing Daddy's arms to hold her."
Hey, Ethel.
I just wanted to tell you how moved I was by your poem.
It felt like you were tapping into something pretty dark, but also pretty real.
And I don't want to overstep...
But is everything all right, Ethel?
Things at home aren't great.
My mom and dad are fighting, but they won't tell me about what.
It's like this really bad thing is happening, and there's nothing that I can do to stop it.
Like you're trapped in a slow-motion car crash.
Yeah, I know the feeling.
Listen, Ethel.
It sounds like you need some cheering up.
Which happens to be a Veronica Lodge specialty.
So...
If you're free tomorrow, come over for lunch and pampering.
Kevin will be there.
Yeah, come on, it'll be fun.
Just please say yes.
All right, sure.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Great, I'll see you tomorrow.
So...
What was that about?
Ethel's poem was a cry for help if I ever heard one, the likes of which I vowed never to ignore, not after...
Uh-oh.
Do we need to sit down?
Okay, so, last year at Spence, my best friend Katy and I kind of terrorized this girl, Paige.
One time, we made her drink gutter water.
Ew!
Why?
Because she was there.
Because she was a misfit and we were class-A brutal bitches.
Anyway, by December,
Paige couldn't take it anymore...
Oh, my God, did you drive her to suicide?
What?
No.
But she did transfer schools.
And went into therapy.
So now?
If I can make Ethel Muggs' life a little better, even for one afternoon,
I'm going to do it.
Archibald.
I was going to get Principal Weatherbee to summon you.
Hey, Mrs. Blossom.
Have a moment to chat?
About Cheryl.
I believe she invited you to our tree-tapping ceremony?
Yeah.
She did, and like I told her,
I don't feel comfortable going.
Cheryl tells me you have a keen interest in music.
Is that true?
Did she tell you her Great-Uncle Harrison sits on the board of the Brandenburg Music Academy?
They have an excellent summer program, I hear.
It's amazing, crazy hard to get into.
Surely not for a talent like you.
And especially not if I put in a word on your behalf.
Mrs. Blossom...
At Jason's memorial, you brought me his football jersey.
So sorry for your loss, Mrs. Blossom.
I thought you might want to have this.
That was an act of kindness on a day of despair.
You're good and decent, Archibald, unlike most people in this town.
Mrs. Blossom, I don't know what to say.
Say you'll reconsider escorting my daughter to the tapping.
It's just an afternoon.
And it would mean the world to my Cheryl.
I mean, yeah.
I guess I could talk to Valerie.
I swear, Archibald, when the light hits you just right...
I'll tell Cheryl the good news.
And I'll call Great-Uncle Harrison.
Just in time, we're celebrating.
KEVIN:
Archie was just telling us how he's going to some super-exclusive music program this summer.
Maybe.
If it happens, though, it would be huge for me.
Do you have to audition for it?
Well, not exactly.
Mrs. Blossom came by earlier and said she'd put a good word in for me.
- Amazing.
- Terrifying.
Uh-huh.
What's she getting out of it?
I told her I'd take Cheryl to their family's tree-tapping thing.
I already talked to Valerie, and she's cool with it.
Cool with you being a gigolo now?
I'm doing someone a favor for my music, Jughead.
I need to make connections outside of Riverdale.
That's the way of the world.
It's all about connections.
But Jughead's right.
These kinds of favors always come with a price tag.
Betty, back me up here.
I think it's a great idea.
Thank you, Betty.
Yeah, and while you're there, would you talk to Polly for me?
I just want to make sure she's okay.
Definitely.
Thank you.
And don't worry, Ronnie, I can take care of myself.
Famous last words, Archiekins.
CHERYL:
When Jason died,
I thought I'd tapped my last tree.
Now, don't be nervous.
All you have to do is hold the bucket steady,
I'll handle the rest.
ARCHIE:
Who are all these people?
Entre nous, they're Daddy's board of trustees.
They smell blood in the water.
That's why they're here.
[SIGHS] They're worried Daddy's losing his grip on the company and they're looking for a way to take it away from us.
They can do that?
If they all vote together, they can.
When Jason died, it was a PR debacle.
And now, here's Polly, pregnant and unwed.
It's no wonder they've descended upon us like some biblical plague.
"Nearly 100 years ago, Grandfather Blossom came to this sacred maple grove.
The annual tapping ceremony portends each season's bounty."
Now, I've performed this ceremony many times in my life.
My son Jason, when he came of age, performed it as well.
In his place,
I put forth my daughter Cheryl.
Hey.
You can do this in your sleep.
- MAN 1:
Bravo!
- MAN 2:
Well done!
[APPLAUSE]
ARCHIE:
Good shot.
Nice.
Mrs. Lodge, this Quiche Lorraine is to die for.
Ethel, you haven't eaten at all.
Oh.
Sorry.
I just...
I'm not really hungry.
Anything we can help with?
Uh, my parents...
All they do is yell at each other.
My parents are fighting right now, too.
It's terrible.
I think my dad had some bad luck with our savings.
Now my mom says we're going to have to sell the house.
My dad is just so...
Crushed.
I wish there was something I could do to help him.
Girl, we have a lot more in common than I thought.
We lost our place at the Dakota.
Look, being ruined sucks.
But you have your family and you have us.
You've got this, Ethel Muggs.
"Muggs"?
Uh, it's Dutch.
We lost the third "G"
when my Grandpa Manfred came over.
Archibald!
Come join us before the snow starts again.
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Three, two, one.
[CAMERA CLICKS]
Polly.
Betty's worried about you.
Why won't you call or e-mail her?
She fought for you, Polly, and now you're treating her like she's the enemy.
Polly, come along.
Tell Betty that she shouldn't worry, okay?
Veronica, there's something that you need to know
- about that Muggs girl.
- What?
Her father, Manfred Muggs, invested with your dad.
And it's probable that they lost a lot when your father was arrested.
Maybe everything.
Mom, they're being kicked out of their house, their home.
Well, from what I've been told, the Muggs family is going to testify against your father.
They should.
How many, Mom?
How many families like Ethel's?
It's the risk of doing business with your father.
Could Mr. Andrews lose everything, for doing business with you and Dad?
I'm not sure.
My God.
I don't buy this dog-and-pony show for a second.
Cliff can't control his own family, let alone the company.
Agreed.
And if he tries to put Cheryl forward as a successor...
Do you remember what she did at the funeral?
- Crocodile tears.
- Hey.
CHERYL:
Archie, you don't have to.
No, Cheryl loved Jason.
What was she meant to do at his funeral, not cry?
And yeah, Jason was on the football team, but Cheryl was at every single game, too, doing as much to help the Bulldogs win as he did.
Also, 4.0.
Also, she has a 4.0 grade point average.
If there's one thing that I've learned being in Cheryl's class, it's don't underestimate her and don't bet against her.
HERMIONE:
Fred, we need to talk.
Oh, God. [SIGHS]
Hiram and I, we are the anonymous buyers.
You're working for Lodge Industries.
How do you not tell me that?
You never would have gotten involved.
You're damn straight.
Because I didn't sign up to go into business with a criminal like Hiram Lodge.
I'm trying to turn Lodge Industries legitimate.
That means partnering with people like you, good people.
This is why Cliff Blossom bought out my crew?
Sent thugs to beat up teenagers?
Clifford didn't send those thugs.
Hiram did.
He was trying to stop us.
He found out about you and me from Clifford.
So you have dragged me into a war between Hiram and Clifford, that's great.
I know you're angry.
And I know that I have no right to ask this...
But please stay on this project.
If you jump ship, I can't start over with someone else.
So, I do the grunt work while your husband's taking potshots at me and you're playing both sides?
The whole time?
I gotta take a walk.
Archibald, do you know, when Cheryl told me that she wanted you to come with us,
I was a little taken aback.
Your father and I haven't been seeing eye-to-eye lately.
I came for Cheryl, Mr. Blossom.
And because I'm grateful for what Mrs. Blossom is doing for me.
The music academy, you mean?
Yeah, that would be quite a feather in your cap, now, wouldn't it?
You know, we can be extremely generous,
Archibald, to the right people.
Now later this week, we're hosting a banquet for the board at the Belmont Lodge.
It's a simple thing, a little dinner, chit-chat, dancing.
We would love you to attend as Cheryl's escort.
You two make quite the pair.
Oh, I'm honored, Mr. Blossom, really, but...
CHERYL:
But nothing.
You have to come, I'm wearing viridian.
He'll need a proper suit, don't you think, Daddy?
I'll have my tailor fit you.
If that's not a problem?
No.
No, no, it's just...
I'm an Andrews, Mr. Blossom, like you said.
My dad works construction, a fancy banquet's not really our thing.
That's precisely why you should come.
People like you are the bedrock of our town.
You're hard workers.
Plus, I need a dance partner.
We won't take no for an answer...
Archiekins.
Who would have predicted this?
Archie Andrews is our fox in the henhouse.
BETTY:
Tell us about Polly.
How is she?
Did she seem okay?
The Blossoms are treating her great.
But, Betty, I don't think she's coming back.
I don't think she wants to.
That doesn't make any sense.
That's not Polly.
She made her choice.
We have to learn to live with that.
No.
I know my sister.
She wouldn't do that to us.
Something else is going on.
ALICE:
What else did you see, Archie?
When you were in the sticky, red thick of it?
Anything about the board?
Cheryl said that they're worried...
That after all the scandal with Jason and Polly, that they might try and steal the company from Mr. Blossom.
Well, do you hear that, Betty?
This is our story.
A hostile takeover.
No wonder the trustees are in town.
The Blossom empire is crumbling.
Okay, but, Mom, if you write a story attacking them while Polly's still in Thornhill...
Enough about Polly.
I mean it.
She's the one that betrayed us, not the other way around.
CHEERLEADER:
Obviously she's jealous...
Cheryl, can we have a word?
[EXHALES] Scatter, my Vixens.
Yes, Betty?
What is it?
Polly.
Look, I don't know what kind of Stockholm syndrome spell you've cast on her, but I want to talk to my sister.
Let's not fight.
Especially not when we should be celebrating.
Why?
What happened?
Haven't you heard?
Dr. Patel just confirmed it this morning.
Polly is having twins.
Bless our Blossom genes!
And she didn't call to tell me.
Hostages aren't normally allowed to make outgoing calls.
Can you please just give her a message for me?
As long as it doesn't upset her.
Tell her she should call our mom.
She's trying really hard to hide it, but I can tell she's really, really hurt and upset.
- I'll pass your message along...
- Thank you.
If I remember.
Cheryl.
That was a joke, you hobo.
Of course I'll give her your message, Betty.
But no promises that she'll care or respond.
VERONICA:
Okay, Ethel, open your eyes.
What is happening?
VERONICA:
I was purging my closet, thinking how you would look magnificent in some of these.
Here, try this on.
This is...
This is so nice.
And I love this.
It is so you, Ethel.
Ronnie, I can't take all this.
I want you to have it.
These things...
My dad gave them to me.
He always brought home gifts whenever he did something wrong.
As a way to make up for it, I guess.
Did it work?
What girl is immune to the charms of a Givenchy bag?
And I still wear these pearls he gave me.
Okay, but...
You don't have to do anything.
Give me anything.
I just want to be friends.
Me, too, Ethel.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Mr. Andrews!
Nice haircut.
You're looking extremely DILF-y today.
Is Archie home?
Cheryl, yes.
Um, come on in.
The Ice Woman cometh.
Hey, Cheryl.
As a maj thank-you for coming to the maple banquet with me tomorrow,
I wanted to give you this.
An '84 Les Paul.
In our signature color.
You're welcome.
Okay.
That's all.
I'm going now.
My claustrophobia acts up in small houses.
See you tomorrow.
I'd give that back if I were you.
Dad, come on.
The Blossoms, they're helping me get into that summer music program.
Like, the best in the country.
And since when did the Blossoms ever give a damn about you, Archie?
Well, they think I have potential, Dad.
He's also pimping himself out to Cheryl.
The Blossoms tried to run our business into the ground.
Maybe if you tried talking to Mr. Blossom...
I tried talking to him, Archie, he laughed in my face.
Don't think for a second that the Blossoms are looking out for you.
They're using you, Archie.
They look at us like we're dirt under their shoe.
I'm over it.
What's this?
The biggest story we've ever broken.
A tell-all expose on the Blossom clan and all of their glorious corruption.
Um, would you mind telling me what your mother is talking about?
It's time that they finally answer to everything that they've done to us, including taking Polly.
By the way, Polly's living with the Blossoms now, so congratulations, you've finally got what you wanted.
She's officially out of our lives.
I'm not publishing your personal vendetta.
Well, it's a good thing I don't need your permission.
What did you do, Hal?
Well, you kicked me out.
So, now, I'm kicking you out.
If we expose the Blossoms, maybe...
Just maybe, we might have a chance in hell to get our daughter back.
You are done here, Alice.
You're fired.
Fine, Hal.
What?
I want my daughter back, you bastard!
Mom!
Black piping for the velvet, of course.
I'll take measurements for the pants.
Uh, before we do that...
Could I talk to you, Mr. Blossom?
Things aren't going great at my dad's company.
And I know you two have been at odds recently.
But I was wondering, instead of helping me with that music school, if...
Maybe you could help my dad.
Are you negotiating on behalf of your father?
No, no, I'm impressed.
In fact, I'm trying to imagine if Jason would ever have given up something like that for me, and I don't believe so.
It speaks to your character, son.
But I'll tell you what, we've already called the Brandenburg Music Academy.
And they're very excited to meet you, by the way.
Let's just get through this banquet, all right?
Sit down man-to-man and discuss what I can do for Fred Andrews.
Is it satisfactory?
It's more than satisfactory.
My parents are unbelievable, Jug.
Polly is locked up in that house like a character out of Jane Eyre, and what are they doing?
Changing each other's login accounts and throwing bricks through windows.
I wish I'd seen that.
Okay, I'm sorry, that's not funny.
It's like, you know how, in a time of crisis, people either come together or fall apart?
It feels like we're falling apart.
And the way things are going, pretty soon, the Coopers, we're not gonna exist anymore.
And there's nothing I can do to stop that.
JUGHEAD:
Betty, don't do that.
Don't give up.
Your family is definitely splintering right now, but it won't fall apart, because of you.
Because you're holding them together.
You're so much stronger than all of the white noise.
You're stronger than your mother, you're stronger than your father.
You're holding this family together.
So don't.
Don't let go.
I won't.
Valerie, hi.
I thought you should know,
Cheryl poured some insane poison into my ear about how close you two are getting.
She legit thinks she's going to steal you away from me or something.
- [SCOFFS] No, she doesn't.
- Yes, she does.
And I don't blame her.
The new guitar, the new suit?
The Blossoms are buying you.
For one night, if it helps my dad and gets me into that music program...
Wouldn't you rather earn your place at that table?
With your music?
All the Blossoms are doing is opening a door for me.
What would you do if you were in my place?
If you have to ask, then you don't know me at all, Archie.
KEVIN:
Oh, my God, did you hear?
Remember when you went swooping in to save Ethel, 'cause you thought she might be suicidal?
Oh, no.
She didn't...
KEVIN:
No, but her dad did.
He accidentally swallowed a whole bottle of sleeping pills.
[ECHOING] He's going to be okay, but that's why Ethel's been so sad lately.
Now, everybody knows...
[SOBBING]
CLIFFORD:
We were tested this year.
As a town, as a company, mainly as a family.
And it may not have been Jason's hand that staked the maple this year, but it was the hand of hope.
Don't think they're being nice or genuine.
They wanted me to fail at the tree-tapping.
But you're going to help with all that.
I'll do whatever I can.
CLIFFORD:
Archibald, have a word?
I'll be right back.
I just wanted to let you know that I've decided to help your father.
You did?
You will?
Well, you've helped our family.
Cheryl, especially.
You fit in so well.
I think you and your father have a very bright future with us.
Thank you, Mr. Blossom.
Oh. "Clifford", please.
And just so you know, you don't have to keep doing me favors.
I like Cheryl.
And I'm happy to be here for her, as a friend.
You know, I'm going to be honest with you.
Cheryl's a bright girl, but the Blossom board, they're very skeptical of having her play an active role in the company.
Now, someone with your stock and character by her side, tempering her more erratic behavior...
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY]
You know, it's about...
Creating a picture.
The right picture.
Having you with us, with Cheryl, it tells a very appealing story.
Which is something I think we could all use right about now.
You'll help us, won't you?
POLLY:
Excuse me, Mr. Blossom, may I have this first dance with Archie?
CLIFFORD:
I think that's an excellent idea.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Polly, can we talk about what's going on here?
Just keep dancing.
And smiling.
[INAUDIBLE]
Betty keeps asking Cheryl about me, she needs to stop.
As long as she's worried about you, Polly, she'll never stop.
Yes, she will...
If I tell you the real reason I'm at Thornhill.
The Blossoms had something to do with Jason's death,
I'm sure of it.
They threatened him and I'm gonna prove it.
Is that why you keep blowing Betty off?
It has to be believable.
And I don't want her trying to rescue me.
Can you please tell her that for me?
- I'm so done with this!
- Do not make a scene.
- No, I'm done.
I'm done!
- Not now.
Polly, will you excuse me?
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
Betty.
Veronica, hey.
Mom, these are my friends.
This is Betty and this is Veronica.
Mrs. Muggs.
Ethel...
We heard what happened, and we wanted to leave these flowers with you.
That's very kind.
Thank you.
Please don't...
Don't thank me.
We're just so glad Mr. Muggs is going to be okay.
And we'll see you at school, Ethel?
You don't need to do this, Vee.
Ethel?
Mrs. Muggs?
There's something I need to tell you.
My name is Veronica Lodge.
- My father is...
- MRS. MUGGS:
Hiram Lodge.
Hmm.
And you're showing your face here?
Mom, she's my friend.
She's not your friend, honey.
Her father is a criminal.
He's the reason Dad did this to himself.
Ronnie?
Is that true?
Yes.
And I am so sorry.
I wish I could do something.
"Sorry" isn't good enough.
You want to do something?
Tell the truth.
Your father is ruining lives.
He deserves to sit behind bars for the rest of his miserable life.
Come on.
Come on.
Cheryl.
You okay?
What did my dad say to you?
That everyone thinks I'm a train wreck?
Jason was the golden boy, but me...
People hate me, Archie.
And at school, that's fine, whatever.
But this is my family.
Forget them, Cheryl.
Forget what they think.
I think you're awesome.
[SIGHS]
Oh, Archie, sometimes I think you may be the only decent person left in Riverdale.
The only person who doesn't want something from me.
Or who doesn't want me to apologize for who I am...
And what I want.
What are you doing?
My lipstick's maple red, by the way.
In case you're wondering why it tastes so sweet.
PENELOPE:
They seem satisfied, but Uncle
Bedford keeps asking about the drive-in land.
I am so close to getting that land back.
Hermione Lodge will crumble.
PENELOPE:
Who would have thought she'd prove so resourceful?
Maybe you should've sent her to jail instead of Hiram.
[GASPS]
HERMIONE:
Hey.
How was your night?
I just got back from the hospital where Ethel's dad is.
Because he tried to kill himself...
Because of what Daddy did...
And, for all I know, continues to do.
I am done lying for Dad.
[EXHALES]
Archie!
I thought it was Cinderella that ran away from the ball, not Prince Charming.
Cheryl, I can't do this right now.
I'm leaving.
CHERYL:
Archie Andrews, if you leave, the radiant sun that is the Blossom family stops shining on you.
And everything we've given you, including Brandenburg, disappears.
Are you sure you want to give that up?
Are you sure you want to do that to your dad?
Cheryl, I came here as a favor to your mom, to help you.
[SCOFFS]
Oh, Archie, don't start lying now.
You may not want anything from me, but you do from my mom and dad, that's why you're here.
Which means, as much as I want you to be better than everyone else...
You're not.
You're just like the others.
I'm sorry, Cheryl...
But I can't do this anymore.
Goodbye.
BETTY:
Mom?
Archie just called.
He talked to Polly.
She's safe.
She's okay, Mom.
She didn't choose the Blossoms over us, she's actually there to spy on them.
[SOBS]
You know, when I went after this story...
I thought, in the back of my mind that,
"What if this is it?
What if this is finally the time that she doesn't come back?"
She will, Mom.
And right now, she's our woman on the inside.
We're going to write this story.
Come write with us at Blue and Gold.
The school newspaper?
Yeah, that's what we are.
But I'm pretty sure that our annual operating budget is bigger than the Register's.
[MUSIC PLAYING ON EARPHONES]
Val.
Val, hey.
Look, you were right.
About being bought and taking shortcuts.
After last night, I'm done with the Blossoms, I am.
Good for you, Archie, but I'm done with you.
Ever since we started dating you've ignored me, you've ditched me.
ARCHIE:
Val, please.
Let me make it up to you.
Sorry, Archie, but unlike you, I won't be bought.
HERMIONE:
Just listen, Fred.
So many families have been hurt by the Lodges.
Now, I don't want yours to be another one.
I've decided to sell to Clifford...
Before it gets any worse.
No, you're not.
I'm going to stay with the project.
That's great.
Thank you.
Don't thank me.
I'm not doing it for you.
See, from now on, everything we do around here is going to be legal.
A hundred percent above board.
Agreed.
Of course.
Also, my stake is 20%.
If I'm gonna put myself on the line,
I need some skin in the game.
That's a really big share.
I'm sick of you people using me and my family as pawns.
Sure.
Anything else?
Yes.
You and me...
Whatever was going on there is over.
Now, we're just business partners.
That's it.
Right.
[BELL RINGS]
VERONICA:
Ethel, I meant what I said.
I'm sorry, Ethel, for everything my family did to yours.
ETHEL:
It's not your fault what your dad did.
And you were there for me when no one else was.
More than once.
Seat's not taken, if you want it.
JUGHEAD:
It seemed that, for Veronica, the sins of the father would remain simply that.
While Archie Andrews returned from the brink with one more bit of news.
At the banquet, I heard Mr. And Mrs. Blossom talking.
It sounded like Clifford Blossom was responsible for sending Veronica's dad to jail.
Oh, my God.
If Clifford sent Hiram Lodge to jail, tore apart his family, then maybe Hiram was trying to do the same thing to him?
Yeah, by going after what the Blossoms value most, their family, their legacy.
That's a motive.
JUGHEAD:
Winter had come early to Riverdale.
Brutal and unforgiving.
Did it work?
Are the vultures appeased?
We're not out of the woods yet.
JUGHEAD:
But it would be nothing compared to the storm that was gathering.
[EXHALES]
A storm of chaos named...
- [SNIFFLES] - ...
Cheryl Blossom.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Yes?
Good night, Cheryl.
Good night, Pollykins.
Previously on Riverdale...
You know that SoDale contract?
It was awarded to Andrews Construction.
Mr. Andrews still doesn't know that Daddy is the buyer?
I asked around about those bruisers going after your crew.
Pretty sure we both know who has business in Montreal.
Hiram, why would he even...
Maybe he got a whiff of your little romance with Freddy Andrews?
When my father got arrested,
I made a pact to become a better person.
You're the bravest of them all, Ethel Muggs.
You hate the Blossoms and now Polly is pregnant with his baby.
Polly is moving home.
I will not be party to raising a child that has Blossom blood.
Thickerthanblood.
More precious than oil.
Riverdale's big business is maple syrup.
Since the town's founding, one family has controlled its lucrative syrup trade, the Blossoms.
They were a part of the fabric of our daily lives...
Rich or poor, old or young, we consumed Blossom syrup by the bucket.
That sickly, sweet smell was inescapable.
The death of Jason Blossom precipitated a crisis.
With the heir apparent gone, who would inherit the family business one day?
Certainly not Cheryl.
It was a question that brought the wolves to Riverdale.
And now, the Blossoms were circling the wagons against possible attack, from within their own ranks.
Polly won't answer my calls or e-mails.
I mean, I get that she doesn't want to talk to my dad, but what did I do wrong?
Nothing.
We'll figure it out.
Come here.
Up and at 'em, breakfast is ready.
I'm not hungry.
Oh, enough is enough, Elizabeth, we have a big week ahead of us.
The Blossoms have always been a thorn in our side, ever since, according to your milquetoast father,
Great-Grandpappy Blossom killed Great-Grandpappy Cooper.
Well, it's about time someone brings them to heel.
I'm writing a searing, no-holds-barred takedown of their clan.
And you think that's going to bring Polly home?
Maybe, maybe not, but it'll make me feel better.
Word has it that the Blossom board of trustees has descended upon Riverdale like a cabal of vampires.
Why?
Now, that's a story.
I just need to find a way in.
The lawyers are coming over this week to take our statements for your dad's hearing.
We're both gonna have to testify on your father's behalf.
What if they ask about what he did?
Embezzling all that money?
Am I going to have to lie?
Well...
We might have to shade the truth a bit, Ronnie.
Mom?
Baby, I have just made a mess of things.
Your father found out about Fred and me.
Someone went to him before I got a chance to say anything...
Oh, my God, Dad knows?
Yes, and on top of that, the Blossoms are still after the drive-in land, and Fred still doesn't know that we own it.
Maybe it's time you tell Mr. Andrews the truth.
And risk having him walk off the project?
We've bet everything we have on the SoDale construction.
Mom, this is a small, gossipy town.
You need to tell Fred about the land before someone else does.
Archie.
If music be the food of love, play on, play on.
Did you know this week's the official start of maple syrup season?
I...
No, I didn't.
Well, it is.
And every year, we host a tree-tapping ceremony, a tradition that honors the Blossom bloodline.
Our heritage.
Sounds cool.
It is.
Beyond.
It's also incredibly exclusive.
Family and inner circle only.
Wanna be my date?
The maple-tapping's something Jason and I have done together since we could walk.
It was our extra-special thing.
But I...
I can't face it alone.
If you came, as my escort,
I think I could get through it.
Cheryl, I would love to help, but I have a girlfriend.
Maybe invite Kevin?
Or Reggie?
You don't get it, do you?
I don't want Kevin or Reggie.
I want you.
You defended me to Sheriff Keller when not even my parents would.
Never mind, I'm sorry I asked.
Cheryl, hold on.
"They put me in a wooden box as I desperately opposed.
But all my screaming was for naught.
My mouth had been sewn closed.
Curled up in bed was just a girl.
Needing Daddy's arms to hold her."
Hey, Ethel.
I just wanted to tell you how moved I was by your poem.
It felt like you were tapping into something pretty dark, but also pretty real.
And I don't want to overstep...
But is everything all right, Ethel?
Things at home aren't great.
My mom and dad are fighting, but they won't tell me about what.
It's like this really bad thing is happening, and there's nothing that I can do to stop it.
Like you're trapped in a slow-motion car crash.
Yeah, I know the feeling.
Listen, Ethel.
It sounds like you need some cheering up.
Which happens to be a Veronica Lodge specialty.
So...
If you're free tomorrow, come over for lunch and pampering.
Kevin will be there.
Yeah, come on, it'll be fun.
Just please say yes.
All right, sure.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Great, I'll see you tomorrow.
So...
What was that about?
Ethel's poem was a cry for help if I ever heard one, the likes of which I vowed never to ignore, not after...
Uh-oh.
Do we need to sit down?
Okay, so, last year at Spence, my best friend Katy and I kind of terrorized this girl, Paige.
One time, we made her drink gutter water.
Ew!
Why?
Because she was there.
Because she was a misfit and we were class-A brutal bitches.
Anyway, by December,
Paige couldn't take it anymore...
Oh, my God, did you drive her to suicide?
What?
No.
But she did transfer schools.
And went into therapy.
So now?
If I can make Ethel Muggs' life a little better, even for one afternoon,
I'm going to do it.
Archibald.
I was going to get Principal Weatherbee to summon you.
Hey, Mrs. Blossom.
Have a moment to chat?
About Cheryl.
I believe she invited you to our tree-tapping ceremony?
Yeah.
She did, and like I told her,
I don't feel comfortable going.
Cheryl tells me you have a keen interest in music.
Is that true?
Did she tell you her Great-Uncle Harrison sits on the board of the Brandenburg Music Academy?
They have an excellent summer program, I hear.
It's amazing, crazy hard to get into.
Surely not for a talent like you.
And especially not if I put in a word on your behalf.
Mrs. Blossom...
At Jason's memorial, you brought me his football jersey.
So sorry for your loss, Mrs. Blossom.
I thought you might want to have this.
That was an act of kindness on a day of despair.
You're good and decent, Archibald, unlike most people in this town.
Mrs. Blossom, I don't know what to say.
Say you'll reconsider escorting my daughter to the tapping.
It's just an afternoon.
And it would mean the world to my Cheryl.
I mean, yeah.
I guess I could talk to Valerie.
I swear, Archibald, when the light hits you just right...
I'll tell Cheryl the good news.
And I'll call Great-Uncle Harrison.
Just in time, we're celebrating.
Archie was just telling us how he's going to some super-exclusive music program this summer.
Maybe.
If it happens, though, it would be huge for me.
Do you have to audition for it?
Well, not exactly.
Mrs. Blossom came by earlier and said she'd put a good word in for me.
- Amazing.
- Terrifying.
Uh-huh.
What's she getting out of it?
I told her I'd take Cheryl to their family's tree-tapping thing.
I already talked to Valerie, and she's cool with it.
Cool with you being a gigolo now?
I'm doing someone a favor for my music, Jughead.
I need to make connections outside of Riverdale.
That's the way of the world.
It's all about connections.
But Jughead's right.
These kinds of favors always come with a price tag.
Betty, back me up here.
I think it's a great idea.
Thank you, Betty.
Yeah, and while you're there, would you talk to Polly for me?
I just want to make sure she's okay.
Definitely.
Thank you.
And don't worry, Ronnie, I can take care of myself.
Famous last words, Archiekins.

When Jason died,
I thought I'd tapped my last tree.
Now, don't be nervous.
All you have to do is hold the bucket steady,
I'll handle the rest.
Who are all these people?
Entre nous, they're Daddy's board of trustees.
They smell blood in the water.
That's why they're here.
They're worried Daddy's losing his grip on the company and they're looking for a way to take it away from us.
They can do that?
If they all vote together, they can.
When Jason died, it was a PR debacle.
And now, here's Polly, pregnant and unwed.
It's no wonder they've descended upon us like some biblical plague.
"Nearly 100 years ago, Grandfather Blossom came to this sacred maple grove.
The annual tapping ceremony portends each season's bounty."
Now, I've performed this ceremony many times in my life.
My son Jason, when he came of age, performed it as well.
In his place,
I put forth my daughter Cheryl.
Hey.
You can do this in your sleep.
- Bravo!
- Well done!
Good shot.
Nice.
Mrs. Lodge, this Quiche Lorraine is to die for.
Ethel, you haven't eaten at all.
Oh.
Sorry.
I just...
I'm not really hungry.
Anything we can help with?
Uh, my parents...
All they do is yell at each other.
My parents are fighting right now, too.
It's terrible.
I think my dad had some bad luck with our savings.
Now my mom says we're going to have to sell the house.
My dad is just so...
Crushed.
I wish there was something I could do to help him.
Girl, we have a lot more in common than I thought.
We lost our place at the Dakota.
Look, being ruined sucks.
But you have your family and you have us.
You've got this, Ethel Muggs.
"Muggs"?
Uh, it's Dutch.
We lost the third "G"
when my Grandpa Manfred came over.
Archibald!
Come join us before the snow starts again.
Three, two, one.
Polly.
Betty's worried about you.
Why won't you call or e-mail her?
She fought for you, Polly, and now you're treating her like she's the enemy.
Polly, come along.
Tell Betty that she shouldn't worry, okay?
Veronica, there's something that you need to know
- about that Muggs girl.
- What?
Her father, Manfred Muggs, invested with your dad.
And it's probable that they lost a lot when your father was arrested.
Maybe everything.
Mom, they're being kicked out of their house, their home.
Well, from what I've been told, the Muggs family is going to testify against your father.
They should.
How many, Mom?
How many families like Ethel's?
It's the risk of doing business with your father.
Could Mr. Andrews lose everything, for doing business with you and Dad?
I'm not sure.
My God.
I don't buy this dog-and-pony show for a second.
Cliff can't control his own family, let alone the company.
Agreed.
And if he tries to put Cheryl forward as a successor...
Do you remember what she did at the funeral?
- Crocodile tears.
- Hey.
Archie, you don't have to.
No, Cheryl loved Jason.
What was she meant to do at his funeral, not cry?
And yeah, Jason was on the football team, but Cheryl was at every single game, too, doing as much to help the Bulldogs win as he did.
Also, 4.0.
Also, she has a 4.0 grade point average.
If there's one thing that I've learned being in Cheryl's class, it's don't underestimate her and don't bet against her.
Fred, we need to talk.
Oh, God.
Hiram and I, we are the anonymous buyers.
You're working for Lodge Industries.
How do you not tell me that?
You never would have gotten involved.
You're damn straight.
Because I didn't sign up to go into business with a criminal like Hiram Lodge.
I'm trying to turn Lodge Industries legitimate.
That means partnering with people like you, good people.
This is why Cliff Blossom bought out my crew?
Sent thugs to beat up teenagers?
Clifford didn't send those thugs.
Hiram did.
He was trying to stop us.
He found out about you and me from Clifford.
So you have dragged me into a war between Hiram and Clifford, that's great.
I know you're angry.
And I know that I have no right to ask this...
But please stay on this project.
If you jump ship, I can't start over with someone else.
So, I do the grunt work while your husband's taking potshots at me and you're playing both sides?
The whole time?
I gotta take a walk.
Archibald, do you know, when Cheryl told me that she wanted you to come with us,
I was a little taken aback.
Your father and I haven't been seeing eye-to-eye lately.
I came for Cheryl, Mr. Blossom.
And because I'm grateful for what Mrs. Blossom is doing for me.
The music academy, you mean?
Yeah, that would be quite a feather in your cap, now, wouldn't it?
You know, we can be extremely generous,
Archibald, to the right people.
Now later this week, we're hosting a banquet for the board at the Belmont Lodge.
It's a simple thing, a little dinner, chit-chat, dancing.
We would love you to attend as Cheryl's escort.
You two make quite the pair.
Oh, I'm honored, Mr. Blossom, really, but...
But nothing.
You have to come, I'm wearing viridian.
He'll need a proper suit, don't you think, Daddy?
I'll have my tailor fit you.
If that's not a problem?
No.
No, no, it's just...
I'm an Andrews, Mr. Blossom, like you said.
My dad works construction, a fancy banquet's not really our thing.
That's precisely why you should come.
People like you are the bedrock of our town.
You're hard workers.
Plus, I need a dance partner.
We won't take no for an answer...
Archiekins.
Who would have predicted this?
Archie Andrews is our fox in the henhouse.
Tell us about Polly.
How is she?
Did she seem okay?
The Blossoms are treating her great.
But, Betty, I don't think she's coming back.
I don't think she wants to.
That doesn't make any sense.
That's not Polly.
She made her choice.
We have to learn to live with that.
No.
I know my sister.
She wouldn't do that to us.
Something else is going on.
What else did you see, Archie?
When you were in the sticky, red thick of it?
Anything about the board?
Cheryl said that they're worried...
That after all the scandal with Jason and Polly, that they might try and steal the company from Mr. Blossom.
Well, do you hear that, Betty?
This is our story.
A hostile takeover.
No wonder the trustees are in town.
The Blossom empire is crumbling.
Okay, but, Mom, if you write a story attacking them while Polly's still in Thornhill...
Enough about Polly.
I mean it.
She's the one that betrayed us, not the other way around.
Obviously she's jealous...
Cheryl, can we have a word?
Scatter, my Vixens.
Yes, Betty?
What is it?
Polly.
Look, I don't know what kind of Stockholm syndrome spell you've cast on her, but I want to talk to my sister.
Let's not fight.
Especially not when we should be celebrating.
Why?
What happened?
Haven't you heard?
Dr. Patel just confirmed it this morning.
Polly is having twins.
Bless our Blossom genes!
And she didn't call to tell me.
Hostages aren't normally allowed to make outgoing calls.
Can you please just give her a message for me?
As long as it doesn't upset her.
Tell her she should call our mom.
She's trying really hard to hide it, but I can tell she's really, really hurt and upset.
- I'll pass your message along...
- Thank you.
If I remember.
Cheryl.
That was a joke, you hobo.
Of course I'll give her your message, Betty.
But no promises that she'll care or respond.
Okay,Ethel, open your eyes.
What is happening?
I was purging my closet, thinking how you would look magnificent in some of these.
Here, try this on.
This is...
This is so nice.
And I love this.
It is so you, Ethel.
Ronnie, I can't take all this.
I want you to have it.
These things...
My dad gave them to me.
He always brought home gifts whenever he did something wrong.
As a way to make up for it, I guess.
Did it work?
What girl is immune to the charms of a Givenchy bag?
And I still wear these pearls he gave me.
Okay, but...
You don't have to do anything.
Give me anything.
I just want to be friends.
Me, too, Ethel.
Mr. Andrews!
Nice haircut.
You're looking extremely DILF-y today.
Is Archie home?
Cheryl, yes.
Um, come on in.
The Ice Woman cometh.
Hey, Cheryl.
As a maj thank-you for coming to the maple banquet with me tomorrow,
I wanted to give you this.
An '84 Les Paul.
In our signature color.
You're welcome.
Okay.
That's all.
I'm going now.
My claustrophobia acts up in small houses.
See you tomorrow.
I'd give that back if I were you.
Dad, come on.
The Blossoms, they're helping me get into that summer music program.
Like, the best in the country.
And since when did the Blossoms ever give a damn about you, Archie?
Well, they think I have potential, Dad.
He's also pimping himself out to Cheryl.
The Blossoms tried to run our business into the ground.
Maybe if you tried talking to Mr. Blossom...
I tried talking to him, Archie, he laughed in my face.
Don't think for a second that the Blossoms are looking out for you.
They're using you, Archie.
They look at us like we're dirt under their shoe.
I'm over it.
What's this?
The biggest story we've ever broken.
A tell-all expose on the Blossom clan and all of their glorious corruption.
Um, would you mind telling me what your mother is talking about?
It's time that they finally answer to everything that they've done to us, including taking Polly.
By the way, Polly's living with the Blossoms now, so congratulations, you've finally got what you wanted.
She's officially out of our lives.
I'm not publishing your personal vendetta.
Well, it's a good thing I don't need your permission.
What did you do, Hal?
Well, you kicked me out.
So, now, I'm kicking you out.
If we expose the Blossoms, maybe...
Just maybe, we might have a chance in hell to get our daughter back.
You are done here, Alice.
You're fired.
Fine, Hal.
What?
I want my daughter back, you bastard!
Mom!
Black piping for the velvet, of course.
I'll take measurements for the pants.
Uh, before we do that...
Could I talk to you, Mr. Blossom?
Things aren't going great at my dad's company.
And I know you two have been at odds recently.
But I was wondering, instead of helping me with that music school, if...
Maybe you could help my dad.
Are you negotiating on behalf of your father?
No, no, I'm impressed.
In fact, I'm trying to imagine if Jason would ever have given up something like that for me, and I don't believe so.
It speaks to your character, son.
But I'll tell you what, we've already called the Brandenburg Music Academy.
And they're very excited to meet you, by the way.
Let's just get through this banquet, all right?
Sit down man-to-man and discuss what I can do for Fred Andrews.
Is it satisfactory?
It's more than satisfactory.
My parents are unbelievable, Jug.
Polly is locked up in that house like a character out of Jane Eyre, and what are they doing?
Changing each other's login accounts and throwing bricks through windows.
I wish I'd seen that.
Okay, I'm sorry, that's not funny.
It's like, you know how, in a time of crisis, people either come together or fall apart?
It feels like we're falling apart.
And the way things are going, pretty soon, the Coopers, we're not gonna exist anymore.
And there's nothing I can do to stop that.
Betty, don't do that.
Don't give up.
Your family is definitely splintering right now, but it won't fall apart, because of you.
Because you're holding them together.
You're so much stronger than all of the white noise.
You're stronger than your mother, you're stronger than your father.
You're holding this family together.
So don't.
Don't let go.
I won't.
Valerie, hi.
I thought you should know,
Cheryl poured some insane poison into my ear about how close you two are getting.
She legit thinks she's going to steal you away from me or something.
- No, she doesn't.
- Yes, she does.
And I don't blame her.
The new guitar, the new suit?
The Blossoms are buying you.
For one night, if it helps my dad and gets me into that music program...
Wouldn't you rather earn your place at that table?
With your music?
All the Blossoms are doing is opening a door for me.
What would you do if you were in my place?
If you have to ask, then you don't know me at all, Archie.
Oh, my God, did you hear?
Remember when you went swooping in to save Ethel, 'cause you thought she might be suicidal?
Oh, no.
She didn't...
No, but her dad did.
He accidentally swallowed a whole bottle of sleeping pills.
He's going to be okay, but that's why Ethel's been so sad lately.
Now, everybody knows...
We were tested this year.
As a town, as a company, mainly as a family.
And it may not have been Jason's hand that staked the maple this year, but it was the hand of hope.
Don't think they're being nice or genuine.
They wanted me to fail at the tree-tapping.
But you're going to help with all that.
I'll do whatever I can.
Archibald, have a word?
I'll be right back.
I just wanted to let you know that I've decided to help your father.
You did?
You will?
Well, you've helped our family.
Cheryl, especially.
You fit in so well.
I think you and your father have a very bright future with us.
Thank you, Mr. Blossom.
Oh. "Clifford", please.
And just so you know, you don't have to keep doing me favors.
I like Cheryl.
And I'm happy to be here for her, as a friend.
You know, I'm going to be honest with you.
Cheryl's a bright girl, but the Blossom board, they're very skeptical of having her play an active role in the company.
Now, someone with your stock and character by her side, tempering her more erratic behavior...
You know, it's about...
Creating a picture.
The right picture.
Having you with us, with Cheryl, it tells a very appealing story.
Which is something I think we could all use right about now.
You'll help us, won't you?
Excuse me, Mr. Blossom, may I have this first dance with Archie?
I think that's an excellent idea.
Polly, can we talk about what's going on here?
Just keep dancing.
And smiling.
Betty keeps asking Cheryl about me, she needs to stop.
As long as she's worried about you, Polly, she'll never stop.
Yes, she will...
If I tell you the real reason I'm at Thornhill.
The Blossoms had something to do with Jason's death,
I'm sure of it.
They threatened him and I'm gonna prove it.
Is that why you keep blowing Betty off?
It has to be believable.
And I don't want her trying to rescue me.
Can you please tell her that for me?
- I'm so done with this!
- Do not make a scene.
- No, I'm done.
I'm done!
- Not now.
Polly, will you excuse me?
Betty.
Veronica, hey.
Mom, these are my friends.
This is Betty and this is Veronica.
Mrs. Muggs.
Ethel...
We heard what happened, and we wanted to leave these flowers with you.
That's very kind.
Thank you.
Please don't...
Don't thank me.
We're just so glad Mr. Muggs is going to be okay.
And we'll see you at school, Ethel?
You don't need to do this, Vee.
Ethel?
Mrs. Muggs?
There's something I need to tell you.
My name is Veronica Lodge.
- My father is...
- Hiram Lodge.
Hmm.
And you're showing your face here?
Mom, she's my friend.
She's not your friend, honey.
Her father is a criminal.
He's the reason Dad did this to himself.
Ronnie?
Is that true?
Yes.
And I am so sorry.
I wish I could do something.
"Sorry" isn't good enough.
You want to do something?
Tell the truth.
Your father is ruining lives.
He deserves to sit behind bars for the rest of his miserable life.
Come on.
Come on.
Cheryl.
You okay?
What did my dad say to you?
That everyone thinks I'm a train wreck?
Jason was the golden boy, but me...
People hate me, Archie.
And at school, that's fine, whatever.
But this is my family.
Forget them, Cheryl.
Forget what they think.
I think you're awesome.
Oh, Archie, sometimes I think you may be the only decent person left in Riverdale.
The only person who doesn't want something from me.
Or who doesn't want me to apologize for who I am...
And what I want.
What are you doing?
My lipstick's maple red, by the way.
In case you're wondering why it tastes so sweet.
They seem satisfied, but Uncle
Bedford keeps asking about the drive-in land.
I am so close to getting that land back.
Hermione Lodge will crumble.
Who would have thought she'd prove so resourceful?
Maybe you should've sent her to jail instead of Hiram.
Hey.
How was your night?
I just got back from the hospital where Ethel's dad is.
Because he tried to kill himself...
Because of what Daddy did...
And, for all I know, continues to do.
I am done lying for Dad.
Archie!
I thought it was Cinderella that ran away from the ball, not Prince Charming.
Cheryl, I can't do this right now.
I'm leaving.
Archie Andrews, if you leave, the radiant sun that is the Blossom family stops shining on you.
And everything we've given you, including Brandenburg, disappears.
Are you sure you want to give that up?
Are you sure you want to do that to your dad?
Cheryl, I came here as a favor to your mom, to help you.
Oh, Archie, don't start lying now.
You may not want anything from me, but you do from my mom and dad, that's why you're here.
Which means, as much as I want you to be better than everyone else...
You're not.
You're just like the others.
I'm sorry, Cheryl...
But I can't do this anymore.
Goodbye.
Mom?
Archie just called.
He talked to Polly.
She's safe.
She's okay, Mom.
She didn't choose the Blossoms over us, she's actually there to spy on them.
You know, when I went after this story...
I thought, in the back of my mind that,
"What if this is it?
What if this is finally the time that she doesn't come back?"
She will, Mom.
And right now, she's our woman on the inside.
We're going to write this story.
Come write with us at Blue and Gold.
The school newspaper?
Yeah, that's what we are.
But I'm pretty sure that our annual operating budget is bigger than the Register's.
Val.
Val, hey.
Look, you were right.
About being bought and taking shortcuts.
After last night, I'm done with the Blossoms, I am.
Good for you, Archie, but I'm done with you.
Ever since we started dating you've ignored me, you've ditched me.
Val, please.
Let me make it up to you.
Sorry, Archie, but unlike you, I won't be bought.
Justlisten,Fred.
So many families have been hurt by the Lodges.
Now, I don't want yours to be another one.
I've decided to sell to Clifford...
Before it gets any worse.
No, you're not.
I'm going to stay with the project.
That's great.
Thank you.
Don't thank me.
I'm not doing it for you.
See, from now on, everything we do around here is going to be legal.
A hundred percent above board.
Agreed.
Of course.
Also, my stake is 20%.
If I'm gonna put myself on the line,
I need some skin in the game.
That's a really big share.
I'm sick of you people using me and my family as pawns.
Sure.
Anything else?
Yes.
You and me...
Whatever was going on there is over.
Now, we're just business partners.
That's it.
Right.
Ethel, I meant what I said.
I'm sorry, Ethel, for everything my family did to yours.
It's not your fault what your dad did.
And you were there for me when no one else was.
More than once.
Seat's not taken, if you want it.
It seemed that, for Veronica, the sins of the father would remain simply that.
While Archie Andrews returned from the brink with one more bit of news.
At the banquet, I heard Mr. And Mrs. Blossom talking.
It sounded like Clifford Blossom was responsible for sending Veronica's dad to jail.
Oh, my God.
If Clifford sent Hiram Lodge to jail, tore apart his family, then maybe Hiram was trying to do the same thing to him?
Yeah, by going after what the Blossoms value most, their family, their legacy.
That's a motive.
Winter had come early to Riverdale.
Brutal and unforgiving.
Did it work?
Are the vultures appeased?
We're not out of the woods yet.
But it would be nothing compared to the storm that was gathering.
A storm of chaos named Cheryl Blossom.
Yes?
Good night, Cheryl.
Good night, Pollykins.

ARCHIE:
Previously on Riverdale...
You know that SoDale contract?
It was awarded to Andrews Construction.
Mr. Andrews still doesn't know that Daddy is the buyer?
I asked around about those bruisers going after your crew.
Pretty sure we both know who has business in Montreal.
Hiram, why would he even...
Maybe he got a whiff of your little romance with Freddy Andrews?
When my father got arrested,
I made a pact to become a better person.
You're the bravest of them all, Ethel Muggs.
You hate the Blossoms and now Polly is pregnant with his baby.
Polly is moving home.
I will not be party to raising a child that has Blossom blood.
JUGHEAD:
Thicker than blood.
More precious than oil.
Riverdale's big business is maple syrup.
Since the town's founding, one family has controlled its lucrative syrup trade, the Blossoms.
They were a part of the fabric of our daily lives...
Rich or poor, old or young, we consumed Blossom syrup by the bucket.
That sickly, sweet smell was inescapable.
The death of Jason Blossom precipitated a crisis.
With the heir apparent gone, who would inherit the family business one day?
Certainly not Cheryl.
It was a question that brought the wolves to Riverdale.
And now, the Blossoms were circling the wagons against possible attack, from within their own ranks.
BETTY:
Polly won't answer my calls or e-mails.
I mean, I get that she doesn't want to talk to my dad, but what did I do wrong?
JUGHEAD:
Nothing.
We'll figure it out.
Come here.
[DOOR OPENS]
Up and at 'em, breakfast is ready.
I'm not hungry.
Oh, enough is enough, Elizabeth, we have a big week ahead of us.
The Blossoms have always been a thorn in our side, ever since, according to your milquetoast father,
Great-Grandpappy Blossom killed Great-Grandpappy Cooper.
Well, it's about time someone brings them to heel.
I'm writing a searing, no-holds-barred takedown of their clan.
And you think that's going to bring Polly home?
Maybe, maybe not, but it'll make me feel better.
Word has it that the Blossom board of trustees has descended upon Riverdale like a cabal of vampires.
Why?
Now, that's a story.
I just need to find a way in.
HERMIONE:
The lawyers are coming over this week to take our statements for your dad's hearing.
We're both gonna have to testify on your father's behalf.
What if they ask about what he did?
Embezzling all that money?
Am I going to have to lie?
Well... [SIGHS] We might have to shade the truth a bit, Ronnie.
Mom?
Baby, I have just made a mess of things.
Your father found out about Fred and me.
Someone went to him before I got a chance to say anything...
Oh, my God, Dad knows?
Yes, and on top of that, the Blossoms are still after the drive-in land, and Fred still doesn't know that we own it.
Maybe it's time you tell Mr. Andrews the truth.
And risk having him walk off the project?
We've bet everything we have on the SoDale construction.
Mom, this is a small, gossipy town.
You need to tell Fred about the land before someone else does.
[TUNING GUITAR]
Archie.
If music be the food of love, play on, play on.
Did you know this week's the official start of maple syrup season?
I...
No, I didn't.
Well, it is.
And every year, we host a tree-tapping ceremony, a tradition that honors the Blossom bloodline.
Our heritage.
Sounds cool.
It is.
Beyond.
It's also incredibly exclusive.
Family and inner circle only.
Wanna be my date?
The maple-tapping's something Jason and I have done together since we could walk.
It was our extra-special thing.
But I...
I can't face it alone.
If you came, as my escort,
I think I could get through it.
Cheryl, I would love to help, but I have a girlfriend.
Maybe invite Kevin?
Or Reggie?
You don't get it, do you?
I don't want Kevin or Reggie.
I want you.
You defended me to Sheriff Keller when not even my parents would.
Never mind, I'm sorry I asked.
Cheryl, hold on.
"They put me in a wooden box as I desperately opposed.
But all my screaming was for naught.
My mouth had been sewn closed.
Curled up in bed was just a girl.
Needing Daddy's arms to hold her."
Hey, Ethel.
I just wanted to tell you how moved I was by your poem.
It felt like you were tapping into something pretty dark, but also pretty real.
And I don't want to overstep...
But is everything all right, Ethel?
Things at home aren't great.
My mom and dad are fighting, but they won't tell me about what.
It's like this really bad thing is happening, and there's nothing that I can do to stop it.
Like you're trapped in a slow-motion car crash.
Yeah, I know the feeling.
Listen, Ethel.
It sounds like you need some cheering up.
Which happens to be a Veronica Lodge specialty.
So...
If you're free tomorrow, come over for lunch and pampering.
Kevin will be there.
Yeah, come on, it'll be fun.
Just please say yes.
All right, sure.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Great, I'll see you tomorrow.
So...
What was that about?
Ethel's poem was a cry for help if I ever heard one, the likes of which I vowed never to ignore, not after...
Uh-oh.
Do we need to sit down?
Okay, so, last year at Spence, my best friend Katy and I kind of terrorized this girl, Paige.
One time, we made her drink gutter water.
Ew!
Why?
Because she was there.
Because she was a misfit and we were class-A brutal bitches.
Anyway, by December,
Paige couldn't take it anymore...
Oh, my God, did you drive her to suicide?
What?
No.
But she did transfer schools.
And went into therapy.
So now?
If I can make Ethel Muggs' life a little better, even for one afternoon,
I'm going to do it.
Archibald.
I was going to get Principal Weatherbee to summon you.
Hey, Mrs. Blossom.
Have a moment to chat?
About Cheryl.
I believe she invited you to our tree-tapping ceremony?
Yeah.
She did, and like I told her,
I don't feel comfortable going.
Cheryl tells me you have a keen interest in music.
Is that true?
Did she tell you her Great-Uncle Harrison sits on the board of the Brandenburg Music Academy?
They have an excellent summer program, I hear.
It's amazing, crazy hard to get into.
Surely not for a talent like you.
And especially not if I put in a word on your behalf.
Mrs. Blossom...
At Jason's memorial, you brought me his football jersey.
So sorry for your loss, Mrs. Blossom.
I thought you might want to have this.
That was an act of kindness on a day of despair.
You're good and decent, Archibald, unlike most people in this town.
Mrs. Blossom, I don't know what to say.
Say you'll reconsider escorting my daughter to the tapping.
It's just an afternoon.
And it would mean the world to my Cheryl.
I mean, yeah.
I guess I could talk to Valerie.
I swear, Archibald, when the light hits you just right...
I'll tell Cheryl the good news.
And I'll call Great-Uncle Harrison.
Just in time, we're celebrating.
KEVIN:
Archie was just telling us how he's going to some super-exclusive music program this summer.
Maybe.
If it happens, though, it would be huge for me.
Do you have to audition for it?
Well, not exactly.
Mrs. Blossom came by earlier and said she'd put a good word in for me.
- Amazing.
- Terrifying.
Uh-huh.
What's she getting out of it?
I told her I'd take Cheryl to their family's tree-tapping thing.
I already talked to Valerie, and she's cool with it.
Cool with you being a gigolo now?
I'm doing someone a favor for my music, Jughead.
I need to make connections outside of Riverdale.
That's the way of the world.
It's all about connections.
But Jughead's right.
These kinds of favors always come with a price tag.
Betty, back me up here.
I think it's a great idea.
Thank you, Betty.
Yeah, and while you're there, would you talk to Polly for me?
I just want to make sure she's okay.
Definitely.
Thank you.
And don't worry, Ronnie, I can take care of myself.
Famous last words, Archiekins.

CHERYL:
When Jason died,
I thought I'd tapped my last tree.
Now, don't be nervous.
All you have to do is hold the bucket steady,
I'll handle the rest.
ARCHIE:
Who are all these people?
Entre nous, they're Daddy's board of trustees.
They smell blood in the water.
That's why they're here.
[SIGHS] They're worried Daddy's losing his grip on the company and they're looking for a way to take it away from us.
They can do that?
If they all vote together, they can.
When Jason died, it was a PR debacle.
And now, here's Polly, pregnant and unwed.
It's no wonder they've descended upon us like some biblical plague.
"Nearly 100 years ago, Grandfather Blossom came to this sacred maple grove.
The annual tapping ceremony portends each season's bounty."
Now, I've performed this ceremony many times in my life.
My son Jason, when he came of age, performed it as well.
In his place,
I put forth my daughter Cheryl.
Hey.
You can do this in your sleep.
- MAN 1:
Bravo!
- MAN 2:
Well done!
[APPLAUSE]
ARCHIE:
Good shot.
Nice.
Mrs. Lodge, this Quiche Lorraine is to die for.
Ethel, you haven't eaten at all.
Oh.
Sorry.
I just...
I'm not really hungry.
Anything we can help with?
Uh, my parents...
All they do is yell at each other.
My parents are fighting right now, too.
It's terrible.
I think my dad had some bad luck with our savings.
Now my mom says we're going to have to sell the house.
My dad is just so...
Crushed.
I wish there was something I could do to help him.
Girl, we have a lot more in common than I thought.
We lost our place at the Dakota.
Look, being ruined sucks.
But you have your family and you have us.
You've got this, Ethel Muggs.
"Muggs"?
Uh, it's Dutch.
We lost the third "G"
when my Grandpa Manfred came over.
Archibald!
Come join us before the snow starts again.
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Three, two, one.
[CAMERA CLICKS]
Polly.
Betty's worried about you.
Why won't you call or e-mail her?
She fought for you, Polly, and now you're treating her like she's the enemy.
Polly, come along.
Tell Betty that she shouldn't worry, okay?
Veronica, there's something that you need to know
- about that Muggs girl.
- What?
Her father, Manfred Muggs, invested with your dad.
And it's probable that they lost a lot when your father was arrested.
Maybe everything.
Mom, they're being kicked out of their house, their home.
Well, from what I've been told, the Muggs family is going to testify against your father.
They should.
How many, Mom?
How many families like Ethel's?
It's the risk of doing business with your father.
Could Mr. Andrews lose everything, for doing business with you and Dad?
I'm not sure.
My God.
I don't buy this dog-and-pony show for a second.
Cliff can't control his own family, let alone the company.
Agreed.
And if he tries to put Cheryl forward as a successor...
Do you remember what she did at the funeral?
- Crocodile tears.
- Hey.
CHERYL:
Archie, you don't have to.
No, Cheryl loved Jason.
What was she meant to do at his funeral, not cry?
And yeah, Jason was on the football team, but Cheryl was at every single game, too, doing as much to help the Bulldogs win as he did.
Also, 4.0.
Also, she has a 4.0 grade point average.
If there's one thing that I've learned being in Cheryl's class, it's don't underestimate her and don't bet against her.
HERMIONE:
Fred, we need to talk.
Oh, God. [SIGHS]
Hiram and I, we are the anonymous buyers.
You're working for Lodge Industries.
How do you not tell me that?
You never would have gotten involved.
You're damn straight.
Because I didn't sign up to go into business with a criminal like Hiram Lodge.
I'm trying to turn Lodge Industries legitimate.
That means partnering with people like you, good people.
This is why Cliff Blossom bought out my crew?
Sent thugs to beat up teenagers?
Clifford didn't send those thugs.
Hiram did.
He was trying to stop us.
He found out about you and me from Clifford.
So you have dragged me into a war between Hiram and Clifford, that's great.
I know you're angry.
And I know that I have no right to ask this...
But please stay on this project.
If you jump ship, I can't start over with someone else.
So, I do the grunt work while your husband's taking potshots at me and you're playing both sides?
The whole time?
I gotta take a walk.
Archibald, do you know, when Cheryl told me that she wanted you to come with us,
I was a little taken aback.
Your father and I haven't been seeing eye-to-eye lately.
I came for Cheryl, Mr. Blossom.
And because I'm grateful for what Mrs. Blossom is doing for me.
The music academy, you mean?
Yeah, that would be quite a feather in your cap, now, wouldn't it?
You know, we can be extremely generous,
Archibald, to the right people.
Now later this week, we're hosting a banquet for the board at the Belmont Lodge.
It's a simple thing, a little dinner, chit-chat, dancing.
We would love you to attend as Cheryl's escort.
You two make quite the pair.
Oh, I'm honored, Mr. Blossom, really, but...
CHERYL:
But nothing.
You have to come, I'm wearing viridian.
He'll need a proper suit, don't you think, Daddy?
I'll have my tailor fit you.
If that's not a problem?
No.
No, no, it's just...
I'm an Andrews, Mr. Blossom, like you said.
My dad works construction, a fancy banquet's not really our thing.
That's precisely why you should come.
People like you are the bedrock of our town.
You're hard workers.
Plus, I need a dance partner.
We won't take no for an answer...
Archiekins.
Who would have predicted this?
Archie Andrews is our fox in the henhouse.
BETTY:
Tell us about Polly.
How is she?
Did she seem okay?
The Blossoms are treating her great.
But, Betty, I don't think she's coming back.
I don't think she wants to.
That doesn't make any sense.
That's not Polly.
She made her choice.
We have to learn to live with that.
No.
I know my sister.
She wouldn't do that to us.
Something else is going on.
ALICE:
What else did you see, Archie?
When you were in the sticky, red thick of it?
Anything about the board?
Cheryl said that they're worried...
That after all the scandal with Jason and Polly, that they might try and steal the company from Mr. Blossom.
Well, do you hear that, Betty?
This is our story.
A hostile takeover.
No wonder the trustees are in town.
The Blossom empire is crumbling.
Okay, but, Mom, if you write a story attacking them while Polly's still in Thornhill...
Enough about Polly.
I mean it.
She's the one that betrayed us, not the other way around.
CHEERLEADER:
Obviously she's jealous...
Cheryl, can we have a word?
[EXHALES] Scatter, my Vixens.
Yes, Betty?
What is it?
Polly.
Look, I don't know what kind of Stockholm syndrome spell you've cast on her, but I want to talk to my sister.
Let's not fight.
Especially not when we should be celebrating.
Why?
What happened?
Haven't you heard?
Dr. Patel just confirmed it this morning.
Polly is having twins.
Bless our Blossom genes!
And she didn't call to tell me.
Hostages aren't normally allowed to make outgoing calls.
Can you please just give her a message for me?
As long as it doesn't upset her.
Tell her she should call our mom.
She's trying really hard to hide it, but I can tell she's really, really hurt and upset.
- I'll pass your message along...
- Thank you.
If I remember.
Cheryl.
That was a joke, you hobo.
Of course I'll give her your message, Betty.
But no promises that she'll care or respond.
VERONICA:
Okay, Ethel, open your eyes.
What is happening?
VERONICA:
I was purging my closet, thinking how you would look magnificent in some of these.
Here, try this on.
This is...
This is so nice.
And I love this.
It is so you, Ethel.
Ronnie, I can't take all this.
I want you to have it.
These things...
My dad gave them to me.
He always brought home gifts whenever he did something wrong.
As a way to make up for it, I guess.
Did it work?
What girl is immune to the charms of a Givenchy bag?
And I still wear these pearls he gave me.
Okay, but...
You don't have to do anything.
Give me anything.
I just want to be friends.
Me, too, Ethel.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Mr. Andrews!
Nice haircut.
You're looking extremely DILF-y today.
Is Archie home?
Cheryl, yes.
Um, come on in.
The Ice Woman cometh.
Hey, Cheryl.
As a maj thank-you for coming to the maple banquet with me tomorrow,
I wanted to give you this.
An '84 Les Paul.
In our signature color.
You're welcome.
Okay.
That's all.
I'm going now.
My claustrophobia acts up in small houses.
See you tomorrow.
I'd give that back if I were you.
Dad, come on.
The Blossoms, they're helping me get into that summer music program.
Like, the best in the country.
And since when did the Blossoms ever give a damn about you, Archie?
Well, they think I have potential, Dad.
He's also pimping himself out to Cheryl.
The Blossoms tried to run our business into the ground.
Maybe if you tried talking to Mr. Blossom...
I tried talking to him, Archie, he laughed in my face.
Don't think for a second that the Blossoms are looking out for you.
They're using you, Archie.
They look at us like we're dirt under their shoe.
I'm over it.
What's this?
The biggest story we've ever broken.
A tell-all expose on the Blossom clan and all of their glorious corruption.
Um, would you mind telling me what your mother is talking about?
It's time that they finally answer to everything that they've done to us, including taking Polly.
By the way, Polly's living with the Blossoms now, so congratulations, you've finally got what you wanted.
She's officially out of our lives.
I'm not publishing your personal vendetta.
Well, it's a good thing I don't need your permission.
What did you do, Hal?
Well, you kicked me out.
So, now, I'm kicking you out.
If we expose the Blossoms, maybe...
Just maybe, we might have a chance in hell to get our daughter back.
You are done here, Alice.
You're fired.
Fine, Hal.
What?
I want my daughter back, you bastard!
Mom!
Black piping for the velvet, of course.
I'll take measurements for the pants.
Uh, before we do that...
Could I talk to you, Mr. Blossom?
Things aren't going great at my dad's company.
And I know you two have been at odds recently.
But I was wondering, instead of helping me with that music school, if...
Maybe you could help my dad.
Are you negotiating on behalf of your father?
No, no, I'm impressed.
In fact, I'm trying to imagine if Jason would ever have given up something like that for me, and I don't believe so.
It speaks to your character, son.
But I'll tell you what, we've already called the Brandenburg Music Academy.
And they're very excited to meet you, by the way.
Let's just get through this banquet, all right?
Sit down man-to-man and discuss what I can do for Fred Andrews.
Is it satisfactory?
It's more than satisfactory.
My parents are unbelievable, Jug.
Polly is locked up in that house like a character out of Jane Eyre, and what are they doing?
Changing each other's login accounts and throwing bricks through windows.
I wish I'd seen that.
Okay, I'm sorry, that's not funny.
It's like, you know how, in a time of crisis, people either come together or fall apart?
It feels like we're falling apart.
And the way things are going, pretty soon, the Coopers, we're not gonna exist anymore.
And there's nothing I can do to stop that.
JUGHEAD:
Betty, don't do that.
Don't give up.
Your family is definitely splintering right now, but it won't fall apart, because of you.
Because you're holding them together.
You're so much stronger than all of the white noise.
You're stronger than your mother, you're stronger than your father.
You're holding this family together.
So don't.
Don't let go.
I won't.
Valerie, hi.
I thought you should know,
Cheryl poured some insane poison into my ear about how close you two are getting.
She legit thinks she's going to steal you away from me or something.
- [SCOFFS] No, she doesn't.
- Yes, she does.
And I don't blame her.
The new guitar, the new suit?
The Blossoms are buying you.
For one night, if it helps my dad and gets me into that music program...
Wouldn't you rather earn your place at that table?
With your music?
All the Blossoms are doing is opening a door for me.
What would you do if you were in my place?
If you have to ask, then you don't know me at all, Archie.
KEVIN:
Oh, my God, did you hear?
Remember when you went swooping in to save Ethel, 'cause you thought she might be suicidal?
Oh, no.
She didn't...
KEVIN:
No, but her dad did.
He accidentally swallowed a whole bottle of sleeping pills.
[ECHOING] He's going to be okay, but that's why Ethel's been so sad lately.
Now, everybody knows...
[SOBBING]
CLIFFORD:
We were tested this year.
As a town, as a company, mainly as a family.
And it may not have been Jason's hand that staked the maple this year, but it was the hand of hope.
Don't think they're being nice or genuine.
They wanted me to fail at the tree-tapping.
But you're going to help with all that.
I'll do whatever I can.
CLIFFORD:
Archibald, have a word?
I'll be right back.
I just wanted to let you know that I've decided to help your father.
You did?
You will?
Well, you've helped our family.
Cheryl, especially.
You fit in so well.
I think you and your father have a very bright future with us.
Thank you, Mr. Blossom.
Oh. "Clifford", please.
And just so you know, you don't have to keep doing me favors.
I like Cheryl.
And I'm happy to be here for her, as a friend.
You know, I'm going to be honest with you.
Cheryl's a bright girl, but the Blossom board, they're very skeptical of having her play an active role in the company.
Now, someone with your stock and character by her side, tempering her more erratic behavior...
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY]
You know, it's about...
Creating a picture.
The right picture.
Having you with us, with Cheryl, it tells a very appealing story.
Which is something I think we could all use right about now.
You'll help us, won't you?
POLLY:
Excuse me, Mr. Blossom, may I have this first dance with Archie?
CLIFFORD:
I think that's an excellent idea.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Polly, can we talk about what's going on here?
Just keep dancing.
And smiling.
[INAUDIBLE]
Betty keeps asking Cheryl about me, she needs to stop.
As long as she's worried about you, Polly, she'll never stop.
Yes, she will...
If I tell you the real reason I'm at Thornhill.
The Blossoms had something to do with Jason's death,
I'm sure of it.
They threatened him and I'm gonna prove it.
Is that why you keep blowing Betty off?
It has to be believable.
And I don't want her trying to rescue me.
Can you please tell her that for me?
- I'm so done with this!
- Do not make a scene.
- No, I'm done.
I'm done!
- Not now.
Polly, will you excuse me?
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
Betty.
Veronica, hey.
Mom, these are my friends.
This is Betty and this is Veronica.
Mrs. Muggs.
Ethel...
We heard what happened, and we wanted to leave these flowers with you.
That's very kind.
Thank you.
Please don't...
Don't thank me.
We're just so glad Mr. Muggs is going to be okay.
And we'll see you at school, Ethel?
You don't need to do this, Vee.
Ethel?
Mrs. Muggs?
There's something I need to tell you.
My name is Veronica Lodge.
- My father is...
- MRS. MUGGS:
Hiram Lodge.
Hmm.
And you're showing your face here?
Mom, she's my friend.
She's not your friend, honey.
Her father is a criminal.
He's the reason Dad did this to himself.
Ronnie?
Is that true?
Yes.
And I am so sorry.
I wish I could do something.
"Sorry" isn't good enough.
You want to do something?
Tell the truth.
Your father is ruining lives.
He deserves to sit behind bars for the rest of his miserable life.
Come on.
Come on.
Cheryl.
You okay?
What did my dad say to you?
That everyone thinks I'm a train wreck?
Jason was the golden boy, but me...
People hate me, Archie.
And at school, that's fine, whatever.
But this is my family.
Forget them, Cheryl.
Forget what they think.
I think you're awesome.
[SIGHS]
Oh, Archie, sometimes I think you may be the only decent person left in Riverdale.
The only person who doesn't want something from me.
Or who doesn't want me to apologize for who I am...
And what I want.
What are you doing?
My lipstick's maple red, by the way.
In case you're wondering why it tastes so sweet.
PENELOPE:
They seem satisfied, but Uncle
Bedford keeps asking about the drive-in land.
I am so close to getting that land back.
Hermione Lodge will crumble.
PENELOPE:
Who would have thought she'd prove so resourceful?
Maybe you should've sent her to jail instead of Hiram.
[GASPS]
HERMIONE:
Hey.
How was your night?
I just got back from the hospital where Ethel's dad is.
Because he tried to kill himself...
Because of what Daddy did...
And, for all I know, continues to do.
I am done lying for Dad.
[EXHALES]
Archie!
I thought it was Cinderella that ran away from the ball, not Prince Charming.
Cheryl, I can't do this right now.
I'm leaving.
CHERYL:
Archie Andrews, if you leave, the radiant sun that is the Blossom family stops shining on you.
And everything we've given you, including Brandenburg, disappears.
Are you sure you want to give that up?
Are you sure you want to do that to your dad?
Cheryl, I came here as a favor to your mom, to help you.
[SCOFFS]
Oh, Archie, don't start lying now.
You may not want anything from me, but you do from my mom and dad, that's why you're here.
Which means, as much as I want you to be better than everyone else...
You're not.
You're just like the others.
I'm sorry, Cheryl...
But I can't do this anymore.
Goodbye.
BETTY:
Mom?
Archie just called.
He talked to Polly.
She's safe.
She's okay, Mom.
She didn't choose the Blossoms over us, she's actually there to spy on them.
[SOBS]
You know, when I went after this story...
I thought, in the back of my mind that,
"What if this is it?
What if this is finally the time that she doesn't come back?"
She will, Mom.
And right now, she's our woman on the inside.
We're going to write this story.
Come write with us at Blue and Gold.
The school newspaper?
Yeah, that's what we are.
But I'm pretty sure that our annual operating budget is bigger than the Register's.
[MUSIC PLAYING ON EARPHONES]
Val.
Val, hey.
Look, you were right.
About being bought and taking shortcuts.
After last night, I'm done with the Blossoms, I am.
Good for you, Archie, but I'm done with you.
Ever since we started dating you've ignored me, you've ditched me.
ARCHIE:
Val, please.
Let me make it up to you.
Sorry, Archie, but unlike you, I won't be bought.
HERMIONE:
Just listen, Fred.
So many families have been hurt by the Lodges.
Now, I don't want yours to be another one.
I've decided to sell to Clifford...
Before it gets any worse.
No, you're not.
I'm going to stay with the project.
That's great.
Thank you.
Don't thank me.
I'm not doing it for you.
See, from now on, everything we do around here is going to be legal.
A hundred percent above board.
Agreed.
Of course.
Also, my stake is 20%.
If I'm gonna put myself on the line,
I need some skin in the game.
That's a really big share.
I'm sick of you people using me and my family as pawns.
Sure.
Anything else?
Yes.
You and me...
Whatever was going on there is over.
Now, we're just business partners.
That's it.
Right.
[BELL RINGS]
VERONICA:
Ethel, I meant what I said.
I'm sorry, Ethel, for everything my family did to yours.
ETHEL:
It's not your fault what your dad did.
And you were there for me when no one else was.
More than once.
Seat's not taken, if you want it.
JUGHEAD:
It seemed that, for Veronica, the sins of the father would remain simply that.
While Archie Andrews returned from the brink with one more bit of news.
At the banquet, I heard Mr. And Mrs. Blossom talking.
It sounded like Clifford Blossom was responsible for sending Veronica's dad to jail.
Oh, my God.
If Clifford sent Hiram Lodge to jail, tore apart his family, then maybe Hiram was trying to do the same thing to him?
Yeah, by going after what the Blossoms value most, their family, their legacy.
That's a motive.
JUGHEAD:
Winter had come early to Riverdale.
Brutal and unforgiving.
Did it work?
Are the vultures appeased?
We're not out of the woods yet.
JUGHEAD:
But it would be nothing compared to the storm that was gathering.
[EXHALES]
A storm of chaos named...
- [SNIFFLES] - ...
Cheryl Blossom.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Yes?
Good night, Cheryl.
Good night, Pollykins.

Previously on Riverdale...
You know that SoDale contract?
It was awarded to Andrews Construction.
Mr. Andrews still doesn't know that Daddy is the buyer?
I asked around about those bruisers going after your crew.
Pretty sure we both know who has business in Montreal.
Hiram, why would he even...
Maybe he got a whiff of your little romance with Freddy Andrews?
When my father got arrested,
I made a pact to become a better person.
You're the bravest of them all, Ethel Muggs.
You hate the Blossoms and now Polly is pregnant with his baby.
Polly is moving home.
I will not be party to raising a child that has Blossom blood.
Thicker than blood.
More precious than oil.
Riverdale's big business is maple syrup.
Since the town's founding, one family has controlled its lucrative syrup trade, the Blossoms.
They were a part of the fabric of our daily lives...
Rich or poor, old or young, we consumed Blossom syrup by the bucket.
That sickly, sweet smell was inescapable.
The death of Jason Blossom precipitated a crisis.
With the heir apparent gone, who would inherit the family business one day?
Certainly not Cheryl.
It was a question that brought the wolves to Riverdale.
And now, the Blossoms were circling the wagons against possible attack, from within their own ranks.
Polly won't answer my calls or e-mails.
I mean, I get that she doesn't want to talk to my dad, but what did I do wrong?
Nothing.
We'll figure it out.
Come here.
Up and at 'em, breakfast is ready.
I'm not hungry.
Oh, enough is enough, Elizabeth, we have a big week ahead of us.
The Blossoms have always been a thorn in our side, ever since, according to your milquetoast father,
Great-Grandpappy Blossom killed Great-Grandpappy Cooper.
Well, it's about time someone brings them to heel.
I'm writing a searing, no-holds-barred takedown of their clan.
And you think that's going to bring Polly home?
Maybe, maybe not, but it'll make me feel better.
Word has it that the Blossom board of trustees has descended upon Riverdale like a cabal of vampires.
Why?
Now, that's a story.
I just need to find a way in.
The lawyers are coming over this week to take our statements for your dad's hearing.
We're both gonna have to testify on your father's behalf.
What if they ask about what he did?
Embezzling all that money?
Am I going to have to lie?
Well...
We might have to shade the truth a bit, Ronnie.
Mom?
Baby, I have just made a mess of things.
Your father found out about Fred and me.
Someone went to him before I got a chance to say anything...
Oh, my God, Dad knows?
Yes, and on top of that, the Blossoms are still after the drive-in land, and Fred still doesn't know that we own it.
Maybe it's time you tell Mr. Andrews the truth.
And risk having him walk off the project?
We've bet everything we have on the SoDale construction.
Mom, this is a small, gossipy town.
You need to tell Fred about the land before someone else does.
Archie.
If music be the food of love, play on, play on.
Did you know this week's the official start of maple syrup season?
I...
No, I didn't.
Well, it is.
And every year, we host a tree-tapping ceremony, a tradition that honors the Blossom bloodline.
Our heritage.
Sounds cool.
It is.
Beyond.
It's also incredibly exclusive.
Family and inner circle only.
Wanna be my date?
The maple-tapping's something Jason and I have done together since we could walk.
It was our extra-special thing.
But I...
I can't face it alone.
If you came, as my escort,
I think I could get through it.
Cheryl, I would love to help, but I have a girlfriend.
Maybe invite Kevin?
Or Reggie?
You don't get it, do you?
I don't want Kevin or Reggie.
I want you.
You defended me to Sheriff Keller when not even my parents would.
Never mind, I'm sorry I asked.
Cheryl, hold on.
"They put me in a wooden box as I desperately opposed.
But all my screaming was for naught.
My mouth had been sewn closed.
Curled up in bed was just a girl.
Needing Daddy's arms to hold her."
Hey, Ethel.
I just wanted to tell you how moved I was by your poem.
It felt like you were tapping into something pretty dark, but also pretty real.
And I don't want to overstep...
But is everything all right, Ethel?
Things at home aren't great.
My mom and dad are fighting, but they won't tell me about what.
It's like this really bad thing is happening, and there's nothing that I can do to stop it.
Like you're trapped in a slow-motion car crash.
Yeah, I know the feeling.
Listen, Ethel.
It sounds like you need some cheering up.
Which happens to be a Veronica Lodge specialty.
So...
If you're free tomorrow, come over for lunch and pampering.
Kevin will be there.
Yeah, come on, it'll be fun.
Just please say yes.
All right, sure.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Great, I'll see you tomorrow.
So...
What was that about?
Ethel's poem was a cry for help if I ever heard one, the likes of which I vowed never to ignore, not after...
Uh-oh.
Do we need to sit down?
Okay, so, last year at Spence, my best friend Katy and I kind of terrorized this girl, Paige.
One time, we made her drink gutter water.
Ew!
Why?
Because she was there.
Because she was a misfit and we were class-A brutal bitches.
Anyway, by December,
Paige couldn't take it anymore...
Oh, my God, did you drive her to suicide?
What?
No.
But she did transfer schools.
And went into therapy.
So now?
If I can make Ethel Muggs' life a little better, even for one afternoon,
I'm going to do it.
Archibald.
I was going to get Principal Weatherbee to summon you.
Hey, Mrs. Blossom.
Have a moment to chat?
About Cheryl.
I believe she invited you to our tree-tapping ceremony?
Yeah.
She did, and like I told her,
I don't feel comfortable going.
Cheryl tells me you have a keen interest in music.
Is that true?
Did she tell you her Great-Uncle Harrison sits on the board of the Brandenburg Music Academy?
They have an excellent summer program, I hear.
It's amazing, crazy hard to get into.
Surely not for a talent like you.
And especially not if I put in a word on your behalf.
Mrs. Blossom...
At Jason's memorial, you brought me his football jersey.
So sorry for your loss, Mrs. Blossom.
I thought you might want to have this.
That was an act of kindness on a day of despair.
You're good and decent, Archibald, unlike most people in this town.
Mrs. Blossom, I don't know what to say.
Say you'll reconsider escorting my daughter to the tapping.
It's just an afternoon.
And it would mean the world to my Cheryl.
I mean, yeah.
I guess I could talk to Valerie.
I swear, Archibald, when the light hits you just right...
I'll tell Cheryl the good news.
And I'll call Great-Uncle Harrison.
Just in time, we're celebrating.
Archie was just telling us how he's going to some super-exclusive music program this summer.
Maybe.
If it happens, though, it would be huge for me.
Do you have to audition for it?
Well, not exactly.
Mrs. Blossom came by earlier and said she'd put a good word in for me.
- Amazing.
- Terrifying.
Uh-huh.
What's she getting out of it?
I told her I'd take Cheryl to their family's tree-tapping thing.
I already talked to Valerie, and she's cool with it.
Cool with you being a gigolo now?
I'm doing someone a favor for my music, Jughead.
I need to make connections outside of Riverdale.
That's the way of the world.
It's all about connections.
But Jughead's right.
These kinds of favors always come with a price tag.
Betty, back me up here.
I think it's a great idea.
Thank you, Betty.
Yeah, and while you're there, would you talk to Polly for me?
I just want to make sure she's okay.
Definitely.
Thank you.
And don't worry, Ronnie, I can take care of myself.
Famous last words, Archiekins.
When Jason died,
I thought I'd tapped my last tree.
Now, don't be nervous.
All you have to do is hold the bucket steady,
I'll handle the rest.
Who are all these people?
Entre nous, they're Daddy's board of trustees.
They smell blood in the water.
That's why they're here.
They're worried Daddy's losing his grip on the company and they're looking for a way to take it away from us.
They can do that?
If they all vote together, they can.
When Jason died, it was a PR debacle.
And now, here's Polly, pregnant and unwed.
It's no wonder they've descended upon us like some biblical plague.
"Nearly 100 years ago, Grandfather Blossom came to this sacred maple grove.
The annual tapping ceremony portends each season's bounty."
Now, I've performed this ceremony many times in my life.
My son Jason, when he came of age, performed it as well.
In his place,
I put forth my daughter Cheryl.
Hey.
You can do this in your sleep.
- Bravo!
- Well done!
Good shot.
Nice.
Mrs. Lodge, this Quiche Lorraine is to die for.
Ethel, you haven't eaten at all.
Oh.
Sorry.
I just...
I'm not really hungry.
Anything we can help with?
Uh, my parents...
All they do is yell at each other.
My parents are fighting right now, too.
It's terrible.
I think my dad had some bad luck with our savings.
Now my mom says we're going to have to sell the house.
My dad is just so...
Crushed.
I wish there was something I could do to help him.
Girl, we have a lot more in common than I thought.
We lost our place at the Dakota.
Look, being ruined sucks.
But you have your family and you have us.
You've got this, Ethel Muggs.
"Muggs"?
Uh, it's Dutch.
We lost the third "G"
when my Grandpa Manfred came over.
Archibald!
Come join us before the snow starts again.
Three, two, one.
Polly.
Betty's worried about you.
Why won't you call or e-mail her?
She fought for you, Polly, and now you're treating her like she's the enemy.
Polly, come along.
Tell Betty that she shouldn't worry, okay?
Veronica, there's something that you need to know
- about that Muggs girl.
- What?
Her father, Manfred Muggs, invested with your dad.
And it's probable that they lost a lot when your father was arrested.
Maybe everything.
Mom, they're being kicked out of their house, their home.
Well, from what I've been told, the Muggs family is going to testify against your father.
They should.
How many, Mom?
How many families like Ethel's?
It's the risk of doing business with your father.
Could Mr. Andrews lose everything, for doing business with you and Dad?
I'm not sure.
My God.
I don't buy this dog-and-pony show for a second.
Cliff can't control his own family, let alone the company.
Agreed.
And if he tries to put Cheryl forward as a successor...
Do you remember what she did at the funeral?
- Crocodile tears.
- Hey.
Archie, you don't have to.
No, Cheryl loved Jason.
What was she meant to do at his funeral, not cry?
And yeah, Jason was on the football team, but Cheryl was at every single game, too, doing as much to help the Bulldogs win as he did.
Also, 4.0.
Also, she has a 4.0 grade point average.
If there's one thing that I've learned being in Cheryl's class, it's don't underestimate her and don't bet against her.
Fred, we need to talk.
Oh, God.
Hiram and I, we are the anonymous buyers.
You're working for Lodge Industries.
How do you not tell me that?
You never would have gotten involved.
You're damn straight.
Because I didn't sign up to go into business with a criminal like Hiram Lodge.
I'm trying to turn Lodge Industries legitimate.
That means partnering with people like you, good people.
This is why Cliff Blossom bought out my crew?
Sent thugs to beat up teenagers?
Clifford didn't send those thugs.
Hiram did.
He was trying to stop us.
He found out about you and me from Clifford.
So you have dragged me into a war between Hiram and Clifford, that's great.
I know you're angry.
And I know that I have no right to ask this...
But please stay on this project.
If you jump ship, I can't start over with someone else.
So, I do the grunt work while your husband's taking potshots at me and you're playing both sides?
The whole time?
I gotta take a walk.
Archibald, do you know, when Cheryl told me that she wanted you to come with us,
I was a little taken aback.
Your father and I haven't been seeing eye-to-eye lately.
I came for Cheryl, Mr. Blossom.
And because I'm grateful for what Mrs. Blossom is doing for me.
The music academy, you mean?
Yeah, that would be quite a feather in your cap, now, wouldn't it?
You know, we can be extremely generous,
Archibald, to the right people.
Now later this week, we're hosting a banquet for the board at the Belmont Lodge.
It's a simple thing, a little dinner, chit-chat, dancing.
We would love you to attend as Cheryl's escort.
You two make quite the pair.
Oh, I'm honored, Mr. Blossom, really, but...
But nothing.
You have to come, I'm wearing viridian.
He'll need a proper suit, don't you think, Daddy?
I'll have my tailor fit you.
If that's not a problem?
No.
No, no, it's just...
I'm an Andrews, Mr. Blossom, like you said.
My dad works construction, a fancy banquet's not really our thing.
That's precisely why you should come.
People like you are the bedrock of our town.
You're hard workers.
Plus, I need a dance partner.
We won't take no for an answer...
Archiekins.
Who would have predicted this?
Archie Andrews is our fox in the henhouse.
Tell us about Polly.
How is she?
Did she seem okay?
The Blossoms are treating her great.
But, Betty, I don't think she's coming back.
I don't think she wants to.
That doesn't make any sense.
That's not Polly.
She made her choice.
We have to learn to live with that.
No.
I know my sister.
She wouldn't do that to us.
Something else is going on.
What else did you see, Archie?
When you were in the sticky, red thick of it?
Anything about the board?
Cheryl said that they're worried...
That after all the scandal with Jason and Polly, that they might try and steal the company from Mr. Blossom.
Well, do you hear that, Betty?
This is our story.
A hostile takeover.
No wonder the trustees are in town.
The Blossom empire is crumbling.
Okay, but, Mom, if you write a story attacking them while Polly's still in Thornhill...
Enough about Polly.
I mean it.
She's the one that betrayed us, not the other way around.
Obviously she's jealous...
Cheryl, can we have a word?
Scatter, my Vixens.
Yes, Betty?
What is it?
Polly.
Look, I don't know what kind of Stockholm syndrome spell you've cast on her, but I want to talk to my sister.
Let's not fight.
Especially not when we should be celebrating.
Why?
What happened?
Haven't you heard?
Dr. Patel just confirmed it this morning.
Polly is having twins.
Bless our Blossom genes!
And she didn't call to tell me.
Hostages aren't normally allowed to make outgoing calls.
Can you please just give her a message for me?
As long as it doesn't upset her.
Tell her she should call our mom.
She's trying really hard to hide it, but I can tell she's really, really hurt and upset.
- I'll pass your message along...
- Thank you.
If I remember.
Cheryl.
That was a joke, you hobo.
Of course I'll give her your message, Betty.
But no promises that she'll care or respond.
Okay, Ethel, open your eyes.
What is happening?
I was purging my closet, thinking how you would look magnificent in some of these.
Here, try this on.
This is...
This is so nice.
And I love this.
It is so you, Ethel.
Ronnie, I can't take all this.
I want you to have it.
These things...
My dad gave them to me.
He always brought home gifts whenever he did something wrong.
As a way to make up for it, I guess.
Did it work?
What girl is immune to the charms of a Givenchy bag?
And I still wear these pearls he gave me.
Okay, but...
You don't have to do anything.
Give me anything.
I just want to be friends.
Me, too, Ethel.
Mr. Andrews!
Nice haircut.
You're looking extremely DILF-y today.
Is Archie home?
Cheryl, yes.
Um, come on in.
The Ice Woman cometh.
Hey, Cheryl.
As a maj thank-you for coming to the maple banquet with me tomorrow,
I wanted to give you this.
An '84 Les Paul.
In our signature color.
You're welcome.
Okay.
That's all.
I'm going now.
My claustrophobia acts up in small houses.
See you tomorrow.
I'd give that back if I were you.
Dad, come on.
The Blossoms, they're helping me get into that summer music program.
Like, the best in the country.
And since when did the Blossoms ever give a damn about you, Archie?
Well, they think I have potential, Dad.
He's also pimping himself out to Cheryl.
The Blossoms tried to run our business into the ground.
Maybe if you tried talking to Mr. Blossom...
I tried talking to him, Archie, he laughed in my face.
Don't think for a second that the Blossoms are looking out for you.
They're using you, Archie.
They look at us like we're dirt under their shoe.
I'm over it.
What's this?
The biggest story we've ever broken.
A tell-all expose on the Blossom clan and all of their glorious corruption.
Um, would you mind telling me what your mother is talking about?
It's time that they finally answer to everything that they've done to us, including taking Polly.
By the way, Polly's living with the Blossoms now, so congratulations, you've finally got what you wanted.
She's officially out of our lives.
I'm not publishing your personal vendetta.
Well, it's a good thing I don't need your permission.
What did you do, Hal?
Well, you kicked me out.
So, now, I'm kicking you out.
If we expose the Blossoms, maybe...
Just maybe, we might have a chance in hell to get our daughter back.
You are done here, Alice.
You're fired.
Fine, Hal.
What?
I want my daughter back, you bastard!
Mom!
Black piping for the velvet, of course.
I'll take measurements for the pants.
Uh, before we do that...
Could I talk to you, Mr. Blossom?
Things aren't going great at my dad's company.
And I know you two have been at odds recently.
But I was wondering, instead of helping me with that music school, if...
Maybe you could help my dad.
Are you negotiating on behalf of your father?
No, no, I'm impressed.
In fact, I'm trying to imagine if Jason would ever have given up something like that for me, and I don't believe so.
It speaks to your character, son.
But I'll tell you what, we've already called the Brandenburg Music Academy.
And they're very excited to meet you, by the way.
Let's just get through this banquet, all right?
Sit down man-to-man and discuss what I can do for Fred Andrews.
Is it satisfactory?
It's more than satisfactory.
My parents are unbelievable, Jug.
Polly is locked up in that house like a character out of Jane Eyre, and what are they doing?
Changing each other's login accounts and throwing bricks through windows.
I wish I'd seen that.
Okay, I'm sorry, that's not funny.
It's like, you know how, in a time of crisis, people either come together or fall apart?
It feels like we're falling apart.
And the way things are going, pretty soon, the Coopers, we're not gonna exist anymore.
And there's nothing I can do to stop that.
Betty, don't do that.
Don't give up.
Your family is definitely splintering right now, but it won't fall apart, because of you.
Because you're holding them together.
You're so much stronger than all of the white noise.
You're stronger than your mother, you're stronger than your father.
You're holding this family together.
So don't.
Don't let go.
I won't.
Valerie, hi.
I thought you should know,
Cheryl poured some insane poison into my ear about how close you two are getting.
She legit thinks she's going to steal you away from me or something.
- No, she doesn't.
- Yes, she does.
And I don't blame her.
The new guitar, the new suit?
The Blossoms are buying you.
For one night, if it helps my dad and gets me into that music program...
Wouldn't you rather earn your place at that table?
With your music?
All the Blossoms are doing is opening a door for me.
What would you do if you were in my place?
If you have to ask, then you don't know me at all, Archie.
Oh, my God, did you hear?
Remember when you went swooping in to save Ethel, 'cause you thought she might be suicidal?
Oh, no.
She didn't...
No, but her dad did.
He accidentally swallowed a whole bottle of sleeping pills.
He's going to be okay, but that's why Ethel's been so sad lately.
Now, everybody knows...
We were tested this year.
As a town, as a company, mainly as a family.
And it may not have been Jason's hand that staked the maple this year, but it was the hand of hope.
Don't think they're being nice or genuine.
They wanted me to fail at the tree-tapping.
But you're going to help with all that.
I'll do whatever I can.
Archibald, have a word?
I'll be right back.
I just wanted to let you know that I've decided to help your father.
You did?
You will?
Well, you've helped our family.
Cheryl, especially.
You fit in so well.
I think you and your father have a very bright future with us.
Thank you, Mr. Blossom.
Oh. "Clifford", please.
And just so you know, you don't have to keep doing me favors.
I like Cheryl.
And I'm happy to be here for her, as a friend.
You know, I'm going to be honest with you.
Cheryl's a bright girl, but the Blossom board, they're very skeptical of having her play an active role in the company.
Now, someone with your stock and character by her side, tempering her more erratic behavior...
You know, it's about...
Creating a picture.
The right picture.
Having you with us, with Cheryl, it tells a very appealing story.
Which is something I think we could all use right about now.
You'll help us, won't you?
Excuse me, Mr. Blossom, may I have this first dance with Archie?
I think that's an excellent idea.
Polly, can we talk about what's going on here?
Just keep dancing.
And smiling.
Betty keeps asking Cheryl about me, she needs to stop.
As long as she's worried about you, Polly, she'll never stop.
Yes, she will...
If I tell you the real reason I'm at Thornhill.
The Blossoms had something to do with Jason's death,
I'm sure of it.
They threatened him and I'm gonna prove it.
Is that why you keep blowing Betty off?
It has to be believable.
And I don't want her trying to rescue me.
Can you please tell her that for me?
- I'm so done with this!
- Do not make a scene.
- No, I'm done.
I'm done!
- Not now.
Polly, will you excuse me?
Betty.
Veronica, hey.
Mom, these are my friends.
This is Betty and this is Veronica.
Mrs. Muggs.
Ethel...
We heard what happened, and we wanted to leave these flowers with you.
That's very kind.
Thank you.
Please don't...
Don't thank me.
We're just so glad Mr. Muggs is going to be okay.
And we'll see you at school, Ethel?
You don't need to do this, Vee.
Ethel?
Mrs. Muggs?
There's something I need to tell you.
My name is Veronica Lodge.
- My father is...
- Hiram Lodge.
Hmm.
And you're showing your face here?
Mom, she's my friend.
She's not your friend, honey.
Her father is a criminal.
He's the reason Dad did this to himself.
Ronnie?
Is that true?
Yes.
And I am so sorry.
I wish I could do something.
"Sorry" isn't good enough.
You want to do something?
Tell the truth.
Your father is ruining lives.
He deserves to sit behind bars for the rest of his miserable life.
Come on.
Come on.
Cheryl.
You okay?
What did my dad say to you?
That everyone thinks I'm a train wreck?
Jason was the golden boy, but me...
People hate me, Archie.
And at school, that's fine, whatever.
But this is my family.
Forget them, Cheryl.
Forget what they think.
I think you're awesome.
Oh, Archie, sometimes I think you may be the only decent person left in Riverdale.
The only person who doesn't want something from me.
Or who doesn't want me to apologize for who I am...
And what I want.
What are you doing?
My lipstick's maple red, by the way.
In case you're wondering why it tastes so sweet.
They seem satisfied, but Uncle
Bedford keeps asking about the drive-in land.
I am so close to getting that land back.
Hermione Lodge will crumble.
Who would have thought she'd prove so resourceful?
Maybe you should've sent her to jail instead of Hiram.
Hey.
How was your night?
I just got back from the hospital where Ethel's dad is.
Because he tried to kill himself...
Because of what Daddy did...
And, for all I know, continues to do.
I am done lying for Dad.
Archie!
I thought it was Cinderella that ran away from the ball, not Prince Charming.
Cheryl, I can't do this right now.
I'm leaving.
Archie Andrews, if you leave, the radiant sun that is the Blossom family stops shining on you.
And everything we've given you, including Brandenburg, disappears.
Are you sure you want to give that up?
Are you sure you want to do that to your dad?
Cheryl, I came here as a favor to your mom, to help you.
Oh, Archie, don't start lying now.
You may not want anything from me, but you do from my mom and dad, that's why you're here.
Which means, as much as I want you to be better than everyone else...
You're not.
You're just like the others.
I'm sorry, Cheryl...
But I can't do this anymore.
Goodbye.
Mom?
Archie just called.
He talked to Polly.
She's safe.
She's okay, Mom.
She didn't choose the Blossoms over us, she's actually there to spy on them.
You know, when I went after this story...
I thought, in the back of my mind that,
"What if this is it?
What if this is finally the time that she doesn't come back?"
She will, Mom.
And right now, she's our woman on the inside.
We're going to write this story.
Come write with us at Blue and Gold.
The school newspaper?
Yeah, that's what we are.
But I'm pretty sure that our annual operating budget is bigger than the Register's.
Val.
Val, hey.
Look, you were right.
About being bought and taking shortcuts.
After last night, I'm done with the Blossoms, I am.
Good for you, Archie, but I'm done with you.
Ever since we started dating you've ignored me, you've ditched me.
Val, please.
Let me make it up to you.
Sorry, Archie, but unlike you, I won't be bought.
Just listen, Fred.
So many families have been hurt by the Lodges.
Now, I don't want yours to be another one.
I've decided to sell to Clifford...
Before it gets any worse.
No, you're not.
I'm going to stay with the project.
That's great.
Thank you.
Don't thank me.
I'm not doing it for you.
See, from now on, everything we do around here is going to be legal.
A hundred percent above board.
Agreed.
Of course.
Also, my stake is 20%.
If I'm gonna put myself on the line,
I need some skin in the game.
That's a really big share.
I'm sick of you people using me and my family as pawns.
Sure.
Anything else?
Yes.
You and me...
Whatever was going on there is over.
Now, we're just business partners.
That's it.
Right.
Ethel, I meant what I said.
I'm sorry, Ethel, for everything my family did to yours.
It's not your fault what your dad did.
And you were there for me when no one else was.
More than once.
Seat's not taken, if you want it.
It seemed that, for Veronica, the sins of the father would remain simply that.
While Archie Andrews returned from the brink with one more bit of news.
At the banquet, I heard Mr. And Mrs. Blossom talking.
It sounded like Clifford Blossom was responsible for sending Veronica's dad to jail.
Oh, my God.
If Clifford sent Hiram Lodge to jail, tore apart his family, then maybe Hiram was trying to do the same thing to him?
Yeah, by going after what the Blossoms value most, their family, their legacy.
That's a motive.
Winter had come early to Riverdale.
Brutal and unforgiving.
Did it work?
Are the vultures appeased?
We're not out of the woods yet.
But it would be nothing compared to the storm that was gathering.
A storm of chaos named Cheryl Blossom.
Yes?
Good night, Cheryl.
Good night, Pollykins.
ARCHIE:
Previously on Riverdale...
You know that SoDale contract?
It was awarded to Andrews Construction.
Mr. Andrews still doesn't know that Daddy is the buyer?
I asked around about those bruisers going after your crew.
Pretty sure we both know who has business in Montreal.
Hiram, why would he even...
Maybe he got a whiff of your little romance with Freddy Andrews?
VERONICA:
When my father got arrested,
I made a pact to become a better person.
You're the bravest of them all, Ethel Muggs.
You hate the Blossoms and now Polly is pregnant with his baby.
Polly is moving home.
I will not be party to raising a child that has Blossom blood.
JUGHEAD:
Thicker than blood.
More precious than oil.
Riverdale's big business is maple syrup.
Since the town's founding, one family has controlled its lucrative syrup trade, the Blossoms.
They were a part of the fabric of our daily lives...
Rich or poor, old or young, we consumed Blossom syrup by the bucket.
That sickly, sweet smell was inescapable.
The death of Jason Blossom precipitated a crisis.
With the heir apparent gone, who would inherit the family business one day?
Certainly not Cheryl.
It was a question that brought the wolves to Riverdale.
And now, the Blossoms were circling the wagons against possible attack, from within their own ranks.
BETTY:
Polly won't answer my calls or e-mails.
I mean, I get that she doesn't want to talk to my dad, but what did I do wrong?
JUGHEAD:
Nothing.
We'll figure it out.
Come here.
(DOOR OPENS)
Up and at 'em, breakfast is ready.
I'm not hungry.
ALICE:
Oh, enough is enough, Elizabeth, we have a big week ahead of us.
The Blossoms have always been a thorn in our side, ever since, according to your milquetoast father,
Great-Grandpappy Blossom killed Great-Grandpappy Cooper.
Well, it's about time someone brings them to heel.
I'm writing a searing, no-holds-barred takedown of their clan.
And you think that's going to bring Polly home?
Maybe, maybe not, but it'll make me feel better.
Word has it that the Blossom board of trustees has descended upon Riverdale like a cabal of vampires.
Why?
Now, that's a story.
I just need to find a way in.
HERMIONE:
The lawyers are coming over this week to take our statements for your dad's hearing.
We're both gonna have to testify on your father's behalf.
What if they ask about what he did?
Embezzling all that money?
Am I going to have to lie?
Well... (SIGHS) We might have to shade the truth a bit, Ronnie.
Mom?
Baby, I have just made a mess of things.
Your father found out about Fred and me.
Someone went to him before I got a chance to say anything...
Oh, my God, Dad knows?
Yes, and on top of that, the Blossoms are still after the drive-in land, and Fred still doesn't know that we own it.
Maybe it's time you tell Mr. Andrews the truth.
And risk having him walk off the project?
We've bet everything we have on the SoDale construction.
Mom, this is a small, gossipy town.
You need to tell Fred about the land before someone else does.
(TUNING GUITAR)
Archie.
If music be the food of love, play on, play on.
Did you know this week's the official start of maple syrup season?
I...
No, I didn't.
Well, it is.
And every year, we host a tree-tapping ceremony, a tradition that honors the Blossom bloodline.
Our heritage.
Sounds cool.
It is.
Beyond.
It's also incredibly exclusive.
Family and inner circle only.
Wanna be my date?
The maple-tapping's something Jason and I have done together since we could walk.
It was our extra-special thing.
But I...
I can't face it alone.
If you came, as my escort,
I think I could get through it.
Cheryl, I would love to help, but I have a girlfriend.
Maybe invite Kevin?
Or Reggie?
You don't get it, do you?
I don't want Kevin or Reggie.
I want you.
You defended me to Sheriff Keller when not even my parents would.
Never mind, I'm sorry I asked.
Cheryl, hold on.
"They put me in a wooden box as I desperately opposed.
But all my screaming was for naught.
My mouth had been sewn closed.
Curled up in bed was just a girl.
Needing Daddy's arms to hold her."
Hey, Ethel.
I just wanted to tell you how moved I was by your poem.
It felt like you were tapping into something pretty dark, but also pretty real.
And I don't want to overstep...
But is everything all right, Ethel?
Things at home aren't great.
My mom and dad are fighting, but they won't tell me about what.
It's like this really bad thing is happening, and there's nothing that I can do to stop it.
Like you're trapped in a slow-motion car crash.
Yeah, I know the feeling.
Listen, Ethel.
It sounds like you need some cheering up.
Which happens to be a Veronica Lodge specialty.
So...
If you're free tomorrow, come over for lunch and pampering.
Kevin will be there.
Yeah, come on, it'll be fun.
Just please say yes.
All right, sure.
Yeah?
- Yeah.
Great, I'll see you tomorrow.
So...
What was that about?
Ethel's poem was a cry for help if I ever heard one, the likes of which I vowed never to ignore, not after...
Uh-oh.
Do we need to sit down?
Okay, so, last year at Spence, my best friend Katy and I kind of terrorized this girl, Paige.
One time, we made her drink gutter water.
Ew!
Why?
Because she was there.
Because she was a misfit and we were class-A brutal bitches.
Anyway, by December,
Paige couldn't take it anymore...
Oh, my God, did you drive her to suicide?
What?
No.
But she did transfer schools.
And went into therapy.
So now?
If I can make Ethel Muggs' life a little better, even for one afternoon,
I'm going to do it.
Archibald.
I was going to get Principal Weatherbee to summon you.
Hey, Mrs. Blossom.
Have a moment to chat?
About Cheryl.
I believe she invited you to our tree-tapping ceremony?
Yeah.
She did, and like I told her,
I don't feel comfortable going.
Cheryl tells me you have a keen interest in music.
Is that true?
Did she tell you her Great-Uncle Harrison sits on the board of the Brandenburg Music Academy?
They have an excellent summer program, I hear.
It's amazing, crazy hard to get into.
Surely not for a talent like you.
And especially not if I put in a word on your behalf.
Mrs. Blossom...
At Jason's memorial, you brought me his football jersey.
So sorry for your loss, Mrs. Blossom.
I thought you might want to have this.
That was an act of kindness on a day of despair.
You're good and decent, Archibald, unlike most people in this town.
Mrs. Blossom, I don't know what to say.
Say you'll reconsider escorting my daughter to the tapping.
It's just an afternoon.
And it would mean the world to my Cheryl.
I mean, yeah.
I guess I could talk to Valerie.
I swear, Archibald, when the light hits you just right...
I'll tell Cheryl the good news.
And I'll call Great-Uncle Harrison.
Just in time, we're celebrating.
KEVIN:
Archie was just telling us how he's going to some super-exclusive music program this summer.
Maybe.
If it happens, though, it would be huge for me.
Do you have to audition for it?
Well, not exactly.
Mrs. Blossom came by earlier and said she'd put a good word in for me.
Amazing.
- Terrifying.
Uh-huh.
What's she getting out of it?
I told her I'd take Cheryl to their family's tree-tapping thing.
I already talked to Valerie, and she's cool with it.
Cool with you being a gigolo now?
I'm doing someone a favor for my music, Jughead.
I need to make connections outside of Riverdale.
That's the way of the world.
It's all about connections.
But Jughead's right.
These kinds of favors always come with a price tag.
Betty, back me up here.
I think it's a great idea.
Thank you, Betty.
Yeah, and while you're there, would you talk to Polly for me?
I just want to make sure she's okay.
Definitely.
Thank you.
And don't worry, Ronnie, I can take care of myself.
Famous last words, Archiekins.
CHERYL:
When Jason died,
I thought I'd tapped my last tree.
Now, don't be nervous.
All you have to do is hold the bucket steady,
I'll handle the rest.
ARCHIE:
Who are all these people?
Entre nous, they're Daddy's board of trustees.
They smell blood in the water.
That's why they're here.
(SIGHS) They're worried Daddy's losing his grip on the company and they're looking for a way to take it away from us.
They can do that?
If they all vote together, they can.
When Jason died, it was a PR debacle.
And now, here's Polly, pregnant and unwed.
It's no wonder they've descended upon us like some biblical plague.
"Nearly 100 years ago, Grandfather Blossom came to this sacred maple grove.
The annual tapping ceremony portends each season's bounty."
Now, I've performed this ceremony many times in my life.
My son Jason, when he came of age, performed it as well.
In his place,
I put forth my daughter Cheryl.
Hey.
You can do this in your sleep.
MAN 1:
Bravo!
MAN 2:
Well done!
(APPLAUSE)
ARCHIE:
Good shot.
Nice.
Mrs. Lodge, this Quiche Lorraine is to die for.
Ethel, you haven't eaten at all.
Oh.
Sorry.
I just...
I'm not really hungry.
Anything we can help with?
Uh, my parents...
All they do is yell at each other.
My parents are fighting right now, too.
It's terrible.
I think my dad had some bad luck with our savings.
Now my mom says we're going to have to sell the house.
My dad is just so...
Crushed.
I wish there was something I could do to help him.
Girl, we have a lot more in common than I thought.
We lost our place at the Dakota.
Look, being ruined sucks.
But you have your family and you have us.
You've got this, Ethel Muggs.
"Muggs"?
Uh, it's Dutch.
We lost the third "G"
when my Grandpa Manfred came over.
Archibald!
Come join us before the snow starts again.
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Three, two, one.
(CAMERA CLICKS)
Polly.
Betty's worried about you.
Why won't you call or e-mail her?
She fought for you, Polly, and now you're treating her like she's the enemy.
Polly, come along.
Tell Betty that she shouldn't worry, okay?
Veronica, there's something that you need to know about that Muggs girl.
What?
Her father, Manfred Muggs, invested with your dad.
And it's probable that they lost a lot when your father was arrested.
Maybe everything.
Mom, they're being kicked out of their house, their home.
Well, from what I've been told, the Muggs family is going to testify against your father.
They should.
How many, Mom?
How many families like Ethel's?
It's the risk of doing business with your father.
Could Mr. Andrews lose everything, for doing business with you and Dad?
I'm not sure.
My God.
I don't buy this dog-and-pony show for a second.
Cliff can't control his own family, let alone the company.
Agreed.
And if he tries to put Cheryl forward as a successor...
Do you remember what she did at the funeral?
Crocodile tears.
Hey.
CHERYL:
Archie, you don't have to.
No, Cheryl loved Jason.
What was she meant to do at his funeral, not cry?
And yeah, Jason was on the football team, but Cheryl was at every single game, too, doing as much to help the Bulldogs win as he did.
Also, 4.0.
Also, she has a 4.0 grade point average.
If there's one thing that I've learned being in Cheryl's class, it's don't underestimate her and don't bet against her.
HERMIONE:
Fred, we need to talk.
Oh, God. (SIGHS)
Hiram and I, we are the anonymous buyers.
You're working for Lodge Industries.
How do you not tell me that?
You never would have gotten involved.
You're damn straight.
Because I didn't sign up to go into business with a criminal like Hiram Lodge.
I'm trying to turn Lodge Industries legitimate.
That means partnering with people like you, good people.
This is why Cliff Blossom bought out my crew?
Sent thugs to beat up teenagers?
Clifford didn't send those thugs.
Hiram did.
He was trying to stop us.
He found out about you and me from Clifford.
So you have dragged me into a war between Hiram and Clifford, that's great.
I know you're angry.
And I know that I have no right to ask this...
But please stay on this project.
If you jump ship, I can't start over with someone else.
So, I do the grunt work while your husband's taking potshots at me and you're playing both sides?
The whole time?
I gotta take a walk.
Archibald, do you know, when Cheryl told me that she wanted you to come with us,
I was a little taken aback.
Your father and I haven't been seeing eye-to-eye lately.
I came for Cheryl, Mr. Blossom.
And because I'm grateful for what Mrs. Blossom is doing for me.
The music academy, you mean?
Yeah, that would be quite a feather in your cap, now, wouldn't it?
You know, we can be extremely generous,
Archibald, to the right people.
Now later this week, we're hosting a banquet for the board at the Belmont Lodge.
It's a simple thing, a little dinner, chit-chat, dancing.
We would love you to attend as Cheryl's escort.
You two make quite the pair.
Oh, I'm honored, Mr. Blossom, really, but...
CHERYL:
But nothing.
You have to come, I'm wearing viridian.
He'll need a proper suit, don't you think, Daddy?
I'll have my tailor fit you.
If that's not a problem?
No.
No, no, it's just...
I'm an Andrews, Mr. Blossom, like you said.
My dad works construction, a fancy banquet's not really our thing.
That's precisely why you should come.
People like you are the bedrock of our town.
You're hard workers.
Plus, I need a dance partner.
We won't take no for an answer...
Archiekins.
ALICE:
Who would've predicted this?
Archie Andrews is our fox in the henhouse.
BETTY:
Tell us about Polly.
How is she?
Did she seem okay?
The Blossoms are treating her great.
But, Betty, I don't think she's coming back.
I don't think she wants to.
That doesn't make any sense.
That's not Polly.
She made her choice.
We have to learn to live with that.
No.
I know my sister.
She wouldn't do that to us.
Something else is going on.
ALICE:
What else did you see, Archie?
When you were in the sticky, red thick of it?
Anything about the board?
Cheryl said that they're worried...
That after all the scandal with Jason and Polly, that they might try and steal the company from Mr. Blossom.
Well, do you hear that, Betty?
This is our story.
A hostile takeover.
No wonder the trustees are in town.
The Blossom empire is crumbling.
Okay, but, Mom, if you write a story attacking them while Polly's still in Thornhill...
Enough about Polly.
I mean it.
She's the one that betrayed us, not the other way around.
CHEERLEADER:
Obviously she's jealous...
Cheryl, can we have a word?
(EXHALES) Scatter, my Vixens.
Yes, Betty?
What is it?
Polly.
Look, I don't know what kind of Stockholm syndrome spell you've cast on her, but I want to talk to my sister.
Let's not fight.
Especially not when we should be celebrating.
Why?
What happened?
Haven't you heard?
Dr. Patel just confirmed it this morning.
Polly is having twins.
Bless our Blossom genes!
And she didn't call to tell me.
Hostages aren't normally allowed to make outgoing calls.
Can you please just give her a message for me?
As long as it doesn't upset her.
Tell her she should call our mom.
She's trying really hard to hide it, but I can tell she's really, really hurt and upset.
I'll pass your message along...
- Thank you.
If I remember.
Cheryl.
That was a joke, you hobo.
Of course I'll give her your message, Betty.
But no promises that she'll care or respond.
VERONICA:
Okay, Ethel, open your eyes.
What is happening?
VERONICA:
I was purging my closet, thinking how you would look magnificent in some of these.
Here, try this on.
This is...
This is so nice.
And I love this.
It is so you, Ethel.
Ronnie, I can't take all this.
I want you to have it.
These things...
My dad gave them to me.
He always brought home gifts whenever he did something wrong.
As a way to make up for it, I guess.
Did it work?
What girl is immune to the charms of a Givenchy bag?
And I still wear these pearls he gave me.
Okay, but...
You don't have to do anything.
Give me anything.
I just want to be friends.
Me, too, Ethel.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Mr. Andrews!
Nice haircut.
You're looking extremely DILF-y today.
Is Archie home?
Cheryl, yes.
Um, come on in.
The Ice Woman cometh.
Hey, Cheryl.
As a maj thank-you for coming to the maple banquet with me tomorrow,
I wanted to give you this.
An '84 Les Paul.
In our signature color.
You're welcome.
Okay.
That's all.
I'm going now.
My claustrophobia acts up in small houses.
See you tomorrow.
I'd give that back if I were you.
Dad, come on.
The Blossoms, they're helping me get into that summer music program.
Like, the best in the country.
And since when did the Blossoms ever give a damn about you, Archie?
Well, they think I have potential, Dad.
He's also pimping himself out to Cheryl.
The Blossoms tried to run our business into the ground.
Maybe if you tried talking to Mr. Blossom...
I tried talking to him, Archie, he laughed in my face.
Don't think for a second that the Blossoms are looking out for you.
They're using you, Archie.
They look at us like we're dirt under their shoe.
I'm over it.
What's this?
The biggest story we've ever broken.
A tell-all expose on the Blossom clan and all of their glorious corruption.
Um, would you mind telling me what your mother is talking about?
It's time that they finally answer to everything that they've done to us, including taking Polly.
By the way, Polly's living with the Blossoms now, so congratulations, you've finally got what you wanted.
She's officially out of our lives.
I'm not publishing your personal vendetta.
Well, it's a good thing I don't need your permission.
What did you do, Hal?
Well, you kicked me out.
So, now, I'm kicking you out.
If we expose the Blossoms, maybe...
Just maybe, we might have a chance in hell to get our daughter back.
You are done here, Alice.
You're fired.
Fine, Hal.
What?
I want my daughter back, you bastard!
Mom!
Black piping for the velvet, of course.
I'll take measurements for the pants.
Uh, before we do that...
Could I talk to you, Mr. Blossom?
Things aren't going great at my dad's company.
And I know you two have been at odds recently.
But I was wondering, instead of helping me with that music school, if...
Maybe you could help my dad.
Are you negotiating on behalf of your father?
No, no, I'm impressed.
In fact, I'm trying to imagine if Jason would ever have given up something like that for me, and I don't believe so.
It speaks to your character, son.
But I'll tell you what, we've already called the Brandenburg Music Academy.
And they're very excited to meet you, by the way.
Let's just get through this banquet, all right?
Sit down man-to-man and discuss what I can do for Fred Andrews.
Is it satisfactory?
It's more than satisfactory.
My parents are unbelievable, Jug.
Polly is locked up in that house like a character out of Jane Eyre, and what are they doing?
Changing each other's login accounts and throwing bricks through windows.
I wish I'd seen that.
Okay, I'm sorry, that's not funny.
It's like, you know how, in a time of crisis, people either come together or fall apart?
It feels like we're falling apart.
And the way things are going, pretty soon, the Coopers, we're not gonna exist anymore.
And there's nothing I can do to stop that.
JUGHEAD:
Betty, don't do that.
Don't give up.
Your family is definitely splintering right now, but it won't fall apart, because of you.
Because you're holding them together.
You're so much stronger than all of the white noise.
You're stronger than your mother, you're stronger than your father.
You're holding this family together.
So don't.
Don't let go.
I won't.
Valerie, hi.
I thought you should know,
Cheryl poured some insane poison into my ear about how close you two are getting.
She legit thinks she's going to steal you away from me or something.
(SCOFFS) No, she doesn't.
- Yes, she does.
And I don't blame her.
The new guitar, the new suit?
The Blossoms are buying you.
For one night, if it helps my dad and gets me into that music program...
Wouldn't you rather earn your place at that table?
With your music?
All the Blossoms are doing is opening a door for me.
What would you do if you were in my place?
If you have to ask, then you don't know me at all, Archie.
KEVIN:
Oh, my God, did you hear?
Remember when you went swooping in to save Ethel, 'cause you thought she might be suicidal?
Oh, no.
She didn't...
KEVIN:
No, but her dad did.
He accidentally swallowed a whole bottle of sleeping pills.
(ECHOING) He's going to be okay, but that's why Ethel's been so sad lately.
Now, everybody knows...
(SOBBING)
(GLASS CLINKING)
CLIFFORD:
We were tested this year.
As a town, as a company, mainly as a family.
And it may not have been Jason's hand that staked the maple this year,
but it was the hand of hope.
Don't think they're being nice or genuine.
They wanted me to fail at the tree-tapping.
But you're going to help with all that.
I'll do whatever I can.
CLIFFORD:
Archibald, have a word?
I'll be right back.
I just wanted to let you know that I've decided to help your father.
You did?
You will?
Well, you've helped our family.
Cheryl, especially.
You fit in so well.
I think you and your father have a very bright future with us.
Thank you, Mr. Blossom.
Oh. "Clifford", please.
And just so you know, you don't have to keep doing me favors.
I like Cheryl.
And I'm happy to be here for her, as a friend.
You know, I'm going to be honest with you.
Cheryl's a bright girl, but the Blossom board, they're very skeptical of having her play an active role in the company.
Now, someone with your stock and character by her side, tempering her more erratic behavior... (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
You know, it's about...
Creating a picture.
The right picture.
Having you with us, with Cheryl, it tells a very appealing story.
Which is something I think we could all use right about now.
You'll help us, won't you?
POLLY:
Excuse me, Mr. Blossom, may I have this first dance with Archie?
CLIFFORD:
I think that's an excellent idea.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Polly, can we talk about what's going on here?
Just keep dancing.
And smiling.
(INAUDIBLE)
Betty keeps asking Cheryl about me, she needs to stop.
As long as she's worried about you, Polly, she'll never stop.
Yes, she will...
If I tell you the real reason I'm at Thornhill.
The Blossoms had something to do with Jason's death,
I'm sure of it.
They threatened him and I'm gonna prove it.
Is that why you keep blowing Betty off?
It has to be believable.
And I don't want her trying to rescue me.
Can you please tell her that for me?
I'm so done with this!
Do not make a scene.
No, I'm done.
I'm done!
- Not now.
Polly, will you excuse me?
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Betty.
Veronica, hey.
Mom, these are my friends.
This is Betty and this is Veronica.
Mrs. Muggs.
Ethel...
We heard what happened, and we wanted to leave these flowers with you.
That's very kind.
Thank you.
Please don't...
Don't thank me.
We're just so glad Mr. Muggs is going to be okay.
And we'll see you at school, Ethel?
You don't need to do this, Vee.
Ethel?
Mrs. Muggs?
There's something I need to tell you.
My name is Veronica Lodge.
My father is...
MRS. MUGGS:
Hiram Lodge.
Hmm.
And you're showing your face here?
Mom, she's my friend.
She's not your friend, honey.
Her father is a criminal.
He's the reason Dad did this to himself.
Ronnie?
Is that true?
Yes.
And I am so sorry.
I wish I could do something.
"Sorry" isn't good enough.
You want to do something?
Tell the truth.
Your father is ruining lives.
He deserves to sit behind bars for the rest of his miserable life.
Come on.
Come on.
Cheryl.
You okay?
What did my dad say to you?
That everyone thinks I'm a train wreck?
Jason was the golden boy, but me...
People hate me, Archie.
And at school, that's fine, whatever.
But this is my family.
Forget them, Cheryl.
Forget what they think.
I think you're awesome.
(SIGHS)
Oh, Archie, sometimes I think you may be the only decent person left in Riverdale.
The only person who doesn't want something from me.
Or who doesn't want me to apologize for who I am...
And what I want.
What are you doing?
My lipstick's maple red, by the way.
In case you're wondering why it tastes so sweet.
PENELOPE:
They seem satisfied, but Uncle
Bedford keeps asking about the drive-in land.
I am so close to getting that land back.
Hermione Lodge will crumble.
PENELOPE:
Who would have thought she'd prove so resourceful?
Maybe you should've sent her to jail instead of Hiram.
(GASPS)
HERMIONE:
Hey.
How was your night?
I just got back from the hospital where Ethel's dad is.
Because he tried to kill himself...
Because of what Daddy did...
And, for all I know, continues to do.
I am done lying for Dad.
(EXHALES)
Archie!
I thought it was Cinderella that ran away from the ball, not Prince Charming.
Cheryl, I can't do this right now.
I'm leaving.
CHERYL:
Archie Andrews, if you leave, the radiant sun that is the Blossom family stops shining on you.
And everything we've given you, including Brandenburg, disappears.
Are you sure you want to give that up?
Are you sure you want to do that to your dad?
Cheryl, I came here as a favor to your mom, to help you.
(SCOFFS)
Oh, Archie, don't start lying now.
You may not want anything from me, but you do from my mom and dad, that's why you're here.
Which means, as much as I want you to be better than everyone else...
You're not.
You're just like the others.
I'm sorry, Cheryl...
But I can't do this anymore.
Goodbye.
BETTY:
Mom?
Archie just called.
He talked to Polly.
She's safe.
She's okay, Mom.
She didn't choose the Blossoms over us, she's actually there to spy on them.
(SOBS)
You know, when I went after this story...
I thought, in the back of my mind that,
"What if this is it?
"What if this is finally the time
"that she doesn't come back?"
She will, Mom.
And right now, she's our woman on the inside.
We're going to write this story.
Come write with us at Blue and Gold.
The school newspaper?
Yeah, that's what we are.
But I'm pretty sure that our annual operating budget is bigger than the Register's.
(MUSIC PLAYING ON EARPHONES)
Val.
Val, hey.
Look, you were right.
About being bought and taking shortcuts.
After last night, I'm done with the Blossoms, I am.
Good for you, Archie, but I'm done with you.
Ever since we started dating you've ignored me, you've ditched me.
ARCHIE:
Val, please.
Let me make it up to you.
Sorry, Archie, but unlike you, I won't be bought.
HERMIONE:
Just listen.
So many families have been hurt by the Lodges.
Now, I don't want yours to be another one.
I've decided to sell to Clifford...
Before it gets any worse.
No, you're not.
I'm going to stay with the project.
That's great.
Thank you.
Don't thank me.
I'm not doing it for you.
See, from now on, everything we do around here is going to be legal.
A hundred percent above board.
Agreed.
Of course.
Also, my stake is 20%.
If I'm gonna put myself on the line,
I need some skin in the game.
That's a really big share.
I'm sick of you people using me and my family as pawns.
Sure.
Anything else?
Yes.
You and me...
Whatever was going on there is over.
Now, we're just business partners.
That's it.
Right.
(BELL RINGS)
VERONICA:
Ethel, I meant what I said.
I'm sorry, Ethel, for everything my family did to yours.
ETHEL:
It's not your fault what your dad did.
And you were there for me when no one else was.
More than once.
Seat's not taken, if you want it.
JUGHEAD:
It seemed that, for Veronica, the sins of the father would remain simply that.
While Archie Andrews returned from the brink with one more bit of news.
At the banquet, I heard Mr. and Mrs. Blossom talking.
It sounded like Clifford Blossom was responsible for sending Veronica's dad to jail.
Oh, my God.
If Clifford sent Hiram Lodge to jail, tore apart his family, then maybe Hiram was trying to do the same thing to him?
Yeah, by going after what the Blossoms value most, their family, their legacy.
That's a motive.
JUGHEAD:
Winter had come early to Riverdale.
Brutal and unforgiving.
Did it work?
Are the vultures appeased?
We're not out of the woods yet.
JUGHEAD:
But it would be nothing compared to the storm that was gathering.
(EXHALES)
A storm of chaos named... (SNIFFLES) Cheryl Blossom.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Yes?
Good night, Cheryl.
Good night, Pollykins.
there he is.
Jesus.
You'll tell him you were the reason we're late, right?
Come on.
I don't--
I don't want him to think I don't care about time and stuff.
There's my girl.
There's my dad.
Dad, this is my boyfriend Martin.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Martin.
Uh, Mr. gallo.
I'm Martin.
You're Mr. gallo.
I know that.
Nice to meet you, Martin.
Fuck.
It's really good to see you.
You look great.
You look tired.
Where you coming from this time?
Singapore.
Ah.
Ever been?
No, I haven't been.
Uh, i-
- I hear it's very, um, clean, which I like.
I also hear that they cane you if you spit in the street.
Uh, not that I like that.
Yeah, I don't like that part.
Good evening.
Can I bring you something to drink?
Shall we start with a nice bottle of red?
Uh, Martin has a sulfite allergy.
A sulfite allergy?
Um, it's not that bad, actually.
I just get a little, uh, hivey.
But I'm fine with water or death.
Okay.
Uh, we'll have a bottle of the chateauneuf-du-pape.
Excellent choice.
And, Martin, are you sure?
Nothing?
Maybe a beer?
Or are you allergic to hops?
Heh.
You sure you don't want something else, Martin?
Mm.
Oh, no.
This is delicious.
These beets are really well steamed.
I'm sorry.
I gotta take this.
He hates me.
He doesn't hate you.
He hates me.
He hates me so much, I'm starting to hate myself.
All that matters is what I think, and I'm a fan.
Yeah?
Big fan.
Huge fan.
All right.
Martin:
Okay, I got this.
I'll bounce back.
Round two.
Sorry about that.
It's, uh, not a problem.
Looks like a, uh, pretty major deal just went down over there by the bar, huh?
So, Martin, what is it that you do?
Uh, dad, I told you Martin is a musician.
Right.
Right.
What is it, the, uh, ukulele?
Uh, it's the, uh, banjo.
Banjo.
Right, like Kermit the frog.
Heh.
I guess I assumed the banjo was a hobby.
Well, i have a band, hysterical kindness.
It's a bluegrass collective, more flatt and scruggs or punch brothers than some, you know, poppy mumford sons kind of wannabe thing.
What's wrong with mumford sons?
They're a very successful act, no?
He likes mumford sons.
So where you from?
Well, I was born in Chicago, uh, but I grew up in guelph.
Guelph?
Uh, guelph, Ontario.
Guelph?
It's, uh...
Canada.
Guelph?
Okay.
Your folks, what do they do?
Jesus, dad, what is with the third degree?
Third degree?
I'm just getting to know the guy.
You don't mind, do you, Martin?
No.
No, no.
It's great.
It's great getting to know someone this, you know, vigorously.
So your parents?
Oh.
Right.
Um...
My mother is an acupuncturist in Toronto, and my father is an, um-- he's an environmental activist in Albuquerque.
He's an environmental activist in Albuquerque, dad.
Deal with it.
I didn't say anything.
I'm sure it's very satisfying work.
He never met a tree that he didn't want to chain himself to.
Sweetie, you have a little, um, salad dressing.
Oh.
Oops.
Oh.
Mr. gallo,
I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.
Could tonight's dinner have gone any worse?
Actually, it could have.
Mm, I guess he could have castrated me at the table.
Last time i introduced dad to a boyfriend,
I never heard from the guy again, so...
Wow.
When I disappear next, ask your dad where my body's buried, just as, you know, like, a courtesy to my mom.
Martin, i know he's tough.
But you're not gonna have to deal with him.
I probably won't see him for another year, so...
Oh.
In that case, I think we should make a plan to see him sooner than that.
You'd be up for that?
Absolutely.
I would go through that hell all over again for you.
Coming.
I'm coming.
Mr. gallo?
Ginnie home?
Home?
Uh, no.
No.
I mean, uh, she may be home, but, uh...
Ginnie doesn't live here anymore.
We broke up.
Okay.
Want to invite me in?
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, of course.
Sorry.
I was just, uh, getting some work done.
She didn't tell you when we, uh, broke up?
We haven't spoken since Christmas.
Ah.
Well, I guess you could call her, you know, to get her, uh, new address to go there.
She's not picking up or returning calls or texts.
I was hoping maybe she'd be here.
Oh, I just, uh--
I just had a little, uh, get-together last month, so-- don't worry about it.
Just cleaning, anyway.
Yeah.
So, uh, any idea where i could find my daughter?
Did you try Gary and Roberta?
Gary and Roberta?
Yeah.
When she moved out, she went to go stay with them.
Do you want any coffee?
Uh, that's-- that's okay.
Don't bother.
I'm just gonna make some anyway.
So, uh...
So when did you two break up?
Uh, about three months ago.
Three months and nine days or something.
I don't-- you know, I'm not, uh--
I'm sure she's, uh-- you said she, uh-- she knew you were coming in to town?
I gave her the heads-up i was coming in last minute, but I never got a response.
Huh.
No, no.
This is-- this is jimothy, uh, is my new roommate.
Gallo:
Gotcha.
Jimothy.
Like Timothy with a "j."
No.
Jimothy, this is Mr. gallo, ginnie's dad.
Who?
Ex-girlfriend's father.
Do you have the bong?
What?
I, uh-
- I don't know what you mean?
What do you mean by that?
The bong, thing I smoke weed out of all day.
Oh, is that-- is that-- is that what this is?
I was-- yeah, i was looking earlier.
I just didn't-- i was curious.
You're giving me a real stressy vibe, man.
Uh...
You stressed out?
What's going on?
J-jimothy.
Could you just, um-- just take your weird machine there and just let Mr. gallo and I talk?
Am I wrong?
Is he giving you a stressy vibe?
You're not wrong.
Yeah.
I'm having people over tonight, in case you want to hide in your room again.
You can come.
I thought-- you know, i thought we said, uh-- we agreed, you know, last time, you know, with-- with the cops...
Oh, so I'm not allowed to have people over in my own home?
No, it's cool.
Whatever.
Oh, did you get my message?
What message?
The fiddle player in your band or something came by, wanted you to know you had a show this weekend or something.
Wait.
What do you mean?
We have a show?
I think so.
Well, did he say when or where?
Didn't say when.
Didn't say where.
You know, I'm not-- heh.
He's not-- we're not-- we're not friends.
None of my business.
W-we're just friends.
Okay.
When ginnie moved out, i needed a new roommate to help cover the rent.
Of course, yeah.
You don't wanna let go of a prime piece of real estate like this.
Yeah.
No, these crossbeams, you don't always-- oh.
Oh, I'll go get that coffee.
Look, Martin, i can see you're, uh, a busy man here.
Tomorrow I have to get on a flight to Geneva.
All I want to do is find my daughter, so if you can just point me to her new place,
I'll get out of your hair.
Uh, we're all out of milk.
And sugar.
Uh, but we have syrup.
You want syrup in your coffee, or is that-- is that weird?
I don't want syrup.
Thanks.
Okay.
So do you have an address for this Gary and Roberta?
Uh, no, but they're not too far from here.
Uh, I don't have an address, but I've been over there.
So it's close?
Yeah.
Yes, it's just a couple blocks that-a-way.
Okay.
You want to get dressed, and you can take me over there?
Now?
Yes, now, Martin.
Do you mind?
Fuck.
Fuck this.
Hey, Martin, do you mind if I go on this computer for a minute, check e-mails?
Um, yeah, sure.
Go ahead.
Fuck.
Uh, wait!
H-hold on!
Why don't you just--
Holy shit!
Uh, you know, I just--
I tell jimothy not to use my computer, but he does.
Look, Martin, porn is porn, you know, but you gotta hide that shit.
Put it in a folder or something.
Yeah.
Can't just leave it hanging out there.
You know, i-- i can't even believe that they have sites like that on the Internet.
Uh, those poor women.
Okay, you want to put on some pants so we can hit the road?
Here.
You know where we're going.
You drive.
Ahh.
Wasn't ready for that.
Actually, I don't drive.
What do you mean, you don't drive?
Ah, I don't have my license.
And, uh, also i don't know how.
Nice throw.
How can you not know how to drive in Los Angeles?
A man should know how to drive.
I have a bicycle.
Oh, well, congrats on that.
Yeah, it's actually considered very masculine in the Netherlands.
You know, hey, i haven't really been in touch with ginnie recently, so...
So?
So I might not come in.
Fine by me.
You know, not that we're not friends.
You know, we're still friends.
I think we're still friends.
We're still friends on Facebook.
That--
Martin, where are we going?
Oh, uh, it's just up ahead that-a-way and a second left at the light.
It's one of these.
I can never tell which.
They all look the same.
Voice mail's still full.
It's gotta be this one.
I hear fighting.
This is definitely it.
Okay, well, write it down, like, on the dry erase!
'Cause Saturday's my day!
Shit.
Hey.
Hey, how's it going, man?
Um-- Gary.
Yeah, hey, Martin.
Hi.
Sorry to just drop by like this.
Yeah, it-- it really is-- we're looking for my daughter.
Ginnie.
Oh.
This is her father, Mr. gallo.
Uh, he didn't have her new address.
She, um--
Martin, hi.
Oh.
Uh, they-- they're looking for ginnie, babe.
Um, this is ginnie's dad.
I'm Roberta.
So great to finally meet you.
Jack, right?
That would be ginnie's stepfather.
Right.
Well, don't worry.
She's talked a lot about you, too.
Did you invite them in?
I literally just opened the door.
Come in.
Come in.
Yeah, come on in.
Yeah.
After you.
Yeah, welcome, welcome.
Micasa-- heh heh.
Roberta:
Uh, could I get you something to drink?
Water or kombucha?
Twig tea?
I have some nice biodynamic wine.
Don't bother.
Please, we're just looking for ginnie.
Martin said she was staying here.
She was staying here.
Uh, she left about three weeks ago.
Did you try her cell?
Phone is off, mailbox full for a couple days now.
Gary:
Oh, man, sounds to me like she's living off the grid, you know?
Martin, was ginnie, like, a survivalist, you know?
Like one of those preppers or-- Gary, stop talking.
Do you know where she moved when she left here?
Yes.
Um...
Ohh.
Ahh.
What was her name?
Martin, you know her.
Um, the jittery girl.
Always looks like she's about to cry.
You know her.
Mm, doesn't, uh, ring a bell.
Okay, did ginnie leave an address?
Roberta:
Yes.
I think it's on the fridge.
Uh, Gary, could you get it, please?
Please come in.
Gary:
Uh, I'm not seeing it.
It's on the fridge!
No, it isn't!
It's definitely on the fridge.
I just checked there.
Jesus.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
There's no address on the fridge.
It's on the Japanese paper.
Yeah, no.
I know you think it's there, but it's not there.
On the Japanese paper.
Christ.
Roberta:
Get out of my way.
Fine.
I don't know how to look.
It's not there.
You sure you guys don't want anything, like a-- like a beer?
Sure.
I could do a beer.
Ah, you know, uh,
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Uh, how have you been, Gary?
I've been, um-- work's good.
Work's good.
Yeah.
Gary, where's the tub where we, uh, keep the receipts?
What tub?
I-
- I don't know.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
I need to help her out.
What tub are you ta-- the tin?
That's a tin.
That's not a tub.
Tub, tin, whatever.
No, I don't know.
Can I help you find what you're looking for?
Go-- go check the drawer.
What drawer?
The odds-and-ends drawer.
All right, I'm just saying be specific.
We'll find it.
Can I get you guys something?
Are you sure?
Something to drink or cheese?
We have nice cheese.
Oh, we're out of the cheese, babe.
Since when?
Since we finished it.
I didn't finish the cheese, so don't say "we."
I was gonna freeze it for my doula workshop next month.
It's okay.
We don't need cheese.
Someone finished the cheese, I guess.
Yeah, someone was hungry in their house, and they ate cheese.
They ate it all, though.
It's okay.
Have you seen ginnie recently?
Brother.
I certainly have not.
We love ginnie.
Don't get me wrong.
But some of us loved her a little too much, if you know what I mean, and some things got said.
Yeah, some things got said.
You said 'em.
Yeah, I said 'em, all right.
Yeah.
'Cause someone had to say something, 'cause a certain someone in this house wanted to have sex with his daughter.
Okay, what?
Excuse me?
No?
No.
No, Mr. gallo, you know that your daughter is very attractive.
And unfortunately, in this house, that makes certain people very insecure.
Okay, let me translate for Mr. sensitivity over here.
Ginnie was getting a little sick and tired of being leered at every time she went to the fridge.
It was one time, and i was trying to warn her about the bad milk!
Mr. gallo, Martin, ginnie was going for some bad milk in the fridge, so I was peering to see what she was grabbing from the fridge, in order to say, "hey, don't ingest that, yeah.
'Cause you might get sick." I was doing a service.
You're a knight in shining armor, aren't you, gare?
Here's an idea.
Maybe you could sort it out with them at your favorite strip joint...
Ohh!
That happened at a bachelor party!
They're strippers!
They climb all over you!
You can't stop them!
You guys know!
They're-- they're like monkeys at a zoo!
Can't stop 'em.
The monkeys climb all over you at a zoo?
Really?
Interesting zoo.
Okay, we should probably get going.
If you find that address, you could give me a shout, that'd be great.
We'll find it.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
I'm so sorry about the cheese.
You know, it was very expensive cheese.
Jesus, Roberta, he doesn't care about the goddamn cheese.
You, uh, might want to try the cafe.
Martin knows where it is.
She's probably working there.
The cafe?
Roberta:
Yeah.
Great.
Martin?
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
Uh, all right.
Well, thanks, guys.
Thank you for...
That.
All right.
Why do you have to attack me?
Why are you-- have to be so hostile?
And now i completely lost face.
I gotta go apologize for something i didn't even do.
Hey, ma-Martin.
Are we cool, man?
Are we-
- I just want you to know truly-- yeah, no.
Bro, I would never...
Gary, it's fine.
I mean, you know, we're not even--
I know.
We're not, but still, i promise you on my--
I wouldn't-- and, Mr. gallo,
I would never-- okay.
Yeah, good.
I'll rest easy now.
You guys are the best.
Hey, try the cafe.
She's probably there, all right?
Hey, and tell her Gary says, "what's up?"
Okay, so you just wanna go straight until sunset, and then you make a right, and, uh, you can't miss it.
Um, before you drop me off,
I can draw you a little map.
What, are you dora the explorer?
Fuck that.
You're coming with.
Yeah.
I would love to.
Just apparently I have a show coming up, and I really need to rehearse.
I'll pay you, okay?
Pay me?
Uh, no, no.
I don't, um-- you don't, what, need the money?
I beg to differ.
Look, Martin,
I'll be straight with you.
I'm worried here, okay?
This is not like my daughter to just disappear like this.
If you care about her at all,
I would think you would want to know if she's okay or not.
I do.
I do.
Of course I do.
Okay.
Tell me when to turn.
This is where my daughter works?
Yeah.
It's-- it's not that bad.
They got a little gallery now.
It was ginnie's idea, actually.
Really turned the place around.
Nothing.
Two dudes just came in here.
You know this one?
Yeah.
Tracy.
You're the slut.
The old one, maybe.
You're gross.
I have to go.
Call me if it doesn't stop bleeding.
Tracy, hi.
Uh, it's Martin.
Remember me?
No.
Uh, ginnie's boyfriend.
Ex-boyfriend.
Is ginnie working today?
Ginnie doesn't work here anymore.
What?
Since when?
Since none of your business.
I'm her father...
Trying to find her.
Oh.
She quit, like, a month ago, maybe.
Do you know where she's working now?
I think she works at some restaurant.
Lizzie, our manager, would know, but she's at moglu right now.
Moglu?
The yoga place, right, on hyperion?
Did you check her Facebook?
Checked her Facebook.
Twitter?
Twitter.
Yeah.
You tweet something, will you?
Oh, I don't-- i don't Twitter-- or tweet or, you know, twit.
'Course you don't.
Look, um, Tracy, would you mind just putting something out there--
I already did it.
You-- you did what?
I tweeted it.
Great.
What-- what did you tweet?
"Baller old guy, creepy young guy looking for ginnie g.
#random #doable."
I'm creepy?
W-why am I creepy?
I've met her many times, many times.
Yeah.
She seemed like she-- was she stoned?
Is this whole neighborhood stoned?
Uh, maybe she was stoned.
You know, this-- this neighborhood's probably 70% stoned, 80% on a Sunday.
All right, where's the yoga place?
Uh, just that-a-way.
So, uh, where'd you say you were coming from?
Mumbai.
Oh, Mumbai!
Yeah.
Ever been?
Uh, no, no.
But i-I'd like to.
It's a shithole.
Huh.
Huh.
Well, I guess I can, uh, cross that off the list then.
I need to take this.
Okay.
Barry.
Talk to me.
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks again for coming.
Hey, Lizzie.
Martin.
What are you doing here?
Uh...
Please, please do not fuck with my yoga buzz.
No.
No, uh...
I was just wondering-- I've been looking for ginnie.
Martin, Martin, Martin...
Martin, you've got to get over this ginnie thing.
She's moving on.
You should, too.
Uh, what do you mean, she's moving on?
What...
Okay, everything is in place.
Barry, look, my phone is about to die.
Okay, Barry, stop talking.
I don't think this is the best move for you, Martin, but if you need some kind of closure or whatever, she's hostessing at bibola.
Bibola?
What's that?
It's a restaurant, Martin.
It's the new, hot big restaurant in west Hollywood.
Fuck!
My yoga buzz is gone now.
Okay.
Well, thanks for the info, Lizzie.
Shit.
Yeah, Martin, you should know that-- oh, and by the way, good job.
You know, keep it up.
What the hell does that mean, "good job"?
No, I didn't mean it like-- like-- what did you mean?
I mean, like, yoga.
You know, like "good job, yoga."
Uh-huh.
Like, you look great.
Fuck off, Martin.
Okay?
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
You're an asshole.
Stop talking, Barry.
Just do your fucking job, okay?
She said ginnie's working at a restaurant in west Hollywood.
Let's go.
Frank.
Wow.
Kelly.
Hi.
Hi.
It's been a minute.
Are you in town for a visit?
Yeah, just popped in.
You look good.
I'm a sweaty mess, but thank you.
You look good.
How long are you in town for?
Very briefly.
Uh, I'm sorry.
We're late to meet my daughter, so...
Oh.
Oh, I won't-- i won't keep you, then.
Well, it was, uh-- it was good to see you.
You, too.
So if you end up sticking around, give me a shout.
Will do.
Take care, Kelly.
Bye.
You're gonna catch flies there, Kermit.
Come on.
Was that that waitress from that night we all had dinner?
I don't know, maybe.
So what?
No, i-- nothing.
I mean, you know, you must have made quite an impression on her.
Where we going?
Uh, it's just up that-a-way.
That's gotta be the 15th fucking time you said "that-a-way."
Are you hopalong Cassidy?
Who's hopalong Cassidy?
Ha-- get in the car.
I thought there was a little something going on that night.
Forget about it.
No, I know.
I know.
It's none of my business.
She's very attractive.
Yes.
She's an attractive woman.
Okay?
Deal with it.
Very attractive.
So how did that work?
Did she slip you her number-- would you fucking forget about it?
Please?
Jesus.
Okay, okay.
Yeesh.
nice.
Sweet.
You like Bob seger?
Yeah.
I love Bob seger.
"Beautiful loser," "stranger in town,"
those are some of my favorite albums ever.
might be hope for you yet.
Maitre d' says she quit about 10 days ago all of a sudden, has no idea why.
She only worked here two weeks.
That is pretty weird.
Yeah, it is.
Well, want to grab a bite?
Here?
Sure.
Why not?
Gotta refuel, right?
I mean, you must be starving.
Let me buy you dinner.
That's very nice of you.
I guess i am pretty hungry.
Good.
Oh, yeah, ginnie.
Yeah, I love ginnie.
Ginnie's great.
I was bummed when she quit.
But I think maybe she got a better job.
You know where?
I don't.
But I can ask around.
In the meantime, can i get you anything to start?
I think we'll skip straight to the entree.
We're in a bit of a rush.
I'll take the, uh, steak-frites, rare.
I guess I'll have, uh-- you know what?
I'll get what he's getting, uh, the-- the steak.
Excellent.
Rare as well?
Uh, yeah, yeah, rare.
Very good.
This place is pretty, uh, chichi.
Yeah, for you, I guess, eating tofu out of a paper bag or whatever.
That is how i usually eat, actually.
She'll turn up, Mr. gallo.
She will.
Have you, um...
Talked to ginnie's mom?
No.
I was just thinking, uh, maybe she's heard from her.
I don't want to worry her.
Right, but, you know, they're pretty close.
I mean, maybe she knows where she is.
And what if she doesn't?
Then she's in a panic.
And whose fault is that?
Yours?
Well, no, it would be yours, actually, because it's your idea.
Maybe she lost her phone.
If she lost her phone, then she wouldn't get your messages.
Martin, I get that you think I'm being paranoid here, okay?
But believe me, shit happens every day.
Friend of mine's daughter takes a little trip to Europe.
She gets grabbed 20 minutes out of orly.
Jesus.
Yeah.
Lucky for them i know a thing or two about a thing or two.
I was able to get her back.
A thing or two?
I know how to handle a situation like that, let's just say.
Wait.
Like those Liam neeson movies?
What?
You know, those Liam neeson movies.
His-- his daughter gets kidnapped or his wife.
This is not a movie, Martin.
This is life.
What-- what is so funny?
Oh, just, uh-- it just reminds me of-- ginnie could never explain what you do.
It always seemed so mysterious to us.
We used to joke that you were a, uh, um, an arms dealer or something, you know, something badass.
Well, something like that, but not quite so glamorous, I guess.
So what is it that you do, exactly, then?
I'm in procurement.
Okay.
Huh.
Procurement.
So what about you?
How's it going with the music?
Well, I guess I've got that show coming up with my band, but I'm not sure that I want to do it.
Not sure?
Well, what's the issue?
Well, it's been a while, and I guess I've been trying to figure some stuff out actually.
I mean...
Finally hit me.
What's the endgame?
I mean, I'm probably never gonna make...
A real living at it, or at least one decent enough to support a family or...
Are you good at it?
Yeah, I am.
Then you should play the show.
Waiter:
Here we are.
No luck on the ginnie front, I'm sorry to say.
Well, thanks for trying.
You know, it is Thursday, though.
You know, you might want to try rococo.
You know her friend trev?
He's awesome.
He's been djing there every Thursday.
Yeah, I know Trevor.
You know the place?
Enjoy your meal.
Dig in.
You okay there, bub?
It's been a while since I ate meat.
Yeah.
Like how long?
Oh, three...
Maybe five years.
Nobody made you order it.
Tell you what, let's go to that rococo place, get a drink, settle your stomach, huh?
I guess one drink couldn't hurt.
If not, maybe you can point out somebody that knows her, huh?
You're the boss.
Now you're getting it.
This place is impossible.
We're never getting in.
What, are you kidding me?
Come on.
Where are you...
All right.
He's with me.
Have a good night.
How'd you do that?
I spoke the guy's language.
What-- what was it, samoan?
What, you spoke samoan?
Dennis said he hadn't seen her, but you never know.
Dennis?
You spoke to that guy for, like, three seconds.
Martin, look around.
See if you can spot anyone who knows ginnie.
No, I don't know, Mr. gallo.
This really doesn't look like her kind of crowd.
Come on.
Let's get that drink.
Two taliskers, neat.
You got it.
See anything?
No.
There you go.
I think I, uh...
Good.
Hey, Megan.
Oh, my god.
Martin!
Megan!
What the fuck are you doing here?
I'm looking for ginnie, actually.
Oh, Martin, you gotta get over it.
It's so sad, like-- no, I'm-
- I'm over it.
Uh, it's just her dad is looking for her, actually.
Do you-- do you know if she's gonna be here tonight?
What?
Do you know if she's coming here tonight?
Who?
Ginnie!
Get over it, Martin!
'Kay.
Oh, wow.
She's very drunk.
Yeah.
Hey, uh, Lois.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Martin, right?
Yes!
Thank you!
Oh, sorry?
I just, uh-- have you seen ginnie by any chance?
I'm sorry.
Who?
Ginnie, my ex-girlfriend.
Yeah.
No, I haven't seen her.
Sorry.
It's so loud in here.
I know.
It's unbelievably loud in here.
I feel like I'm screaming at you.
It probably looks like we're having a horrible, horrible argument.
Fuck you, you fucking asshole!
I swear to fucking god!
Woman:
Uh, what was that?
I'm sorry.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I was kidding.
It was a joke about arguments.
Oh, man.
Good.
Good.
I probably went too far.
No.
Sorry.
I don't think I've seen her in here for a few weeks.
Is she missing or something?
Something like that.
This one's on the house all right?
Thank you.
You know, you ought to talk to that guy she's seeing.
She's seeing somebody?
Yeah, cute guy, too, a big tipper.
They met here, I think.
You seen him lately?
No.
I haven't seen either of 'em.
Just a second.
So do you come here often?
No, never.
It's a little bit too, like-- axe body spray?
Yes.
Hey, I heard you guys are playing this weekend, right?
Yeah.
Uh...
I don't know if that's gonna happen.
Yeah, I saw you play, like-- like a year ago at the river room.
You were really good, kind of like...
The punch brothers meets, like, the foggy mountain boys meets, like, the muppets.
Yeah, thanks, I think.
That's at least partially what-- exactly what-- man:
Marty?
Hey, Trevor.
They let you in here?
Yeah.
Well, you know, Dennis is a friend, so...
Oh man.
I know this guy!
He's an idiot!
Hey, um, I think my friend is leaving, so I have to go.
Okay.
And if I do play that show, uh, maybe I'll see you there.
Yeah.
Good to see you.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Listen, Trevor, have you seen ginnie recently?
Uh, yeah, I'm just gonna do you a solid and not even answer that, bro.
I don't know what your problem is with me.
Hey, I told you guys about Marty here, right?
He plays old-timey music on his banjo like he's old McDonald or some shit, and, like, 10 people show up.
It's hilarious.
Yeah, well, you know, what's hilarious is, uh, you know, you look like a-- a rapist...
Like you've committed rape.
You know why ginnie dumped you?
'Cause she's way too fine for your hella broke ass.
I kind of want to punch you in the face right now.
You know, Marty, a woman like ginnie, deserves to be given the finer things in life.
And there's a long line of dudes who want to give it to her.
Hey, Martin.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
I was just talking to ginnie's, uh, friend Trevor, just asking him if he's seen ginnie.
And?
And I was telling Marty here that the way that girl's been working through their breakup, she could be facedown in any bed in a 10-mile rad--
Look out!
time to go.
Holy shit.
You flattened that guy out.
I shouldn't have done that.
Oh, fuck that guy.
Never been in a bar fight before.
That was-- that was so amazing when I was like, "look out!"
You're a real lifesaver.
I mean--
I feel like i could have totally held my own, though.
I've got a ton of pent-up rage
I've never gotten to use.
Maybe we should go back.
Gallo:
Simmer down, Mike Tyson.
Oh, shit.
I know that girl.
E'eryone is right now--
Megan?
Where are my keys?
Megan, are-- are you okay?
Why is bri-baby being such a dick-face right now?
Um, i-
- I don't know who that is.
Bri-baby.
Oh, I'm so outta here.
And if he doesn't like it, he can kiss my ass.
Well, uh...
Is this my car?
Well, oh, oh, no.
This my car?
I don't think it's such a good idea for you to be driving right now, Megan.
Well, maybe it's not such a good idea for your face to be a dick right now.
Right.
Okay.
Uh...
Mr. gallo...
Yeah.
Where do you live, Megan?
You know where.
Burger king.
Because we're trying to drive you home.
Oh, I don't want to go home.
I want to go to the par-tay.
Are you still on sweetzer?
I want to go to the party so I can blow Dan Franklin.
Let's get her home, for Dan Franklin's sake.
Yeah, I think she's still on sweetzer.
It's just a right at the next light.
Yeah?
Okay, slow down, Barry.
What the hell do you mean they're backing out?
They--
Barry.
Barry.
Barry.
Fuck.
Fucking phone died.
Perfect.
Take a picture, and post it on bri-baby's Twitter fuck.
you gonna make it upstairs okay?
Where is it?
Where it's at?
We'll-- we'll help you up.
Got it.
Why don't you get rid of Martin so me and you can go to the party and party?
I think you're kind of partied out, kiddo.
Ah, I'm fine.
I had, like, two shots.
I'm fuckin' fine.
I just need to spit.
Megan:
Where are you taking me?
Okay.
All right.
There you go.
Where am I?
Move just a little bit.
Okay.
Drink this.
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
Megan...
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh...
Drink this.
It's gonna make you feel better.
Mm.
I'm not thirsty.
It'll make you feel better, Megan.
Uh-uh.
Drink it.
We can make out if you want.
That's a nice offer, but I'm good.
Mm, 'cause you're so in love with ginnie still.
Well, sure, that, and I think you still have some vomit in your hair.
That's fucked up, dude.
'Cause you know she's in love with someone else.
She is?
Mm-hmm.
Who's that?
Mr. hot stuff.
Mm.
Mr. hot stuff?
Dude's ripped.
That's...
Awesome.
This Mr. hot stuff...
Does he have a name?
Megan?
Megan, what's his name?
M-Megan.
Megan.
Megan.
This girl is friends with my daughter?
Yeah.
This isn't ginnie, Mr. gallo.
She's not like this.
Let me find you a shirt.
What the fuck is going on here?
Hey, uh, no.
Now, um...
What the fuck is going on here?
Hey, relax, okay?
We gave the girl a ride.
That's all.
That's my fucking girlfriend, dude!
Oh, you're, um, bri-baby.
I-I'm Martin.
I'm Martin.
I'm ginnie's ex-boyfriend,
Megan's friend ginnie.
Why is this dude fucking shirtless?
Just relax, bri-baby.
Your girlfriend threw up on me is all.
Tell you what.
We'll just, uh, give you a few dollars for the shirt, and, uh, we'll just--
hey, Martin--
Fuck.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Martin:
Hey!
I think he's-- he's...
Oh, he's breathing.
He's breathing.
Good for him.
Let's get out of here.
That-a-way.
That doesn't look too bad.
Fucking hurts.
How 'bout the smell?
I still smell like vomit?
Little bit.
Oh.
What?
Thanks.
You really had my back up there.
Yeah, well, Mr. gallo-- you can call me frank.
I don't think i can do that, Mr. gallo, but you're welcome.
Megan said ginnie had a new boyfriend.
Yeah.
Mr. hot stuff.
Bartender at the club said the same thing.
Well, so...
We probably won't be finding her tonight, and that's because she's with him.
Look, Martin-- so even if we do find her, find them, how's it gonna look?
I'm tooling around with her dad.
She's shacked up with her new boyfriend.
So she's dating someone else.
So what?
I mean, don't you still want to know that she's okay?
Aren't you at all worried that none of the people we talked to tonight know where she is?
Of course I'm worried about her.
Because I thought you still cared about her.
Of course I still care about her!
She broke my heart!
Has that not been spelled out enough for you tonight?
Your daughter fucked my shit up.
My life has been a complete wreck for the last three months.
I mean, I can't eat.
I can't think straight.
I can't play music.
All I've literally been able to do...
Is sleep.
So what do you want to do, go home?
Yes.
Crawl into bed, sleep some more?
Yes, that's exactly what I wanna do.
Martin, I get it.
I do, but...
It's a fucking terrible feeling.
It sucks, but...
I don't think retreating into your shell is doing you a lot of good.
Listen, I'm telling you this from personal experience, okay?
Life goes by really fast.
If you half-ass it now, you're gonna feel it later.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Where to now?
There you go, juicy.
Since we're, um, exploring our options-- and I know this is a sensitive area, but maybe you could try calling ginnie's mom.
I'm not calling ginnie's mother, period.
End of story.
End of story.
Okay, but I was thinking-- all right.
So why'd you and ginnie break up?
You know that prizewinning douchebag
Trevor back at the club, he was saying that ginnie is out of my league.
She's an amazing girl, as you obviously know.
She's smart, beautiful, funny, and tough.
Yeah, and, um...
She is out of my league.
Well...
Maybe she saw something you don't.
Maybe she did, but I started to get insecure about it, and then I got jealous and moody.
I don't know.
It was my fault.
I just--
I fucked it up.
I fucked it all up.
We all fuck it up sometimes.
There it is.
So procurement, what is that?
Forget about it.
No, no.
I'm curious, really.
I bid on contracts from foreign governments to procure for them anything they need in bulk, grain, seed, fertilizer, fucking nuts and bolts, what have you.
Ah.
Okay.
Procurement.
Actually, figuring how to get 20 tons of corn feed from Germany to Nigeria can be more exciting than it might sound like.
But it's also...
Just not a normal lifestyle, you know?
Makes it harder to see my daughter, for example.
hey, you know that other girl at the club?
What girl?
What do you mean, "what girl?"
The one I saw you talking to.
She's into you.
What, Lois?
Wait.
How-- how did you even-- you weren't even there.
Jesus, Martin, wake up.
90% of that shit is body language, okay?
She's into you.
Wow, really?
Huh, Lois.
I just...
You gotta be kidding me.
Gary?
Hey!
Hey, how's it going, guys?
Hey, did you find ginnie?
Was she at the cafe?
No.
Aw, bummer.
Bummer.
You don't think she got kidnapped, do you?
No!
Jesus, Gary!
Hey, does Roberta know you're here?
Yeah.
Yeah, no.
She sent me out for groceries.
Um, I had to replace the cheese.
Yeah, so how's that going, the grocery shopping?
I don't know.
I think I just, um, needed...
Air.
Yeah, 'cause actually, uh...
I don't know if you guys noticed, but Roberta and i have actually been having a lot of problems lately.
No shit?
Really?
No idea.
Apparently, the sight of my face nauseates her is what she told me verbatim.
Mm.
Sorry to hear that, gare.
Thanks.
Uh, how 'bout if i buy you another one?
Yeah!
Yeah, man!
Now we're talking!
Definitely!
Yeah, one more for our friend.
One more.
Yeah, on him.
He's--
I got it.
On him, yeah.
Bartender:
All right.
Mm.
Always tastes better when it's free.
Heh.
It does, though, a little bit.
Yeah, no, i remember those days.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
God.
Okay, back to business.
What do we know about this guy, Mr. hot stuff?
Mr. who?
Ginnie's got a new boyfriend.
Really?
Damn it.
For you, man.
Damn it.
That sucks for you.
We know he's a regular at the club.
Bartender says he's a big tipper.
And he's ripped, apparently.
So he goes to the gym, frequents nightclubs, likes to throw his money around, maybe act like a big shot.
Sounds like an asshole.
This is what I'm saying.
I smell a rat here.
Hmm.
What about with Martin?
Did you smell a rat when you met him?
No, no rat.
Field mouse, maybe.
Field mouse.
Hah hah.
He's right.
You're a field mouse, bro.
This is great.
This is what I'm talking about.
This is just guys being guys, drinking beer, and busting balls.
"Field mouse."
Mm.
Mm-mmm.
Next round is on me.
I insist.
You've been more than generous, Mr. gallo.
Got an emergency 20 in here somewhere.
No way.
Ohh.
I been looking for this, my 'shrooms.
You guys want some?
Huh?
Hey, we should do these together, go camping.
Joshua tree.
You should probably put those away, like, now.
Wait.
Japanese paper.
Gary:
Hey, man.
Gary, you dumbass, drug-addled son of a bitch,
I could kiss you right now.
Okay, but we should wait 'til after we eat the 'shrooms.
Are you kidding me?
Are you just completely out to lunch?
Martin, who cares?
We have ginnie's address.
Come on.
Let's go.
No, no, no, no.
We've been searching for ginnie all day and night all over town while her address has been sitting in his pocket, wrapping his stupid 'shrooms!
Martin, man, i-I'm really sorry.
I am, but you just--
Martin, come on.
Let it go.
Field mouse, huh?
Hey, guys, wait.
Can I come?
Gary:
Whoo-hoo!
This is great, really.
Really great, man.
Call to adventure, you know?
We're on the case.
Oh, you know what it's-- it's, um-- it's like that movie, that movie...
John Wayne--
Whoa!
Whuhh!
Mr. gallo, you sure you're okay to drive?
Sound like my ex.
"The searchers."
"The searchers." That's it.
Ah, man, that's an awesome movie.
Hey, do either of you have any weed on you?
I don't like to 'shroom without a little weed.
You know, I bet i can get my dealer to come meet us.
What's the, um-- Gary...
We're not gonna have your weed dealer meet us at my daughter's place.
Right.
No, right.
Right.
Um...
Oh, shit.
Sycamore, right?
What's the address?
1030 sycamore.
Terri sadler.
That's her roommate, right?
Yeah, that's her.
She's the-- the jittery girl.
You know her, right?
No, but keep asking.
Ohh!
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
I can't get unbuckled.
Gary, just stay with the car.
Mm-hmm.
Windows are dark.
Yeah, well, some people are actually asleep after midnight.
Okay.
When you and ginnie lived together, where did you hide the spare key?
Where?
Um, that's not really, um-- that's kind of private.
Martin, I'm not gonna rob you.
What am I gonna take, your bong?
Where did you hide the key?
It was under a rock, but...
What-- what are you gonna-- no, you're not gonna-- it's okay.
I'm her father.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mr. gallo, you are not--
Martin, I need to see if my daughter is in trouble.
Okay, this is a very bad idea.
You know what, Martin?
I'm starting to see why ginnie kicked you to the curb.
Oh, are you?
And why's that?
Yeah.
'Cause you're a namby-pamby, little fucking pain in the ass.
Now move it.
No.
Seriously?
Martin, you do not want to be standing in my fucking way right now.
Fine.
That's what I thought.
Fuck this.
Shit.
Gary:
Because it's-- it's frustrating, 'cause you don't trust me like I trust you!
Because all you wanna do is sit around watching "game of thrones"
and fantasize about Jaime lannister!
You do!
You want to bang the shit out of Jaime lannister!
That's fine!
I don't get mad at you, because I get it!
Even with one hand, he's beautiful!
Hello.
Anybody home?
Shit.
Woman:
Hello.
Mr. gallo.
I think ginnie's room's over here.
Thank fucking god.
What the fuck?
Wait.
Hold on.
I found out where ginnie is.
Where?
She went on vacation with her new boyfriend.
His name is kip.
Kip.
Yeah.
I think it sounds pretty serious.
Gary:
And guess what, babe.
'Member those 'shrooms you wouldn't let me take on Halloween?
Well, trick or treat, 'cause I'm taking 'em right now.
Mmm.
Delicious.
I can eat 'shrooms.
I can eat sun chips.
I can eat fucking cheese, because I'm my own man.
I have something inside of me.
I have potential.
I-- hello.
Hel-- all right, it's Gary.
Call me back.
wait a minute.
How do you know where she is?
Don't get mad.
Terri:
Hello?
Is someone there?
Hello?
Shh.
Uh...
Hi...
There.
This is--
No, no, no.
It's...
What is this girl's name?
Um, Tammy, Toni, uh...
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Frank:
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.
You know him.
Run!
I will fucking murder you!
You don't know her?
No.
I don't fucking know her.
Terri:
I will fucking kill you!
Do you hear that, you motherfucker?
!
I have a gun!
You motherfucker, i will...
What do we do?
No way.
No way.
Come on.
...fucking calling the motherfucking cops on you!
I am not getting arrested tonight.
Wait.
Oh.
So beautiful.
I know how you found out ginnie's on vacation.
You called her mom.
Yeah, that's right.
I did.
I called Connie, who actually talks to ginnie and cares about what's going on in her life and knows where the hell she is.
You had no right to do that.
I told you I didn't want to worry her.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
We should have called 12 hours ago.
Like, then, maybe you wouldn't have home invaded.
It's complicated, okay?
I didn't do right by ginnie's mom.
I...
Fucked around when ginnie was little.
Yeah, it's old news.
I've heard all about it, believe me.
You got a lot of nerve talking to me like that.
Ginnie's mom is fine, Mr. gallo.
She's happily remarried.
She got over it years ago.
Ginnie did, too.
Freeze!
Stop right there!
I'm gonna let it shine.
I'm gonna let it shine.
I'm gonna let it shine.
I'm shining my light!
This is the police.
Don't move.
Just to be clear, I've always been there for my daughter.
I gave her everything she wanted.
How 'bout your attention?
Oh, sh...
Fuck.
Hi.
We, uh-- could we use your bathroom?
Toilet is for customers only.
Uh, here.
Come on.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sorry.
Look, uh, my fault.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Come on.
Let's go.
Both of you, on the ground now!
This day is never-ending.
What is this?
I'm sure it's nothing, babe.
It's fine.
No, kip, they're directly in front of my house.
Okay, look, officers, it's-- it's just really a big misunderstanding.
Stop right there, and get down!
Just calm down for a second.
I can explain the whole thing.
That was my daughter's apartment.
On the ground!
Mr. gallo, get down now.
I will not.
I am an upstanding citizen.
I am a taxpayer.
I am a-- dad?
Ginnie?
Ginnie?
Gary, stop.
Tastes like glass.
All I wanted was to make it through this breakup in one piece, not be desperate or stalkery or pathetic.
I just needed to wait it out, get to the other side with my pride intact.
instead, I became my ex-girlfriend's father's idiot lackey, everyone she knows in this town getting an eyeful of what a loser I am.
Ah, Martin, you're not a loser.
Oh, not to mention-- not to mention the throwing up, the bar brawl, breaking and entering my ex-girlfriend's new home, running from the police--
I really don't need a recap, okay?
I was there.
Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, just shut the fuck up, okay?
!
Just shut the fuck up!
Couple of weeks ago in my hotel in Mumbai,
I woke up in the middle of the night soaked in sweat, didn't know where I was.
I didn't know who I was for a second.
My heart was just going...
Thousand miles a minute.
I mean, i-
- I thought i was gonna die.
I called down to the front desk and-- and asked 'em to send up a doctor.
And then I'm-- I'm just lying there, thinking, "this is it,"
you know, "this is-- this is it."
And so I called ginnie...
And ginnie wasn't there.
And of course the doctor shows up, and he-- and he checks everything out.
He says it's not a heart attack.
It's not-- it's nothing.
It's a fucking panic attack.
Just ridiculous...
Embarrassing.
I'm at the airport the next morning, and, uh...
No, it's not like there's a layover here.
I'm supposed to be in Geneva right now.
But I came here, because...
Because I needed to see my little girl.
I have no one else, Martin.
You know?
She's all I got.
Hey, you guys, you guys, you guys, you guys...
Can we just be serious for one moment?
Okay, can we just...
Talk real shit?
Visitor for Gary...
"Fulenwilder"?
Huh?
I'm Gary.
Roberta.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my poor, poor baby.
Oh, yeah.
What a night you've had.
Baby, I see your light.
It's, like, blue.
Your aura is blue, like an "avatar" thing.
Ho ho.
You know,
I actually believed you, that you were going to the store to replace the cheese because you felt bad about it.
No, no, no.
Not my gare.
My gare's not that kind of boyfriend, is he?
Ow.
Ow.
Ow...
He's more of a call you from jail at 4:00 A.M.
Because I'm tripping my balls off kind of guy.
Ow.
Uh, honey, your aura's turning, like, dark red now.
Good.
Here's the drill.
You're gonna stay here until your arraignment...
Uh-huh.
Which is in two days, and you're gonna sit and think about whether you want to come home or be your own man and let your light shine down.
I want-- i want to come home.
I want to come home.
I know you do, honey, but that's because you're scared and stupid right now, so you just sit tight, and sleep on it, okay?
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Okay.
Nice work, guys.
Gary:
I love you!
All right, you two.
Looks like your lawyer has saved your ass.
Ginnie.
What the hell, dad?
I know.
Look, I was worried.
You hadn't returned voice mails or e-mails.
I was on vacation, and I tried to call you back as soon as I got off the plane.
Right.
And of course then my phone was dead, so...
So you thought it would be a good idea to break into my house with my ex-boyfriend?
Look, I'm sorry, okay, but what are you doing running off without telling anybody and not answering your phone?
We were in bora bora trying to unplug, and I told mom.
Jesus.
Dad, this is kip.
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
How do you do?
I-I'm sorry about the misunderstanding.
It's my fault.
That's very generous of you, but I'm pretty sure it's all my fault.
Hey.
Kip.
Uh, I'm Martin.
Well, uh, since we have your father's rental car, you want to-- want to take him back to the hotel?
I'll take our car.
I'll meet you there?
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm gonna go.
It was nice to meet everybody.
I guess I'll-- I'm gonna be going, too.
Um, ginnie, I'm so sorry about everything.
It was really nice to see you, though.
Martin.
Martin!
Look, ginnie,
I'm truly-- no, no, no.
You don't have to apologize.
I know how persuasive my dad can be.
Well, yeah, but go easy on the guy, huh?
I think he's been in a pretty rough place lately.
I'll try.
How are you?
You know, uh...
How have you been?
I actually applied to ucla, architecture and urban design, and I got in.
Wow.
That's great.
That's what you've always wanted.
That's-- that's great.
I found out last week, and bora bora was kip's congratulation gift.
I'm sorry that you had to find out about him like this.
I didn't know if I should call.
Ah, no.
Kip seems great, ginnie.
And you, you seem...
You seem really happy.
And I'm happy for you.
Your head hurt?
Little bit.
Good.
Look, ginnie--
I don't want to hear it, dad.
Hey, you didn't tell me you were thinking about going back to school.
You're not in my life.
Okay?
You are never here.
When are you gonna understand that you don't get a say in what I do or where I go or who with?
Look...
You're my dad, and I love you...
And I do know that you love me.
Why do you have to be such an asshole?
I don't know.
Why is the sky blue?
Jimothy:
No, no, no.
Ah, no, no, no, no.
Jimothy...
I'm trying to beat this level, dawg.
Have some respect.
We need to talk.
Well, I'm busy.
And after i beat this level,
I'm gonna do more drugs, have more sex with this very attractive couple, and then sleep for 16 hours, so pencil you in after that.
Hey, it's time for you to move now.
Get your shit, and go.
Listen, man-- you're 30 days past due on rent, so consider it an eviction.
You're done.
This is mine.
You know, I find your newfound confidence intoxicating.
What if we...
Figured out a different way to pay rent...
A physical way?
Connie:
Hello.
Hey, Connie.
I hope it's okay i called.
Frank?
Mr. gallo.
Jesus.
Would you please fucking call me frank already?
Thanks for coming, frank.
That's nice stuff up there.
Seriously, really, really good.
I enjoyed it.
Ah, thanks.
I thought you were, uh-- had to be in Geneva.
I figured I'd stick around here, spend a little time with my daughter.
You want a beer?
Sure.
You know, Martin, you went to the mat for me in a big way.
I appreciate it.
Well, I mean...
I won't forget it.
Looks like you got a fan there.
Who?
Oh, Lois?
Yeah, I, uh...
Martin, would you please open your eyes?
That girl is clearly here for you.
We met up before the show.
Did you, now?
Yeah.
You were right about that whole body-language thing.
Look at you.
I am impressed.
Uh...
I should probably go say hi before the second set.
I think you should.
Are you gonna be...
I'm totally good.
Okay.
Um...
Martin...
Get over there.
they sound real good tonight.
Yeah.
You Martin's dad?
His dad?
No, no, no.
No, I'm, uh... whoo!

Jesus.
You'll tell him you were the reason we're late, right?
Come on.
I don't...
I don't want him to think I don't care about time and stuff.
There's my girl.
There's my Dad.
Dad, this is my boyfriend Martin.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Martin.
Uh, Mr. Gallo.
I'm Martin.
You're Mr. Gallo.
I know that.
Nice to meet you, Martin.
Fuck.
It's really good to see you.
You look great.
You look tired.
Where you coming from this time?
- Singapore.
- Ah.
Ever been?
No, I haven't been.
Uh, I...
I hear it's very, um, clean, which I like.
I also hear that they cane you if you spit in the street.
Uh, not that I like that.
Yeah, I don't like that part.
Good evening.
Can I bring you something to drink?
Shall we start with a nice bottle of red?
Uh, Martin has a sulfite allergy.
A sulfite allergy?
Um, it's not that bad, actually.
I just get a little, uh, Hivey.
But I'm fine with water or death.
Okay.
Uh, we'll have a bottle of the Chateauneuf-Du-Pape.
Excellent choice.
And, Martin, are you sure?
Nothing?
Maybe a beer?
Or are you allergic to hops?
Heh.
You sure you don't want something else, Martin?
Mm.
Oh, no.
This is delicious.
These beets are really well steamed.
I'm sorry.
I gotta take this.
He hates me.
He doesn't hate you.
He hates me.
He hates me so much, I'm starting to hate myself.
All that matters is what I think, and I'm a fan.
Yeah?
Big fan.
Huge fan.
All right.
Okay, I got this.
I'll bounce back.
Round two.
Sorry about that.
It's, uh, not a problem.
Looks like a, uh, pretty major deal just went down over there by the bar, huh?
So, Martin, what is it that you do?
Uh, Dad, I told you Martin is a musician.
Right.
Right.
What is it, the, uh, ukulele?
Uh, it's the, uh, banjo.
Banjo.
Right, like Kermit the Frog.
- Heh.
- I guess I assumed the banjo was a hobby.
Well, I have a band,
Hysterical Kindness.
It's a bluegrass collective, more Flatt and Scruggs or Punch Brothers than some, you know, poppy Mumford Sonskindof wannabething.
What's wrong with Mumford Sons?
They're a very successful act, no?
He likes Mumford Sons.
So where you from?
Well, I was born in Chicago, uh, but I grew up in Guelph.
Guelph?
Uh, Guelph, Ontario.
- Guelph?
- It's, uh...
Canada.
Guelph?
Okay.
Your folks, what do they do?
Jesus, Dad, what is with the third degree?
Third degree?
I'm just getting to know the guy.
You don't mind, do you, Martin?
No.
No, no.
It's great.
It's great getting to know someone this, you know, vigorously.
So your parents?
Oh.
Right.
Um... my mother is an acupuncturist in Toronto, and my father is an, um...
He's an environmental activist in Albuquerque.
He's an environmental activist in Albuquerque, Dad.
Deal with it.
I didn't say anything.
I'm sure it's very satisfying work.
He never met a tree that he didn't want to chain himself to.
Sweetie, you have a little, um, salad dressing.
Oh.
Oops.
Oh.
Mr. Gallo,
I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.
Could tonight's dinner have gone any worse?
Actually, it could have.
Mm, I guess he could have castrated me at the table.
Last time I introduced Dad to a boyfriend,
I never heard from the guy again, so...
Wow.
When I disappear next, ask your Dad where my body's buried, just as, you know, like, a courtesy to my Mom.
Martin, I know he's tough.
But you're not gonna have to deal with him.
I probably won't see him for another year, so...
Oh.
In that case, I think we should make a plan to see him sooner than that.
You'd be up for that?
Absolutely.
I would go through that hell all over again for you.
Coming.
I'm coming.
Mr. Gallo?
Ginnie home?
Home?
Uh, no.
No.
I mean, uh, she may be home, but, uh...
Ginnie doesn't live here anymore.
We broke up.
Okay.
Want to invite me in?
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, of course.
Sorry.
I was just, uh, getting some work done.
She didn't tell you when we, uh, broke up?
We haven't spoken since Christmas.
Ah.
Well, I guess you could call her, you know, to get her, uh, new address to go there.
She's not picking up or returning calls or texts.
I was hoping maybe she'd be here.
Oh, I just, uh...
I just had a little, uh, get-together last month, so-
Don't worry about it.
Just cleaning, anyway.
Yeah.
So, uh, any idea where I could find my daughter?
Did you try Gary and Roberta?
Gary and Roberta?
Yeah.
When she moved out, she went to go stay with them.
Do you want any coffee?
Uh, that's... that's okay.
Don't bother.
I'm just gonna make some anyway.
So, uh...
So when did you two break up?
Uh, about three months ago.
Three months and nine days or something.
I don't...
You know, I'm not, uh...
I'm sure she's, uh...
You said she, uh...
She knew you were coming in to town?
I gave her the heads-up I was coming in last minute, but I never got a response.
Huh.
No, no.
This is...
This is Jimothy, uh, is my new roommate.
Gotcha.
Jimothy.
Like Timothy with a
No.
Jimothy, this is Mr. Gallo,
Ginnie's Dad.
Who?
Ex-girlfriend's father.
Do you have the bong?
What?
I, uh...
I don't know what you mean?
What do you mean by that?
The bong, thing I smoke weed out of all day.
Oh, is that... is that...
is that what this is?
I was" Yeah, I was looking earlier.
I just didn't...
I was curious.
You're giving me a real Stressy Vibe, man.
- Uh...
- You stressed out?
- What's going on?
- J-Jimothy.
Could you just, um... just take your weird machine there and just let Mr. Gallo and I talk?
Am I wrong?
Is he giving you a Stressy vibe?
You're not wrong.
Yeah.
I'm having people over tonight, in case you want to hide in your room again.
You can come.
I thought" You know, I thought we said, uh... we agreed, you know, last time, you know, with...
with the Cops...
Oh, so I'm not allowed to have people over in my own home?
No, it's cool.
Whatever.
Oh, did you get my message?
What message?
The fiddle player in your band or something came by, wanted you to know you had a show this weekend or something.
Wait.
What do you mean?
We have a show?
I think so.
Well, did he say when or where?
Didn't say when.
Didn't say where.
You know, I'm not...
Heh.
He's not...
We're not...
We're not friends.
- None of my business.
- W-We're just friends.
Okay.
When Ginnie moved out, I needed a new roommate to help cover the rent.
Of course, yeah.
You don't wanna let go of a prime piece of real estate like this.
Yeah.
No, these crossbeams, you don't always...
Oh.
Oh, I'll go get that coffee.
Look, Martin, I can see you're, uh, a busy man here.
Tomorrow I have to get on a flight to Geneva.
All I want to do is find my daughter, so if you can just point me to her new place,
I'll get out of your hair.
Uh, we're all out of milk.
And sugar.
Uh, but we have syrup.
You want syrup in your coffee, or is that... is that weird?
I don't want syrup.
Thanks.
Okay.
So do you have an address for this Gary and Roberta?
Uh, no, but they're not too far from here.
Uh, I don't have an address, but I've been over there.
- So it's close?
- Yeah.
Yes, it's just a couple blocks that-a-way.
Okay.
You want to get dressed, and you can take me over there?
NOW?
Yes, now, Martin.
Do you mind?
Fuck.
Fuck this.
Hey, Martin, do you mind if I go on this computer for a minute, check e-mails?
Um, yeah, sure.
Go ahead.
Fuck.
Uh, wait!
H-Hold on!
Why don't you just...
Holy shit!
Uh, you know, I just...
I tell Jimothy not to use my computer, but he does.
Look, Martin, porn is porn, you know, but you gotta hide that shit.
- Put it in a folder or something.
- Yeah.
Can't just leave it hanging out there.
You know, I...
I can't even believe that they have sites like that on the Internet.
Uh, those poor women.
Okay, you want to put on some pants so we can hit the road?
Here.
You know where we're going.
You drive.
Ahh.
Wasn't ready for that.
Actually, I don't drive.
What do you mean, you don't drive?
Ah, I don't have my license.
And, uh, also I don't know how.
Nice throw.
How can you not know how to drive in Los Angeles?
A man should know how to drive.
I have a bicycle.
Oh, well, congrats on that.
Yeah, it's actually considered very masculine in the Netherlands.
You know, hey, I haven't really been in touch with Ginnie recently,
- so...
- So?
- So I might not come in.
- Fine by me.
You know, not that we're not friends.
You know, we're still friends.
I think we're still friends.
We're still friends on Facebook.
That...
Martin, where are we going?
Oh, uh, it's just up ahead that-a-way and a second left at the light.
It's one of these.
I can never tell which.
They all look the same.
Voice mail's still full.
It's gotta be this one.
I hear fighting.
This is definitely it.
Okay, well, write it down, like, on the dry erase!
'Cause Saturday's my day!
Shit.
Hey.
Hey, how's it going, man?
- Um...
- Gary.
- Yeah, hey, Martin.
- Hi.
Sorry to just drop by like this.
Yeah, it... it really is...
We're looking for my daughter.
- Ginnie.
- Oh.
This is her father, Mr. Gallo.
Uh, he didn't have her new address.
She, um...
Martin, hi.
Oh.
Uh, they... they're looking for Ginnie, babe.
Um, this is Ginnie's Dad.
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
I'm Roberta.
So great to finally meet you.
Jack, right?
That would be Ginnie's stepfather.
Right.
Well, don't worry.
She's talked a lot about you, too.
Did you invite them in?
I literally just opened the door.
Come in.
Come in.
Yeah, come on in.
Yeah.
After you.
Yeah, welcome, welcome.
Mi Casa...
Heh heh.
Uh, could I get you something to drink?
Water or Kombucha?
Twig tea?
I have some nice Biodynamic Wine.
Don't bother.
Please, we're just looking for Ginnie.
Martin said she was staying here.
She was staying here.
Uh, she left about three weeks ago.
Did you try her cell?
I can try her cell.
Phone is off, mailbox full for a couple days now.
Oh, man, sounds to me like she's living off the grid, you know?
Martin, was Ginnie, like, a survivalist, you know?
Like one of those Preppers
- or...
- Gary, stop talking.
Do you know where she moved when she left here?
Yes.
Um...
Ohh.
Ahh.
What was her name?
Martin, you know her.
Um, the jittery girl.
Always looks like she's about to cry.
You know her.
Mm, doesn't, uh, ring a bell.
Okay, did Ginnie leave an address?
Yes.
I think it's on the fridge.
Uh, Gary, could you get it, please?
Please come in.
Uh, I'm not seeing it.
- It's on the fridge!
- No, it isn't!
It's definitely on the fridge.
I just checked there.
Jesus.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
There's no address on the fridge.
It's on the Japanese paper.
Yeah, no.
I know you think it's there,
- but it's not there.
- On the Japanese paper.
Christ.
Get out of my way.
Fine.
I don't know how to look.
It's not there.
You sure you guys don't want anything, like a...
like a beer?
Sure.
I could do a beer.
Ah, you know, uh,
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Uh, how have you been, Gary?
I've been, um... work's good.
Work's good.
Yeah.
Gary, where's the tub where we, uh, keep the receipts?
What tub?
I...
I don't know.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
I need to help her out.
What tub are you ta...
The tin?
That's a tin.
That's not a tub.
- Tub, tin, whatever.
- No, I don't know.
Can I help you find what you're looking for?
Go...
Go check the drawer.
What drawer?
The odds-and-ends drawer.
All right, I'm just saying be specific.
We'll find it.
Can I get you guys something?
Are you sure?
Something to drink or cheese?
We have nice cheese.
Oh, we're out of the cheese, babe.
Since when?
Since we finished it.
I didn't finish the cheese, so don't say "we."
I was gonna freeze it for my Doula workshop next month.
It's okay.
We don't need cheese.
Someone finished the cheese, I guess.
Yeah, someone was hungry in their house, and they ate cheese.
They ate it all, though.
It's okay.
Have you seen Ginnie recently?
Brother.
I certainly have not.
We love Ginnie.
Don't get me wrong.
But some of us loved her a little too much, if you know what I mean, and some things got said.
Yeah, some things got said.
You said 'em.
- Yeah, I said 'em, all right.
- Yeah.
'Cause someone had to say something, 'cause a certain someone in this house wanted to have sex with his daughter.
- Okay, what?
- Excuse me?
- No?
- No.
No, Mr. Gallo, you know that your daughter is very attractive.
And unfortunately, in this house, that makes certain people very insecure.
Okay, let me translate for Mr. Sensitivity over here.
Ginnie was getting a little sick and tired of being leered at every time she went to the fridge.
It was one time, and I was trying to warn her about the bad milk!
Mr. Gallo, Martin, Ginnie was going for some bad milk in the fridge, so I was peering to see what she was grabbing from the fridge, in order to say, "Hey, don't ingest that, Yeah.
'Cause you might get sick." I was doing a service.
You're a knight in shining armor, aren't you, Gare?
Here's an idea.
Maybe you could sort it out with them at your favorite strip joint...
Ohh!
That happened at a bachelor party!
They're strippers!
They climb all over you!
You can't stop them!
You guys know!
They're...
They're like monkeys at a zoo!
Can't stop 'em.
The monkeys climb all over you at a zoo?
Really?
Interesting zoo.
Okay, we should probably get going.
If you find that address, you could give me a shout, that'd be great.
We'll find it.
- Don't worry.
- Thank you.
I'm so sorry about the cheese.
You know, it was very expensive cheese.
Jesus, Roberta, he doesn't care about the goddamn cheese.
You, uh, might want to try the cafe.
Martin knows where it is.
She's probably working there.
- The cafe?
- Yeah.
Great.
Martin?
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
Uh, all right.
Well, thanks, guys.
Thank you for... that.
All right.
Why do you have to attack me?
Why are you... have to be so hostile?
And now I completely lost face.
I gotta go apologize for something I didn't even do.
Hey, Ma-Martin.
Are we cool, man?
Are we...
I just want you to know
- truly...
- Yeah, no.
Bro, I would never...
Gary, it's fine.
I mean, you know, we're not even...
I know.
We're not, but still, I promise you on my...
I wouldn't... and, Mr. Gallo,
- I would never...
- Okay.
Yeah, good.
I'll rest easy now.
You guys are the best.
Hey, try the cafe.
She's probably there, all right?
Hey, and tell her Gary says, "What's up?"
Okay, so you just wanna go straight until Sunset,
Okay, so you just wanna go straight until Sunset, and then you make a right, and, uh, you can't miss it.
Um, before you drop me off,
I can draw you a little map.
What, are you Dora the Explorer?
Fuck that.
You're coming with.
Yeah.
I would love to.
Just apparently I have a show coming up, and I really need to rehearse.
I'll pay you, okay?
Pay me?
Uh, no, no.
I don't, um...
You don't, what, need the money?
I beg to differ.
Look, Martin,
I'll be straight with you.
I'm worried here, okay?
This is not like my daughter to just disappear like this.
If you care about her at all,
I would think you would want to know if she's okay or not.
I do.
I do.
Of course I do.
Okay.
Tell me when to turn.
This is where my daughter works?
Yeah.
It's...
It's not that bad.
They got a little gallery now.
It was Ginnie's idea, actually.
Really turned the place around.
Nothing.
Two dudes just came in here.
You know this one?
Yeah.
Tracy.
You're the slut.
The old one, maybe.
You're gross.
I have to go.
Call me if it doesn't stop bleeding.
Tracy, hi.
Uh, it's Martin.
Remember me?
No.
Uh, Ginnie's boyfriend.
Ex-boyfriend.
Is Ginnie working today?
Ginnie doesn't work here anymore.
What?
Since when?
Since none of your business.
I'm her father... trying to find her.
Oh.
She quit, like, a month ago, maybe.
Do you know where she's working now?
I think she works at some restaurant.
Lizzie, our manager, would know, but she's at Moglu right now.
Moglu?
The yoga place, "QM.
On Hyperion?
Did you check her Facebook?
- Checked her Facebook.
- Twitter?
Twitter.
Yeah.
You tweet something, will you?
Oh, I don't...
I don't twitter... or tweet or, you know, twit.
'Course you don't.
Look, um, Tracy, would you mind just putting something out there...
- I already did it.
- You...
You did what?
I tweeted it.
Great.
What...
What did you tweet?
"Baller old guy, creepy young guy looking for Ginnie G. #random #doable."
I'm creepy?
Why am I creepy?
I've met her many times, many times.
Yeah.
She seemed like she...
Was she stoned?
Is this whole neighborhood stoned?
Uh, maybe she was stoned.
You know, this... this neighborhood's probably 70% stoned, 80% on a Sunday.
All right, where's the yoga place?
Uh, just that-a-way.
So, uh, where'd you say you were coming from?
Mumbai.
Oh, Mumbai!
Yeah.
Ever been?
Uh, no, no.
But I-I'd like to.
It's a shithole.
Huh.
Huh.
Well, I guess I can, uh, cross that off the list then.
I need to take this.
Okay.
Barry.
Talk to me.
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks again for coming.
Hey, Lizzie.
Martin.
What are you doing here?
- Uh...
- Please, please do not fuck with my yoga buzz.
No.
No, uh...
I was just wondering...
I've been looking for Ginnie.
Martin, Martin, Martin...
Oh.
No.
No, no.
Martin, you've got to get over this Ginnie thing.
She's moving on.
You should, too.
Uh, what do you mean, she's moving on?
What...
Okay, everything is in place.
Barry, look, my phone is about to die.
Okay, Barry, stop talking.
I don't think this is the best move for you, Martin, but if you need some kind of closure or whatever, she's hostessing at Bibola.
Bibola?
What's that?
It's a restaurant, Martin.
It's the new, hot big restaurant in West Hollywood.
Fuck!
My yoga buzz is gone now.
- Okay.
Well, thanks for the info, Lizzie.
- Shit.
Yeah, Martin, you should know that...
Oh, and by the way, good job.
You know, keep it up.
What the hell does that mean, "Good job"?
No, I didn't mean it like...
like...
- What did you mean?
- I mean, like, yoga.
You know, like "Good job, yoga."
- Uh-huh.
- Like, you look great.
Fuck off, Martin.
Okay?
- Absolutely.
Yeah.
- Thank you.
Good-bye.
You're an asshole.
You're an asshole.
Stop talking, Barry.
Just do your fucking job, okay?
So?
She said Ginnie's working at a restaurant in West Hollywood.
Let's go.
Frank.
- Wow.
- Kelly.
Hi.
Hi.
It's been a minute.
Are you in town for a visit?
Yeah, just popped in.
You look good.
I'm a sweaty mess, but thank you.
You look good.
How long are you in town for?
Very briefly.
Uh, I'm sorry.
We're late to meet my daughter, so...
Oh.
Oh, I won't...
I won't keep you, then.
Well, it was, uh... it was good to see you.
You, too.
So if you end up sticking around,
- give me a shout.
- Will do.
- Take care, Kelly.
- Bye.
You're gonna catch flies there, Kermit.
Come on.
Was that that waitress from that night we all had dinner?
I don't know, maybe.
So what?
No, I...
Nothing.
I mean, you know, you must have made quite an impression on her.
- Where we going?
- Uh, it's just up that-a-way.
That's gotta be the 15th fucking time you said "that-a-way."
Are you Hopalong Cassidy?
Who's Hopalong Cassidy?
Ha...
Get in the car.
I thought there was a little something going on that night.
Forget about it.
No, I know.
I know.
It's none of my business.
She's very attractive.
Yes.
She's an attractive woman.
Okay?
Deal with it.
Very attractive.
So how did that work?
Did she slip you her number...
Would you fucking forget about it?
Please?
- Jesus.
- Okay, okay.
Yeesh.

Nice.
Sweet.

Yeah.

Maitre d' says she quit about 10 days ago all of a sudden, has no idea why.
She only worked here two weeks.
That is pretty weird.
Yeah, it is.
Well, want to grab a bite?
Here?
Sure.
Why not?
Gotta refuel, right?
I mean, you must be starving.
Let me buy you dinner.
That's very nice of you.
I guess I am pretty hungry.
Good.
Oh, yeah, Ginnie.
Yeah, I love Ginnie.
Ginnie's great.
I was bummed when she quit.
But I think maybe she got a better job.
- You know where?
- I don't.
But I can ask around.
That'd be great.
Thanks.
In the meantime, can I get you anything to start?
I think we'll skip straight to the entree.
We're in a bit of a rush.
I'll take the, uh, steak-frites, rare.
I guess I'll have, uh...
You know what?
I'll get what he's getting, uh, the... the steak.
Excellent.
Rare as well?
Uh, yeah, yeah, rare.
Very good.
This place is pretty, uh, chichi.
Yeah, for you, I guess, eating tofu out of a paper bag or whatever.
That is how I usually eat, actually.
She'll turn up, Mr. Gallo.
She will.
Have you, um...
- talked to Ginnie's Mom?
- No.
I was just thinking, uh, maybe she's heard from her.
I don't want to worry her.
Right, but, you know, they're pretty close.
I mean, maybe she knows where she is.
And what if she doesn't?
Then she's in a panic.
And whose fault is that?
Yours?
Well, no, it would be yours, actually, because it's your idea.
Maybe she lost her phone.
If she lost her phone, then she wouldn't get your messages.
Martin, I get that you think I'm being paranoid here, okay?
But believe me, shit happens every day.
Friend of mine's daughter takes a little trip to Europe.
She gets grabbed 20 minutes out of Orly.
- Jesus.
- Yeah.
Lucky for them I know a thing or two about a thing or two.
I was able to get her back.
- A thing or two?
- I know how to handle a situation like that, let's just say.
Wait.
Like those Liam Neeson movies?
- What?
- You know, those Liam Neeson movies.
His...
His daughter gets kidnapped or his wife.
This is not a movie, Martin.
This is life.
What...
What is so funny?
Oh, just, uh...
It just reminds me of...
Ginnie could never explain what you do.
It always seemed so mysterious to us.
We used to joke that you were a, uh, um, an arms dealer or something, you know, something badass.
Well, something like that, but not quite so glamorous, I guess.
So what is it that you do, exactly, then?
I'm in procurement.
Okay.
Huh.
Procurement.
So what about you?
How's it going with the music?
Well, I guess I've got that show coming up with my band.
But I'm not sure that I want to do it.
Not sure?
Well, what's the issue?
Well, it's been a while, and I guess I've been trying to figure some stuff out actually.
I mean... finally hit me.
What's the endgame?
I mean, I'm probably never gonna make... a real living at it, or at least one decent enough to support a family or...
Are you good at it?
Yeah, I am.
Then you should play the show.
Here we are.
No luck on the Ginnie front, I'm sorry to say.
Well, thanks for trying.
You know, it is Thursday, though.
You know, you might want to try Rococo.
You know her friend Trev?
He's awesome.
He's been DJing there every Thursday.
Yeah, I know Trevor.
You know the place?
Enjoy your meal.
Dig in.
You okay there, bub?
It's been a while since I ate meat.
Yeah.
Like how long?
Oh, three... maybe five years.
Nobody made you order it.
Tell you what, let's go to that Rococo place, get a drink, settle your stomach, huh?
I guess one drink couldn't hurt.
If she's there, great.
If not, maybe you can point out somebody that knows her, huh?
- You're the Boss.
- Now you're getting it.
This place is impossible.
We're never getting in.
What, are you kidding me?
Come on.
Where are you...
All right.
He's with me.
Have a good night.
How'd you do that?
I spoke the guy's language.
What...
What was it, Samoan?
What, you spoke Samoan?
Martin, look alive.
Dennis said he hadn't seen her, but you never know.
Dennis?
You spoke to that guy for, like, three seconds.
Martin, look around.
See if you can spot anyone who knows Ginnie.
No, I don't know, Mr. Gallo.
This really doesn't look like her kind of crowd.
Come on.
Let's get that drink.
Two Taliskers, neat.
You got it.
See anything?
No.
There you go.
I think I, uh...
Good.
Hey, Megan.
Oh, my God.
Martin!
Megan!
What the fuck are you doing here?
I'm looking for Ginnie, actually.
Oh, Martin, you gotta get over it.
It's so sad, like...
No, I'm...
I'm over it.
Uh, it's just her Dad is looking for her, actually.
Do you...
Do you know if she's gonna be here tonight?
- What?
- Do you know if she's coming here tonight?
- Who?
- Ginnie!
Get over it, Martin!
'Kay.
Oh, wow.
She's very drunk.
Yeah.
Hey, uh, Lois.
- Right?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Martin, right?
Yes!
Thank you!
Oh, sorry?
I just, uh...
Have you seen Ginnie by any chance?
I'm sorry.
Who?
Ginnie, my ex-girlfriend.
Yeah.
No, I haven't seen her.
Sorry.
It's so loud in here.
I know.
It's unbelievably loud in here.
I feel like I'm screaming at you.
It probably looks like we're having a horrible, horrible argument.
Fuck you, you fucking asshole!
I swear to fucking God!
Uh, what was that?
I'm sorry.
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.
I was kidding.
It was a joke about arguments.
Oh, man.
Good.
Good.
I probably went too far.
- No.
- Sorry.
I don't think I've seen her in here for a few weeks.
Is she missing or something?
Something like that.
This one's on the house all right?
- Thank you.
- You know, you ought to talk to that guy she's seeing.
She's seeing somebody?
Yeah, cute guy, too, a big tipper.
They met here, I think.
You seen him lately?
No.
I haven't seen either of 'em.
Just a second.
So do you come here often?
So do you come here often?
No, never.
It's a little bit too, like...
Axe body spray?
Yes.
Hey, I heard you guys are playing this weekend, right?
Yeah.
Uh...
I don't know if that's gonna happen.
Yeah, I saw you play, like...
like a year ago at the River Room.
You were really good, kind of like... the Punch Brothers meets, like, the Foggy Mountain Boys meets, like, the Muppets.
Yeah, thanks, I think.
That's at least partially what...
exactly what...
Marty?
Hey, Trevor.
They let you in here?
Yeah.
Well, you know, Dennis is a friend, so...
Oh man.
I know this guy!
He's an idiot!
Hey, um, I think my friend is leaving, so I have to go.
Okay.
And if I do play that show, uh, maybe I'll see you there.
Yeah.
Good to see you.
'Bye-bye.
- Bye.
Listen, Trevor, have you seen Ginnie recently?
Uh, yeah, I'm just gonna do you a solid and not even answer that, bro.
I don't know what your problem is with me.
Hey, I told you guys about Marty here, right?
He plays old-timey music on his banjo like he's old McDonald or some shit, and, like, 10 people show up.
It's hilarious.
Yeah, well, you know, what's hilarious is, uh, you know, you look like a...
a rapist... like you've committed rape.
You know why Ginnie dumped you?
'Cause she's way too fine for your hella broke ass.
I kind of want to punch you in the face right now.
You know, Marty, a woman like Ginnie, deserves to be given the finer things in life.
And there's a long line of dudes who want to give it to her.
Hey, Martin.
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.
I was just talking to Ginnie's, uh, friend Trevor, just asking him if he's seen Ginnie.
And?
And I was telling Marty here that the way that girl's been working through their breakup, she could be facedown in any bed in a 10-mile rad...
Look out!
♪ Aw, yeah ♪
♪ Yeah, yeah ♪
Time to go.
Holy shit.
You flattened that guy out.
I shouldn't have done that.
Oh, fuck that guy.
Never been in a bar fight before.
That was...
That was so amazing when I was like, "Look out!"
- You're a real lifesaver.
- I mean...
I feel like I could have totally held my own, though.
I've got a ton of pent-up rage
I've never gotten to use.
Maybe we should go back.
Simmer down, Mike Tyson.
Oh, shit.
I know that girl.
Everyone is right now...
- Megan?
- Where are my keys?
Megan, are... are you okay?
Why is Bri-baby being such a dick-face right now?
Um, I...
I don't know who that is.
Bri-baby.
Oh, I'm so outta here.
And if he doesn't like it, he can kiss my ass.
Well, uh...
Is this my car?
- Well, oh, oh, no.
- This my car?
I don't think it's such a good idea for you to be driving right now, Megan.
Well, maybe it's not such a good idea for your face to be a dick right now.
Right.
Okay.
Uh...
Mr. Gallo...
Yeah.
Where do you live, Megan?
You know where.
Burger King.
Because we're trying to drive you home.
Oh, I don't want to go home.
I want to go to the par-tay.
Are you still on Sweetzer?
I want to go to the party so I can blow Dan Franklin.
Let's get her home, for Dan Franklin's sake.
Yeah, I think she's still on Sweetzer.
It's just a right at the next light.
Yeah?
Okay, slow down, Barry.
What the hell do you mean they're backing out?
They...
Barry.
Barry.
Barry.
Fuck.
Fucking phone died.
Perfect.
Take a picture, and post it on Bri-baby's Twitter fuck.

You gonna make it upstairs okay?
Where is it?
Where it's at?
We'll...
We'll help you up.
Got it.
Why don't you get rid of Martin so me and you can go to the party and party?
I think you're kind of partied out, kiddo.
Ah, I'm fine.
I had, like, two shots.
I'm fuckin' fine.
I just need to spit.
Where are you taking me?
Where are you taking me?
Okay.
All right.
There you go.
Where am I?
Move just a little bit.
Okay...
- Drink this.
- Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
- Megan...
- Uh-uh.
Uh-uh... drink this.
It's gonna make you feel better.
Mm.
I'm not thirsty.
It'll make you feel better, Megan.
- Uh-uh.
- Drink it.
We can make out if you want.
That's a nice offer, but I'm good.
Mm, 'cause you're so in love with Ginnie still.
Well, sure, that, and I think you still have some vomit in your hair.
That's fucked up, dude.
'Cause you know she's in love with someone else.
She is?
Mm-hmm.
Who's that?
Mr. Hot Stuff.
Mm.
Mr. Hot Stuff?
Dude's ripped.
That's... awesome.
This Mr. Hot Stuff... does he have a name?
Megan?
Megan, what's his name?
M-Megan.
Megan.
Megan.
This girl is friends with my daughter?
Yeah.
This isn't Ginnie, Mr. Gallo.
She's not like this.
Let me find you a shirt.
What the fuck is going on here?
What the fuck is going on here?
Hey, uh, no.
Now, um...
What the fuck is going on here?
Hey, relax, okay?
We gave the girl a ride.
That's all.
That's my fucking girlfriend, dude!
Oh, you're, um, Bri-baby.
L-I'm Martin.
I'm Martin.
I'm Ginnie's ex-boyfriend,
Megan's friend Ginnie.
Why is this dude fucking shirtless?
Just relax, Bri-baby.
Your girlfriend threw up on me is all.
Tell you what.
We'll just, uh, give you a few dollars for the shirt, and, uh, we'll just...
Hey, Martin...
Fuck.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Hey!
I think he's... he's...
Oh, he's breathing.
He's breathing.
Good for him.
Let's get out of here.
That a way.
That doesn't look too bad.
Fucking hurts.
How 'bout the smell?
I still smell like vomit?
Little bit.
Oh.
- What?
- Thanks.
You really had my back up there.
Yeah, well, Mr. Gallo...
You can call me Frank.
I don't think I can do that, Mr. Gallo, but you're welcome.
Megan said Ginnie had a new boyfriend.
- Yeah.
- Mr. Hot Stuff.
Bartender at the club said the same thing.
Well, so... we probably won't be finding her tonight, and that's because she's with him.
Look, Martin...
So even if we do find her, find them, how's it gonna look?
I'm tooling around with her Dad.
She's shacked up with her new boyfriend.
So she's dating someone else.
So what?
I mean, don't you still want to know that she's okay?
Aren't you at all worried that none of the people we talked to tonight know where she is?
Of course I'm worried about her.
Because I thought you still cared about her.
Of course I still care about her!
She broke my heart!
Has that not been spelled out enough for you tonight?
Your daughter fucked my shit up.
My life has been a complete wreck for the last three months.
I mean, I can't eat.
I can't think straight.
I can't play music.
All I've literally been able to do... is sleep.
So what do you want to do, go home?
Yes.
Crawl into bed, sleep some more?
Yes, that's exactly what I wanna do.
Martin, I get it.
I do, but... it's a fucking terrible feeling.
It sucks, but...
I don't think retreating into your shell is doing you a lot of good.
Listen, I'm telling you this from personal experience, okay?
Life goes by really fast.
If you half-ass it now, you're gonna feel it later.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Where to now?
There you go, Juicy.
Since we're, um, exploring our options...
And I know this is a sensitive area, but maybe you could try calling Ginnie's Mom.
I'm not calling Ginnie's mother, period.
- End of story.
End of story.
- Okay, but I was thinking...
All right.
So Why'd you and Ginnie break up?
You know that prizewinning douchebag
Trevor back at the club, he was saying that Ginnie is out of my league.
She's an amazing girl, as you obviously know.
She's smart, beautiful, funny, and tough.
Yeah, and, um...
She is out of my league.
Well... maybe she saw something you don't.
Maybe she did, but I started to get insecure about it, and then I got jealous and moody.
I don't know.
It was my fault.
I just...
I fucked it up.
I fucked it all up.
We all fuck it up sometimes.
There it is.
So procurement, what is that?
Forget about it.
No, no.
I'm curious, really.
I bid on contracts from foreign governments to procure for them anything they need in bulk, grain, seed, fertilizer, fucking nuts and bolts, what have you.
Ah.
Okay.
Procurement.
Actually, figuring how to get 20 tons of corn feed from Germany to Nigeria can be more exciting than it might sound like.
But it's also... just not a normal lifestyle, you know?
Makes it harder to see my daughter, for example.

Hey, you know that other girl at the club?
What girl?
What do you mean, "What girl?"
The one I saw you talking to.
She's into you.
What, Lois?
Wait.
How...
How did you even...
You weren't even there.
Jesus, Martin, wake up.
90% of that shit is body language, okay?
She's into you.
Wow, really?
Huh, Lois.
I just...
You gotta be kidding me.
Gary?
Hey!
Hey, how's it going, guys?
Hey, did you find Ginnie?
Was she at the cafe?
- No.
- Aw, bummer.
Bummer.
You don't think she got kidnapped, do you?
No!
Jesus, Gary!
Hey, does Roberta know you're here?
Yeah.
Yeah, no.
She sent me out for groceries.
Um, I had to replace the cheese.
Yeah, so how's that going, the grocery shopping?
I don't know.
I think I just, um, needed... air.
Yeah, 'cause actually, uh...
I don't know if you guys noticed, but Roberta and I have actually been having a lot of problems lately.
No shit?
Really?
- No idea.
- Apparently, the sight of my face nauseates her
- is what she told me verbatim.
- Mm.
Sorry to hear that, Gare.
Thanks.
Uh, how 'bout if I buy you another one?
Yeah!
Yeah, man!
Now we're talking!
Definitely!
Yeah, one more for our friend.
One more.
Yeah, on him.
He's...
- I got it.
- On him, yeah.
- All right.
- Mm.
Always tastes better when it's free.
Heh.
It does, though, a little bit.
Yeah, no, I remember those days.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
God.
Okay, back to business.
Okay, back to business.
What do we know about this guy, Mr. Hot Stuff?
Mr. who?
Ginnie's got a new boyfriend.
Really?
Damn it.
For you, man.
Damn it.
That sucks for you.
We know he's a regular at the club.
Bartender says he's a big tipper.
And he's ripped, apparently.
So he goes to the gym, frequents nightclubs, likes to throw his money around, maybe act like a big shot.
Sounds like an asshole.
This is what I'm saying.
I smell a rat here.
Hmm.
What about with Martin?
Did you smell a rat when you met him?
No, no rat.
Field mouse, maybe.
Field mouse!
Hah hah.
He's right.
You're a field mouse, bro.
This is great.
This is what I'm talking about.
This is just guys being guys.
Drinking beer, and busting balls.
"Field mouse."
Mm.
Mm-mmm.
Next round is on me.
I insist.
You've been more than generous, Mr. Gallo.
Got an emergency 20 in here somewhere.
No way.
Ohh.
I been looking for this, my 'shrooms.
You guys want some?
Huh?
Hey, we should do these together, go camping.
Joshua Tree.
You should probably put those away, like, now.
Wait.
Japanese paper.
Hey, man.
Aw, man.
Ah, Dude.
♪ What you want is in your hands, yeah... ♪
Gary, you dumb-ass, drug-addled son of a bitch,
I could kiss you right now.
Okay, but we should wait 'til after we eat the 'shrooms.
Are you kidding me?
Are you just completely out to lunch?
Martin, who cares?
We have Ginnie's address.
Come on.
Let's go.
No.
No.
No, no.
We've been searching for Ginnie all day and night all over town while her address has been sitting in his pocket, wrapping his stupid 'shrooms!
Martin, man, I-I'm really sorry.
I am, but you just...
Martin, come on.
Let it go.
Field mouse, huh?
Hey, guys, wait.
Can I come?
Whoo-hoo!
This is great, really.
Really great, man.
Call to adventure, you know?
We're on the case.
Oh, you know what it's...
It's, um...
It's like that movie, that movie...
John Wayne...
Whoa!
Whuhh!
Mr. Gallo, you sure you're okay to drive?
- Sound like my ex.
- "The Searchers."
"The Searchers." That's it.
Ah, man, that's an awesome movie.
Hey, do either of you have any weed on you?
I don't like to 'shroom without a little weed.
You know, I bet I can get my dealer to come meet us.
- What's the, um...
- Gary... we're not gonna have your weed dealer meet us at my daughter's place.
Right.
No, right.
Right.
Um... oh, shit.
Sycamore, right?
What's the address?
1030 Sycamore.
Terri Sadler.
That's her roommate, right?
Yeah, that's her.
She's the... the jittery girl.
You know her, right?
No, but keep asking.
Ohh!
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
I can't get unbuckled.
Gary, just stay with the car.
Mm-hmm.
Windows are dark.
Yeah, well, some people are actually asleep after midnight.
Okay.
When you and Ginnie lived together, where did you hide the spare key?
Where?
Um, that's not really, um...
That's kind of private.
Martin, I'm not gonna rob you.
What am I gonna take, your bong?
Where did you hide the key?
It was under a rock, but...
What...
What are you gonna...
- No, you're not gonna...
- It's okay.
I'm her father.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mr. Gallo, you are not...
Martin, I need to see if my daughter is in trouble.
Okay, this is a very bad idea.
You know what, Martin?
I'm starting to see why Ginnie kicked you to the curb.
- Oh, are you?
And why's that?
- Yeah.
'Cause you're a namby-pamby, little fucking pain in the ass.
Now move it.
No.
Seriously?
Martin, you do not want to be standing in my fucking way right now.
Fine.
That's what I thought.
Fuck this.
Shit.
Because it's...
it's frustrating, 'cause you don't trust me like I trust you!
Because all you wanna do is sit around watching "Game of Thrones"
and fantasize about Jaime Lannister!
You do!
You want to bang the shit out of Jaime Lannister!
That's fine!
I don't get mad at you, because I get it!
Even with one hand, he's beautiful!
Hello.
Anybody home?
Shit.
Hello.
Mr. Gallo.
I think Ginnie's room's over here.
Thank fucking God.
What the fuck?
Wait.
Hold on.
I found out where Ginnie is.
- Where?
- She went on vacation with her new boyfriend.
His name is Kip.
- Kip.
- Yeah.
I think it sounds pretty serious.
And guess what, babe.

Well, trick or treat, 'cause I'm taking 'em right now.

I know how you found out Ginnie's on vacation.
- You called her Mom.
- Yeah, that's right.
I did.
I called Connie, who actually talks to Ginnie and cares about what's going on in her life and knows where the hell she is.
You had no right to do that.
I told you I didn't want to worry her.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
We should have called 12 hours ago.
Like, then, maybe you wouldn't have home invaded.
It's complicated, okay?
I didn't do right by Ginnie's Mom.
I... fucked around when Ginnie was little.
Yeah, it's old news.
I've heard all about it, believe me.
You got a lot of nerve talking to me like that.
Ginnie's Mom is fine, Mr. Gallo.
She's happily remarried.
She got over it years ago.
Ginnie did, too.
Freeze!
Stop right there!
I'm gonna let it shine.
I'm gonna let it shine.
I'm gonna let it shine.
I'm shining my light!
This is the police.
Don't move.
Just to be clear, I've always been there for my daughter.
I gave her everything she wanted.
How 'bout your attention?
- Oh, sh...
- Fuck.
Hi.
We, uh...
Could we use your bathroom?
Toilet is for customers only.
Uh, here.
Come on.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sorry.
Look, uh, my fault.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Come on.
Let's go.
Both of you, on the ground now!
This day is never-ending.
What is this?
I'm sure it's nothing, babe.
It's fine.
No, Kip, they're directly in front of my house.
Okay, look, officers, it's... it's just really a big misunderstanding.
Stop right there, and get down!
Just calm down for a second.
I can explain the whole thing.
That was my daughter's apartment.
On the ground!
Mr. Gallo, get down now.
I will not.

I am a taxpayer.
- I am a...

Couple of weeks ago in my hotel in Mumbai,
I woke up in the middle of the night soaked in sweat, didn't know where I was.
I didn't know who I was for a second.
My heart was just going... thousand miles a minute.
I mean, I...
I thought I was gonna die.
I called down to the front desk and... and asked 'em to send up a doctor.
And then I'm...
I'm just lying there, thinking, "This is it,"
you know, "This is...
This is it."
And so I called Ginnie... and Ginnie wasn't there.
And of course the doctor shows up, and he... and he checks everything out.
He says it's not a heart attack.
It's not...
It's nothing.
It's a fucking panic attack.
Just ridiculous... embarrassing.
I'm at the airport the next morning, and, uh...
No, it's not like there's a layover here.
I'm supposed to be in Geneva right now.
But I came here, because... because I needed to see my little girl.
I have no one else, Martin.
You know?
She's all I got.
Hey, you guys, you guys.
You guys you guys... can we just be serious for one Moment?
Okay, can we just... talk real shit?

Oh, my God.
- Oh, my poor, poor baby.
- Oh, yeah.
What a night you've had.
Baby, I see your light.
It's, like, blue.
Your aura is blue,
- like an "Avatar" thing.
- Ho ho.
You know,
I actually believed you, that you were going to the store to replace the cheese because you felt bad about it.
No, no, no.
Not my Gare.
My Gare's not that kind of boyfriend, is he?
- Ow.
Ow.
Ow...
- He's more of a call you from jail at 4:00 A.M.
because I'm tripping my balls off kind of guy.
Ow.
Uh, honey, your aura's turning, like, dark red now.
Good.
Here's the drill.
You're gonna stay here until your arraignment...
- Uh-huh.
- Which is in two days, and you're gonna sit and think about whether you want to come home or be your own man and let your light shine down.
I want...
I want to come home.
I want to come home.
I know you do, honey, but that's because you're scared and stupid right now, so you just sit tight, and sleep on it, okay?
- Uh-huh.
Okay.
- Okay.
Nice work, guys.
I love you!
All right, you two.
Looks like your lawyer has saved your ass.
Ginnie.
What the hell, Dad?
I know.
Look, I was worried.
You hadn't returned voice mails or e-mails.
I was on vacation, and I tried to call you back as soon as I got off the plane.
Right.
And of course then my phone was dead, so...
So you thought it would be a good idea to break into my house with my ex-boyfriend?
Look, I'm sorry, okay, but what are you doing running off without telling anybody and not answering your phone?
We were in Bora Bora trying to unplug, and I told Mom.
Jesus.
Dad, this is Kip.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Sir.
How do you do?
L-I'm sorry about the misunderstanding.
It's my fault.
That's very generous of you, but I'm pretty sure it's all my fault.
Hey.
Kip.
Uh, I'm Martin.
Well, uh, since we have your father's rental car, you want to... want to take him back to the hotel?
I'll take our car.
- I'll meet you there?
- Yeah.
Okay.
I'm gonna go.
It was nice to meet everybody.
I guess I'll...
I'm gonna be going, too.
Um, Ginnie, I'm so sorry about everything.
It was really nice to see you, though.
Martin.
Martin!
Look, Ginnie,
- I'm truly...
- No, no, no.
You don't have to apologize.
I know how persuasive my Dad can be.
Well, yeah, but go easy on the guy, huh?
I think he's been in a pretty rough place lately.
I'll try.
How are you?
You know, uh...
How have you been?
I actually applied to UCLA, architecture and urban design,
- and I got in.
- Wow.
That's great.
That's what you've always wanted.
That's" That's great.
I found out last week, and Bora Bora was Kip's congratulation gift.
I'm sorry that you had to find out about him like this.
I didn't know if I should call.
Ah, no.
Kip seems great, Ginnie.
And you, you seem... you seem really happy.
And I'm happy for you.
Your head hurt?
Little bit.
Good.
Look, Ginnie...
I don't want to hear it, Dad.
Hey, you didn't tell me you were thinking about going back to school.
You're not in my life.
Okay?
You are never here.
When are you gonna understand that you don't get a say in what I do or where I go or who with?
Look... you're my Dad.
And I love you... and I do know that you love me.
Why do you have to be such an asshole?
I don't know.
Why is the sky blue?
No, no, no.
Ah.
No, no, no, no.
Jimothy...
I'm trying to beat this level, dawg.
Have some respect.
We need to talk.
Well, I'm busy.
And after I beat this level,
I'm gonna do more drugs, have more sex with this very attractive couple, and then sleep for 16 hours, so pencil you in after that.
Hey, it's time for you to move now.
- Get your shit, and go.
- Listen, man...
You're 30 days past due on rent, so consider it an eviction.
You're done.
This is mine.
You know, I find your new-found confidence intoxicating.
What if we... figured out a different way to pay rent... a Physical way?
Hello.
Hey, Connie.
I hope it's okay I called.
Frank?

Jesus.
Would you please fucking call me Frank already?
Thanks for coming, Frank.
That's nice stuff up there.
Seriously, really, really good.

Ah, thanks.

had to be in Geneva.
I figured I'd stick around here, spend a little time with my daughter.
You want a beer?

Well, I mean...
I won't forget it.

Who?
Oh, Lois?
Yeah, I, uh...

We met up before the show.
Did you, now?
Yeah.
You were right about that whole body-language thing.

I'm Martin.
You're Mr. Gallo.

Nice to meet you, Martin.
Fuck.
It's really good to see you.
You look great.
You look tired.
Where you coming from this time?
Singapore.
Ah.
Ever been?
No, I haven't been.
Uh, i...
I hear it's very, um, clean, which I like.
I also hear that they cane you if you spit in the street.
Uh, not that I like that.
Yeah, I don't like that part.
Good evening.
Can I bring you something to drink?
Shall we start with a nice bottle of red?
Uh, Martin has a sulfite allergy.
A sulfite allergy?
Um, it's not that bad, actually.
I just get a little, uh, Hivey.
But I'm fine with water or death.
Okay.
Uh, we'll have a bottle of the chateauneuf-Du-pape.
Excellent choice.
And, Martin, are you sure?
Nothing?
Maybe a beer?
Or are you allergic to hops?
Heh.
You sure you don't want something else, Martin?
Mm.
Oh, no.
This is delicious.
These beets are really well steamed.
I'm sorry.
I gotta take this.
He hates me.
He doesn't hate you.
He hates me.
He hates me so much, I'm starting to hate myself.
All that matters is what I think, and I'm a fan.
Yeah?
Big fan.
Huge fan.
All right.
Martin:
Okay, I got this.
I'll bounce back.
Round two.
Sorry about that.
It's, uh, not a problem.
Looks like a, uh, pretty major deal just went down over there by the bar, huh?
So, Martin, what is it that you do?
Uh, dad, I told you Martin is a musician.
Right.
Right.
What is it, the, uh, ukulele?
Uh, it's the, uh, banjo.
Banjo.
Right, like Kermit the frog.
Heh.
I guess I assumed the banjo was a hobby.
Well, I have a band, hysterical kindness.
It's a bluegrass collective, more Flatt and Scruggs or punch brothers than some, you know, poppy Mumford sonskindof wannabething.
What's wrong with Mumford sons?
They're a very successful act, no?
He likes Mumford sons.
So where you from?
Well, I was born in Chicago, uh, but I grew up in Guelph.
Guelph?
Uh, Guelph, Ontario.
Guelph?
It's, uh...
Canada.
Guelph?
Okay.
Your folks, what do they do?
Jesus, dad, what is with the third degree?
Third degree?
I'm just getting to know the guy.
You don't mind, do you, Martin?
No.
No, no.
It's great.
It's great getting to know someone this, you know, vigorously.
So your parents?
Oh.
Right.
Um...
My mother is an acupuncturist in Toronto, and my father is an, um...
He's an environmental activist in Albuquerque.
He's an environmental activist in Albuquerque, dad.
Deal with it.
I didn't say anything.
I'm sure it's very satisfying work.
He never met a tree that he didn't want to chain himself to.
Sweetie, you have a little, um, salad dressing.
Oh.
Oops.
Oh.
Mr. Gallo,
I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.
Could tonight's dinner have gone any worse?
Actually, it could have.
Mm, I guess he could have castrated me at the table.
Last time I introduced dad to a boyfriend,
I never heard from the guy again, so...
Wow.
When I disappear next, ask your dad where my body's buried, just as, you know, like, a courtesy to my mom.
Martin, I know he's tough.
But you're not gonna have to deal with him.
I probably won't see him for another year, so...
Oh.
In that case, I think we should make a plan to see him sooner than that.
You'd be up for that?
Absolutely.
I would go through that hell all over again for you.
Coming.
I'm coming.
Mr. Gallo?
Ginnie home?
Home?
Uh, no.
No.
I mean, uh, she may be home, but, uh...
Ginnie doesn't live here anymore.
We broke up.
Okay.
Want to invite me in?
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, of course.
Sorry.
I was just, uh, getting some work done.
She didn't tell you when we, uh, broke up?
We haven't spoken since Christmas.
Ah.
Well, I guess you could call her, you know, to get her, uh, new address to go there.
She's not picking up or returning calls or texts.
I was hoping maybe she'd be here.
Oh, I just, uh...
I just had a little, uh, get-together last month, so...
Don't worry about it.
Just cleaning, anyway.
Yeah.
So, uh, any idea where I could find my daughter?
Did you try Gary and Roberta?
Gary and Roberta?
Yeah.
When she moved out, she went to go stay with them.
Do you want any coffee?
Uh, that's... that's okay.
Don't bother.
I'm just gonna make some anyway.
So, uh...
So when did you two break up?
Uh, about three months ago.
Three months and nine days or something.
I don't... you know, I'm not, uh...
I'm sure she's, uh...
You said she, uh... she knew you were coming in to town?
I gave her the heads-up I was coming in last minute, but I never got a response.
Huh.
No, no.
This is...
This is Jimothy, uh, is my new roommate.
Gallo:
Gotcha.
Jimothy.
Like Timothy with a "j."
No.
Jimothy, this is Mr. Gallo,
Ginnie's dad.
Who?
Ex-girlfriend's father.
Do you have the bong?
What?
I, uh...
I don't know what you mean?
What do you mean by that?
The bong, thing I smoke weed out of all day.
Oh, is that... is that...
Is that what this is?
I was... yeah, I was looking earlier.
I just didn't...
I was curious.
You're giving me a real stressy vibe, man.
Uh...
You stressed out?
What's going on?
J-Jimothy.
Could you just, um...
Just take your weird machine there and just let Mr. Gallo and I talk?
Am I wrong?
Is he giving you a stressy vibe?
You're not wrong.
Yeah.
I'm having people over tonight, in case you want to hide in your room again.
You can come.
I thought... you know, I thought we said, uh... we agreed, you know, last time, you know, with...
With the cops...
Oh, so I'm not allowed to have people over in my own home?
No, it's cool.
Whatever.
Oh, did you get my message?
What message?
The fiddle player in your band or something came by, wanted you to know you had a show this weekend or something.
Wait.
What do you mean?
We have a show?
I think so.
Well, did he say when or where?
Didn't say when.
Didn't say where.
You know, I'm not...
Heh.
He's not...
We're not...
We're not friends.
None of my business.
W-we're just friends.
Okay.
When Ginnie moved out, I needed a new roommate to help cover the rent.
Of course, yeah.
You don't wanna let go of a prime piece of real estate like this.
Yeah.
No, these crossbeams, you don't always...
Oh.
Oh, I'll go get that coffee.
Look, Martin, I can see you're, uh, a busy man here.
Tomorrow I have to get on a flight to Geneva.
All I want to do is find my daughter, so if you can just point me to her new place,
I'll get out of your hair.
Uh, we're all out of milk.
And sugar.
Uh, but we have syrup.
You want syrup in your coffee, or is that...
Is that weird?
I don't want syrup.
Thanks.
Okay.
So do you have an address for this Gary and Roberta?
Uh, no, but they're not too far from here.
Uh, I don't have an address, but I've been over there.
So it's close?
Yeah.
Yes, it's just a couple blocks that-a-way.
Okay.
You want to get dressed, and you can take me over there?
Now?
Yes, now, Martin.
Do you mind?
Fuck.
Fuck this.
Hey, Martin, do you mind if I go on this computer for a minute, check e-mails?
Um, yeah, sure.
Go ahead.
Fuck.
Uh, wait!
H-hold on!
Why don't you just...
Holy shit!
Uh, you know, I just...
I tell Jimothy not to use my computer, but he does.
Look, Martin, porn is porn, you know, but you gotta hide that shit.
Put it in a folder or something.
Yeah.
Can't just leave it hanging out there.
You know, i...
I can't even believe that they have sites like that on the Internet.
Uh, those poor women.
Okay, you want to put on some pants so we can hit the road?
Here.
You know where we're going.
You drive.
Ahh.
Wasn't ready for that.
Actually, I don't drive.
What do you mean, you don't drive?
Ah, I don't have my license.
And, uh, also I don't know how.
Nice throw.
How can you not know how to drive in Los Angeles?
A man should know how to drive.
I have a bicycle.
Oh, well, congrats on that.
Yeah, it's actually considered very masculine in the Netherlands.
You know, hey, I haven't really been in touch with Ginnie recently, so...
So?
So I might not come in.
Fine by me.
You know, not that we're not friends.
You know, we're still friends.
I think we're still friends.
We're still friends on Facebook.
That...
Martin, where are we going?
Oh, uh, it's just up ahead that-a-way and a second left at the light.
It's one of these.
I can never tell which.
They all look the same.
Voice mail's still full.
It's gotta be this one.
I hear fighting.
This is definitely it.
Okay, well, write it down, like, on the dry erase!
'Cause Saturday's my day!
Shit.
Hey.
Hey, how's it going, man?
Um...
Gary.
Yeah, hey, Martin.
Hi.
Sorry to just drop by like this.
Yeah, it...
It really is...
We're looking for my daughter.
Ginnie.
Oh.
This is her father, Mr. Gallo.
Uh, he didn't have her new address.
She, um...
Martin, hi.
Oh.
Uh, they... they're looking for Ginnie, babe.
Um, this is Ginnie's dad.
Oh, hi.
Hi.
I'm Roberta.
So great to finally meet you.
Jack, right?
That would be Ginnie's stepfather.
Right.
Well, don't worry.
She's talked a lot about you, too.
Did you invite them in?
I literally just opened the door.
Come in.
Come in.
Yeah, come on in.
Yeah.
After you.
Yeah, welcome, welcome.
Mi casa...
Heh heh.
Roberta:
Uh, could I get you something to drink?
Water or Kombucha?
Twig tea?
I have some nice biodynamic wine.
Don't bother.
Please, we're just looking for Ginnie.
Martin said she was staying here.
She was staying here.
Uh, she left about three weeks ago.
Did you try her cell?
Roberta:
I can try her cell.
Phone is off, mailbox full for a couple days now.
Gary:
Oh, man, sounds to me like she's living off the grid, you know?
Martin, was Ginnie, like, a survivalist, you know?
Like one of those preppers or...
Gary, stop talking.
Do you know where she moved when she left here?
Yes.
Um...
Ohh.
Ahh.
What was her name?
Martin, you know her.
Um, the jittery girl.
Always looks like she's about to cry.
You know her.
Mm, doesn't, uh, ring a bell.
Okay, did Ginnie leave an address?
Roberta:
Yes.
I think it's on the fridge.
Uh, Gary, could you get it, please?
Please come in.
Gary:
Uh, I'm not seeing it.
It's on the fridge!
No, it isn't!
It's definitely on the fridge.
I just checked there.
Jesus.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
There's no address on the fridge.
It's on the Japanese paper.
Yeah, no.
I know you think it's there, but it's not there.
On the Japanese paper.
Christ.
Roberta:
Get out of my way.
Fine.
I don't know how to look.
It's not there.
You sure you guys don't want anything, like a...
like a beer?
Sure.
I could do a beer.
Ah, you know, uh,
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Uh, how have you been, Gary?
I've been, um...
Work's good.
Work's good.
Yeah.
Gary, where's the tub where we, uh, keep the receipts?
What tub?
I...
I don't know.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
I need to help her out.
What tub are you ta...
The tin?
That's a tin.
That's not a tub.
Tub, tin, whatever.
No, I don't know.
Can I help you find what you're looking for?
Go... go check the drawer.
What drawer?
The odds-and-ends drawer.
All right, I'm just saying be specific.
We'll find it.
Can I get you guys something?
Are you sure?
Something to drink or cheese?
We have nice cheese.
Oh, we're out of the cheese, babe.
Since when?
Since we finished it.
I didn't finish the cheese, so don't say "we."
I was gonna freeze it for my doula workshop next month.
It's okay.
We don't need cheese.
Someone finished the cheese, I guess.
Yeah, someone was hungry in their house, and they ate cheese.
They ate it all, though.
It's okay.
Have you seen Ginnie recently?
Brother.
I certainly have not.
We love Ginnie.
Don't get me wrong.
But some of us loved her a little too much, if you know what I mean, and some things got said.
Yeah, some things got said.
You said 'em.
Yeah, I said 'em, all right.
Yeah.
'Cause someone had to say something, 'cause a certain someone in this house wanted to have sex with his daughter.
Okay, what?
Excuse me?
No?
No.
No, Mr. Gallo, you know that your daughter is very attractive.
And unfortunately, in this house, that makes certain people very insecure.
Okay, let me translate for Mr. Sensitivity over here.
Ginnie was getting a little sick and tired of being leered at every time she went to the fridge.
It was one time, and I was trying to warn her about the bad milk!
Mr. Gallo, Martin, Ginnie was going for some bad milk in the fridge, so I was peering to see what she was grabbing from the fridge, in order to say, "hey, don't ingest that, yeah.
'Cause you might get sick." I was doing a service.
You're a knight in shining armor, aren't you, Gare?
Here's an idea.
Maybe you could sort it out with them at your favorite strip joint...
Ohh!
That happened at a bachelor party!
They're strippers!
They climb all over you!
You can't stop them!
You guys know!
They're... they're like monkeys at a zoo!
Can't stop 'em.
The monkeys climb all over you at a zoo?
Really?
Interesting zoo.
Okay, we should probably get going.
If you find that address, you could give me a shout, that'd be great.
We'll find it.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
I'm so sorry about the cheese.
You know, it was very expensive cheese.
Jesus, Roberta, he doesn't care about the goddamn cheese.
You, uh, might want to try the cafe.
Martin knows where it is.
She's probably working there.
The cafe?
Roberta:
Yeah.
Great.
Martin?
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
Uh, all right.
Well, thanks, guys.
Thank you for...
That.
All right.
Why do you have to attack me?
Why are you...
Have to be so hostile?
And now I completely lost face.
I gotta go apologize for something I didn't even do.
Hey, ma-Martin.
Are we cool, man?
Are we...
I just want you to know truly...
Yeah, no.
Bro, I would never...
Gary, it's fine.
I mean, you know, we're not even...
I know.
We're not, but still, I promise you on my...
I wouldn't...
And, Mr. Gallo,
I would never...
Okay.
Yeah, good.
I'll rest easy now.
You guys are the best.
Hey, try the cafe.
She's probably there, all right?
Hey, and tell her Gary says, "what's up?"
Okay, so you just wanna go straight until sunset, and then you make a right, and, uh, you can't miss it.
Um, before you drop me off,
I can draw you a little map.
What, are you Dora the explorer?
Fuck that.
You're coming with.
Yeah.
I would love to.
Just apparently I have a show coming up, and I really need to rehearse.
I'll pay you, okay?
Pay me?
Uh, no, no.
I don't, um...
You don't, what, need the money?
I beg to differ.
Look, Martin,
I'll be straight with you.
I'm worried here, okay?
This is not like my daughter to just disappear like this.
If you care about her at all,
I would think you would want to know if she's okay or not.
I do.
I do.
Of course I do.
Okay.
Tell me when to turn.
This is where my daughter works?
Yeah.
It's...
It's not that bad.
They got a little gallery now.
It was Ginnie's idea, actually.
Really turned the place around.
Nothing.
Two dudes just came in here.
You know this one?
Yeah.
Tracy.
You're the slut.
The old one, maybe.
You're gross.
I have to go.
Call me if it doesn't stop bleeding.
Tracy, hi.
Uh, it's Martin.
Remember me?
No.
Uh, Ginnie's boyfriend.
Ex-boyfriend.
Is Ginnie working today?
Ginnie doesn't work here anymore.
What?
Since when?
Since none of your business.
I'm her father...
Trying to find her.
Oh.
She quit, like, a month ago, maybe.
Do you know where she's working now?
I think she works at some restaurant.
Lizzie, our manager, would know, but she's at Moglu right now.
Moglu?
The yoga place, right, on Hyperion?
Did you check her Facebook?
Checked her Facebook.
Twitter?
Twitter.
Yeah.
You tweet something, will you?
Oh, I don't...
I don't Twitter...
Or tweet or, you know, twit.
'Course you don't.
Look, um, Tracy, would you mind just putting something out there...
I already did it.
You... you did what?
I tweeted it.
Great.
What...
What did you tweet?
"Baller old guy, creepy young guy looking for Ginnie g.
#random #doable."
I'm creepy?
W-why am I creepy?
I've met her many times, many times.
Yeah.
She seemed like she... was she stoned?
Is this whole neighborhood stoned?
Uh, maybe she was stoned.
You know, this... this neighborhood's probably 70% stoned, 80% on a Sunday.
All right, where's the yoga place?
Uh, just that-a-way.
So, uh, where'd you say you were coming from?
Mumbai.
Oh, Mumbai!
Yeah.
Ever been?
Uh, no, no.
But I-I'd like to.
It's a shithole.
Huh.
Huh.
Well, I guess I can, uh, cross that off the list then.
I need to take this.
Okay.
Barry.
Talk to me.
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks again for coming.
Hey, Lizzie.
Martin.
What are you doing here?
Uh...
Please, please do not fuck with my yoga buzz.
No.
No, uh...
I was just wondering...
I've been looking for Ginnie.
Martin, Martin, Martin...
Oh, no, no, no.
Martin, you've got to get over this Ginnie thing.
She's moving on.
You should, too.
Uh, what do you mean, she's moving on?
What...
Okay, everything is in place.
Barry, look, my phone is about to die.
Okay, Barry, stop talking.
I don't think this is the best move for you, Martin, but if you need some kind of closure or whatever, she's hostessing at Bibola.
Bibola?
What's that?
It's a restaurant, Martin.
It's the new, hot big restaurant in west Hollywood.
Fuck!
My yoga buzz is gone now.
Okay.
Well, thanks for the info, Lizzie.
Shit.
Yeah, Martin, you should know that...
Oh, and by the way, good job.
You know, keep it up.
What the hell does that mean, "good job"?
No, I didn't mean it like...
like...
What did you mean?
I mean, like, yoga.
You know, like "good job, yoga."
Uh-huh.
Like, you look great.
Fuck off, Martin.
Okay?
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
You're an asshole.
Stop talking, Barry.
Just do your fucking job, okay?
So?
She said Ginnie's working at a restaurant in west Hollywood.
Let's go.
Frank.
Wow.
Kelly.
Hi.
Hi.
It's been a minute.
Are you in town for a visit?
Yeah, just popped in.
You look good.
I'm a sweaty mess, but thank you.
You look good.
How long are you in town for?
Very briefly.
Uh, I'm sorry.
We're late to meet my daughter, so...
Oh.
Oh, I won't...
I won't keep you, then.
Well, it was, uh...
It was good to see you.
You, too.
So if you end up sticking around, give me a shout.
Will do.
Take care, Kelly.
Bye.
You're gonna catch flies there, Kermit.
Come on.
Was that that waitress from that night we all had dinner?
I don't know, maybe.
So what?
No, i... nothing.
I mean, you know, you must have made quite an impression on her.
Where we going?
Uh, it's just up that-a-way.
That's gotta be the 15th fucking time you said "that-a-way."
Are you Hopalong Cassidy?
Who's Hopalong Cassidy?
Ha... get in the car.
I thought there was a little something going on that night.
Forget about it.
No, I know.
I know.
It's none of my business.
She's very attractive.
Yes.
She's an attractive woman.
Okay?
Deal with it.
Very attractive.
So how did that work?
Did she slip you her number...
Would you fucking forget about it?
Please?
Jesus.
Okay, okay.
Yeesh.
Nice.
Sweet.
You like Bob Seger?
Yeah.
I love Bob Seger.
"Beautiful loser," "stranger in town,"
those are some of my favorite albums ever.
Might be hope for you yet.
MAITRE d' says she quit about 10 days ago all of a sudden, has no idea why.
She only worked here two weeks.
That is pretty weird.
Yeah, it is.
Well, want to grab a bite?
Here?
Sure.
Why not?
Gotta refuel, right?
I mean, you must be starving.
Let me buy you dinner.
That's very nice of you.
I guess I am pretty hungry.
Good.
Oh, yeah, Ginnie.
Yeah, I love Ginnie.
Ginnie's great.
I was bummed when she quit.
But I think maybe she got a better job.
You know where?
I don't.
But I can ask around.
That'd be great.
Thanks.
In the meantime, can I get you anything to start?
I think we'll skip straight to the entree.
We're in a bit of a rush.
I'll take the, uh, steak-frites, rare.
I guess I'll have, uh...
You know what?
I'll get what he's getting, uh, the... the steak.
Excellent.
Rare as well?
Uh, yeah, yeah, rare.
Very good.
This place is pretty, uh, chichi.
Yeah, for you, I guess, eating tofu out of a paper bag or whatever.
That is how I usually eat, actually.
She'll turn up, Mr. Gallo.
She will.
Have you, um...
Talked to Ginnie's mom?
No.
I was just thinking, uh, maybe she's heard from her.
I don't want to worry her.
Right, but, you know, they're pretty close.
I mean, maybe she knows where she is.
And what if she doesn't?
Then she's in a panic.
And whose fault is that?
Yours?
Well, no, it would be yours, actually, because it's your idea.
Maybe she lost her phone.
If she lost her phone, then she wouldn't get your messages.
Martin, I get that you think I'm being paranoid here, okay?
But believe me, shit happens every day.
Friend of mine's daughter takes a little trip to Europe.
She gets grabbed 20 minutes out of Orly.
Jesus.
Yeah.
Lucky for them I know a thing or two about a thing or two.
I was able to get her back.
A thing or two?
I know how to handle a situation like that, let's just say.
Wait.
Like those Liam NEESON movies?
What?
You know, those Liam NEESON movies.
His... his daughter gets kidnapped or his wife.
This is not a movie, Martin.
This is life.
What... what is so funny?
Oh, just, uh...
It just reminds me of...
Ginnie could never explain what you do.
It always seemed so mysterious to us.
We used to joke that you were a, uh, um, an arms dealer or something, you know, something badass.
Well, something like that, but not quite so glamorous, I guess.
So what is it that you do, exactly, then?
I'm in procurement.
Okay.
Huh.
Procurement.
So what about you?
How's it going with the music?
Well, I guess I've got that show coming up with my band, but I'm not sure that I want to do it.
Not sure?
Well, what's the issue?
Well, it's been a while, and I guess I've been trying to figure some stuff out actually.
I mean...
Finally hit me.
What's the endgame?
I mean, I'm probably never gonna make...
A real living at it, or at least one decent enough to support a family or...
Are you good at it?
Yeah, I am.
Then you should play the show.
Waiter:
Here we are.
No luck on the Ginnie front, I'm sorry to say.
Well, thanks for trying.
You know, it is Thursday, though.
You know, you might want to try rococo.
You know her friend Trev?
He's awesome.
He's been DJING there every Thursday.
Yeah, I know Trevor.
You know the place?
Enjoy your meal.
Dig in.
You okay there, bub?
It's been a while since I ate meat.
Yeah.
Like how long?
Oh, three...
Maybe five years.
Nobody made you order it.
Tell you what, let's go to that rococo place, get a drink, settle your stomach, huh?
I guess one drink couldn't hurt.
If she's there, great.
If not, maybe you can point out somebody that knows her, huh?
You're the boss.
Now you're getting it.
This place is impossible.
We're never getting in.
What, are you kidding me?
Come on.
Where are you...
All right.
He's with me.
Have a good night.
How'd you do that?
I spoke the guy's language.
What... what was it, Samoan?
What, you spoke Samoan?
Martin, look alive.
Dennis said he hadn't seen her, but you never know.
Dennis?
You spoke to that guy for, like, three seconds.
Martin, look around.
See if you can spot anyone who knows Ginnie.
No, I don't know, Mr. Gallo.
This really doesn't look like her kind of crowd.
Come on.
Let's get that drink.
Two Taliskers, neat.
You got it.
See anything?
No.
There you go.
I think I, uh...
Good.
Hey, Megan.
Oh, my god.
Martin!
Megan!
What the fuck are you doing here?
I'm looking for Ginnie, actually.
Oh, Martin, you gotta get over it.
It's so sad, like...
No, I'm...
I'm over it.
Uh, it's just her dad is looking for her, actually.
Do you... do you know if she's gonna be here tonight?
What?
Do you know if she's coming here tonight?
Who?
Ginnie!
Get over it, Martin!
'Kay.
Oh, wow.
She's very drunk.
Yeah.
Hey, uh, Lois.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Martin, right?
Yes!
Thank you!
Oh, sorry?
I just, uh... have you seen Ginnie by any chance?
I'm sorry.
Who?
Ginnie, my ex-girlfriend.
Yeah.
No, I haven't seen her.
Sorry.
It's so loud in here.
I know.
It's unbelievably loud in here.
I feel like I'm screaming at you.
It probably looks like we're having a horrible, horrible argument.
Fuck you, you fucking asshole!
I swear to fucking god!
Woman:
Uh, what was that?
I'm sorry.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I was kidding.
It was a joke about arguments.
Oh, man.
Good.
Good.
I probably went too far.
No.
Sorry.
I don't think I've seen her in here for a few weeks.
Is she missing or something?
Something like that.
This one's on the house all right?
Thank you.
You know, you ought to talk to that guy she's seeing.
She's seeing somebody?
Yeah, cute guy, too, a big tipper.
They met here, I think.
You seen him lately?
No.
I haven't seen either of 'em.
Just a second.
So do you come here often?
No, never.
It's a little bit too, like...
Axe body spray?
Yes.
Hey, I heard you guys are playing this weekend, right?
Yeah.
Uh...
I don't know if that's gonna happen.
Yeah, I saw you play, like...
like a year ago at the river room.
You were really good, kind of like...
The punch brothers meets, like, the foggy mountain boys meets, like, the muppets.
Yeah, thanks, I think.
That's at least partially what... exactly what...
Man:
Marty?
Hey, Trevor.
They let you in here?
Yeah.
Well, you know, Dennis is a friend, so...
Oh man.
I know this guy!
He's an idiot!
Hey, um, I think my friend is leaving, so I have to go.
Okay.
And if I do play that show, uh, maybe I'll see you there.
Yeah.
Good to see you.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Listen, Trevor, have you seen Ginnie recently?
Uh, yeah, I'm just gonna do you a solid and not even answer that, bro.
I don't know what your problem is with me.
Hey, I told you guys about Marty here, right?
He plays old-timey music on his banjo like he's old McDonald or some shit, and, like, 10 people show up.
It's hilarious.
Yeah, well, you know, what's hilarious is, uh, you know, you look like a... a rapist...
Like you've committed rape.
You know why Ginnie dumped you?
'Cause she's way too fine for your hella broke ass.
I kind of want to punch you in the face right now.
You know, Marty, a woman like Ginnie, deserves to be given the finer things in life.
And there's a long line of dudes who want to give it to her.
Hey, Martin.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
I was just talking to Ginnie's, uh, friend Trevor, just asking him if he's seen Ginnie.
And?
And I was telling Marty here that the way that girl's been working through their breakup, she could be facedown in any bed in a 10-mile rad...
Look out!
Time to go.
Holy shit.
You flattened that guy out.
I shouldn't have done that.
Oh, fuck that guy.
Never been in a bar fight before.
That was...
That was so amazing when I was like, "look out!"
You're a real lifesaver.
I mean...
I feel like I could have totally held my own, though.
I've got a ton of pent-up rage
I've never gotten to use.
Maybe we should go back.
Gallo:
Simmer down, Mike Tyson.
Oh, shit.
I know that girl.
E'eryone is right now...
Megan?
Where are my keys?
Megan, are...
Are you okay?
Why is Bri-baby being such a dick-face right now?
Um, i...
I don't know who that is.
Bri-baby.
Oh, I'm so outta here.
And if he doesn't like it, he can kiss my ass.
Well, uh...
Is this my car?
Well, oh, oh, no.
This my car?
I don't think it's such a good idea for you to be driving right now, Megan.
Well, maybe it's not such a good idea for your face to be a dick right now.
Right.
Okay.
Uh...
Mr. Gallo...
Yeah.
Where do you live, Megan?
You know where.
Burger king.
Because we're trying to drive you home.
Oh, I don't want to go home.
I want to go to the par-tay.
Are you still on sweetzer?
I want to go to the party so I can blow Dan Franklin.
Let's get her home, for Dan Franklin's sake.
Yeah, I think she's still on sweetzer.
It's just a right at the next light.
Yeah?
Okay, slow down, Barry.
What the hell do you mean they're backing out?
They...
Barry.
Barry.
Barry.
Fuck.
Fucking phone died.
Perfect.
Take a picture, and post it on Bri-baby's Twitter fuck.
You gonna make it upstairs okay?
Where is it?
Where it's at?
We'll...
We'll help you up.
Got it.
Why don't you get rid of Martin so me and you can go to the party and party?
I think you're kind of partied out, kiddo.
Ah, I'm fine.
I had, like, two shots.
I'm fuckin' fine.
I just need to spit.
Megan:
Where are you taking me?
Okay.
All right.
There you go.
Where am I?
Move just a little bit.
Okay.
Drink this.
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
Megan...
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh...
Drink this.
It's gonna make you feel better.
Mm.
I'm not thirsty.
It'll make you feel better, Megan.
Uh-uh.
Drink it.
We can make out if you want.
That's a nice offer, but I'm good.
Mm, 'cause you're so in love with Ginnie still.
Well, sure, that, and I think you still have some vomit in your hair.
That's fucked up, dude.
'Cause you know she's in love with someone else.
She is?
Mm-hmm.
Who's that?
Mr. hot stuff.
Mm.
Mr. hot stuff?
Dude's ripped.
That's...
Awesome.
This Mr. hot stuff...
Does he have a name?
Megan?
Megan, what's his name?
M-Megan.
Megan.
Megan.
This girl is friends with my daughter?
Yeah.
This isn't Ginnie, Mr. Gallo.
She's not like this.
Let me find you a shirt.
What the fuck is going on here?
Hey, uh, no.
Now, um...
What the fuck is going on here?
Hey, relax, okay?
We gave the girl a ride.
That's all.
That's my fucking girlfriend, dude!
Oh, you're, um, Bri-baby.
I-I'm Martin.
I'm Martin.
I'm Ginnie's ex-boyfriend,
Megan's friend Ginnie.
Why is this dude fucking shirtless?
Just relax, Bri-baby.
Your girlfriend threw up on me is all.
Tell you what.
We'll just, uh, give you a few dollars for the shirt, and, uh, we'll just...
Hey, Martin...
Fuck.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Martin:
Hey!
I think he's...
He's...
Oh, he's breathing.
He's breathing.
Good for him.
Let's get out of here.
That-a-way.
That doesn't look too bad.
Fucking hurts.
How 'bout the smell?
I still smell like vomit?
Little bit.
Oh.
What?
Thanks.
You really had my back up there.
Yeah, well, Mr. Gallo...
You can call me frank.
I don't think I can do that, Mr. Gallo, but you're welcome.
Megan said Ginnie had a new boyfriend.
Yeah.
Mr. hot stuff.
Bartender at the club said the same thing.
Well, so...
We probably won't be finding her tonight, and that's because she's with him.
Look, Martin...
So even if we do find her, find them, how's it gonna look?
I'm tooling around with her dad.
She's shacked up with her new boyfriend.
So she's dating someone else.
So what?
I mean, don't you still want to know that she's okay?
Aren't you at all worried that none of the people we talked to tonight know where she is?
Of course I'm worried about her.
Because I thought you still cared about her.
Of course I still care about her!
She broke my heart!
Has that not been spelled out enough for you tonight?
Your daughter fucked my shit up.
My life has been a complete wreck for the last three months.
I mean, I can't eat.
I can't think straight.
I can't play music.
All I've literally been able to do...
Is sleep.
So what do you want to do, go home?
Yes.
Crawl into bed, sleep some more?
Yes, that's exactly what I wanna do.
Martin, I get it.
I do, but...
It's a fucking terrible feeling.
It sucks, but...
I don't think retreating into your shell is doing you a lot of good.
Listen, I'm telling you this from personal experience, okay?
Life goes by really fast.
If you half-ass it now, you're gonna feel it later.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Where to now?
There you go, juicy.
Since we're, um, exploring our options...
And I know this is a sensitive area, but maybe you could try calling Ginnie's mom.
I'm not calling Ginnie's mother, period.
End of story.
End of story.
Okay, but I was thinking...
All right.
So why'd you and Ginnie break up?
You know that prizewinning douchebag
Trevor back at the club, he was saying that Ginnie is out of my league.
She's an amazing girl, as you obviously know.
She's smart, beautiful, funny, and tough.
Yeah, and, um...
She is out of my league.
Well...
Maybe she saw something you don't.
Maybe she did, but I started to get insecure about it, and then I got jealous and moody.
I don't know.
It was my fault.
I just...
I fucked it up.
I fucked it all up.
We all fuck it up sometimes.
There it is.
So procurement, what is that?
Forget about it.
No, no.
I'm curious, really.
I bid on contracts from foreign governments to procure for them anything they need in bulk, grain, seed, fertilizer, fucking nuts and bolts, what have you.
Ah.
Okay.
Procurement.
Actually, figuring how to get 20 tons of corn feed from Germany to Nigeria can be more exciting than it might sound like.
But it's also...
Just not a normal lifestyle, you know?
Makes it harder to see my daughter, for example.
Hey, you know that other girl at the club?
What girl?
What do you mean, "what girl?"
The one I saw you talking to.
She's into you.
What, Lois?
Wait.
How...
How did you even...
You weren't even there.
Jesus, Martin, wake up.
90% of that shit is body language, okay?
She's into you.
Wow, really?
Huh, Lois.
I just...
You gotta be kidding me.
Gary?
Hey!
Hey, how's it going, guys?
Hey, did you find Ginnie?
Was she at the cafe?
No.
Aw, bummer.
Bummer.
You don't think she got kidnapped, do you?
No!
Jesus, Gary!
Hey, does Roberta know you're here?
Yeah.
Yeah, no.
She sent me out for groceries.
Um, I had to replace the cheese.
Yeah, so how's that going, the grocery shopping?
I don't know.
I think I just, um, needed...
Air.
Yeah, 'cause actually, uh...
I don't know if you guys noticed, but Roberta and I have actually been having a lot of problems lately.
No shit?
Really?
No idea.
Apparently, the sight of my face nauseates her is what she told me verbatim.
Mm.
Sorry to hear that, Gare.
Thanks.
Uh, how 'bout if I buy you another one?
Yeah!
Yeah, man!
Now we're talking!
Definitely!
Yeah, one more for our friend.
One more.
Yeah, on him.
He's...
I got it.
On him, yeah.
Bartender:
All right.
Mm.
Always tastes better when it's free.
Heh.
It does, though, a little bit.
Yeah, no, I remember those days.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
God.
Okay, back to business.
What do we know about this guy, Mr. hot stuff?
Mr. who?
Ginnie's got a new boyfriend.
Really?
Damn it.
For you, man.
Damn it.
That sucks for you.
We know he's a regular at the club.
Bartender says he's a big tipper.
And he's ripped, apparently.
So he goes to the gym, frequents nightclubs, likes to throw his money around, maybe act like a big shot.
Sounds like an asshole.
This is what I'm saying.
I smell a rat here.
Hmm.
What about with Martin?
Did you smell a rat when you met him?
No, no rat.
Field mouse, maybe.
Field mouse.
Hah hah.
He's right.
You're a field mouse, bro.
This is great.
This is what I'm talking about.
This is just guys being guys, drinking beer, and busting balls.
"Field mouse."
Mm.
Mm-mmm.
Next round is on me.
I insist.
You've been more than generous, Mr. Gallo.
Got an emergency 20 in here somewhere.
No way.
Ohh.
I been looking for this, my 'shrooms.
You guys want some?
Huh?
Hey, we should do these together, go camping.
Joshua tree.
You should probably put those away, like, now.
Wait.
Japanese paper.
Gary:
Hey, man.
Aw, man.
Ah, dude.
Gary, you dumbass, drug-addled son of a bitch,
I could kiss you right now.
Okay, but we should wait 'til after we eat the 'shrooms.
Are you kidding me?
Are you just completely out to lunch?
Martin, who cares?
We have Ginnie's address.
Come on.
Let's go.
No, no, no, no.
We've been searching for Ginnie all day and night all over town while her address has been sitting in his pocket, wrapping his stupid 'shrooms!
Martin, man, I-I'm really sorry.
I am, but you just...
Martin, come on.
Let it go.
Field mouse, huh?
Hey, guys, wait.
Can I come?
Gary:
Whoo-hoo!
This is great, really.
Really great, man.
Call to adventure, you know?
We're on the case.
Oh, you know what it's...
It's, um...
It's like that movie, that movie...
John Wayne...
Whoa!
Whuhh!
Mr. Gallo, you sure you're okay to drive?
Sound like my ex.
"The searchers."
"The searchers." That's it.
Ah, man, that's an awesome movie.
Hey, do either of you have any weed on you?
I don't like to 'Shroom without a little weed.
You know, I bet I can get my dealer to come meet us.
What's the, um...
Gary...
We're not gonna have your weed dealer meet us at my daughter's place.
Right.
No, right.
Right.
Um...
Oh, shit.
Sycamore, right?
What's the address?
1030 sycamore.
Terri Sadler.
That's her roommate, right?
Yeah, that's her.
She's the...
The jittery girl.
You know her, right?
No, but keep asking.
Ohh!
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
I can't get unbuckled.
Gary, just stay with the car.
Mm-hmm.
Windows are dark.
Yeah, well, some people are actually asleep after midnight.
Okay.
When you and Ginnie lived together, where did you hide the spare key?
Where?
Um, that's not really, um...
That's kind of private.
Martin, I'm not gonna rob you.
What am I gonna take, your bong?
Where did you hide the key?
It was under a rock, but...
What...
What are you gonna...
No, you're not gonna...
It's okay.
I'm her father.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mr. Gallo, you are not...
Martin, I need to see if my daughter is in trouble.
Okay, this is a very bad idea.
You know what, Martin?
I'm starting to see why Ginnie kicked you to the curb.
Oh, are you?
And why's that?
Yeah.
'Cause you're a namby-pamby, little fucking pain in the ass.
Now move it.
No.
Seriously?
Martin, you do not want to be standing in my fucking way right now.
Fine.
That's what I thought.
Fuck this.
Shit.
Gary:
Because it's...
It's frustrating, 'cause you don't trust me like I trust you!
Because all you wanna do is sit around watching "game of thrones"
and fantasize about Jaime Lannister!
You do!
You want to bang the shit out of Jaime Lannister!
That's fine!
I don't get mad at you, because I get it!
Even with one hand, he's beautiful!
Hello.
Anybody home?
Shit.
Woman:
Hello.
Mr. Gallo.
I think Ginnie's room's over here.
Thank fucking god.
What the fuck?
Wait.
Hold on.
I found out where Ginnie is.
Where?
She went on vacation with her new boyfriend.
His name is kip.
Kip.
Yeah.
I think it sounds pretty serious.
Gary:
And guess what, babe.
'Member those 'shrooms you wouldn't let me take on Halloween?
Well, trick or treat, 'cause I'm taking 'em right now.
Mmm.
Delicious.
I can eat 'shrooms.
I can eat sun chips.
I can eat fucking cheese, because I'm my own man.
I have something inside of me.
I have potential.
I... hello.
Hel...
All right, it's Gary.
Call me back.
Wait a minute.
How do you know where she is?
Don't get mad.
Terri:
Hello?
Is someone there?
Hello?
Shh.
Uh...
Hi...
There.
This is...
No, no, no.
It's...
What is this girl's name?
Um, Tammy, Toni, uh...
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Frank:
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.
You know him.
Run!
I will fucking murder you!
You don't know her?
No.
I don't fucking know her.
Terri:
I will fucking kill you!
Do you hear that, you motherfucker?
!
I have a gun!
You motherfucker, I will...
What do we do?
No way.
No way.
Come on.
Fucking calling the motherfucking cops on you!
I am not getting arrested tonight.
Wait.
Oh.
So beautiful.
I know how you found out Ginnie's on vacation.
You called her mom.
Yeah, that's right.
I did.
I called Connie, who actually talks to Ginnie and cares about what's going on in her life and knows where the hell she is.
You had no right to do that.
I told you I didn't want to worry her.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
We should have called 12 hours ago.
Like, then, maybe you wouldn't have home invaded.
It's complicated, okay?
I didn't do right by Ginnie's mom.
I...
Fucked around when Ginnie was little.
Yeah, it's old news.
I've heard all about it, believe me.
You got a lot of nerve talking to me like that.
Ginnie's mom is fine, Mr. Gallo.
She's happily remarried.
She got over it years ago.
Ginnie did, too.
Freeze!
Stop right there!
I'm gonna let it shine.
I'm gonna let it shine.
I'm gonna let it shine.
I'm shining my light!
This is the police.
Don't move.
Just to be clear, I've always been there for my daughter.
I gave her everything she wanted.
How 'bout your attention?
Oh, sh...
Fuck.
Hi.
We, uh... could we use your bathroom?
Toilet is for customers only.
Uh, here.
Come on.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sorry.
Look, uh, my fault.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Come on.
Let's go.
Both of you, on the ground now!
This day is never-ending.
What is this?
I'm sure it's nothing, babe.
It's fine.
No, kip, they're directly in front of my house.
Okay, look, officers, it's... it's just really a big misunderstanding.
Stop right there, and get down!
Just calm down for a second.
I can explain the whole thing.
That was my daughter's apartment.
On the ground!
Mr. Gallo, get down now.
I will not.
I am an upstanding citizen.
I am a taxpayer.
I am a...
Dad?
Ginnie?
Ginnie?
Gary, stop.
Tastes like glass.
All I wanted was to make it through this breakup in one piece, not be desperate or stalkery or pathetic.
I just needed to wait it out, get to the other side with my pride intact.
Instead, I became my ex-girlfriend's father's idiot lackey, everyone she knows in this town getting an eyeful of what a loser I am.
Ah, Martin, you're not a loser.
Oh, not to mention...
Not to mention the throwing up, the bar brawl, breaking and entering my ex-girlfriend's new home, running from the police...
I really don't need a recap, okay?
I was there.
Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, just shut the fuck up, okay?
!
Just shut the fuck up!
Couple of weeks ago in my hotel in Mumbai,
I woke up in the middle of the night soaked in sweat, didn't know where I was.
I didn't know who I was for a second.
My heart was just going...
Thousand miles a minute.
I mean, i...
I thought I was gonna die.
I called down to the front desk and... and asked 'em to send up a doctor.
And then I'm...
I'm just lying there, thinking, "this is it,"
you know, "this is...
This is it."
And so I called Ginnie...
And Ginnie wasn't there.
And of course the doctor shows up, and he... and he checks everything out.
He says it's not a heart attack.
It's not... it's nothing.
It's a fucking panic attack.
Just ridiculous...
Embarrassing.
I'm at the airport the next morning, and, uh...
No, it's not like there's a layover here.
I'm supposed to be in Geneva right now.
But I came here, because...
Because I needed to see my little girl.
I have no one else, Martin.
You know?
She's all I got.
Hey, you guys, you guys, you guys, you guys...
Can we just be serious for one moment?
Okay, can we just...
Talk real shit?
Visitor for Gary...
"Fulenwilder"?
Huh?
I'm Gary.
Roberta.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my poor, poor baby.
Oh, yeah.
What a night you've had.
Baby, I see your light.
It's, like, blue.
Your aura is blue, like an "avatar" thing.
Ho ho.
You know,
I actually believed you, that you were going to the store to replace the cheese because you felt bad about it.
No, no, no.
Not my Gare.
My Gare's not that kind of boyfriend, is he?
Ow.
Ow.
Ow...
He's more of a call you from jail at 4:00 A.M.
Because I'm tripping my balls off kind of guy.
Ow.
Uh, honey, your aura's turning, like, dark red now.
Good.
Here's the drill.
You're gonna stay here until your arraignment...
Uh-huh.
Which is in two days, and you're gonna sit and think about whether you want to come home or be your own man and let your light shine down.
I want... i want to come home.
I want to come home.
I know you do, honey, but that's because you're scared and stupid right now, so you just sit tight, and sleep on it, okay?
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Okay.
Nice work, guys.
Gary:
I love you!
All right, you two.
Looks like your lawyer has saved your ass.
Ginnie.
What the hell, dad?
I know.
Look, I was worried.
You hadn't returned voice mails or e-mails.
I was on vacation, and I tried to call you back as soon as I got off the plane.
Right.
And of course then my phone was dead, so...
So you thought it would be a good idea to break into my house with my ex-boyfriend?
Look, I'm sorry, okay, but what are you doing running off without telling anybody and not answering your phone?
We were in Bora Bora trying to unplug, and I told mom.
Jesus.
Dad, this is kip.
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
How do you do?
I-I'm sorry about the misunderstanding.
It's my fault.
That's very generous of you, but I'm pretty sure it's all my fault.
Hey.
Kip.
Uh, I'm Martin.
Well, uh, since we have your father's rental car, you want to...
Want to take him back to the hotel?
I'll take our car.
I'll meet you there?
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm gonna go.
It was nice to meet everybody.
I guess I'll...
I'm gonna be going, too.
Um, Ginnie, I'm so sorry about everything.
It was really nice to see you, though.
Martin.
Martin!
Look, Ginnie,
I'm truly...
No, no, no.
You don't have to apologize.
I know how persuasive my dad can be.
Well, yeah, but go easy on the guy, huh?
I think he's been in a pretty rough place lately.
I'll try.
How are you?
You know, uh...
How have you been?
I actually applied to UCLA, architecture and urban design, and I got in.
Wow.
That's great.
That's what you've always wanted.
That's...
That's great.
I found out last week, and Bora Bora was kip's congratulation gift.
I'm sorry that you had to find out about him like this.
I didn't know if I should call.
Ah, no.
Kip seems great, Ginnie.
And you, you seem...
You seem really happy.
And I'm happy for you.
Your head hurt?
Little bit.
Good.
Look, Ginnie...
I don't want to hear it, dad.
Hey, you didn't tell me you were thinking about going back to school.
You're not in my life.
Okay?
You are never here.
When are you gonna understand that you don't get a say in what I do or where I go or who with?
Look...
You're my dad, and I love you...
And I do know that you love me.
Why do you have to be such an asshole?
I don't know.
Why is the sky blue?
Jimothy:
No, no, no.
Ah, no, no, no, no.
Jimothy...
I'm trying to beat this level, dawg.
Have some respect.
We need to talk.
Well, I'm busy.
And after I beat this level,
I'm gonna do more drugs, have more sex with this very attractive couple, and then sleep for 16 hours, so pencil you in after that.
Hey, it's time for you to move now.
Get your shit, and go.
Listen, man...
You're 30 days past due on rent, so consider it an eviction.
You're done.
This is mine.
You know, I find your newfound confidence intoxicating.
What if we...
Figured out a different way to pay rent...
A physical way?
Connie:
Hello.
Hey, Connie.
I hope it's okay I called.
Frank?
Mr. Gallo.
Jesus.
Would you please fucking call me frank already?
Thanks for coming, frank.
That's nice stuff up there.
Seriously, really, really good.
I enjoyed it.
Ah, thanks.
I thought you were, uh...
Had to be in Geneva.
I figured I'd stick around here, spend a little time with my daughter.
You want a beer?
Sure.
You know, Martin, you went to the mat for me in a big way.
I appreciate it.
Well, I mean...
I won't forget it.
Looks like you got a fan there.
Who?
Oh, Lois?
Yeah, I, uh...
Martin, would you please open your eyes?
That girl is clearly here for you.
We met up before the show.
Did you, now?
Yeah.
You were right about that whole body-language thing.
Look at you.
I am impressed.
Uh...
I should probably go say hi before the second set.
I think you should.
Are you gonna be...
I'm totally good.
Okay.
Um...
Martin...
Get over there.
They sound real good tonight.
Yeah.
You Martin's dad?
His dad?
No, no, no.
No, I'm, uh... whoo!
Captioned by point.360
There he is.
Jesus.
You'll tell him you were the reason we're late, right?
I don't want him to think I don't care about time and stuff.
There's my girl.
There's my dad.
Dad, this is my boyfriend Martin.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Martin.
Mr. Gallo.
I'm Martin.
You're Mr. Gallo.
I know that.
Nice to meet you, Martin.
Fuck.
It's really good to see you.
You look great.
You look tired.
Where you coming from this time?
Singapore.
Ever been?
No, I haven't been.
I hear it's very, um, clean, which I like.
I also hear that they cane you if you spit in the street.
Not that I like that.
Yeah, I don't like that part.
Good evening.
Can I bring you something to drink?
Shall we start with a nice bottle of red?
Martin has a sulfite allergy.
- A sulfite allergy?
- Um, it's not that bad, actually.
I just get a little, hivey.
But I'm fine with water or death.
Okay.
We'll have a bottle of the Chateauneuf-du-Pape.
Excellent choice.
And, Martin, are you sure?
Nothing?
Maybe a beer?
Or are you allergic to hops?
Heh.
You sure you don't want something else, Martin?
No.
This is delicious.
These beets are really well steamed.
I'm sorry.
I gotta take this.
- He hates me.
- He doesn't hate you.
He hates me.
He hates me so much, I'm starting to hate myself.
All that matters is what I think, and I'm a fan.
Yeah?
Big fan.
Huge fan.
All right.
Okay, I got this.
I'll bounce back.
Round two.
- Sorry about that.
- It's, not a problem.
Looks like a, pretty major deal just went down over there by the bar?
- So, Martin, what is it that you do?
- Dad, I told you Martin is a musician.
Right.
Right.
What is it, the, ukulele?
It's the, banjo.
Banjo.
Right, like Kermit the frog.
I guess I assumed the banjo was a hobby.
Well, I have a band, 'Hysterical Kindness'.
It's a bluegrass collective, more Flatt and Scruggs or Punch Brothers than some, you know, Poppy Mumford Sonskindof wannabething.
What's wrong with Mumford Sons?
They're a very successful act, no?
He likes Mumford Sons.
- So where you from?
- Well, I was born in Chicago, but I grew up in Guelph.
- Guelph?
- Guelph, Ontario.
Guelph?
It's...
Canada.
Guelph?
Okay.
Your folks, what do they do?
Jesus, dad, what is with the third degree?
I'm just getting to know the guy.
You don't mind, do you, Martin?
No.
No, no.
It's great.
It's great getting to know someone this, you know, vigorously.
- So your parents?
- Right.
Um...
My mother is an acupuncturist in Toronto, and my father is an, um...
He's an environmental activist in Albuquerque.
He's an environmental activist in Albuquerque, dad.
Deal with it.
I didn't say anything.
I'm sure it's very satisfying work.
He never met a tree that he didn't want to chain himself to.
Sweetie, you have a little, um, salad dressing.
Oops.
Mr. Gallo,
I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.
Could tonight's dinner have gone any worse?
Actually, it could have.
I guess he could have castrated me at the table.
Last time I introduced dad to a boyfriend,
I never heard from the guy again, so...
Wow.
When I disappear next, ask your dad where my body's buried, just as, you know, like, a courtesy to my mom.
Martin, I know he's tough.
But you're not gonna have to deal with him.
I probably won't see him for another year, so...
In that case, I think we should make a plan to see him sooner than that.
- You'd be up for that?
- Absolutely.
I would go through that hell all over again for you.
Coming.
I'm coming.
Mr. Gallo?
- Ginnie home?
- Home?
No.
No.
I mean, she may be home, but...
Ginnie doesn't live here anymore.
We broke up.
Okay.
Want to invite me in?
Yeah.
No, of course.
Sorry.
I was just, getting some work done.
She didn't tell you when we, broke up?
We haven't spoken since Christmas.
Well, I guess you could call her, you know, to get her, new address to go there.
She's not picking up or returning calls or texts.
I was hoping maybe she'd be here.
I just...
I just had a little, get-together last month, so...
- Don't worry about it.
- Just cleaning, anyway.
Yeah.
So, any idea where I could find my daughter?
- Did you try Gary and Roberta?
- Gary and Roberta?
Yeah.
When she moved out, she went to go stay with them.
Do you want any coffee?
- That's okay.
Don't bother.
- I'm just gonna make some anyway.
So...
- So when did you two break up?
- About three months ago.
Three months and nine days or something.
I don't... you know, I'm not...
I'm sure she's...
You said she knew you were coming in to town?
I gave her the heads-up I was coming in last minute, but I never got a response.
No, no.
This is...
This is Jimothy.
- He's my new roommate.
- Gotcha.
Jimothy.
Like Timothy with a "J."
No.
Jimothy, this is Mr. Gallo, Ginnie's dad.
- Who?
- Ex-girlfriend's father.
Do you have the bong?
What?
I...
I don't know what you mean?
What do you mean by that?
The bong, thing I smoke weed out of all day.
Is that... is that...
Is that what this is?
I was... yeah, I was looking earlier.
I just didn't...
I was curious.
You're giving me a real stressy vibe, man.
You stressed out?
- What's going on?
- Jimothy, could you just, um...
Just take your weird machine there and just let Mr. Gallo and I talk?
Am I wrong?
Is he giving you a stressy vibe?
- You're not wrong.
- Yeah.
I'm having people over tonight, in case you want to hide in your room again.
You can come.
I thought...
you know, I thought we said, we agreed, you know, last time, you know, with...
With the cops...
So I'm not allowed to have people over in my own home?
No, it's cool.
Whatever.
- Did you get my message?
- What message?
The fiddle player in your band or something came by, wanted you to know you had a show this weekend or something.
- What do you mean?
We have a show?
- I think so.
- Well, did he say when or where?
- Didn't say when.
Didn't say where.
You know, I'm not...
Heh.
He's not...
- We're not friends.
- None of my business.
- W-we're just friends.
- Okay.
When Ginnie moved out, I needed a new roommate to help cover the rent.
Of course.
You don't wanna let go of a prime piece of real estate like this.
Yeah.
No, these crossbeams, you don't always...
I'll go get that coffee.
Look, Martin, I can see you're, a busy man here.
Tomorrow I have to get on a flight to Geneva.
All I want to do is find my daughter, so if you can just point me to her new place, I'll get out of your hair.
We're all out of milk.
And sugar.
But we have syrup.
You want syrup in your coffee, or is that...
Is that weird?
- I don't want syrup.
Thanks.
- Okay.
So do you have an address for this Gary and Roberta?
No, but they're not too far from here.
I don't have an address, but I've been over there.
- So it's close?
- Yeah.
Yes, it's just a couple blocks that-a-way.
Okay.
You want to get dressed, and you can take me over there?
- Now?
- Yes, now, Martin.
Do you mind?
Fuck.
Fuck this.
Hey, Martin, do you mind if I go on this computer for a minute,
- check e-mails?
- Um, yeah, sure.
Go ahead.
Fuck.
Wait!
H-hold on!
Why don't you just...
Holy shit!
You know, I just...
I tell Jimothy not to use my computer, but he does.
Look, Martin, porn is porn, you know, but you gotta hide that shit.
Put it in a folder or something.
Can't just leave it hanging out there.
You know, I...
I can't even believe that they have sites like that on the Internet.
Those poor women.
Okay, you want to put on some pants so we can hit the road?
Here.
You know where we're going.
You drive.
Wasn't ready for that.
Actually, I don't drive.
- What do you mean, you don't drive?
- I don't have my license.
And, also I don't know how.
Nice throw.
How can you not know how to drive in Los Angeles?
- A man should know how to drive.
- I have a bicycle.
Well, congrats on that.
Yeah, it's actually considered very masculine in the Netherlands.
You know, hey, I haven't really been in touch with Ginnie recently,
- so...
- So?
- So I might not come in.
- Fine by me.
You know, not that we're not friends.
I think we're still friends.
- We're still friends on Facebook.
- Martin, where are we going?
It's just up ahead that-a-way and a second left at the light.
It's one of these.
I can never tell which.
They all look the same.
Voice mail's still full.
It's gotta be this one.
I hear fighting.
This is definitely it.
Okay, well, write it down, like, on the dry erase!
'Cause Saturday's my day!
Shit.
Hey.
How's it going, man?
- Um...
- Gary.
Yeah, hey, Martin.
- Hi.
Sorry to just drop by like this.
- Yeah, it...
It really is...
- We're looking for my daughter.
Ginnie.
This is her father, Mr. Gallo.
- He didn't have her new address.
- She, um...
Martin, hi.
They... they're looking for Ginnie, babe.
Um, this is Ginnie's dad.
Hi.
I'm Roberta.
So great to finally meet you.
- Jack, right?
- That would be Ginnie's stepfather.
Right.
Well, don't worry.
She's talked a lot about you, too.
Did you invite them in?
I literally just opened the door.
- Come in.
Come in.
- Yeah, come on in.
Yeah.
- After you.
- Yeah, welcome, welcome.
Mi casa...
Heh heh.
Can I get you something to drink?
Water or kombucha?
Twig tea?
I have some nice biodynamic wine.
Don't bother.
Please, we're just looking for Ginnie.
- Martin said she was staying here.
- She was staying here.
She left about three weeks ago.
Did you try her cell?
I can try her cell.
Phone is off, mailbox full for a couple days now.
Man, sounds to me like she's living off the grid, you know?
Martin, was Ginnie, like, a survivalist, you know?
- Like one of those preppers or...
- Gary, stop talking.
Do you know where she moved when she left here?
Yes.
Um...
What was her name?
Martin, you know her.
Um, the jittery girl.
Always looks like she's about to cry.
You know her.
Doesn't, ring a bell.
- Okay, did Ginnie leave an address?
- Yes.
I think it's on the fridge.
Gary, could you get it, please?
Please come in.
- I'm not seeing it.
- It's on the fridge!
- No, it isn't!
- It's definitely on the fridge.
- I just checked there.
- Jesus.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
- There's no address on the fridge.
- It's on the Japanese paper.
Yeah, no.
I know you think it's there, but it's not there.
On the Japanese paper.
Christ.
Get out of my way.
- Fine.
I don't know how to look.
- It's not there.
You sure you guys don't want anything, like a...
like a beer?
Sure.
I could do a beer.
You know, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
- How have you been, Gary?
- I've been, um...
Work's good.
Work's good.
Yeah.
Gary, where's the tub where we, keep the receipts?
What tub?
I don't know.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
I need to help her out.
What tub are you ta...
The tin?
That's a tin.
That's not a tub.
Tub, tin, whatever.
No, I don't know.
Can I help you find what you're looking for?
Go check the drawer.
The odds-and-ends drawer.
All right, I'm just saying be specific.
We'll find it.
Can I get you guys something?
Are you sure?
Something to drink or cheese?
- We have nice cheese.
- We're out of the cheese, babe.
- Since when?
- Since we finished it.
I didn't finish the cheese, so don't say "we."
I was gonna freeze it for my doula workshop next month.
- It's okay.
We don't need cheese.
- Someone finished the cheese, I guess.
Yeah, someone was hungry in their house, and they ate cheese.
- They ate it all, though.
- Have you seen Ginnie recently?
Brother.
I certainly have not.
We love Ginnie.
Don't get me wrong.
But some of us loved her a little too much, if you know what I mean, and some things got said.
Yeah, some things got said.
You said 'em.
Yeah, I said 'em, all right.
'Cause someone had to say something, 'cause a certain someone in this house wanted to have sex with his daughter.
- Okay, what?
Excuse me?
- No.
No, Mr. Gallo, you know that your daughter is very attractive.
And unfortunately, in this house, that makes certain people very insecure.
Okay, let me translate for Mr. Sensitivity over here.
Ginnie was getting a little sick and tired of being leered at every time she went to the fridge.
It was one time, and I was trying to warn her about the bad milk!
Mr. Gallo, Martin, Ginnie was going for some bad milk in the fridge, so I was peering to see what she was grabbing from the fridge, in order to say, "Hey, don't ingest that."
'Cause you might get sick." I was doing a service.
You're a knight in shining armor, aren't you, Gare?
Here's an idea.
Maybe you could sort it out with them
- at your favorite strip joint...
- That happened at a bachelor party!
They're strippers!
They climb all over you!
You can't stop them!
You guys know!
They're like monkeys at a zoo!
The monkeys climb all over you at a zoo?
Really?
Interesting zoo.
Okay, we should probably get going.
If you find that address, you could give me a shout, that'd be great.
- We'll find it.
Don't worry.
- Thank you.
I'm so sorry about the cheese.
You know, it was very expensive cheese.
Jesus, Roberta, he doesn't care about the goddamn cheese.
You, might want to try the cafe.
Martin knows where it is.
- She's probably working there.
- The cafe?
- Great.
Martin?
- Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
All right.
Well, thanks, guys.
Thank you for...
That.
All right.
Why do you have to attack me?
Why do you have to be so hostile?
And now I completely lost face.
I gotta go apologize for something I didn't even do.
Hey, Ma-Martin.
Are we cool, man?
- I just want you to know truly...
- Yeah, no.
- Bro, I would never...
- Gary, it's fine.
- I mean, you know, we're not even...
- I know.
We're not, but still, I promise you on my...
I wouldn't...
And, Mr. Gallo,
- I would never...
- Yeah, good.
I'll rest easy now.
You guys are the best.
Hey, try the cafe.
She's probably there, all right?
Hey, and tell her Gary says, "What's up?"
Okay, so you just wanna go straight until Sunset, and then you make a right, and, you can't miss it.
Um, before you drop me off, I can draw you a little map.
What are you, Dora the Explorer?
Fuck that.
You're coming with.
Yeah.
I would love to.
Just apparently I have a show coming up,
- and I really need to rehearse.
- I'll pay you, okay?
Pay me?
No, no.
I don't, um...
You don't, what, need the money?
I beg to differ.
Look, Martin, I'll be straight with you.
I'm worried here, okay?
This is not like my daughter to just disappear like this.
If you care about her at all, I'd think you'd wanna know if she's okay or not.
I do.
I do.
Of course I do.
Okay.
Tell me when to turn.
- This is where my daughter works?
- Yeah.
It's...
It's not that bad.
They got a little gallery now.
It was Ginnie's idea, actually.
Really turned the place around.
Nothing.
Two dudes just came in here.
- You know this one?
- Yeah.
Tracy.
You're the slut.
The old one, maybe.
You're gross.
I have to go.
Call me if it doesn't stop bleeding.
Tracy, hi.
It's Martin.
Remember me?
- No.
- Ginnie's boyfriend.
- Ex-boyfriend.
- Is Ginnie working today?
- Ginnie doesn't work here anymore.
- What?
Since when?
Since none of your business.
I'm her father...
Trying to find her.
She quit, like, a month ago, maybe.
- Do you know where she's working now?
- I think she works at some restaurant.
Lizzie, our manager, would know, but she's at Moglu right now.
Moglu?
The yoga place, right, on Hyperion?
- Did you check her Facebook?
- Checked her Facebook.
- Twitter?
- Twitter.
Yeah.
- You tweet something, will you?
- I don't...
I don't Twitter...
Or tweet or, you know, twit.
'Course you don't.
Look, um, Tracy, would you mind just putting something out there...
- I already did it.
- You did what?
- I tweeted it.
- Great.
What did you tweet?
"Baller old guy, creepy young guy looking for Ginnie G. #Random #Doable."
I'm creepy?
W-why am I creepy?
I've met her many times, many times.
Yeah.
She seemed like she... was she stoned?
- Is this whole neighborhood stoned?
- Maybe she was stoned.
You know, this... this neighborhood's probably 70% stoned, 80% on a Sunday.
- All right, where's the yoga place?
- Just that-a-way.
So, where'd you say you were coming from?
- Mumbai.
- Oh, Mumbai!
- Yeah.
Ever been?
- No, no.
But I-I'd like to.
It's a shithole.
Well, I guess I can, cross that off the list then.
- I need to take this.
- Okay.
Barry.
Talk to me.
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks again for coming.
- Hey, Lizzie.
- Martin.
What are you doing here?
Please, please do not fuck with my yoga buzz.
No.
No...
I was just wondering...
I've been looking for Ginnie.
- Martin, Martin, Martin...
- No, no, no.
Martin, you've got to get over this Ginnie thing.
She's moving on.
You should, too.
- What do you mean, she's moving on?
- Okay, everything is in place.
Barry, look, my phone is about to die.
Okay, Barry, stop talking.
I don't think this is the best move for you, Martin, but if you need some kind of closure or whatever, she's hostessing at Bibola.
- Bibola?
What's that?
- It's a restaurant, Martin.
It's the new, hot big restaurant in West Hollywood.
Fuck!
My yoga buzz is gone now.
- Okay.
Thanks for the info, Lizzie.
- Martin, you should know that...
And by the way, good job.
You know, keep it up.
- What the hell does that mean?
- No, I didn't mean it like...
like...
- What did you mean?
- You know, like "good job, yoga."
- Like, you look great.
- Fuck off, Martin.
Okay?
- Absolutely.
Yeah.
- Thank you.
Good-bye.
- You're an asshole.
- Stop talking, Barry.
Just do your fucking job, okay?
She said Ginnie's working at a restaurant in West Hollywood.
Let's go.
- Frank.
Wow.
- Kelly.
Hi.
Hi.
It's been a minute.
Are you in town for a visit?
Yeah, just popped in.
You look good.
I'm a sweaty mess, but thank you.
You look good.
How long are you in town for?
Very briefly.
I'm sorry.
We're late to meet my daughter, so...
I won't keep you, then.
Well, it was good to see you.
- You, too.
- So if you end up sticking around,
- give me a shout.
- Will do.
Take care, Kelly.
You're gonna catch flies there, Kermit.
Come on.
Was that that waitress from that night we all had dinner?
I don't know, maybe.
So what?
- No, I... nothing.
I mean, you know, you must have made quite an impression on her.
- Where we going?
- It's just up that-a-way.
That's gotta be the 15th fucking time you said "that-a-way."
- Are you Hopalong Cassidy?
- Who's Hopalong Cassidy?
Ha... get in the car.
I thought there was a little something going on that night.
- Forget about it.
- No, I know.
It's none of my business.
- She's very attractive.
- Yes.
She's an attractive woman.
- Okay?
Deal with it.
- Very attractive.
So how did that work?
Did she slip you her number...
- Would you fucking forget about it?
- Jesus.
Okay, okay.
Yeesh.
- Nice.
- Sweet.
You like Bob Seger?
Yeah.
I love Bob Seger.
"Beautiful Loser," "Stranger in Town,"
those are some of my favorite albums ever.
Might be hope for you yet.
Maitre d' says she quit about 10 days ago all of a sudden, has no idea why.
- She only worked here two weeks.
- That is pretty weird.
Yeah, it is.
Well, want to grab a bite?
- Here?
- Sure.
Why not?
Gotta refuel, right?
I mean, you must be starving.
Let me buy you dinner.
That's very nice of you.
- I guess I am pretty hungry.
- Good.
Yeah, Ginnie.
Yeah, I love Ginnie.
Ginnie's great.
I was bummed when she quit.
But I think maybe she got a better job.
- You know where?
- I don't.
But I can ask around.
That'd be great.
Thanks.
In the meantime, can I get you anything to start?
I think we'll skip straight to the entree.
We're in a bit of a rush.
- I'll take the, steak-frites, rare.
- I guess I'll have...
You know what?
I'll get what he's getting, the... the steak.
- Excellent.
Rare as well?
- Yeah, yeah, rare.
Very good.
This place is pretty, chichi.
Yeah, for you, I guess, eating tofu out of a paper bag or whatever.
That is how I usually eat, actually.
She'll turn up, Mr. Gallo.
She will.
Have you, um...
- Talked to Ginnie's mom?
- No.
I was just thinking, maybe she's heard from her.
I don't want to worry her.
- Right, but, they're pretty close.
- I mean, maybe she knows where she is.
- And what if she doesn't?
Then she's in a panic.
And whose fault is that?
- Yours?
- No, it would be yours, actually, because it's your idea.
Maybe she lost her phone.
Then she wouldn't get your messages.
Martin, I get that you think I'm being paranoid here, okay?
But believe me, shit happens every day.
Friend of mine's daughter takes a little trip to Europe.
She gets grabbed 20 minutes out of Orly.
- Jesus.
- Yeah.
Lucky for them I know a thing or two about a thing or two.
I was able to get her back.
A thing or two?
- I know how to handle a situation like that, let's just say.
Wait.
Like those Liam Neeson movies?
- What?
You know, those Liam Neeson movies.
His daughter gets kidnapped, or his wife.
This is not a movie, Martin.
This is life.
What... what is so funny?
Just...
It just reminds me of...
Ginnie could never explain what you do.
It always seemed so mysterious to us.
We used to joke that you were a, um, an arms dealer or something, you know, something badass.
Well, something like that, but not quite so glamorous, I guess.
So what is it that you do, exactly, then?
I'm in procurement.
Okay.
Procurement.
So what about you?
How's it going with the music?
Well, I guess I've got that show coming up with my band, but I'm not sure that I want to do it.
Not sure?
Well, what's the issue?
Well, it's been a while, and I guess I've been trying to figure some stuff out actually.
I mean...
Finally hit me.
What's the endgame?
I mean, I'm probably never gonna make...
A real living at it, or at least one decent enough to support a family or...
Are you good at it?
- Yeah, I am.
- Then you should play the show.
Here we are.
No luck on the Ginnie front, I'm sorry to say.
- Well, thanks for trying.
- You know, it is Thursday, though.
You know, you might want to try Rococo.
You know her friend Trev?
He's awesome.
- He's been DJ-ing there every Thursday.
- Yeah, I know Trevor.
You know the place?
Enjoy your meal.
Dig in.
You okay there, bub?
- It's been a while since I ate meat.
- Yeah.
Like how long?
Three...
Maybe five years.
Nobody made you order it.
Tell you what, let's go to that Rococo place, get a drink, settle your stomach?
I guess one drink couldn't hurt.
If she's there, great.
If not, maybe you can point out somebody that knows her?
- You're the boss.
- Now you're getting it.
This place is impossible.
We're never getting in.
What, are you kidding me?
Come on.
Where are you...
All right.
He's with me.
Have a good night.
- How'd you do that?
- I spoke the guy's language.
What was it, Samoan?
What, you spoke Samoan?
Martin, look alive.
Dennis said he hadn't seen her, but you never know.
Dennis?
You spoke to that guy for, like, three seconds.
Martin, look around.
See if you can spot anyone who knows Ginnie.
I don't know, Mr. Gallo.
This really doesn't look like her kind of crowd.
Come on.
Let's get that drink.
- Two taliskers, neat.
- You got it.
- See anything?
- No.
There you go.
- I think I...
- Good.
- Hey, Megan.
- My God.
Martin!
- Megan!
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- I'm looking for Ginnie, actually.
- Martin, you gotta get over it.
- It's so sad, like...
- No, I'm...
I'm over it.
It's just her dad is looking for her, actually.
Do you... do you know if she's gonna be here tonight?
- What?
- Do you know if she's coming here tonight?
- Who?
- Ginnie!
Get over it, Martin!
- 'Kay.
- Wow.
- She's very drunk.
- Yeah.
Hey, Lois.
- Right?
- Yeah.
Martin, right?
- Yes!
Thank you!
- Sorry?
I just...
Have you seen Ginnie by any chance?
- I'm sorry.
Who?
- Ginnie, my ex-girlfriend.
- Yeah.
No, I haven't seen her.
- Sorry.
It's so loud in here.
I know.
It's unbelievably loud in here.
I feel like I'm screaming at you.
It probably looks like we're having a horrible, horrible argument.
Fuck you, you fucking asshole!
I swear to fucking God!
What was that?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I was kidding.
- It was a joke about arguments.
- Man.
Good.
Good.
- I probably went too far.
Sorry.
- No.
I don't think I've seen her in here for a few weeks.
- Is she missing or something?
- Something like that.
- This one's on the house, all right?
- Thank you.
You know, you ought to talk to that guy she's seeing.
- She's seeing somebody?
- Yeah, cute guy, too, a big tipper.
- They met here, I think.
- You seen him lately?
No.
I haven't seen either of 'em.
Just a second.
- So do you come here often?
- No, never.
- It's a little bit too, like...
- Axe body spray?
Yes.
Hey, I heard you guys are playing this weekend, right?
Yeah.
- I don't know if that's gonna happen.
- Yeah, I saw you play, like... like a year ago at the River Room.
You were really good, kind of like...
The Punch Brothers meets the Foggy Mountain Boys meets the Muppets.
Yeah, thanks, I think.
That's at least partially what... exactly what...
- Marty?
- Hey, Trevor.
- They let you in here?
- Yeah.
Well, Dennis is a friend, so...
Man.
I know this guy!
He's an idiot!
Hey, um, I think my friend is leaving, so I have to go.
Okay.
And if I do play that show, maybe I'll see you there.
- Yeah.
Good to see you.
Bye.
- Bye-bye.
Listen, Trevor, have you seen Ginnie recently?
Yeah, I'm just gonna do you a solid and not even answer that, bro.
- I don't know what your problem is with me.
- I told you guys about Marty here, right?
He plays old-timey music on his banjo like he's old McDonald or some shit, and, like, 10 people show up.
It's hilarious.
Yeah, well, you know, what's hilarious is, you know, you look like a... a rapist...
Like you've committed rape.
You know why Ginnie dumped you?
'Cause she's way too fine for your hella broke ass.
I kind of want to punch you in the face right now.
You know, Marty, a woman like Ginnie, deserves to be given the finer things in life.
And there's a long line of dudes who want to give it to her.
- Hey, Martin.
Everything okay?
- Yeah.
I was just talking to Ginnie's, friend Trevor,
- Just asking him if he's seen Ginnie.
- And?
And I was telling Marty here that the way that girl's been working through their breakup, she could be facedown in any bed in a 10-mile rad...
Look out!
Time to go.
- Holy shit.
You flattened that guy out.
- I shouldn't have done that.
Fuck that guy.
Never been in a bar fight before.
That was...
That was so amazing when I was like, "look out!"
- You're a real lifesaver.
- I mean...
I feel like I could have totally held my own, though.
I've got a ton of pent-up rage I've never gotten to use.
Maybe we should go back.
Simmer down, Mike Tyson.
Shit.
I know that girl.
Hang on right now...
- Megan?
- Where are my keys?
Megan, are you okay?
Why is Bri-Baby being such a dick-face right now?
- Um, I...
I don't know who that is.
- Bri-baby.
I'm so outta here.
And if he doesn't like it, he can kiss my ass.
- Well...
- Is this my car?
- Well, no.
- This my car?
I don't think it's such a good idea for you to be driving right now, Megan.
Well, maybe it's not such a good idea for your face
- to be a dick right now.
- Right.
Okay.
- Mr. Gallo...
- Yeah.
- Where do you live, Megan?
- You know where.
Burger King.
Because we're trying to drive you home.
I don't want to go home.
I want to go to the par-tay.
Are you still on Sweetzer?
I want to go to the party so I can blow Dan Franklin.
Let's get her home, for Dan Franklin's sake.
Yeah, I think she's still on Sweetzer.
It's just a right at the next light.
Yeah?
Okay, slow down, Barry.
What the hell do you mean they're backing out?
They...
Barry.
Barry.
Barry?
Fuck.
Fucking phone died.
Perfect.
Take a picture, and post it on Bri-Baby's Twitter fuck.
- You gonna make it upstairs okay?
- Where is it?
- Where it's at?
- We'll...
We'll help you up.
Got it.
Why don't you get rid of Martin so me and you can go to the party and party?
I think you're kind of partied out, kiddo.
I'm fine.
I had, like, two shots.
I'm fuckin' fine.
I just need to spit.
- Where are you taking me?
- Okay.
All right.
- There you go.
- Where am I?
Move just a little bit.
Okay.
Drink this.
Megan...
Drink this.
It's gonna make you feel better.
- I'm not thirsty.
- It'll make you feel better, Megan.
Drink it.
We can make out if you want.
That's a nice offer, but I'm good.
'Cause you're so in love with Ginnie still.
Well, sure, that, and I think you still have some vomit in your hair.
That's fucked up, dude.
'Cause you know she's in love with someone else.
She is?
- Who's that?
- Mr. Hot Stuff.
- Mr. Hot Stuff?
- Dude's ripped.
That's...
Awesome.
This Mr. Hot Stuff...
Does he have a name?
Megan?
Megan, what's his name?
M-Megan.
Megan.
Megan.
This girl is friends with my daughter?
Yeah.
This isn't Ginnie, Mr. Gallo.
She's not like this.
Let me find you a shirt.
- What the fuck is going on here?
- Hey, no.
Now, um...
- What the fuck is going on here?
- Hey, relax, okay?
- We gave the girl a ride.
That's all.
- That's my fucking girlfriend, dude!
You're, um, Bri-Baby.
I-I'm Martin.
I'm Martin.
I'm Ginnie's ex-boyfriend,
- Megan's friend Ginnie.
- Why is this dude fucking shirtless?
Just relax, Bri-Baby.
Your girlfriend threw up on me is all.
Tell you what.
We'll just, give you a few dollars for the shirt, and, we'll just...
Hey, Martin...
Fuck.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Hey!
I think he's...
He's...
He's breathing.
He's breathing.
Good for him.
Let's get out of here.
That-a-way.
- That doesn't look too bad.
- Fucking hurts.
How 'bout the smell?
I still smell like vomit?
Little bit.
- What?
- Thanks.
- You really had my back up there.
- Yeah, well, Mr. Gallo...
You can call me Frank.
I don't think I can do that, Mr. Gallo, but you're welcome.
Megan said Ginnie had a new boyfriend.
Mr. Hot Stuff.
Bartender at the club said the same thing.
Well, so...
We probably won't be finding her tonight, and that's because she's with him.
Look, Martin...
So even if we do find her, find them, how's it gonna look?
I'm tooling around with her dad.
She's shacked up with her new boyfriend.
So she's dating someone else.
So what?
I mean, don't you still want to know that she's okay?
Aren't you at all worried that none of the people we talked to know where she is?
- I thought you still cared about her.
- Of course I still care about her!
She broke my heart!
Has that not been spelled out enough for you tonight?
Your daughter fucked my shit up.
My life has been a complete wreck for the last three months.
I mean, I can't eat.
I can't think straight.
I can't play music.
All I've literally been able to do is sleep.
- So what do you want to do, go home?
- Yes.
- Crawl into bed, sleep some more?
- Yes, that's exactly what I wanna do.
Martin, I get it.
I do, but...
It's a fucking terrible feeling.
It sucks, but...
I don't think retreating into your shell is doing you a lot of good.
Listen, I'm telling you this from personal experience, okay?
Life goes by really fast.
If you half-ass it now, you're gonna feel it later.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Where to now?
There you go, Juicy.
Since we're, um, exploring our options...
And I know this is a sensitive area, but maybe you could try calling Ginnie's mom.
I'm not calling Ginnie's mother, period.
End of story.
End of story.
All right.
So why'd you and Ginnie break up?
You know that prizewinning douchebag Trevor back at the club, he was saying that Ginnie is out of my league.
She's an amazing girl, as you obviously know.
She's smart, beautiful, funny, and tough.
Yeah, and, um...
She is out of my league.
Well...
Maybe she saw something you don't.
Maybe she did, but I started to get insecure about it, and then I got jealous and moody.
I don't know.
It was my fault.
I just...
I fucked it up.
I fucked it all up.
We all fuck it up sometimes.
There it is.
So... procurement, what is that?
- Forget about it.
- No, no.
I'm curious, really.
I bid on contracts from foreign governments to procure for them anything they need in bulk, grain, seed, fertilizer, fucking nuts and bolts, what have you.
Okay.
Procurement.
Actually, figuring how to get 20 tons of corn feed from Germany to Nigeria can be more exciting than it might sound like.
But it's also...
Just not a normal lifestyle, you know?
Makes it harder to see my daughter, for example.
Hey, you know that other girl at the club?
- What girl?
- What do you mean, "what girl?"
The one I saw you talking to.
She's into you.
What, Lois?
Wait.
How...
How did you even...
- You weren't even there.
- Jesus, Martin, wake up.
90% of that shit is body language, okay?
- She's into you.
- Wow, really?
Lois.
I just...
You gotta be kidding me.
Gary?
Hey!
Hey, how's it going, guys?
Hey, did you find Ginnie?
Was she at the cafe?
- No.
- Aw, bummer.
Bummer.
- You don't think she got kidnapped?
- No!
Jesus, Gary!
- Hey, does Roberta know you're here?
- Yeah.
Yeah, no.
She sent me out for groceries.
Um, I had to replace the cheese.
Yeah, so how's that going, the grocery shopping?
I don't know.
I think I just, um, needed...
Air.
Yeah, 'cause actually...
I don't know if you guys noticed, but Roberta and I have actually
- been having a lot of problems lately.
- No shit?
Really?
- No idea.
- Apparently, the sight of my face nauseates her
- is what she told me verbatim.
- Sorry to hear that, Gare.
Thanks.
- How 'bout if I buy you another one?
- Yeah!
Yeah, man!
Now we're talking!
- Definitely!
- Yeah, one more for our friend.
- One more.
Yeah, on him.
He's...
- I got it.
- On him, yeah.
All right.
Always tastes better when it's free.
Heh.
- It does, though, a little bit.
- Yeah, no, I remember those days.
Okay, back to business.
What do we know about this guy, Mr. Hot Stuff?
- Mr. who?
- Ginnie's got a new boyfriend.
Really?
Damn it.
For you, man.
Damn it.
That sucks for you.
We know he's a regular at the club.
Bartender says he's a big tipper.
And he's ripped, apparently.
So he goes to the gym, frequents nightclubs, likes to throw his money around, maybe act like a big shot.
Sounds like an asshole.
- This is what I'm saying.
I smell a rat here.
What about with Martin?
Did you smell a rat when you met him?
No, no rat.
Field mouse, maybe.
- Field mouse.
- Hah hah.
He's right.
You're a field mouse, bro.
This is great.
This is what I'm talking about.
This is just guys being guys, drinking beer, and busting balls.
"Field mouse."
Next round is on me.
I insist.
You've been more than generous, Mr. Gallo.
Got an emergency 20 in here somewhere.
No way.
I been looking for this, my 'shrooms.
You guys want some?
Hey, we should do these together, go camping.
Joshua tree.
You should probably put those away, like, now.
Wait.
Japanese paper.
Hey, man.
Aw, man.
Dude.
Gary, you dumbass, drug-addled son of a bitch, I could kiss you right now.
Okay, but we should wait 'til after we eat the 'shrooms.
Are you kidding me?
Are you just completely out to lunch?
Martin, who cares?
We have Ginnie's address.
Come on.
Let's go.
No, no, no, no.
We've been searching for Ginnie all day and night all over town while her address has been sitting in his pocket, wrapping his stupid 'shrooms!
Martin, man, I-I'm really sorry.
I am, but you just...
Martin, come on.
Let it go.
Field mouse?
Hey, guys, wait.
Can I come?
Whoo-hoo!
This is great, really.
Really great, man.
Call to adventure, you know?
We're on the case.
You know what it's...
It's, um...
It's like that movie, that movie...
John Wayne...
Whoa!
- You sure you're okay to drive?
- You sound like my ex.
"The searchers!" "The searchers." That's it.
Man, that's an awesome movie.
Hey, do either of you have any weed on you?
I don't like to 'shroom without a little weed.
You know, I bet I can get my dealer to come meet us.
What's the, um...
Gary...
We're not gonna have your weed dealer meet us at my daughter's place.
Right.
No, right.
Right.
Um...
Shit.
- Sycamore, right?
What's the address?
- 1030 Sycamore.
Terri Sadler.
That's her roommate, right?
Yeah, that's her.
She's the...
The jittery girl.
You know her, right?
No, but keep asking.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
- I can't get unbuckled.
- Gary, just stay with the car.
Windows are dark.
Yeah, well, some people are actually asleep after midnight.
When you and Ginnie lived together, where did you hide the spare key?
Where?
Um, that's not really, um...
That's kind of private.
Martin, I'm not gonna rob you.
What am I gonna take, your bong?
- Where did you hide the key?
- It was under a rock, but...
What are you gonna...
No, you're not gonna...
It's okay.
I'm her father.
Whoa, whoa, Mr. Gallo, you are not...
Martin, I need to see if my daughter is in trouble.
Okay, this is a very bad idea.
You know what, Martin?
I'm starting to see why Ginnie kicked you to the curb.
Are you?
And why's that?
'Cause you're a namby-pamby, little fucking pain in the ass.
Now move it.
No.
Seriously?
You do not want to be standing in my fucking way right now.
- Fine.
- That's what I thought.
Fuck this.
Shit.
Because it's frustrating, 'cause you don't trust me like I trust you!
Because all you wanna do is sit around watching "Game of Thrones"
and fantasize about Jaime Lannister!
You do!
You want to bang the shit out of Jaime Lannister!
That's fine!
I don't get mad at you, because I get it!
Even with one hand, he's beautiful!
Hello?
Anybody home?
Shit.
Hello?
Mr. Gallo.
- I think Ginnie's room's over here.
- Thank fucking God.
What the fuck?
Wait.
Hold on.
- I found out where Ginnie is.
- Where?
She went on vacation with her new boyfriend.
- His name is Kip.
- Kip.
Yeah.
I think it sounds pretty serious.
And guess what, babe.
'Member those 'shrooms you wouldn't let me take on Halloween?
Well, trick or treat, 'cause I'm taking 'em right now.
Delicious.
I can eat 'shrooms.
I can eat sun chips.
I can eat fucking cheese, because I'm my own man.
I have something inside of me.
I have potential.
I... hello.
Hel...
All right, it's Gary.
Call me back.
- How do you know where she is?
- Don't get mad.
Hello?
Is someone there?
Hello?
Hi...
There.
This is...
No, no, no.
It's...
- What is this girl's name?
- Um, Tammy, Toni...
- Jesus Christ.
- Hey, it's okay.
You know him...
Run!
- I will fucking murder you!
- You don't know her?
No.
I don't fucking know her.
I will fucking kill you!
Do you hear that, you motherfucker?
!
I have a gun!
You motherfucker, I will...
What do we do?
- No way.
No way!
- Come on.
Fucking calling the motherfucking cops on you!
I am not getting arrested tonight.
Wait.
So beautiful.
I know how you found out Ginnie's on vacation.
You called her mom.
Yeah, that's right.
I did.
I called Connie, who actually talks to Ginnie and cares about what's going on in her life and knows where the hell she is.
You had no right to do that.
I told you I didn't want to worry her.
Are you serious?
We should have called 12 hours ago.
Like, then, maybe you wouldn't have home invaded.
It's complicated, okay?
I didn't do right by Ginnie's mom.
I...
Fucked around when Ginnie was little.
Yeah, it's old news.
I've heard all about it, believe me.
You got a lot of nerve talking to me like that.
Ginnie's mom is fine.
She's happily remarried.
She got over it years ago.
- Ginnie did, too.
- Freeze!
Stop right there!
I'm gonna let it shine.
I'm gonna let it shine.
I'm gonna let it shine.
I'm shining my light!
This is the police.
Don't move.
Just to be clear, I've always been there for my daughter.
- I gave her everything she wanted.
- How 'bout your attention?
Sh...
Fuck.
Hi.
We... could we use your bathroom?
- Toilet is for customers only.
- Here.
- Come on.
- Are you fucking kidding me?
Sorry.
Look, my fault.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Come on.
Let's go!
Both of you, on the ground now!
This day is never-ending.
What is this?
I'm sure it's nothing, babe.
It's fine.
No, Kip, they're directly in front of my house.
Okay, look, officers, it's... it's just really a big misunderstanding.
Stop right there, and get down!
Just calm down for a second.
I can explain the whole thing.
- That was my daughter's apartment.
- On the ground!
Mr. Gallo, get down now.
I will not.
I am an upstanding citizen.
I am a taxpayer.
- I am a...
- Dad?
- Ginnie?
- Ginnie?
Gary, stop.
Tastes like glass.
All I wanted was to make it through this breakup in one piece, not be desperate or stalkery or pathetic.
I just needed to wait it out, get to the other side with my pride intact.
Instead, I became my ex-girlfriend's father's idiot lackey, everyone she knows in this town getting an eyeful of what a loser I am.
- Martin, you're not a loser.
- Not to mention...
Not to mention the throwing up, the bar brawl, breaking and entering my ex-girlfriend's new home,
- running from the police...
- I really don't need a recap, okay?
I was there.
Gary, Gary, Gary, just shut the fuck up, okay?
!
Just shut the fuck up!
Couple of weeks ago in my hotel in Mumbai,
I woke up in the middle of the night soaked in sweat, didn't know where I was.
I didn't know who I was for a second.
My heart was just going...
Thousand miles a minute.
I mean...
I thought i was gonna die.
I called down to the front desk and...
and asked 'em to send up a doctor.
And then I'm...
I'm just lying there, thinking, "this is it,"
you know, "this is...
This is it."
And so I called Ginnie...
And Ginnie wasn't there.
And of course the doctor shows up, and he... checks everything out.
He says it's not a heart attack.
It's nothing.
It's a fucking panic attack.
Just ridiculous...
Embarrassing.
I'm at the airport the next morning, and...
No, it's not like there's a layover here.
I'm supposed to be in Geneva right now.
But I came here, because...
Because I needed to see my little girl.
I have no one else, Martin.
You know?
She's all I got.
Hey, you guys, you guys, you guys, you guys...
Can we just be serious for one moment?
Okay, can we just...
Talk real shit?
Visitor for Gary...
- "Fulenwilder"?
- I'm Gary.
Roberta.
- Oh my God!
- My poor, poor baby.
What a night you've had.
Baby, I see your light.
It's, like, blue.
Your aura is blue,
- like an "avatar" thing.
- Ho ho.
You know, I actually believed you, that you were going to the store to replace the cheese because you felt bad about it.
No, no, no.
Not my Gare.
My Gare's not that kind of boyfriend, is he?
He's more of a call you from jail at 4:00 A.M.
Because I'm tripping my balls off kind of guy.
Honey, your aura's turning, like, dark red now.
Good.
Here's the drill.
You're gonna stay here until your arraignment...
Which is in two days, and you're gonna sit and think about whether you want to come home or be your own man and let your light shine down.
I want to come home.
I want to come home.
I know you do, honey, but that's because you're scared and stupid right now, so you just sit tight, and sleep on it, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
Nice work, guys.
I love you!
All right, you two.
Looks like your lawyer has saved your ass.
Ginnie.
- What the hell, dad?
- I know.
Look, I was worried.
You hadn't returned voice mails or e-mails.
I was on vacation, and I tried to call you back as soon as I got off the plane.
Right.
And of course then my phone was dead, so...
So you thought it would be a good idea to break into my house with my ex-boyfriend?
Look, I'm sorry, okay, but what are you doing running off without telling anybody and not answering your phone?
We were in Bora Bora trying to unplug, and I told mom.
Jesus.
- Dad, this is Kip.
- It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
How do you do?
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding.
It's my fault.
That's very generous of you, but I'm pretty sure it's all my fault.
- Hey.
Kip.
- I'm Martin.
Well, since we have your father's rental car, you want to take him back to the hotel?
I'll take our car.
- I'll meet you there?
- Yeah.
Okay.
I'm gonna go.
It was nice to meet everybody.
I guess I'll...
I'm gonna be going, too.
Um, Ginnie, I'm so sorry about everything.
It was really nice to see you, though.
Martin.
Martin!
Look, Ginnie, I'm truly...
- No, no, you don't have to apologize.
I know how persuasive my dad can be.
Well, yeah, but go easy on the guy?
I think he's been in a pretty rough place lately.
I'll try.
How are you?
You know...
How have you been?
I actually applied to UCLA, architecture and urban design,
- and I got in.
- Wow.
That's great.
That's what you've always wanted.
That's...
That's great.
I found out last week, and Bora Bora was Kip's congratulation gift.
I'm sorry that you had to find out about him like this.
- I didn't know if I should call.
- No.
Kip seems great, Ginnie.
And you, you seem...
You seem really happy.
And I'm happy for you.
Your head hurt?
- Little bit.
- Good.
- Look, Ginnie...
- I don't want to hear it, dad.
You didn't tell me you were thinking about going back to school.
You're not in my life.
Okay?
You are never here.
When are you gonna understand that you don't get a say in what I do or where I go or who with?
Look...
You're my dad and I love you...
And I do know that you love me.
Why do you have to be such an asshole?
I don't know.
Why is the sky blue?
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no.
- Jimothy...
- I'm trying to beat this level, dawg.
- Have some respect.
- We need to talk.
Well, I'm busy.
And after I beat this level, I'm gonna do more drugs, have more sex with this very attractive couple, and then sleep for 16 hours, so pencil you in after that.
Hey, it's time for you to move now.
Get your shit, and go.
You're 30 days past due on rent, so consider it an eviction.
You're done.
This is mine.
You know, I find your newfound confidence intoxicating.
What if we...
Figured out a different way to pay rent...
A physical way?
- Hello.
- Hey, Connie.
- I hope it's okay I called.
- Frank?
- Mr. Gallo.
- Jesus.
Would you please fucking call me Frank already?
Thanks for coming, Frank.
That's nice stuff up there.
Seriously, really, really good.
I enjoyed it.
Thanks.
I thought you were...
Had to be in Geneva.
I figured I'd stick around here, spend a little time with my daughter.
- You want a beer?
- Sure.
You know, Martin, you went to the mat for me in a big way.
- I appreciate it.
- Well, I mean...
I won't forget it.
- Looks like you got a fan there.
- Who?
Lois?
Yeah, I...
Martin, would you please open your eyes?
- That girl is clearly here for you.
- We met up before the show.
- Did you, now?
- Yeah.
You were right about that whole body-language thing.
Look at you.
I am impressed.
- I should go say hi before the second set.
- I think you should.
- Are you gonna be...
- I'm totally good.
Okay.
Martin...
Get over there.
They sound real good tonight.
You Martin's dad?
His dad?
No, no, no.
No, I'm...
He's a friend.

There he is.
Jesus.
You'll tell him you were the reason we're late, right?
Come on.
I don't...
I don't want him to think I don't care about time and stuff.
There's my girl.
There's my Dad.
Dad, this is my boyfriend Martin.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Martin.
Uh, Mr. Gallo.
I'm Martin.
You're Mr. Gallo.
I know that.
Nice to meet you, Martin.
(SOFTLY) Fuck.
It's really good to see you.
You look great.
You look tired.
Where you coming from this time?
- Singapore.
- Ah.
Ever been?
No, I haven't been.
Uh, I...
I hear it's very, um, clean, which I like.
I also hear that they cane you if you spit in the street.
Uh, not that I like that.
Yeah, I don't like that part.
Good evening.
Can I bring you something to drink?
Shall we start with a nice bottle of red?
Uh, Martin has a sulfite allergy.
A sulfite allergy?
Um, it's not that bad, actually.
I just get a little, uh, Hivey.
But I'm fine with water or death.
Okay.
Uh, we'll have a bottle of the Chateauneuf-Du-Pape.
Excellent choice.
And, Martin, are you sure?
Nothing?
Maybe a beer?
Or are you allergic to hops?
Heh.
You sure you don't want something else, Martin?
Mm.
Oh, no.
This is delicious.
These beets are really well steamed.
(CELL PHONE BUZZES)
I'm sorry.
I gotta take this.
(GROANS) He hates me.
He doesn't hate you.
He hates me.
He hates me so much, I'm starting to hate myself.
All that matters is what I think, and I'm a fan.
Yeah?
Big fan.
Huge fan.
All right.
MARTIN:
Okay, I got this.
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)
I'll bounce back.
Round two.
Sorry about that.
It's, uh, not a problem.
Looks like a, uh, pretty major deal just went down over there by the bar, huh?
So, Martin, what is it that you do?
Uh, Dad, I told you Martin is a musician.
Right.
Right.
What is it, the, uh, ukulele?
Uh, it's the, uh, banjo.
Banjo.
Right, like Kermit the Frog.
- Heh.
- I guess I assumed the banjo was a hobby.
Well, I have a band,
Hysterical Kindness.
It's a bluegrass collective, more Flatt and Scruggs or Punch Brothers than some, you know, poppy Mumford Sonskindof wannabething.
What's wrong with Mumford Sons?
They're a very successful act, no?
He likes Mumford Sons.
So where you from?
Well, I was born in Chicago, uh, but I grew up in Guelph.
Guelph?
Uh, Guelph, Ontario.
- Guelph?
- It's, uh...
Canada.
Guelph?
Okay.
Your folks, what do they do?
Jesus, Dad, what is with the third degree?
Third degree?
I'm just getting to know the guy.
You don't mind, do you, Martin?
No.
No, no.
It's great.
It's great getting to know someone this, you know, vigorously.
So your parents?
Oh.
Right.
Um... my mother is an acupuncturist in Toronto, and my father is an, um...
He's an environmental activist in Albuquerque.
He's an environmental activist in Albuquerque, Dad.
Deal with it.
I didn't say anything.
I'm sure it's very satisfying work.
He never met a tree that he didn't want to chain himself to.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Sweetie, you have a little, um, salad dressing.
Oh.
Oops.
Oh.
Mr. Gallo,
I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.
(BANJO PLAYING)
Could tonight's dinner have gone any worse?
Actually, it could have.
Mm, I guess he could have castrated me at the table.
Last time I introduced Dad to a boyfriend,
I never heard from the guy again, so...
Wow.
When I disappear next, ask your Dad where my body's buried, just as, you know, like, a courtesy to my Mom.
Martin, I know he's tough.
But you're not gonna have to deal with him.
I probably won't see him for another year, so...
Oh.
In that case, I think we should make a plan to see him sooner than that.
You'd be up for that?
Absolutely.
I would go through that hell all over again for you.

- MARTIN:
Coming.
I'm coming.
Mr. Gallo?
Ginnie home?
Home?
Uh, no.
No.
I mean, uh, she may be home, but, uh...
Ginnie doesn't live here anymore.
We broke up.
Okay.
(SIREN PASSING)
Want to invite me in?
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, of course.
Sorry.
I was just, uh, getting some work done.
(DOG BARKING OUTSIDE)
She didn't tell you when we, uh, broke up?
We haven't spoken since Christmas.
Ah.
Well, I guess you could call her, you know, to get her, uh, new address to go there.
She's not picking up or returning calls or texts.
I was hoping maybe she'd be here.
Oh, I just, uh...
I just had a little, uh, get-together last month, so-
Don't worry about it.
Just cleaning, anyway.
Yeah.
So, uh, any idea where I could find my daughter?
Did you try Gary and Roberta?
Gary and Roberta?
Yeah.
When she moved out, she went to go stay with them.
Do you want any coffee?
Uh, that's... that's okay.
Don't bother.
I'm just gonna make some anyway.
So, uh... (BOTTLES CLATTERING)
So when did you two break up?
Uh, about three months ago.
Three months and nine days or something.
I don't...
You know, I'm not, uh...
I'm sure she's, uh...
You said she, uh...
She knew you were coming in to town?
I gave her the heads-up I was coming in last minute, but I never got a response.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Huh.
No, no.
This is...
This is Jimothy, uh, is my new roommate.
GALLO:
Gotcha.
Jimothy.
Like Timothy with a
No.
Jimothy, this is Mr. Gallo,
Ginnie's Dad.
Who?
Ex-girlfriend's father.
Do you have the bong?
What?
I, uh...
I don't know what you mean?
What do you mean by that?
The bong, thing I smoke weed out of all day.
Oh, is that... is that...
is that what this is?
I was" Yeah, I was looking earlier.
I just didn't...
I was curious.
You're giving me a real Stressy Vibe, man.
- Uh...
- You stressed out?
- What's going on?
- J-Jimothy.
Could you just, um... just take your weird machine there and just let Mr. Gallo and I talk?
Am I wrong?
Is he giving you a Stressy vibe?
You're not wrong.
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)
I'm having people over tonight, in case you want to hide in your room again.
You can come.
I thought" You know, I thought we said, uh... we agreed, you know, last time, you know, with...
with the Cops...
Oh, so I'm not allowed to have people over in my own home?
No, it's cool.
Whatever.
Oh, did you get my message?
What message?
The fiddle player in your band or something came by, wanted you to know you had a show this weekend or something.
Wait.
What do you mean?
We have a show?
I think so.
Well, did he say when or where?
Didn't say when.
Didn't say where.
(MUSIC ENDS)
(SIGHS)
You know, I'm not...
Heh.
He's not...
We're not...
We're not friends.
- None of my business.
- W-We're just friends.
Okay.
When Ginnie moved out, I needed a new roommate to help cover the rent.
Of course, yeah.
You don't wanna let go of a prime piece of real estate like this.
Yeah.
No, these crossbeams, you don't always...
Oh.
Oh, I'll go get that coffee.
Look, Martin, I can see you're, uh, a busy man here.
Tomorrow I have to get on a flight to Geneva.
All I want to do is find my daughter, so if you can just point me to her new place,
I'll get out of your hair.
Uh, we're all out of milk.
And sugar.
Uh, but we have syrup.
You want syrup in your coffee, or is that... is that weird?
I don't want syrup.
Thanks.
Okay.
So do you have an address for this Gary and Roberta?
Uh, no, but they're not too far from here.
Uh, I don't have an address, but I've been over there.
- So it's close?
- Yeah.
Yes, it's just a couple blocks that-a-way.
Okay.
You want to get dressed, and you can take me over there?
NOW?
Yes, now, Martin.
Do you mind?
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Fuck.
Fuck this.
Hey, Martin, do you mind if I go on this computer for a minute, check e-mails?
Um, yeah, sure.
Go ahead.
Fuck.
Uh, wait!
H-Hold on!
Why don't you just...
- (MOANING)
- Holy shit!
- Uh, you know, I just...
- (MOANING CONTINUES)
I tell Jimothy not to use my computer, but he does.
(VIDEO STOPS)
Look, Martin, porn is porn, you know, but you gotta hide that shit.
- Put it in a folder or something.
- Yeah.
Can't just leave it hanging out there.
You know, I...
I can't even believe that they have sites like that on the Internet.
Uh, those poor women.
Okay, you want to put on some pants so we can hit the road?
(JET ENGINE ROARS OVERHEAD)
(JET ENGINE ROARS OVERHEAD)
(BIRD SQUAWKS)
Here.
You know where we're going.
You drive.
Ahh.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Wasn't ready for that.
Actually, I don't drive.
(THUNK)
What do you mean, you don't drive?
Ah, I don't have my license.
And, uh, also I don't know how.
Nice throw.
How can you not know how to drive in Los Angeles?
A man should know how to drive.
I have a bicycle.
Oh, well, congrats on that.
Yeah, it's actually considered very masculine in the Netherlands.
You know, hey, I haven't really been in touch with Ginnie recently,
- so...
- So?
- So I might not come in.
- Fine by me.
You know, not that we're not friends.
You know, we're still friends.
I think we're still friends.
We're still friends on Facebook.
That...
Martin, where are we going?
Oh, uh, it's just up ahead that-a-way and a second left at the light.
It's one of these.
I can never tell which.
They all look the same.
Voice mail's still full.
It's gotta be this one.
(COUPLE ARGUING)
I hear fighting.
This is definitely it.
(ARGUING CONTINUES)
(POUNDING)
MAN:
Okay, well, write it down, like, on the dry erase!
'Cause Saturday's my day!
Shit.
Hey.
Hey, how's it going, man?
- Um...
- Gary.
- Yeah, hey, Martin.
- Hi.
Sorry to just drop by like this.
Yeah, it... it really is...
We're looking for my daughter.
- Ginnie.
- Oh.
This is her father, Mr. Gallo.
Uh, he didn't have her new address.
She, um...
Martin, hi.
Oh.
Uh, they... they're looking for Ginnie, babe.
Um, this is Ginnie's Dad.
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
I'm Roberta.
So great to finally meet you.
Jack, right?
That would be Ginnie's stepfather.
Right.
Well, don't worry.
She's talked a lot about you, too.
(DOG BARKS)
Did you invite them in?
I literally just opened the door.
(SIGHS)
Come in.
Come in.
Yeah, come on in.
Yeah.
After you.
Yeah, welcome, welcome.
Mi Casa...
Heh heh.
ROBERTA:
Uh, could I get you something to drink?
Water or Kombucha?
Twig tea?
I have some nice Biodynamic Wine.
Don't bother.
Please, we're just looking for Ginnie.
Martin said she was staying here.
She was staying here.
Uh, she left about three weeks ago.
Did you try her cell?
ROBERTA:
I can try her cell.
Phone is off, mailbox full for a couple days now.
GARY:
Oh, man, sounds to me like she's living off the grid, you know?
Martin, was Ginnie, like, a survivalist, you know?
Like one of those Preppers
- or...
- Gary, stop talking.
Do you know where she moved when she left here?
Yes.
Um...
Ohh.
Ahh.
What was her name?
Martin, you know her.
Um, the jittery girl.
Always looks like she's about to cry.
You know her.
Mm, doesn't, uh, ring a bell.
Okay, did Ginnie leave an address?
ROBERTA:
Yes.
I think it's on the fridge.
Uh, Gary, could you get it, please?
(SIGHS)
Please come in.
GARY:
Uh, I'm not seeing it.
- It's on the fridge!
- GARY:
No, it isn't!
It's definitely on the fridge.
GARY:
I just checked there.
Jesus.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
GARY:
There's no address on the fridge.
It's on the Japanese paper.
Yeah, no.
I know you think it's there,
- but it's not there.
- On the Japanese paper.
Christ.
ROBERTA:
Get out of my way.
Fine.
I don't know how to look.
GARY:
It's not there.
You sure you guys don't want anything, like a...
like a beer?
Sure.
I could do a beer.
Ah, you know, uh,
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Uh, how have you been, Gary?
(SIGHS) I've been, um... work's good.
Work's good.
Yeah.
ROBERTA:
Gary, where's the tub where we, uh, keep the receipts?
What tub?
I...
I don't know.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
I need to help her out.
What tub are you ta...
The tin?
That's a tin.
That's not a tub.
- Tub, tin, whatever.
- No, I don't know.
Can I help you find what you're looking for?
ROBERTA:
Go...
Go check the drawer.
GARY:
What drawer?
ROBERTA:
The odds-and-ends drawer.
GARY:
All right, I'm just saying be specific.
We'll find it.
Can I get you guys something?
Are you sure?
Something to drink or cheese?
We have nice cheese.
Oh, we're out of the cheese, babe.
Since when?
Since we finished it.
I didn't finish the cheese, so don't say "we."
I was gonna freeze it for my Doula workshop next month.
It's okay.
We don't need cheese.
Someone finished the cheese, I guess.
Yeah, someone was hungry in their house, and they ate cheese.
They ate it all, though.
It's okay.
Have you seen Ginnie recently?
(ROBERTA SIGHS) Brother.
I certainly have not.
We love Ginnie.
Don't get me wrong.
But some of us loved her a little too much, if you know what I mean, and some things got said.
Yeah, some things got said.
You said 'em.
- Yeah, I said 'em, all right.
- Yeah.
'Cause someone had to say something, 'cause a certain someone in this house wanted to have sex with his daughter.
- Okay, what?
- Excuse me?
- No?
- No.
No, Mr. Gallo, you know that your daughter is very attractive.
And unfortunately, in this house, that makes certain people very insecure.
Okay, let me translate for Mr. Sensitivity over here.
Ginnie was getting a little sick and tired of being leered at every time she went to the fridge.
It was one time, and I was trying to warn her about the bad milk!
Mr. Gallo, Martin, Ginnie was going for some bad milk in the fridge, so I was peering to see what she was grabbing from the fridge, in order to say, "Hey, don't ingest that, Yeah.
'Cause you might get sick." I was doing a service.
You're a knight in shining armor, aren't you, Gare?
Here's an idea.
Maybe you could sort it out with them at your favorite strip joint...
Ohh!
That happened at a bachelor party!
They're strippers!
They climb all over you!
You can't stop them!
You guys know!
They're...
They're like monkeys at a zoo!
Can't stop 'em.
The monkeys climb all over you at a zoo?
Really?
Interesting zoo.
Okay, we should probably get going.
If you find that address, you could give me a shout, that'd be great.
We'll find it.
- Don't worry.
- Thank you.
I'm so sorry about the cheese.
You know, it was very expensive cheese.
Jesus, Roberta, he doesn't care about the goddamn cheese.
You, uh, might want to try the cafe.
Martin knows where it is.
She's probably working there.
- The cafe?
- ROBERTA:
Yeah.
Great.
Martin?
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
Uh, all right.
Well, thanks, guys.
Thank you for... that.
All right.
Why do you have to attack me?
Why are you... have to be so hostile?
And now I completely lost face.
I gotta go apologize for something I didn't even do.
Hey, Ma-Martin.
Are we cool, man?
Are we...
I just want you to know
- truly...
- Yeah, no.
Bro, I would never...
Gary, it's fine.
I mean, you know, we're not even...
I know.
We're not, but still, I promise you on my...
I wouldn't... and, Mr. Gallo,
- I would never...
- Okay.
Yeah, good.
I'll rest easy now.
You guys are the best.
Hey, try the cafe.
She's probably there, all right?
Hey, and tell her Gary says, "What's up?"
Okay, so you just wanna go straight until Sunset,
Okay, so you just wanna go straight until Sunset, and then you make a right, and, uh, you can't miss it.
Um, before you drop me off,
I can draw you a little map.
What, are you Dora the Explorer?
Fuck that.
You're coming with.
(INHALES) Yeah.
I would love to.
Just apparently I have a show coming up, and I really need to rehearse.
I'll pay you, okay?
Pay me?
Uh, no, no.
I don't, um...
You don't, what, need the money?
I beg to differ.
Look, Martin,
I'll be straight with you.
I'm worried here, okay?
This is not like my daughter to just disappear like this.
If you care about her at all,
I would think you would want to know if she's okay or not.
I do.
I do.
Of course I do.
Okay.
Tell me when to turn.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
This is where my daughter works?
Yeah.
It's...
It's not that bad.
They got a little gallery now.
It was Ginnie's idea, actually.
Really turned the place around.
(SITAR MUSIC PLAYING)
Nothing.
Two dudes just came in here.
GALLO:
You know this one?
MARTIN:
Yeah.
Tracy.
(TRACY LAUGHS)
You're the slut.
The old one, maybe.
You're gross.
I have to go.
Call me if it doesn't stop bleeding.
Tracy, hi.
Uh, it's Martin.
Remember me?
No.
Uh, Ginnie's boyfriend.
Ex-boyfriend.
Is Ginnie working today?
Ginnie doesn't work here anymore.
What?
Since when?
Since none of your business.
I'm her father... trying to find her.
Oh.
She quit, like, a month ago, maybe.
Do you know where she's working now?
I think she works at some restaurant.
Lizzie, our manager, would know, but she's at Moglu right now.
Moglu?
The yoga place, "QM.
On Hyperion?
Did you check her Facebook?
- Checked her Facebook.
- Twitter?
(SCOFFS) Twitter.
Yeah.
You tweet something, will you?
Oh, I don't...
I don't twitter... or tweet or, you know, twit.
'Course you don't.
Look, um, Tracy, would you mind just putting something out there...
- I already did it.
- You...
You did what?
I tweeted it.
Great.
What...
What did you tweet?
"Baller old guy, creepy young guy looking for Ginnie G. #random #doable."
I'm creepy?
Why am I creepy?
I've met her many times, many times.
Yeah.
She seemed like she...
Was she stoned?
Is this whole neighborhood stoned?
Uh, maybe she was stoned.
You know, this... this neighborhood's probably 70% stoned, 80% on a Sunday.
All right, where's the yoga place?
Uh, just that-a-way.
So, uh, where'd you say you were coming from?
Mumbai.
Oh, Mumbai!
Yeah.
Ever been?
Uh, no, no.
But I-I'd like to.
It's a shithole.
Huh.
Huh.
Well, I guess I can, uh, cross that off the list then.
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)
GALLO:
I need to take this.
MARTIN:
Okay.
GALLO:
Barry.
Talk to me.
WOMAN:
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks again for coming.
Hey, Lizzie.
Martin. (SIGHS)
What are you doing here?
- Uh...
- Please, please do not fuck with my yoga buzz.
- No.
No, uh...
- (EXHALES)
I was just wondering...
I've been looking for Ginnie.
Martin, Martin, Martin...
Oh.
No.
No, no.
Martin, you've got to get over this Ginnie thing.
She's moving on.
You should, too.
Uh, what do you mean, she's moving on?
What...
Okay, everything is in place.
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
Barry, look, my phone is about to die.
Okay, Barry, stop talking.
I don't think this is the best move for you, Martin, but if you need some kind of closure or whatever, she's hostessing at Bibola.
Bibola?
What's that?
It's a restaurant, Martin.
It's the new, hot big restaurant in West Hollywood.
Fuck!
My yoga buzz is gone now.
- Okay.
Well, thanks for the info, Lizzie.
- Shit.
Yeah, Martin, you should know that...
Oh, and by the way, good job.
You know, keep it up.
What the hell does that mean, "Good job"?
No, I didn't mean it like...
like...
- What did you mean?
- I mean, like, yoga.
You know, like "Good job, yoga."
- Uh-huh.
- Like, you look great.
Fuck off, Martin.
Okay?
- Absolutely.
Yeah.
- Thank you.
Good-bye.
You're an asshole.
You're an asshole.
Stop talking, Barry.
Just do your fucking job, okay?
(SIGHS) So?
She said Ginnie's working at a restaurant in West Hollywood.
Let's go.
Frank.
- Wow.
- Kelly.
Hi.
Hi.
It's been a minute.
Are you in town for a visit?
Yeah, just popped in.
You look good.
I'm a sweaty mess, but thank you.
You look good.
How long are you in town for?
Very briefly.
Uh, I'm sorry.
We're late to meet my daughter, so...
Oh.
Oh, I won't...
I won't keep you, then.
Well, it was, uh... it was good to see you.
You, too.
So if you end up sticking around,
- give me a shout.
- Will do.
- Take care, Kelly.
- Bye.
You're gonna catch flies there, Kermit.
Come on.
Was that that waitress from that night we all had dinner?
I don't know, maybe.
So what?
No, I...
Nothing.
I mean, you know, you must have made quite an impression on her.
- Where we going?
- Uh, it's just up that-a-way.
That's gotta be the 15th fucking time you said "that-a-way."
Are you Hopalong Cassidy?
Who's Hopalong Cassidy?
Ha...
Get in the car.
MARTIN:
I thought there was a little something going on that night.
GALLO:
Forget about it.
No, I know.
I know.
It's none of my business.
She's very attractive.
Yes.
She's an attractive woman.
Okay?
Deal with it.
Very attractive.
So how did that work?
Did she slip you her number...
Would you fucking forget about it?
Please?
- Jesus.
- Okay, okay.

Maitre d' says she quit about 10 days ago all of a sudden, has no idea why.
She only worked here two weeks.
That is pretty weird.
Yeah, it is.
(SIGHS)
Well, want to grab a bite?
Here?
Sure.
Why not?
Gotta refuel, right?
I mean, you must be starving.
Let me buy you dinner.
That's very nice of you.
I guess I am pretty hungry.
Good.
(CORK SQUEAKS)
Oh, yeah, Ginnie.
Yeah, I love Ginnie.
Ginnie's great.
I was bummed when she quit.
But I think maybe she got a better job.
- You know where?
- I don't.
But I can ask around.
That'd be great.
Thanks.
In the meantime, can I get you anything to start?
I think we'll skip straight to the entree.
We're in a bit of a rush.
I'll take the, uh, steak-frites, rare.
I guess I'll have, uh...
You know what?
I'll get what he's getting, uh, the... the steak.
Excellent.
Rare as well?
Uh, yeah, yeah, rare.
Very good.
This place is pretty, uh, chichi.
Yeah, for you, I guess, eating tofu out of a paper bag or whatever.
That is how I usually eat, actually.
She'll turn up, Mr. Gallo.
She will.
Have you, um...
- talked to Ginnie's Mom?
- No.
I was just thinking, uh, maybe she's heard from her.
I don't want to worry her.
Right, but, you know, they're pretty close.
I mean, maybe she knows where she is.
And what if she doesn't?
Then she's in a panic.
And whose fault is that?
Yours?
Well, no, it would be yours, actually, because it's your idea.
(SIGHS)
Maybe she lost her phone.
If she lost her phone, then she wouldn't get your messages.
Martin, I get that you think I'm being paranoid here, okay?
But believe me, shit happens every day.
Friend of mine's daughter takes a little trip to Europe.
She gets grabbed 20 minutes out of Orly.
- Jesus.
- Yeah.
Lucky for them I know a thing or two about a thing or two.
I was able to get her back.
- A thing or two?
- I know how to handle a situation like that, let's just say.
Wait.
Like those Liam Neeson movies?
- What?
- You know, those Liam Neeson movies.
His...
His daughter gets kidnapped or his wife.
This is not a movie, Martin.
This is life.
(MARTIN CHUCKLES)
What...
What is so funny?
Oh, just, uh...
It just reminds me of...
Ginnie could never explain what you do.
It always seemed so mysterious to us.
We used to joke that you were a, uh, um, an arms dealer or something, you know, something badass.
Well, something like that, but not quite so glamorous, I guess.
So what is it that you do, exactly, then?
I'm in procurement.
Okay.
Huh.
Procurement.
So what about you?
How's it going with the music?
Well, I guess I've got that show coming up with my band.
But I'm not sure that I want to do it.
Not sure?
Well, what's the issue?
Well, it's been a while, and I guess I've been trying to figure some stuff out actually.
I mean... finally hit me.
What's the endgame?
I mean, I'm probably never gonna make... a real living at it, or at least one decent enough to support a family or...
Are you good at it?
Yeah, I am.
Then you should play the show.
WAITER:
Here we are.
No luck on the Ginnie front, I'm sorry to say.
Well, thanks for trying.
You know, it is Thursday, though.
You know, you might want to try Rococo.
You know her friend Trev?
He's awesome.
He's been DJing there every Thursday.
Yeah, I know Trevor.
You know the place?
Enjoy your meal.
Dig in.
(COUGHS, SPITS)
You okay there, bub?
(SPITS, COUGHS)
It's been a while since I ate meat.
Yeah.
Like how long?
(SPITS) Oh, three... maybe five years.
Nobody made you order it.
Tell you what, let's go to that Rococo place, get a drink, settle your stomach, huh?
I guess one drink couldn't hurt.
If she's there, great.
If not, maybe you can point out somebody that knows her, huh?
- You're the Boss.
- Now you're getting it.
MARTIN:
This place is impossible.
We're never getting in.
What, are you kidding me?
Come on.

(HOUSE MUSIC BLARING)
How'd you do that?
I spoke the guy's language.
What...
What was it, Samoan?
What, you spoke Samoan?
Martin, look alive.
Dennis said he hadn't seen her, but you never know.
Dennis?
You spoke to that guy for, like, three seconds.
Martin, look around.
See if you can spot anyone who knows Ginnie.
No, I don't know, Mr. Gallo.
This really doesn't look like her kind of crowd.
Come on.
Let's get that drink.
Two Taliskers, neat.
You got it.
See anything?
No.
There you go.
(COUGHS)
I think I, uh...
Good.
(MUSIC CONTINUES)
Hey, Megan.
(TIPSY) Oh, my God.
Martin!
Megan!
What the fuck are you doing here?
I'm looking for Ginnie, actually.
Oh, Martin, you gotta get over it.
It's so sad, like...
No, I'm...
I'm over it.
Uh, it's just her Dad is looking for her, actually.
Do you...
Do you know if she's gonna be here tonight?
- What?
- Do you know if she's coming here tonight?
- Who?
- Ginnie!
Get over it, Martin!
(LAUGHS) 'Kay.
Oh, wow.
She's very drunk.
Yeah.
Hey, uh, Lois.
- Right?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Martin, right?
Yes!
Thank you!
Oh, sorry?
I just, uh...
Have you seen Ginnie by any chance?
I'm sorry.
Who?
Ginnie, my ex-girlfriend.
Yeah.
No, I haven't seen her.
Sorry.
It's so loud in here.
I know.
It's unbelievably loud in here.
I feel like I'm screaming at you.
It probably looks like we're having a horrible, horrible argument.
- Fuck you, you fucking asshole!
- (MUSIC FADES)
I swear to fucking God!
WOMAN:
Uh, what was that?
(NEW SONG BEGINS)
I'm sorry.
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.
I was kidding.
It was a joke about arguments.
Oh, man.
Good.
Good.
I probably went too far.
- No.
- Sorry.
I don't think I've seen her in here for a few weeks.
Is she missing or something?
Something like that.
This one's on the house all right?
- Thank you.
- You know, you ought to talk to that guy she's seeing.
She's seeing somebody?
Yeah, cute guy, too, a big tipper.
They met here, I think.
You seen him lately?
No.
I haven't seen either of 'em.
Just a second.
So do you come here often?
So do you come here often?
No, never.
It's a little bit too, like...
Axe body spray?
Yes.
Hey, I heard you guys are playing this weekend, right?
Yeah.
Uh...
I don't know if that's gonna happen.
Yeah, I saw you play, like...
like a year ago at the River Room.
You were really good, kind of like... the Punch Brothers meets, like, the Foggy Mountain Boys meets, like, the Muppets.
Yeah, thanks, I think.
That's at least partially what...
exactly what...
MAN:
Marty?
Hey, Trevor.
They let you in here?
Yeah.
Well, you know, Dennis is a friend, so... (LAUGHING) Oh man.
I know this guy!
He's an idiot!
Hey, um, I think my friend is leaving, so I have to go.
Okay.
And if I do play that show, uh, maybe I'll see you there.
Yeah.
Good to see you.
'Bye-bye.
- Bye.
Listen, Trevor, have you seen Ginnie recently?
Uh, yeah, I'm just gonna do you a solid and not even answer that, bro.
I don't know what your problem is with me.
Hey, I told you guys about Marty here, right?
He plays old-timey music on his banjo like he's old McDonald or some shit, and, like, 10 people show up.
It's hilarious.
Yeah, well, you know, what's hilarious is, uh, you know, you look like a...
a rapist... like you've committed rape.
You know why Ginnie dumped you?
'Cause she's way too fine for your hella broke ass.
I kind of want to punch you in the face right now.
You know, Marty, a woman like Ginnie, deserves to be given the finer things in life.
And there's a long line of dudes who want to give it to her.
(GRUNTS)
Hey, Martin.
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.
I was just talking to Ginnie's, uh, friend Trevor, just asking him if he's seen Ginnie.
And?
And I was telling Marty here that the way that girl's been working through their breakup, she could be facedown in any bed in a 10-mile rad... (ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING)

You can call me Frank.
I don't think I can do that, Mr. Gallo, but you're welcome.
(SIGHS)
Megan said Ginnie had a new boyfriend.
- Yeah.
- Mr. Hot Stuff.
Bartender at the club said the same thing.
Well, so... we probably won't be finding her tonight, and that's because she's with him.
Look, Martin...
So even if we do find her, find them, how's it gonna look?
I'm tooling around with her Dad.
She's shacked up with her new boyfriend.
So she's dating someone else.
So what?
I mean, don't you still want to know that she's okay?
Aren't you at all worried that none of the people we talked to tonight know where she is?
Of course I'm worried about her.
Because I thought you still cared about her.
Of course I still care about her!
She broke my heart!
Has that not been spelled out enough for you tonight?
Your daughter fucked my shit up.
My life has been a complete wreck for the last three months.
I mean, I can't eat.
I can't think straight.
I can't play music.
All I've literally been able to do... is sleep.
So what do you want to do, go home?
Yes.
Crawl into bed, sleep some more?
Yes, that's exactly what I wanna do.
Martin, I get it.
I do, but... it's a fucking terrible feeling.
It sucks, but...
I don't think retreating into your shell is doing you a lot of good.
Listen, I'm telling you this from personal experience, okay?
Life goes by really fast.
If you half-ass it now, you're gonna feel it later.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Where to now?
There you go, Juicy.
Since we're, um, exploring our options...
And I know this is a sensitive area, but maybe you could try calling Ginnie's Mom.
I'm not calling Ginnie's mother, period.
- End of story.
End of story.
- Okay, but I was thinking...
All right.
So Why'd you and Ginnie break up?
You know that prizewinning douchebag
Trevor back at the club, he was saying that Ginnie is out of my league.
She's an amazing girl, as you obviously know.
She's smart, beautiful, funny, and tough.
Yeah, and, um...
She is out of my league.
Well... maybe she saw something you don't.
Maybe she did, but I started to get insecure about it, and then I got jealous and moody.
I don't know.
It was my fault.
I just...
I fucked it up.
I fucked it all up.
We all fuck it up sometimes.
("NIGHT MOVES" PLAYING)
There it is.

So procurement, what is that?
Forget about it.
No, no.
I'm curious, really.
I bid on contracts from foreign governments to procure for them anything they need in bulk, grain, seed, fertilizer, fucking nuts and bolts, what have you.
Ah.
Okay.
Procurement.
Actually, figuring how to get 20 tons of corn feed from Germany to Nigeria can be more exciting than it might sound like.
But it's also... just not a normal lifestyle, you know?

Mr. who?
Ginnie's got a new boyfriend.

Damn it.
For you, man.
Damn it.
That sucks for you.
We know he's a regular at the club.
Bartender says he's a big tipper.
And he's ripped, apparently.

She got over it years ago.
Ginnie did, too.
- Freeze!
Stop right there!

(MUTTERING) I'm gonna let it shine.
I'm gonna let it shine.
I'm gonna let it shine.
I'm shining my light!
(SIREN BLOOPS)
(ON LOUDSPEAKER) This is the police.
Don't move.
Just to be clear, I've always been there for my daughter.
I gave her everything she wanted.
How 'bout your attention?
(SIREN BLARING)
- Oh, sh...
- Fuck.
(ENTRY BELL RINGS)
Hi.
We, uh...
Could we use your bathroom?
Toilet is for customers only.
Uh, here. (SPEAKING KOREAN)
(SPEAKING KOREAN)

(SPEAKING KOREAN) Come on.
Are you fucking kidding me?
(TIRES SQUEAL)
(BOTH GRUNT)
Sorry.
Look, uh, my fault.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Come on.
Let's go.

Both of you, on the ground now!
This day is never-ending.
What is this?
(SIGHS) I'm sure it's nothing, babe.
It's fine.
No, Kip, they're directly in front of my house.
Okay, look, officers, it's... it's just really a big misunderstanding.
Stop right there, and get down!
GALLO:
Just calm down for a second.
I can explain the whole thing.
That was my daughter's apartment.
On the ground!
Mr. Gallo, get down now.
I will not.
I am an upstanding citizen.
I am a taxpayer.
- I am a...
- Dad?

MARTIN:
Gary, stop.
Tastes like glass.
MARTIN:
All I wanted was to make it through this breakup in one piece, not be desperate or stalkery or pathetic.
I just needed to wait it out, get to the other side with my pride intact.
♪ Are you steeping, are you sleeping ♪
♪ Roberta?
♪
Instead, I became my ex-girlfriend's father's idiot lackey, everyone she knows in this town getting an eyeful of what a loser I am.
Ah, Martin, you're not a loser.
Oh, not to mention...
not to mention the throwing up, the bar brawl, breaking and entering my ex-girlfriend's new home, running from the police...
I really don't need a recap, okay?
I was there.
♪ Row, row, Roberta ♪
♪ Gently down the cheese ♪
♪ Garily, Garily, Garily, Garily ♪
♪ Life is but a nightmare ♪
Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, just shut the fuck up, okay?

Just shut the fuck up!
Couple of weeks ago in my hotel in Mumbai,
I woke up in the middle of the night soaked in sweat, didn't know where I was.
I didn't know who I was for a second.
My heart was just going...
(LIPS FLUTTER) thousand miles a minute.
I mean, I...
I thought I was gonna die.
I called down to the front desk and... and asked 'em to send up a doctor.
And then I'm...
I'm just lying there, thinking, "This is it,"
you know, "This is...
This is it."
And so I called Ginnie... and Ginnie wasn't there.
And of course the doctor shows up, and he... and he checks everything out.
He says it's not a heart attack.
It's not...
It's nothing.
It's a fucking panic attack.
(SIGHS)
Just ridiculous... embarrassing.
I'm at the airport the next morning, and, uh...
No, it's not like there's a layover here.
I'm supposed to be in Geneva right now.
But I came here, because... because I needed to see my little girl.
I have no one else, Martin.
You know?
She's all I got.
Hey, you guys, you guys.
You guys you guys... can we just be serious for one Moment?
Okay, can we just... talk real shit?
(LAUGHING)
(SQUEAKING SOBS)
(BUZZER SOUNDS)
(GATE OPENS)
Visitor for Gary...
Visitor for Gary...
"Fulenwilder"?
Huh?
I'm Gary.
Roberta.
Oh, my God.
- Oh, my poor, poor baby.
- Oh, yeah.
What a night you've had.
Baby, I see your light.
It's, like, blue.
Your aura is blue,
- like an "Avatar" thing.
- Ho ho.
- (CLANG)
- You know,
I actually believed you, that you were going to the store to replace the cheese because you felt bad about it.
(LAUGHS) No, no, no.
Not my Gare.
My Gare's not that kind of boyfriend, is he?
- Ow.
Ow.
Ow...
- He's more of a call you from jail at 4:00 A.M.
because I'm tripping my balls off kind of guy.
Ow.
