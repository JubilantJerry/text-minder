Sorry about yesterday.
Nana asked us to come over to eat the food you prepared.
It's really delicious.
Good!
When will you be able to debut?
It's not that easy.
We have to come up with some great songs that will do well in the charts first.
Right now, I don't have much hope for you to write amazing songs.
Well..
That's not true!
He can do it!
Actually, he already did.
Nobu wrote a song on the night he came to Tokyo.
That's the song I love the most.
I'm serious.
I fell in love with it when I heard it for the first time.
I was so moved!
It even gave me goose bumps!
It would definitely do well in the charts.
Uh..
Hachi..
That's enough..
Thank you.
That's right.. we are out of drinks.
Could someone go get some?
Why don't you get it yourself?
Uh.. sorry for not noticing.
I'll go buy drinks.
It's dangerous for a girl to go alone at night Nobu.
Right!
I love you.
Telling you this now..
Maybe you'll just laugh at me.
I know about your relationship with Takumi.
You love him don't you?
Where's Hachiko?
She went out to get something.
What?
And I rushed home from work.
They won't be home for some time.
Why?
I gave Nobu a chance for them to be alone.
Good job Shin!
I didn't want anyone to know about me and Takumi.
So that I can pretend nothing had happened and live my life just like before.
I am so calculating.
You must have looked down on me.
No.
I am happy.
I don't know how to neglect what I have felt for you.
Nobu..
I..
I cannot force you to be with me.
You will be confused if you get involved with me now.
You are so kind and fragile.
No matter how hard i try, I will never surpass Takumi.
No..
I..
But, if you are willing to break up with him and be mine.
I will do everything in my power to bring you happiness.
Come and find me.
I'll wait for you.
I believe in you.
I have something to tell you.
Give me a call when you can.
Sorry to bother you at work.
- Nana
Hello.
Ah..
What is it that you wanted to tell me?
What's wrong?
What happened?
Can I see you now?
Sorry, I'm in the middle of my work.
Sorry for bothering you at work.
Can't you tell me over the phone?
I have a busy schedule and I won't be available for some time.
Is that so..
What should I do?
What is it?
Could it be that you're pregnant?
What?
No!
No?
Good!
Don't scare me like that
Believe it or not, I'm quite delicate.
Sorry, I gotta go.
I'll call you when I'm free.
You don't need to.
What?
You don't need to.
In other words, don't ever call me again.
GOODBYE!
I did it!
I finally did it!
Now it's over!
Finally, I am awake!
I'm here.
I'm sorry to bother you at work.
Nana told me that you worked here.
When do you finish?
9pm?
I see, I'll wait for you at the nearby coffee shop.
Wait!
You can't!
Why?
We've talked about this before.
Only come when you've broken up with Takumi.
I've already broken it off.
It's too soon.
But, I've already waited a day.
A day seems like a year.
Even so, a day is still a day.
Right!
Right.
I'll wait for another day.
Forget it!
Do you know how to make 'Nikujaga'?
It's my specialty
Good morning.
Nana?
You're back!
What about ren?
I'm busy with work, so I had to return.
How about you?
Who were you with?
Uh..
Right!
Did you find Nobu's work place?
Yes!
Thank you.
I had something to discuss with him.
You two are very alike.
He was always quite honest, naive and pure.
So I think both of you would get along great.
Nana
To me, Nobu..
To me, Nobu..
I think I've fallen for him.
Isn't it obvious?
- Komatsu Nana -
Phone refuses masked number.
The following is an update on the typhoon.
A strong typhoon No.11 has arrived at Kantou.
It hasn't died down yet, but in about an hour..
It's Hachi.
Hello.
Nobu!
What the heck are you doing?
Get over here!
Didn't you promise to pick Hachi up at 7pm?
But, I can't get out!
Look at the weather.
I'm sure the fireworks is cancelled.
Don't you want to see Hachi in a kimono?
Your nose will bleed.
I bought fireworks!
Once the weather dies down, we'll go light them up by the lake.
Why do you have to tag along?
You two are soaked!
It's raining cats and dogs.
To our band, Hachi is like Madonna.
When Hachi's laughter can be heard, there are bound to be noises from the crowd.
No matter what, at our practices, she's always full of energy.
Compared to a talented musician joining our band, her existence is alot more meaningful.
What's that?
You may have noticed.
Your every move is like the wandering typhoon that deeply moves my heart.
I am like a teenager who has just fallen in love for the first time.
During that following week, I spent half the time staying at Ren's
Hachi and I hardly see each other.
We hardly had the chance to talk.
But, I think it's good.
Because we save alot of time from talking about unnecessary things.
Open the package and put the curry in the pot.
Once you remove a package, put a new pack on the table.
One pack at a time.
Are you listening?
Your rice should look like this.
Smells good!
You smell it.
What?
Miss Komatsu?
Miss Komatsu?
You are pregnant.
The small black circle is the egg containing your baby.
Your baby is the black dot inside the egg.
If you want to keep the baby come back for an examination in 2 weeks.
If you decide not to keep the baby.
You should take action soon, otherwise it would take a toll on your body.
Do you need to take the picture home with you?
Yes.
We're done with practice I heard that you aren't feeling well.
I'll go see you if you're not sleeping yet.
Call me!
- Nobu
Nana?
It's me.
What?
Nana, open the door.
Please, open the door.
Oh no, someone's coming.
What are you doing here?
Go home!
This is no joke.
Morning sickness?
I won't be a burden.
It's my fault for not being careful.
Maybe it's my boyfriend's child.
Go home.
Don't ever come back.
Is your boyfriend Nobu?
Really?
I understand.
Takumi?
What are you doing?
- Nobu -
Phone?
Wait.. don't tell Nobu!
Oh!
Hachi?
Yeah!
Hello?
Nobu, it's me.
Takumi.
Can you hear me?
Yes.
Nana is pregnant.
I don't know who the father is.
But, if Nana wants to keep it, I will accept it as my own.
What do you think?
Why don't you say something?
Say something!
What's wrong?
Hello?
Hachiko?
Ah!
Nana?
It's good that you're there.
Can you bring Nobu over?
It's hard to discuss this over the phone.
What the hell are you doing with hachi's phone?
I'm just borrowing it.
I'm at your place.
What the hell are you doing there?
Leave her alone!
She's no longer yours!
Hachi is now with Nobu.
I know..
But, you are the one who stole my woman.
Where is Hachi?
She's here.
Let me talk to her!
I can't communicated with you.
Nana wants to talk to you.
Seems like she's not in the condition to talk.
What the hell did you do?
Anyways, we'll be there soon.
Uh.. on your way home..
Could you get some grapefruits and carbonated drinks?
What?
I'm going to make her a drink.
She's throwing up real bad and is in alot of pain.
I'm counting on you.
Throwing up?
Don't be so depressed..
What if you lost your baby?
Can you stand up?
Nana is so undependable.
Already an adult.
Still doesn't eat proper meals.
Spent time with men when you are lonely and then becomes pregnant.
What am I going to do with you?
You are going to make your parents cry.
Though, I'm not in the position to lecture you.
No matter who the father is, you are definitely the mother of the child.
Hang in there.
You came by yourself?
Where's Nana?
I don't know.
Then, I'm gonna go.
There's nothing good to talk about between the three of us anyway.
Even if Nana doesn't make a choice, one of us is the father.
Nana, is it true that you are pregnant?
I want to hear it from you.
The child could be mine.
I also know that you broke off with Takumi not long ago.
I'm sorry.
Why are you apologizing?
You mean, you never broke up with him?
Look at me!
Why can't you face me?
Please explain to me.
I will believe you, even if you lie to me.
Nobu said that Hachi is pregnant.
I'm so confused.
Am I weird?
At a time like this, what should I do as a friend?
I wanted to be Hachi's friend..
You smoke?
Actually, I'm not as naive as Nana and Nobu think I am.
Takumi is the only one who understands how empty and helpless I am.
and he has forgiven me.
I know that I have a baby inside me.
No matter what I have to be strong.
I cannot pretend as if nothing has happened.
Starting today, I will be in the recording studio for a week.
Before that, could I hear your answer?
Otherwise, I won't be able to concentrate at work.
I want to keep the baby.
Having you as the father of my child.
That is, if we are not a burden to you,
I will marry you.
What?
So that you won't have to keep your pregnancy a secret.
If we get married, no one will talk behind your back.
The media won't bother you, since you are not in the industry.
Any objections?
Welcome back.
I have something important to tell you.
We are getting married.
We'll be looking for a new place to move in.
Sorry, but you need to find a new roommate.
It's fine.
I will be moving in with Ren soon.
No, Wait.
Please think about the trouble you might cause Ren by moving in.
It would be disastrous if the media found out about your relationship with Ren.
Before your debut, you wouldn't want to be known to the public this way, would you?
Of course not!
Sorry for making you worried.
Then, be cautious.
You don't need to apologize.
I got it.
I'll be careful.
That's all I have to say.
I'm gonna go.
I'll get my staff to handle the rest of the details.
If you find a place you like, go right ahead and put a hold on it.
What?
We'll be moving to a new place soon.
So that you won't have to see Nana.
You look alot better now.
Has the vomitting subsided?
Thank you.
Don't.
You don't have to worry about anything.
Why not use the strawberry cups?
Why buy them if you're not going to use them?
Because it would be sad if the cups were to break.
Great.
They are beautifully connected together.
They won't be sad anymore.
Nobu, what happened to the new song?
Ah..
It's rare to see you down.
Get some comfort from Hachi.
Where did you run away to?
Such an important time for Hachi.
You don't seem to care about her.
I went back this morning.
She didn't say a word to me.
Takumi was the one who did all the talking.
About what?
It's okay, tell me.
I won't be shocked by anything.
Anymore.
They are getting married.
You were surprised!
You would be!
This is insane!
I'm sorry Nobu.
Don't be.
Yesterday is already over.
But, I am involved in this, why didn't I know anything?
Am I not trustworthy enough for her?
It's okay to cry, Nobu.
You can cry on my shoulder!
What are you doing?
Don't be shy!
Aren't we best buddies?
But, there are so many people looking at us.
So what?
Before I met you, I hated everyone.
But after knowing you, I realized that I can't give up on this world.
I don't think you are untrustworthy, Nobu.
You've only been dumped by a woman, don't be so down..
It hurts.
Your wristband is cutting into my neck.
Hello?
Ren?
Nana is at my place.
She got drink after a few drinks.
I can't seem to wake her up.
Can you come and get her?
I got it.
I'll be there!
Alright sorry.
Oh.. she's awake!
Where are you going?
Ren is coming to get you!
It would be problematic if the media finds him.
Tell him that we shouldn't meet for awhile.
What?
Wait, Nana!
Wait!
To Nana,
Hachi?
Are you there, Hachiko?
I don't think Nana will forgive me for what I've done.
I will never forget the six months we spent together.
I wish you would make your major debut soon and appear on television frequently so that I could hear you sing and see your glamour on stage.
No matter who I am in love with, Nana is my only hero.
Now and forever.
- Komatsu Nana -
Nana
Why are you so upset?
This is not a farewell letter.
It's a sincere love letter.
Go see her.
Go to Hachi.
You know you want to see her smiling face with joyful tears.
Why should I go?
That is what a hero would do.
I'm looking for someone, she doesn't appear to be at home.
Could you give this to her when she returns?
Sure.
Who is it?
Komatsu Nana who lives with Ichinose Takumi.
Buzzer for Room 302 is connected.
Only expected visitors are allowed to enter.
I'm sorry.
There isn't anyone by that name living in this building.
How's that possible?
Trapnest's Takumi is living with that woman!
Even if you pretend you don't know, I know she's here because we know each other.
I'm sorry please take this back with you.
Shin?
Sorry, it's nothing really important.
Ever since the fireworks, I've been wondering how you were doing.
Fireworks are fun.. so was the summer when we wrote down our wishes on Kozoku.
Yeah.
We had fun.
Let's do fireworks again!
I wonder if the store still sells them.
I'm sorry, Shin.
I'm a traitor, I can't see you guys anymore.
No matter what happens, you are still my friend.
Nana, where is the blow dryer?
I need to use it.
I'm sorry, good night!
I'll try again tomorrow after work.
It's not like we'll never see each other again,
There is a tomorrow.
Why are you watching our tape first thing in the morning?
We are on TV.
What?
Good morning!
It's time for Morning Seven.
Unexpectedly, we have received news on a popular figure.
Guitarist of the popular band, Trapnest, Ren's exposed hot romance.
His love interest was a former bandmate.
Indies band Black Stones' vocalist Nana.
Today, we will unveil the truth behind their relationship.
Our guest for today is..
What is that?
Oh no!
What?
Why are you making a fuss in the morning?
What?
Nana's gossip.
Ah...
Which means, Nana's the one who brought this up.
That is to say, she's trying to make herself known to the public.
That's a lie.
It's obvious why she would do this.
This would definitely increase her popularity.
Yes.
Yeah, I'm watching and I've told her to be careful.
This is troublesome.
Now the media is making a big fuss over it.
What do you mean by troublesome?
That's mean!
Don't get involved.
I'll take care of it.
We are standing outside the apartment where Nana from the Black Stones resides.
Nana is currently at home and she hasn't confronted the reporters yet.
Yes.
Who is it?
Osaki Nana?
We are here to find out about your relationship with Honjo Ren.
Are you there?
Mr Kawano.
Have you seen what happened on TV?
Yeah.
We did.
Why did this have to happen...
Anyway, pack your bags.
You're all going to have to stay in a hotel until the rumors die down.
Miss Nana?
Miss Nana?
Please talk to us.
We will report exactly what you say.
Don't you dare go in.
Shoo!
Aren't you Black Stones...
I won't let you get away with that.
Are you alright?
Why are you acting cool?
Think about your position.
It's alright.
I can full-heartedly focus on the band now.
Hachiko, just watch!
I will make your wish come true.
What is your relationship with Nana?
Please tell us?
I got it.
Yes.
Let's just go with the recording company's plan.
It's so obvious that they are taking advantage of the situation to make more money.
But don't be pressured by it.
We won't sign the contract unless we agree to it.
Are you kidding me?
Of course we'll do it.
It's time to set your pride aside.
Things have already gone this far, we'll just use Ren's influence to get ahead,
We must reach the top, no matter how we get there.
Don't be affected by the scandals, just strive for our dream.
I object!
Even if we become famous musicians, It's all thanks to the scandals.
I don't want to debut in a company that works this way.
But, no matter how Gaia tries to increase our popularity
There's no way to know how well we will sell.
Since we are taking the chances, we need all the publicity we can get.
There are certain things in life we need to accept.
There are just way too many things in my life that I'm having trouble accepting
Then you should understand it better than anyone else.
In this world, justice doesn't always prevail.
If you don't want to lose then you shouldn't start.
If you can't accept this then go back to your home town.
Takumi!
Takumi's wife in UK.
You know how to say this in Japanese.
Ren hasn't said a thing so far.
Soon he will be going through the gate.
Which brings us to the end of this report.
But, I want to hear what he has to say.
Takumi?
Yeah, it's me.
I'll be going to UK tomorrow.
I will send you a message with my contact info.
Tomorrow?
How long will you be there?
Hmm.. six months
That long?
You can visit your family while I'm away.
So that you can be taken care of.
It would be good for the baby too.
I don't want to.
I want my own home.
No matter what.
You, me and the baby will live a happy life together.
I understand.
I'll bring home a present.
What would you like?
Diamond ring!
Ah..
I haven't given you one.
What's your finger size?
Size 7!
I got it.
Hey Nobu, what's missing here?
Ah.. sorry.
I erased it.
You should have told me earlier.
May I have your attention
Today's recording is cancelled.
Instead, we had a meeting
Next month, we will have concerts at 5 locations in Tokyo.
Let's go!
I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused.
Why say it now?
If you hadn't met me, you would have lived a peaceful life.
It's alright.
I'm destined to exist in the story of a woman named Nana.
But, it's all over now.
Now I feel I can write great heartfelt songs.
Maybe the happiest moment of my life was that night with the full moon.
But, I've already made my decisions.
There were so many staff members involved in BLAST's debut project.
We couldn't even remember all the names.
The me who had trouble getting along with people, didn't feel any pain at all.
Even if I met Hachi right now..
I can talk to her with a smile on my face.
Even if she talks about Takumi or the baby, I can calmly listen to what she has to say.
But, now there's no time for me to do that
Shinjuku at 7 pm.
I'll be waiting.
- Nana
Uh.. traffic jam.
Miss, we would probably be stuck here for awhile.
Excuse me, I'll get off here.
We are ready, Mr. Kawano.
Got it.
We'll be there soon.
Let's go!
Sing your heart out!
Good evening.
We are BLAST.
Hachi, although the distance between us is far.
Where you are now, is the safest place in the VIP area.
I wonder if the child in your tummy can hear our song.
Life is.. to keep going forward even though you are being pulled backwards.
Being pulled backwards doesn't make you stupid.
As long as you keep going forward.
At the time, everyone is discussing the two top selling bands.
Even now no one has broken their selling records.
Now you are in your 14th week of pregnancy.
Your baby is doing very well.
No matter what happens, I am Hachi's friend.
What is it?
It's from Shin.
He forwarded Hachiko's mail to you.
He wants you to read it.
Tonight, at Tamagawa
They are showing the firework display that was cancelled on the night of the typhoon.
That summer day when we gathered together.
I wish we could do it again, but I guess it's not possible.
Because it's just a dream.
Hachiko, it's not a dream.
- Nana
So pretty!
What a big rock!
Nobu gave up because he wants you to be happy.
So you better live a happy life for his sake.
Well having Takumi as your husband, he's bound to make you cry.
You are so in love with him, so it can't be helped.
Don't go easy on him if he cheats on you.
You have to punish him until you're not mad with him.
I got it.
Thank you, Nana.
I will definitely be happy.
Nana, why can't dreams and reality bring happiness to our lives?
I still don't understand.
But, what happened on that night
Still remains in my heart.
The two of us chasing after our dreams together.
I will never forget that shiny moment.

Ah..
Traffic jam
Miss, we will be stuck here for awhile
Excuse me, let me get off here
7 pm at Shinjuku, I'll be waiting
-Nana
How many people are there who knows of Nana
Nana,
Do you remember how we met?
It's the room on the 7th floor
There is no elevator
I like it
I like it here
What do you think?
Do you like it?
There aren't many apartments like this
You are very lucky
Nana..
Why can't dreams and reality bring happiness to our lives?
I still do not know..
We were always together but I still do not understand you
I didn't even notice when you were in pain
Nana, please forgive me..
Hachi, what's that?
It's 'donzoku' You don't know about 'donzoku'?
Write down your wishes and hang it by the leaves
Give me a pen
Here
I want blue
I want pink 'defeat Trapnest'
Defeat Trapnest
Nobu, that's not a wish.
It's your determination oh, right..
'I wish Nana will get a mobile phone'
You should really get an air conditioner
I wish to find happiness..
Like getting a boyfriend
Give up on Takumi.
He's a player.
Ah!
Takumi's autograph!
Last time when he came over, I forgot to ask for one.
Is that all you want?
I'll ask Ren to get you one.
Really?
Promise?
I won't forget
Yasu, why don't you write one?
I'll pass.. my mind is filled with what we need to do for our next live
It's been arranged.
Our last live was well received by the audience.
We are invited to perform again.
Wow!
You guys are definitely performing!
You must!
Right?
Nana?
Defeat Trapnest I feel empowered!
Right?
Feel the hotness!
right, you are absolutely right
I got it!
What are you doing?
You're making a mess!
On that night, Tokyo sky was covered by dark clouds We couldn't see the stars
But, we still had fun
Even though I know that simply wishing for something to happen will not make things happen
But at the time, we were hoping that we will be happy when our wishes come true.
'I wish Hachi will find a boyfriend with long hair.'
- Nana
Uh..
I drank too much
A cold?
It seems serious, you should take a day off
In other words, there's no need for you to come back here ever again
He... just fired me
That's right!
You are under estimating society
How can it be?
I hope you learned your lesson
G-o-o-d-b-y-e-!
just one would be enough just like Nana having a goal and blindly chasing after it
I want something like that too
- Unknown number -
Hello?
Hello!
Nana?
It's me, Takumi.
Sorry that I couldn't stay last time
I want to thank you properly, so I asked Ren for your number.
Don't say that, I wasn't being a good host as well.
What are you doing in a place like this?
What?
In a place like this?
Behind you, do you see a big black Benz?
Over there!
I see it!
Come over, let's have dinner together.
Sure!
At the time, I felt so empty
The world around Nana, everyone shines so brightly
That's not something that anyone can achieve
I also want to be a part of their world
There's no need to be nervous
Yes.
Sorry.
But I don't know what to do
I never imagined to meet you like this
I should be the one saying that.
I thought it'd be great if we meet again
.. how can that be?
I wouldn't have called you otherwise
Give up on Takumi.
He's a player.
What's this?
It's huge..
like a castle!
Don't tell me it's a suite room?
Gorgeous
Order whatever you like
Ah!
I always wanted to get room service!
Awesome!
Delicious!
I like Nana's cooking more.
You're right.
It's tiresome to eat out all the time during tour.
After the tour ends, I'll go see you right away!
Please cook for me then.
It's alright.
I know what to expect.
I only want to be like this for now.
I won't take it seriously.
- Yasu -
Hello?
Hey..
Hachiko!
It's late.
Where the heck are you?
Nana!
You are getting me worried!
I'm sorry.
I'll be staying over in my friend's place tonight.
What?
at your boyfriend's?
No!
At Junko's!
Haha!
I'm kidding!
Don't take it so seriously.
Say hi to Junko for me.
Sure
I can't tell Nana, I don't want her to know
Nana, actually I'm not fine at all
but I can't just run away like this and I don't expect him to say he loves me
It's no good.
I might end up hurting myself again.
- Takumi's phone number and e-mail -
Trapnest's final tour is in Tokyo
I can't go without a ticket, so I have to wait for him with my home cooked meal.
with a shred of hope, I'll wait for him
Looks delicious!
So much food!
Who's coming
It's enough for 5 people
They must be really hungry after the live.
What time will Ren be here?
What?
Is he coming?
You mean he's not?
I don't think so.
He never told me.
He will definitely come, after the live is over.
Wouldn't he come to see you right afterwards?
There's that party after the live.
I don't think he's coming.
Really?
Cheer up!
I'll ask him to come over next time.
Shall I ask him to bring Takumi with him?
No, it's okay.
Don't worry about it.
Alright!
I'll eat as much as I can!
Too bad for Ren!
Serves him right for missing all this delicious food!
Nana
This time's world tour..
Is really great!
Thank you everyone!
Cheers!
Picture time!
Stand closer!
Cheese
Alright!
One more!
Gin tonic.
Nobu, you are drinking too much.
I shouldn't attend another band's celebration
This time, Takumi produced Trapnest's new album right?
Yeah
No wonder it's so much better than the first.
You are cute.
But all the music are composed by Ren
Heard that?
Give me one
Who should I write it to?
Hachiko
Hachi?
You met her at the Mahjong match.
Her name is Komatsu Nana.
Ah..
Nana.
I don't think she needs one.
No.. she's always wanted one.
I've already done it with her.
Here.
Wait.. what did you do?
She's Nana's close friend
Have some decency.
I didn't force her.
She willingly came to me.
Wait a minute!
If you want a fight, let's take this outside.
Don't ruin the party for the tour staff.
Nobu.
I'm going home.
Mr. Takumi, thanks for the hard work.
Don't get mad.
It's all your fault.
Thanks to him, I remembered something important that I had to do.
I'm gonna go.
.. but Takumi, there's still..
Count me out.
Hey, Hachiko.
Have some?
Get her back!
Doesn't Nobu like Hachi?
I can't help it.
Hachi likes Takumi.
Takumi just happened to be there for Hachi
Hachi is not that type of woman.
Takumi must have fooled her with his sweet words.
You think so?
Hachi is not that stupid
- It's not stupid.
It's naive.
Hachi must be lonely and sad after she broke up with her boyfriend
Yet you are too perserved to do anything.
I'm not going to forgive Takumi for what he did.
Do you know what time it is?
It's already 4 am.
Did you have a fight with Nana?
Do you have a boyfriend?
No
Really?
That's good.
You are cute.
Men must have fallen all over for you.
No that's you Mr Takumi.
No need for formalities.
Takumi must be very popular among women.
I bet you've had lots of girlfriends
Not true.
I am very lonely.
No way!
How can that be?
My work comes first.
They all felt neglected.
Sometimes I couldn't keep my promise.
No woman can stand being with me for so long.
You can't help it if you're busy.
You are the only one who understands me.
That's because I am a fan of Takumi and Trapnest.
Please place your work before your relationship with a woman.
You are so cute, really..
Stay with me forever.
I am Hachi's friend.
I want to cheer for her.
But, why does it have to be Takumi?
Why does Trapnest steal all the important people away from me?
First, Ren.
Now, Hachiko.
Just go and have a talk with Ren.
What are you trying to do?
It's no use feeling this way.
Quit smoking from now on.
I will do the same.
Please try our new product - 3 Flavoured Dumpling.
In each pack, there are three different flavours.
Shrimp, pork and vegetable.
Please come and try it.
Please have one.
Scout?
Scout?
Yes.
Scout?
Right.
Wait.
Calm down, calm down, Nana.
You are the one who should calm down.
Right.
Actually, we mailed our demo tape and live video to several recording companies.
We were contacted by Gaia Records, one of the biggest recording company.
Wow!
That's great!
How about your debut?
Someone from Gaia will be coming to our next live event.
If they like what they see, we will then discuss it in detail.
That's definitely not a problem.
BLAST's lives are the best.
Isn't it?
Consider the deal sealed then.
Nana, Takumi came over after Trapnest's final live.
Yeah I know.
I saw you two.
I called out to you but you didn't notice me.
I'm sorry.
About what?
You must be surprised because I didn't tell you..
I was surprised.
But, there's no need to apologize.
But then I noticed that you left because you didn't want to disturb us.
It's alright.
I'm going to live with Ren soon.
What?
At Ren's place?
It's only for 2 weeks.
Trapnest is taking 2 weeks off from activities.
It's rare for them to have a break.
So, I want to spend some time with Ren.
When I woke up the next day, Nana had already left.
Isn't the scenery beautiful?
Live with me.
I'll think about it.
Let's go on a trip.
We've got the time.
Maybe for you.
I'm busy.
Take a break.
Forget about work.
An important live is ahead of us.
We are practicing everyday.
You can see the ocean in Tokyo very well.
I have forgotten.
During the two weeks Nana was gone, I put all my energy into work.
As for their practices, I never missed one.
And never once has Takumi called me.
Ah..
This time it's fireworks.
Yes.
It's close by, we should all go.
Yes!
Let's stop here, I am almost home.
I'm sorry to trouble you for walking me home.
What's wrong?
I can't.
About what?
Uh.. nevermind.
I'll tell you next time.
What is it?
I know that I am in no way better than him and that I am not good enough to surpass him..
What are you talking about?
I may be able to offer you some suggestions.
But, I will surpass him one day.
Who?
Takumi.
Good night.
Good evening we are BLAST.
Think about it.
You have talent.
Your live was flawless.
I've been in this business for so many years.
I haven't been this excited in a long time.
Yea, it's Nana.
Ah..
Nana you've worked hard for this live.
I'm already home.
When will you be coming home?
Sorry, we won't be able to go home.
We are having dinner with someone from Gaia.
Could it be that you've already prepared everything?
No.. not yet..
I just got home.
I'm really sorry.
It's alright.
Don't worry.
Just go to your dinner.
Compared to our promise, it's understandable that Nana chooses her work over me.
It's also understandable that she chose to live with Ren over me.
I understand everything.
But.. does that mean I am not needed?
I couldn't contact Takumi.
Ocassionally, I sent him a few short messages.
But, he never sends me any replies.
Thank you for today.
No, no, I should be saying that.
Let's do this again some time.
Hachi said she has to work tomorrow I want to go see her tonight.
Welcome home!
Sorry about yesterday.
Nana asked us to come over to eat the food you prepared.
It's really delicious.
Good!
When will you be able to debut?
It's not that easy.
We have to come up with some great songs that will do well in the charts first.
Right now, I don't have much hope for you to write amazing songs.
Well..
That's not true!
He can do it!
Actually, he already did.
Nobu wrote a song on the night he came to Tokyo.
That's the song I love the most.
I'm serious.
I fell in love with it when I heard it for the first time.
I was so moved!
It even gave me goose bumps!
It would definitely do well in the charts.
Uh..
Hachi..
That's enough..
Thank you.
That's right.. we are out of drinks.
Could someone go get some?
Why don't you get it yourself?
Uh.. sorry for not noticing.
I'll go buy drinks.
It's dangerous for a girl to go alone at night Nobu.
Right!
I love you.
Telling you this now..
Maybe you'll just laugh at me.
I know about your relationship with Takumi.
You love him don't you?
Where's Hachiko?
She went out to get something.
What?
And I rushed home from work.
They won't be home for some time.
Why?
I gave Nobu a chance for them to be alone.
Good job Shin!
I didn't want anyone to know about me and Takumi.
So that I can pretend nothing had happened and live my life just like before.
I am so calculating.
You must have looked down on me.
No.
I am happy.
I don't know how to neglect what I have felt for you.
Nobu..
I..
I cannot force you to be with me.
You will be confused if you get involved with me now.
You are so kind and fragile.
No matter how hard i try, I will never surpass Takumi.
No..
I..
But, if you are willing to break up with him and be mine.
I will do everything in my power to bring you happiness.
Come and find me.
I'll wait for you.
I believe in you.
I have something to tell you.
Give me a call when you can.
Sorry to bother you at work.
- Nana
Hello.
Ah..
What is it that you wanted to tell me?
What's wrong?
What happened?
Can I see you now?
Sorry, I'm in the middle of my work.
Sorry for bothering you at work.
Can't you tell me over the phone?
I have a busy schedule and I won't be available for some time.
Is that so..
What should I do?
What is it?
Could it be that you're pregnant?
What?
No!
No?
Good!
Don't scare me like that
Believe it or not, I'm quite delicate.
Sorry, I gotta go.
I'll call you when I'm free.
You don't need to.
What?
You don't need to.
In other words, don't ever call me again.
GOODBYE!
I did it!
I finally did it!
Now it's over!
Finally, I am awake!
I'm here.
I'm sorry to bother you at work.
Nana told me that you worked here.
When do you finish?
9pm?
I see, I'll wait for you at the nearby coffee shop.
Wait!
You can't!
Why?
We've talked about this before.
Only come when you've broken up with Takumi.
I've already broken it off.
It's too soon.
But, I've already waited a day.
A day seems like a year.
Even so, a day is still a day.
Right!
Right.
I'll wait for another day.
Forget it!
Do you know how to make 'Nikujaga'?
It's my specialty
Good morning.
Nana?
You're back!
What about ren?
I'm busy with work, so I had to return.
How about you?
Who were you with?
Uh..
Right!
Did you find Nobu's work place?
Yes!
Thank you.
I had something to discuss with him.
You two are very alike.
He was always quite honest, naive and pure.
So I think both of you would get along great.
Nana
To me, Nobu..
To me, Nobu..
I think I've fallen for him.
Isn't it obvious?
- Komatsu Nana -
Phone refuses masked number.
The following is an update on the typhoon.
A strong typhoon No.11 has arrived at Kantou.
It hasn't died down yet, but in about an hour..
It's Hachi.
Hello.
Nobu!
What the heck are you doing?
Get over here!
Didn't you promise to pick Hachi up at 7pm?
But, I can't get out!
Look at the weather.
I'm sure the fireworks is cancelled.
Don't you want to see Hachi in a kimono?
Your nose will bleed.
I bought fireworks!
Once the weather dies down, we'll go light them up by the lake.
Why do you have to tag along?
You two are soaked!
It's raining cats and dogs.
To our band, Hachi is like Madonna.
When Hachi's laughter can be heard, there are bound to be noises from the crowd.
No matter what, at our practices, she's always full of energy.
Compared to a talented musician joining our band, her existence is alot more meaningful.
What's that?
You may have noticed.
Your every move is like the wandering typhoon that deeply moves my heart.
I am like a teenager who has just fallen in love for the first time.
During that following week, I spent half the time staying at Ren's
Hachi and I hardly see each other.
We hardly had the chance to talk.
But, I think it's good.
Because we save alot of time from talking about unnecessary things.
Open the package and put the curry in the pot.
Once you remove a package, put a new pack on the table.
One pack at a time.
Are you listening?
Your rice should look like this.
Smells good!
You smell it.
What?
Miss Komatsu?
Miss Komatsu?
You are pregnant.
The small black circle is the egg containing your baby.
Your baby is the black dot inside the egg.
If you want to keep the baby come back for an examination in 2 weeks.
If you decide not to keep the baby.
You should take action soon, otherwise it would take a toll on your body.
Do you need to take the picture home with you?
Yes.
We're done with practice I heard that you aren't feeling well.
I'll go see you if you're not sleeping yet.
Call me!
- Nobu
Nana?
It's me.
What?
Nana, open the door.
Please, open the door.
Oh no, someone's coming.
What are you doing here?
Go home!
This is no joke.
Morning sickness?
I won't be a burden.
It's my fault for not being careful.
Maybe it's my boyfriend's child.
Go home.
Don't ever come back.
Is your boyfriend Nobu?
Really?
I understand.
Takumi?
What are you doing?
- Nobu -
Phone?
Wait.. don't tell Nobu!
Oh!
Hachi?
Yeah!
Hello?
Nobu, it's me.
Takumi.
Can you hear me?
Yes.
Nana is pregnant.
I don't know who the father is.
But, if Nana wants to keep it, I will accept it as my own.
What do you think?
Why don't you say something?
Say something!
What's wrong?
Hello?
Hachiko?
Ah!
Nana?
It's good that you're there.
Can you bring Nobu over?
It's hard to discuss this over the phone.
What the hell are you doing with hachi's phone?
I'm just borrowing it.
I'm at your place.
What the hell are you doing there?
Leave her alone!
She's no longer yours!
Hachi is now with Nobu.
I know..
But, you are the one who stole my woman.
Where is Hachi?
She's here.
Let me talk to her!
I can't communicated with you.
Nana wants to talk to you.
Seems like she's not in the condition to talk.
What the hell did you do?
Anyways, we'll be there soon.
Uh.. on your way home..
Could you get some grapefruits and carbonated drinks?
What?
I'm going to make her a drink.
She's throwing up real bad and is in alot of pain.
I'm counting on you.
Throwing up?
Don't be so depressed..
What if you lost your baby?
Can you stand up?
Nana is so undependable.
Already an adult.
Still doesn't eat proper meals.
Spent time with men when you are lonely and then becomes pregnant.
What am I going to do with you?
You are going to make your parents cry.
Though, I'm not in the position to lecture you.
No matter who the father is, you are definitely the mother of the child.
Hang in there.
You came by yourself?
Where's Nana?
I don't know.
Then, I'm gonna go.
There's nothing good to talk about between the three of us anyway.
Even if Nana doesn't make a choice, one of us is the father.
Nana, is it true that you are pregnant?
I want to hear it from you.
The child could be mine.
I also know that you broke off with Takumi not long ago.
I'm sorry.
Why are you apologizing?
You mean, you never broke up with him?
Look at me!
Why can't you face me?
Please explain to me.
I will believe you, even if you lie to me.
Nobu said that Hachi is pregnant.
I'm so confused.
Am I weird?
At a time like this, what should I do as a friend?
I wanted to be Hachi's friend..
You smoke?
Actually, I'm not as naive as Nana and Nobu think I am.
Takumi is the only one who understands how empty and helpless I am.
and he has forgiven me.
I know that I have a baby inside me.
No matter what I have to be strong.
I cannot pretend as if nothing has happened.
Starting today, I will be in the recording studio for a week.
Before that, could I hear your answer?
Otherwise, I won't be able to concentrate at work.
I want to keep the baby.
Having you as the father of my child.
That is, if we are not a burden to you,
I will marry you.
What?
So that you won't have to keep your pregnancy a secret.
If we get married, no one will talk behind your back.
The media won't bother you, since you are not in the industry.
Any objections?
Welcome back.
I have something important to tell you.
We are getting married.
We'll be looking for a new place to move in.
Sorry, but you need to find a new roommate.
It's fine.
I will be moving in with Ren soon.
No, Wait.
Please think about the trouble you might cause Ren by moving in.
It would be disastrous if the media found out about your relationship with Ren.
Before your debut, you wouldn't want to be known to the public this way, would you?
Of course not!
Sorry for making you worried.
Then, be cautious.
You don't need to apologize.
I got it.
I'll be careful.
That's all I have to say.
I'm gonna go.
I'll get my staff to handle the rest of the details.
If you find a place you like, go right ahead and put a hold on it.
What?
We'll be moving to a new place soon.
So that you won't have to see Nana.
You look alot better now.
Has the vomitting subsided?
Thank you.
Don't.
You don't have to worry about anything.
Why not use the strawberry cups?
Why buy them if you're not going to use them?
Because it would be sad if the cups were to break.
Great.
They are beautifully connected together.
They won't be sad anymore.
Nobu, what happened to the new song?
Ah..
It's rare to see you down.
Get some comfort from Hachi.
Where did you run away to?
Such an important time for Hachi.
You don't seem to care about her.
I went back this morning.
She didn't say a word to me.
Takumi was the one who did all the talking.
About what?
It's okay, tell me.
I won't be shocked by anything.
Anymore.
They are getting married.
You were surprised!
You would be!
This is insane!
I'm sorry Nobu.
Don't be.
Yesterday is already over.
But, I am involved in this, why didn't I know anything?
Am I not trustworthy enough for her?
It's okay to cry, Nobu.
You can cry on my shoulder!
What are you doing?
Don't be shy!
Aren't we best buddies?
But, there are so many people looking at us.
So what?
Before I met you, I hated everyone.
But after knowing you, I realized that I can't give up on this world.
I don't think you are untrustworthy, Nobu.
You've only been dumped by a woman, don't be so down..
It hurts.
Your wristband is cutting into my neck.
Hello?
Ren?
Nana is at my place.
She got drink after a few drinks.
I can't seem to wake her up.
Can you come and get her?
I got it.
I'll be there!
Alright sorry.
Oh.. she's awake!
Where are you going?
Ren is coming to get you!
It would be problematic if the media finds him.
Tell him that we shouldn't meet for awhile.
What?
Wait, Nana!
Wait!
To Nana,
Hachi?
Are you there, Hachiko?
I don't think Nana will forgive me for what I've done.
I will never forget the six months we spent together.
I wish you would make your major debut soon and appear on television frequently so that I could hear you sing and see your glamour on stage.
No matter who I am in love with, Nana is my only hero.
Now and forever.
- Komatsu Nana -
Nana
Why are you so upset?
This is not a farewell letter.
It's a sincere love letter.
Go see her.
Go to Hachi.
You know you want to see her smiling face with joyful tears.
Why should I go?
That is what a hero would do.
I'm looking for someone, she doesn't appear to be at home.
Could you give this to her when she returns?
Sure.
Who is it?
Komatsu Nana who lives with Ichinose Takumi.
Buzzer for Room 302 is connected.
Only expected visitors are allowed to enter.
I'm sorry.
There isn't anyone by that name living in this building.
How's that possible?
Trapnest's Takumi is living with that woman!
Even if you pretend you don't know, I know she's here because we know each other.
I'm sorry please take this back with you.
Shin?
Sorry, it's nothing really important.
Ever since the fireworks, I've been wondering how you were doing.
Fireworks are fun.. so was the summer when we wrote down our wishes on Kozoku.
Yeah.
We had fun.
Let's do fireworks again!
I wonder if the store still sells them.
I'm sorry, Shin.
I'm a traitor, I can't see you guys anymore.
No matter what happens, you are still my friend.
Nana, where is the blow dryer?
I need to use it.
I'm sorry, good night!
I'll try again tomorrow after work.
It's not like we'll never see each other again,
There is a tomorrow.
Why are you watching our tape first thing in the morning?
We are on TV.
What?
Good morning!
It's time for Morning Seven.
Unexpectedly, we have received news on a popular figure.
Guitarist of the popular band, Trapnest, Ren's exposed hot romance.
His love interest was a former bandmate.
Indies band Black Stones' vocalist Nana.
Today, we will unveil the truth behind their relationship.
Our guest for today is..
What is that?
Oh no!
What?
Why are you making a fuss in the morning?
What?
Nana's gossip.
Ah...
Which means, Nana's the one who brought this up.
That is to say, she's trying to make herself known to the public.
That's a lie.
It's obvious why she would do this.
This would definitely increase her popularity.
Yes.
Yeah, I'm watching and I've told her to be careful.
This is troublesome.
Now the media is making a big fuss over it.
What do you mean by troublesome?
That's mean!
Don't get involved.
I'll take care of it.
We are standing outside the apartment where Nana from the Black Stones resides.
Nana is currently at home and she hasn't confronted the reporters yet.
Yes.
Who is it?
Osaki Nana?
We are here to find out about your relationship with Honjo Ren.
Are you there?
Mr Kawano.
Have you seen what happened on TV?
Yeah.
We did.
Why did this have to happen...
Anyway, pack your bags.
You're all going to have to stay in a hotel until the rumors die down.
Miss Nana?
Miss Nana?
Please talk to us.
We will report exactly what you say.
Don't you dare go in.
Shoo!
Aren't you Black Stones...
I won't let you get away with that.
Are you alright?
Why are you acting cool?
Think about your position.
It's alright.
I can full-heartedly focus on the band now.
Hachiko, just watch!
I will make your wish come true.
What is your relationship with Nana?
Please tell us?
I got it.
Yes.
Let's just go with the recording company's plan.
It's so obvious that they are taking advantage of the situation to make more money.
But don't be pressured by it.
We won't sign the contract unless we agree to it.
Are you kidding me?
Of course we'll do it.
It's time to set your pride aside.
Things have already gone this far, we'll just use Ren's influence to get ahead,
We must reach the top, no matter how we get there.
Don't be affected by the scandals, just strive for our dream.
I object!
Even if we become famous musicians, It's all thanks to the scandals.
I don't want to debut in a company that works this way.
But, no matter how Gaia tries to increase our popularity
There's no way to know how well we will sell.
Since we are taking the chances, we need all the publicity we can get.
There are certain things in life we need to accept.
There are just way too many things in my life that I'm having trouble accepting
Then you should understand it better than anyone else.
In this world, justice doesn't always prevail.
If you don't want to lose then you shouldn't start.
If you can't accept this then go back to your home town.
Takumi!
Takumi's wife in UK.
You know how to say this in Japanese.
Ren hasn't said a thing so far.
Soon he will be going through the gate.
Which brings us to the end of this report.
But, I want to hear what he has to say.
Takumi?
Yeah, it's me.
I'll be going to UK tomorrow.
I will send you a message with my contact info.
Tomorrow?
How long will you be there?
Hmm.. six months
That long?
You can visit your family while I'm away.
So that you can be taken care of.
It would be good for the baby too.
I don't want to.
I want my own home.
No matter what.
You, me and the baby will live a happy life together.
I understand.
I'll bring home a present.
What would you like?
Diamond ring!
Ah..
I haven't given you one.
What's your finger size?
Size 7!
I got it.
Hey Nobu, what's missing here?
Ah.. sorry.
I erased it.
You should have told me earlier.
May I have your attention
Today's recording is cancelled.
Instead, we had a meeting
Next month, we will have concerts at 5 locations in Tokyo.
Let's go!
I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused.
Why say it now?
If you hadn't met me, you would have lived a peaceful life.
It's alright.
I'm destined to exist in the story of a woman named Nana.
But, it's all over now.
Now I feel I can write great heartfelt songs.
Maybe the happiest moment of my life was that night with the full moon.
But, I've already made my decisions.
There were so many staff members involved in BLAST's debut project.
We couldn't even remember all the names.
The me who had trouble getting along with people, didn't feel any pain at all.
Even if I met Hachi right now..
I can talk to her with a smile on my face.
Even if she talks about Takumi or the baby, I can calmly listen to what she has to say.
But, now there's no time for me to do that
Shinjuku at 7 pm.
I'll be waiting.
- Nana
Uh.. traffic jam.
Miss, we would probably be stuck here for awhile.
Excuse me, I'll get off here.
We are ready, Mr. Kawano.
Got it.
We'll be there soon.
Let's go!
Sing your heart out!
Good evening.
We are BLAST.
Hachi, although the distance between us is far.
Where you are now, is the safest place in the VIP area.
I wonder if the child in your tummy can hear our song.
Life is.. to keep going forward even though you are being pulled backwards.
Being pulled backwards doesn't make you stupid.
As long as you keep going forward.
At the time, everyone is discussing the two top selling bands.
Even now no one has broken their selling records.
Now you are in your 14th week of pregnancy.
Your baby is doing very well.
No matter what happens, I am Hachi's friend.
What is it?
It's from Shin.
He forwarded Hachiko's mail to you.
He wants you to read it.
Tonight, at Tamagawa
They are showing the firework display that was cancelled on the night of the typhoon.
That summer day when we gathered together.
I wish we could do it again, but I guess it's not possible.
Because it's just a dream.
Hachiko, it's not a dream.
- Nana
So pretty!
What a big rock!
Nobu gave up because he wants you to be happy.
So you better live a happy life for his sake.
Well having Takumi as your husband, he's bound to make you cry.
You are so in love with him, so it can't be helped.
Don't go easy on him if he cheats on you.
You have to punish him until you're not mad with him.
I got it.
Thank you, Nana.
I will definitely be happy.
Nana, why can't dreams and reality bring happiness to our lives?
I still don't understand.
But, what happened on that night
Still remains in my heart.
The two of us chasing after our dreams together.
I will never forget that shiny moment.

AUREHOJ HIGH SCHOOL 9TH GRADE 2:43 PM
All over the world youths undergo special rituals to mark the transition to adulthood.
These rituals are governed by a special set of rules.
The youth is removed from his or her daily surroundings and is placed in an unknown or dangerous situation.
These puberty rituals are called rites of passage.
In other words, an individual's passage from one status to another.
Afterwards he's regarded as an adult.
What else do we call this?
Rebekka?
Why can't we plan our curriculum?
At least we'd learn something useful.
- What would be useful to learn?
- Something relevant to our life.
This is relevant to people all over the world, and has been for ages.
Can you think of a Christian rite of passage?
- Confirmation.
But I don't agree.
- Of course you don't.
Nobody treats me different 'coz I got an iMac and some shitty altar wine.
I didn't feel any sexual challenge by having a curfew at 11 o'clock.
That's quite interesting.
A shame you didn't put that in your paper.
As it is, I have to give you a D. Have a nice weekend.
TRIPLE DARE
- How old are you?
- 18.
17.
- 16.
- Can I see some ID?
Look, I know you're only 15.
- Are you calling me a liar?
- Yes.
Your name is Rebekka.
I've fucked your big brother.
- Where's our vodka?
- The cashier's fucked Stefan.
- Were all the cashiers girls?
- I don't know.
- How did you do that?
- Hoot hoot!
Hoot hoot!
Do you wanna have a go?
Hi.
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.
- Jesus, 50 Cent and Dr. Dre?
- You sound like my mom, Sofie.
- They call women degrading names.
- Like ho, like bitch, like slut.
- Why do you have to talk like that?
- You're such a fucking virgin!
- It's okay to be a virgin.
- Chill.
I didn't mean you.
- What's this?
- A cootie catcher, remember?
- My step sister gave it to me.
- Aren't you lucky?
- Choose a color.
- Blue.
- Choose a number.
- Six.
Sex?
Sex!
It says you have to moon.
You have to!
- Or else?
- You die.
It says so in the rules.
Fuck the rules.
- A children's ticket.
- Nope.
You're not under 16.
- I'm 15.
- Don't lie to me.
I'm not lying.
I'm entitled to buy a children's ticket.
I'm a child!
You can have an ordinary ticket, or you can get off.
I'd like to discuss the way you talk to me.
- I think you're condescending.
- We don't mean to.
- It's mainly Stefan... stupid pube!
- How about the way you talk?
- See, Rebekka.
Do as Mom says.
- Shut up.
I'm trying to converse.
- How grown-up. "Converse"!
- Stefan, don't start.
- Are you coming to the cottage?
- No, the girls are coming.
- I won't babysit the 3 little pigs!
- They can babysit themselves.
I can't get wasted, pick up chicks and babysit the 3 little pigs.
- Look how condescending he is!
- Stop it, will you?
- Hey, that must be your wet dream.
- Stop it!
She dreams about Adam every night.
Sure you do, you're turning red.
If she likes Adam, it's her business.
- I don't like Adam.
- Why don't you let him in then?
- Cool top.
- Thanks.
- Coming tomorrow?
- Yes.
- Where?
- Didn't he invite you to my 18th?
You can bring some friends so you aren't the only freshman.
Wassup, bitch!
- Rebekka wants to go out with you.
- Shouldn't she ask me herself?
- She's shy...
Turning red again.
- You're such a dick!
Yuck!
Are you piercing your ear with that dirty needle?
- You do it, Sofie.
- No, I'll faint.
I'll do it.
- I've got an idea.
- Gross.
- It's just skin.
- I'm trying to say something.
- I'm going to puke.
- And some people pierce their pussy.
I'm trying to tell you something.
These rites of passage, right?
The idea is to do something creepy and then you're considered an adult.
Some African tribes brand people to show they've entered adulthood.
I'd let them brand me if it would get me into the trendy clubs.
We're in limbo waiting to get older so people will take us seriously.
Wasting our lives following rules made by old people with long boobs and rotting brain cells!
We should make the rules.
- I'm sick of being in limbo.
- But what can we do about it?
We can make up our own rite of passage...
The Cootie Catcher.
We'll each write a dare on the flaps without letting the others see it.
I'll start.
No peeking.
- This isn't like the other rites.
- They're like ancient and African!
- Must it be something gross?
- Not necessarily.
- Can it be about sex?
- Preferably.
Just push the limit.
Rule No. 1.
We all have to do a dare by midnight on Saturday.
Rule No. 2.
If you don't do your dare in two hours, it's the next one's tum.
And then you draw a new dare.
Rule No. 3.
The Cootie Catcher is a secret.
If anyone fails, we'll send nude pics of her round to the whole school.
- No way.
- Be sure to pass, then.
I've got a better punishment.
If you fail, you shave your head.
- Isn't there more to life than hair?
- Yeah, but my punishment is better.
- I'd rather be bald than nude.
- I make the rules.
- Two punishments?
That's stupid.
- Mine's way better.
- Let's just have them both.
- Fine.
Both mine and Sofie's then.
So, if we fail, we'll send nude pics round and we have to shave our head.
It's 7 p.m. Let the Cootie Catcher begin.
Claudia, you have two hours to do your first dare.
Blue.
Five.
One...
Six.
- "Make out with Yogurt"?
- You got mine!
- Who the fuck is Yogurt?
- The acne guy with the 6,000 DVDs.
- Who wets himself when he's drunk?
- Yes.
You have to make out with him.
- Eat your heart out.
- Man, if he kisses like a blender!
MAKE OUT WITH YOGURT
- We have to be able to see you.
- See me pop Yogurt's cherry?
We have to verify that you do it properly.
- Sure I will.
- You have one hour and 45 minutes.
Good luck.
- Hello.
- Is Yogurt in?
Alexander.
Alexander, you've got a visitor.
Are you in the same grade as "Yogurt" as you call him?
No.
Bye.
- What are you doing here?
- Have you really got 6,000 DVDs?
- Why?
- Can I borrow one?
- Why don't you go to Blockbuster?
- I promised Rebekka to bring some.
But seeing as you know all about movies, maybe you can help me.
- Seen "Zombie Flesh Eaters"?
- Yes...
No.
Get down!
"Zombie Flesh Eaters", 1979.
A masterpiece.
Fulci's 30th movie.
Far out.
They made movies like that then?
- Sure!
Ever seen "The Beyond"?
- I don't think so.
A girl gets her face eaten by maggots in two minutes.
It's pure ballet.
Yuck!
Come over here.
How come we've never hung out?
You've ignored me since grade school.
- Were you in my grade school?
- Yes, don't you remember?
Sure, I do.
The hell you do.
I wasn't in your grade school.
I was just testing.
- Are we on Candid Camera?
- What do you mean?
I don't care if we are.
- They did it!
- That's not making out.
No tongue.
Why did you kiss me?
Because I want to.
- They didn't make out, Sofie.
- Alright.
I remember your first day in school.
You were late and couldn't find your home room.
You fell next to the Coke machine.
You thought no one noticed and got back up in a hurry.
I was dying to help you up and kiss you.
But I didn't dare to, of course.
- Is this some kind of a joke?
- No.
Who's that?
Katja, Stefan's class mate.
What the hell's she doing here?
I know it's wrong, but I'm madly in love with you.
Come on.
Do you know Katja, Alexander's girlfriend?
- Why was Katja there?
- Is he going out with a senior?
Don't you feel bad that you tried to kiss her boyfriend?
She'll never know, will she?
Anyway, it's over and I passed.
- No, you didn't.
- Why not?
- You were supposed to make out.
- My tongue almost touched his.
But the Cootie Catcher said "make out".
We have to take it seriously.
- I do!
And I passed.
- I don't think so.
Right, Sofie?
I dunno.
Didn't you agree they didn't make out?
- Yes.
- We either do it all-out or drop it.
Fuck it!
- Can we drop by the cafe?
- We have to draw the next dare.
- Rasmus keeps texting me.
- Ignore him.
I am.
But I want to make it clear to him that it's over.
- Okay, five minutes.
- That's all I need.
You can't sit here.
- But I'm 18.
- "I'm 18".
Sure, just buy something.
- My friends are in the bathroom.
- They're for paying customers only.
Okay.
Give me a Coke...
And three glasses.
Run up and get it yourself.
Fucking teenager!
- Someone's doing it in the bathroom.
- I bet it's Claudia.
- She promised not to.
- How can she when she's not in love?
- What?
- Nothing.
Tell me.
Will I ever fall in love?
Maybe some people never find anyone.
- Not you, Sofie.
- Why not?
Maybe I'm frigid.
Everyone talks about the sweet agony of being madly in love.
I've never felt that way about a guy.
What are you trying to say?
Nothing.
I'll call you later, beautiful.
Hi.
- So, what did you talk about?
- He was full of bad excuses.
- I think he wants me back.
- Good thing you know how to say no.
Yes.
Your tum, right?
Here.
Okay.
Yellow.
Four.
Four again.
Eight.
What does that mean?
- Hey, I wrote that.
- Let me see.
"Make someone think you're a hooker." How?
Yes, how?
- I didn't make the rules.
- Are you mad because you failed?
No.
I just think we should take the Cootie Catcher seriously.
But your definition sucks. "Make someone think you're a hooker".
- Not one word about money.
- How else are you going to prove it?
Just convince someone you're a hooker, take the money and run.
Sure, but where do I find him?
- She's hot.
- You can't call other girls hot.
- Sure.
You're pretty hot yourself.
- If girls like girls, let them.
But do they have to lie there...
licking each other?
Now just choose the least gross one.
"31-year-old good-looking guy seeks the erotic company of playful girl."
- 31!
- How about this one:
"64-year-old farmer in bra and panties wants to be spanked." Nice.
I'll take the 31-year-old.
But what if he's a psycho?
- He is.
He's got a sex web profile.
- Just take the money and run.
Okay, what to write?
"Dear 31-year-old.
I really got turned on by your profile."
- "I want to meet you right away." - "Please fulfill my sex fantasies."
What if he believes it?
500?
No, I cost at least 100,000 kroner.
- He won't call you then.
- "I'm only wet the next two hours."
"My number is..."
- There.
- You didn't!
What if he calls?
Talk to him.
Would you rather wait to be picked up on the street?
As if I'm going to stand on the street and shout:
"Love for sale.
Only 500 kroner."
"But hurry up.
I'm only wet the next two hours!" Oh, my God!
Want some candy?
- Are you on-line?
- Yes, but it was boring, so...
You're never home on a Friday night.
Nice to know you're not getting into trouble.
- We're going upstairs.
- Thanks for the candy.
Why, you're... welcome.
He's not going to call.
- What does a hooker wear?
- How about those?
No way!
Rebekka.
Where are you going?
- To Sofie's to watch DVDs.
- Now?
It's 11 p.m.
She's got "Zombie Flesh Eaters", an Italian horror movie by Lucio Fulci.
All that make-up.
You look like a...
I can look like whatever I want.
But do you have to look like that when you're watching videos?
DVDs!
See you, Mom.
Bye.
MAKE SOMEONE THINK YOU'RE A HOOKER
Shit, man!
- What if he wants me to get in?
- Just ask for the money first.
- Where do you think they go?
- I don't like this.
There's one.
Come on, you can do it.
It'll be okay.
Do it.
Now, Rebekka.
Do it.
Be careful.
- Fucking whore!
- It's Rebekka.
It's the 31-year-old.
Run when you've got the money.
Kick him in the balls if he acts up.
- Fancy place.
Think he's rich?
- No, men'll do anything to get laid.
- What if he wants sex first?
- Lick him a little on the neck.
- Gross!
- They're suckers for that.
- I'm going in.
- Show us the 500 and you've passed.
Hi.
- How old are you anyway?
- 20.
20?
Great.
Let me take your jacket.
Come in, for chrissakes.
A drink?
- Do you live here?
- No, it's just temporary.
- How long have you lived here?
- How long?
A year or so.
Your jacket, let's take it off.
There you go...
Whoops.
You smell nice.
Cheers.
Give me the money first and then we'll get down to business.
500, right?
Hello.
Hi, sweetie.
What?
Have you been to the zoo?
Great.
With Mom?
Were you scared?
Of course you weren't.
Let's go to the park on Saturday and play football, just you and me.
We can go to McDonald's afterwards.
Hello?
Hi, Laura.
Yes, I know...
Relax, he called me.
What's so strange about that?
I'm his Dad, goddammit.
Relax!
Shut up, you fucking whore!
What about the money?
- Don't you ever get scared?
- No.
I think we're done.
Whoa there.
You're sweet.
Okay.
Please don't.
Please don't.
How old are you?
How old are you?
- How old are you?
- 15.
Get out.
Now!
- One minute left.
- What took you so long?
- He wouldn't pay me.
- So what the fuck were you doing?
Did he think you were a hooker?
Did you get the 500?
- How come you've got his wallet?
- I took it by mistake.
- There's only 200.
- He's married!
And he buys a hooker.
- Let's go home.
I feel sick.
- You know you haven't passed, right?
- What are you talking about?
- We said 500.
There's only 200 here.
- Isn't his wallet good enough?
- My kiss wasn't good enough!
- This is completely different.
- You said to take it seriously.
I do.
But you should pass when you were almost raped!
Hey, are you okay?
Are you okay?
- Let's do something about it.
- No, I just want to go home.
- You still haven't passed.
- What?
Sure I have.
I have, haven't I, Sofie?
I don't think so.
Are you asleep in there?
- Get out!
- No!
Taking a crap, little piggy?
And so what, if I am?
Phew!
We come to fetch more booze and the house reeks of baby pooh.
- Lay off, Stefan.
- Shut up, man.
Adam thought I was taking a crap.
Oh no.
Are you asleep?
- No.
- Me neither.
Does it hurt much the first time?
I didn't really think it hurt.
But then I was stone drunk.
Was it the guy from summer camp?
Pierre.
- Were you in love with him?
- No.
I just wanted to get it done.
How does it feel?
At first I thought: "Is that it?"
It's sort of like getting a massage on the inside.
It's hard to explain.
It's nothing special, really.
So why do people do it all the time?
Because you get used to it.
I kind of like it now.
- If it doesn't go too fast.
- How long does it take?
- Two or three minutes.
- That sure isn't long.
No.
- Can I draw another one?
- Not until you've tried to do this.
- "French kiss a girl."
- Piece of cake.
It's Yogurt.
What the hell does he want?
- I'm not here.
- Does he think you're going out?
Of course he doesn't.
Say I'm not here...
Please.
Hi.
- Claudia's mom said she was here.
- Yes, but she just left.
- Is she coming back?
- I think so.
Will you give her this?
- Yes.
Bye.
- Where did she go?
I think she went to see Rasmus.
Her boyfriend.
Want me to tell her something?
Yes, tell her I broke up with Katja.
- Did you have to mention Rasmus?
- You asked me to get rid of him.
You don't want that nerd stalking you, do you?
It's the one where someone has her head eaten by maggots.
He asked me to tell you he broke up with Katja.
Let's get on with it, shall we?
- Look, I won't do it.
- You have to.
- I promise to do two other dares.
- No.
If you refuse, we'll shave your head and send round nude pics of you.
- I can't just do stuff like you.
- What is it we just do?
It's just like you to chicken out.
Do you know what we went through?
You're so selfish.
FRENCH KISS A GIRL
- What do I say to her?
- Ask her to come to the ball pit.
Yes, then we can watch you on the monitor.
- It's like watching porn.
- No.
Please let me draw another one.
No!
Go make out, Sofie.
Go on.
All we need is popcorn.
- What are we going to do there?
- I just want to show you something.
- Well, here we are then.
- Yes.
I just wanted to ask you...
Don't you think there are too many balls?
- Is that why you brought me here?
- Yes.
No, I think the number of balls is fine.
Can I get back to work now?
Stay for a while.
It's Rebekka.
It was him!
You have to turn him in.
What if he rapes someone else?
- It's not like he actually did.
- But still!
I know you tried to rape Rebekka.
Call again and we're turning you in!
Get it, psycho?
Remember when you were a kid and hid under all the balls?
I wish I could stay there and see the world through colored plastic.
Sometimes I wish I was ten again.
Me too.
When I was ten, I wasn't so scared of everything.
- Are you scared of who you are?
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.
- No.
What are we doing here then?
I bet he's raped tons of others that way.
Oh my God!
Far out!
I never thought she'd have the nerve.
Why does she go on?
She passed already.
What's up?
Way to go!
You passed the Cootie Catcher.
- Anything wrong?
- I just felt sick.
I couldn't do it.
We saw you.
You were all over each other.
When I say I didn't French kiss her, I didn't French kiss her, okay?
- Why don't you want to pass?
- We have to take it seriously.
- I don't want to pass by cheating.
- We do take it seriously.
Why do we even do this?
To prove to the world we're not scared of anything.
- We want to be taken seriously.
- You sound just like Rebekka.
- 'Coz I'm right.
- But why keep it a secret then?
What matters is that we know what we've overcome.
Fuck the rest!
Fuck authority and fuck the rules for when you can and can't do stuff.
We've made our own rite of passage.
Maybe it doesn't show afterwards but then I won't let anyone discriminate me anymore.
Right.
Fuck the rest, man!
- Three two-zone tickets.
- Children's?
You're under 16, right?
Yes, but yesterday I was even more under 16, and you didn't believe me.
- You'd rather pay more then?
- You just don't get it.
Fuck!
Give me my wallet.
I traced your cell phone.
My wallet!
- Who is it?
- Nobody, Mom.
- Thought about seeing a shrink?
- My Mom is a shrink.
- I'm sorry.
- For playing a hooker or stealing?
- Or the rape allegations?
- I didn't want them to think that.
- Who?
- My friends.
I thought I wouldn't pass the Cootie Catcher unless I accused you of rape.
It's not fucking funny.
Hi.
Who are you?
- How do you know Rebekka?
- Wrong address.
Sorry.
Good luck.
He was a Jehovah's Witness, okay?
For the last time:
Who was he?
- Are you on drugs?
- No!
You want to be treated like an adult but you behave very immaturely.
Pack your bags.
We're leaving in ten minutes.
- Yes, in ten minutes.
- But I'm going to Adam's party.
- No, you're coming to the cottage.
- You can't make me!
Yes.
If you won't be honest with us, we have to treat you like a child.
- Rebekka, where are you?
- The 31-year-old came by.
- Oh, my God!
Where are you now?
- On my way to the cottage.
- I can't go until I say who he was.
- You have to come back.
- I've been kidnapped.
Do something.
- What do you want us to do?
You can't go on without me because I have the Cootie Catcher.
Would you like to play a game?
- We could go buy some more candy.
- Dad, I'm not five anymore.
Let's buy a bottle of vodka and get stoned and throw up then.
Rebekka, why are you so upset?
Is it because of Adam?
Don't, Dad.
Rebekka, I miss you.
Help me with the potatoes, will you, sweetie?
There's something I've got to tell you.
Mom, sit down.
Since yesterday this thing has ruled my, Sofie's and Claudia's lives.
In some tribes you have to undergo rites of passage to become an adult.
- So we made our own.
- You're confirmed.
Well, that doesn't mean shit.
So we made up dares for each other.
My dare was to...
I had to make someone believe I was a hooker.
That's why I knew that man.
I pretended to be a hooker, found him on the Net and stole his wallet.
Your mother is a psychologist.
Did you think she'd fall for that?
- What?
- Hi.
- How did you get here?
- By train.
We ran from the station.
- It's all my fault.
- What is?
- That guy is someone I know.
- Where did you meet him?
I talked to him at a party and someone told me he sold drugs.
Drugs?
- Have you done drugs, Rebekka?
- No, Mom.
He just wanted my number and I wouldn't give him the right one.
So you gave a 40-year-old drug dealer Rebekka's number?
Are you insane?
I couldn't think of any others.
I didn't know he'd actually show up.
- I thought he'd give up.
- Don't give strangers her number!
- She said she was sorry.
- Should we report it?
Was he nasty?
No.
I said I didn't know Claudia.
- Claudia, you're a fool.
- Yes.
I'm sorry.
I didn't want to rat on Claudia.
Sweetie, you know you can tell us anything.
None of us have passed yet.
By midnight we all have to do a dare.
If we all do it at the same time, how can we prove we've done it?
We just have to trust each other.
I promise to do my dare.
If I fail, I promise to tell you.
Me too.
Me too.
Hi, Sofie.
Hi.
- Aren't you going in?
- What do you think?
- What's up with you?
- What's up with you?
- Why were you so mean to her?
- I don't want her to get any ideas.
- Why are you just standing there?
- Why do you think?
GIVE A BLOWJOB
Hi, Rebekka.
Welcome.
Have you got any ice?
For my drink.
- What are you drinking?
- I thought I'd have... a beer.
The beer's over here.
Help yourself.
- Can you show me where the ice is?
- Down the hall, one flight down...
Come with me.
I always get lost.
Okay.
Here.
- Anything wrong?
- No.
- Where are you going?
- Back to my party.
- Let's sit for a while.
- Here?
- So, what are you going to do now?
- People keep asking me that.
- I don't know.
- I can't wait to graduate.
It's crazy.
I'm 18 and I've gone to school for almost... 14 years.
- Your entire life.
- I'm 15!
16 in two months.
- It's almost the same.
- No way.
- 14, 15, girls look the same to me.
- They're so different.
- Not to me.
- Would you date a 14-year-old?
- No.
And not a 15 year-old either.
- What if she was really mature...
And she turned 16 in two months?
Is that what you mean?
Christ...
Okay.
But she'd have to be really special.
She is.
- Are you hitting on me?
- No!
- I have to get back to the party.
- No, don't go.
- Get me a beer.
Please.
- Why don't you come with me?
What if I want to drink it here?
Let's just stay here.
TELL SOMEONE YOU LOVE HIM
- Katrine.
- What do you want?
- I just want to say something...
- If you're sexually confused, fine.
- But don't take it out on me, okay?
- I'm sorry.
Please come with me.
It's really important.
FRENCH KISS A GIRL
- I have to pee.
Can I go with you?
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Get lost.
- Don't you know what you've ruined?
- You don't even want Yogurt.
- You just don't give a shit, do you?
- That's not true.
- And it's not the first time either.
- You stole my boyfriend once.
- Thomas?
No, Simon.
You're a whore.
- Katja, I'm sorry...
- Don't touch me!
Just go away.
Take your skanky friends and get the fuck out of here!
Cheers!
Cheers.
Hi.
Hi.
Are you hitting on me now?
Christ, Rebekka...
What's the rush?
I don't know what you're up to, but this is wrong.
You're Stefan's kid sister.
You're 15.
- What if I wasn't Stefan's sister?
- And you're wacko, too.
- I'm not wacko.
- Yes...
Yes, you are.
Why are you sending nude pics of you and your friends?
- This was sent from your cell phone.
- What?
Jesus Christ!
Look, Sofie.
I'm really flattered.
But I'm not in love with you.
What did you want to tell me?
That...
That I love you.
But I just said there can't be anything between us.
I can still love you, can't I?
Welcome.
My man!
Go grab a beer.
Thanks.
Hi.
- Adam.
- Half my party got your porn pics.
Someone must have taken my phone.
I didn't send them, Adam.
It's just weird for someone to have nude pics of herself and her friends.
I told you it was a mistake.
I'm not that kind of girl.
What's going on?
- There.
Two minutes left.
Let's go.
- We can't do rites on each other!
- It doesn't say so in the rules.
- There are like a million rules!
I'm sick of you and your fucking rules!
Did you send the pics?
As if enough people haven't seen you naked!
Lay off!
Katja gave me your phone.
You've ruined everything.
Let's go.
- Did you pass?
- Yes.
I don't believe you.
Hey, Adam.
Did Rebekka just give you a blow job?
Did she?
Because she says so.
- No way.
- Ouch!
Crazy bitch!
How could you says something like that?
- You invented the crazy ritual.
- Yes, and we've come far.
- You had us jumping through hoops!
- No one forced you!
I did it!
I told someone I loved...
the person.
And I meant it.
- Who?
- Does it matter?
Who cares if everyone has seen our nude pics!
Nothing matters anymore.
- And it's my fault says Rebekka.
- Everyone's seen you naked anyway.
- I'm not like that.
- Oh, so what are you like?
I don't fuck a guy in the bathroom 'coz he sends me a sleazy message.
I'm sorry.
Take your fucking bag!
- You're so callous.
- I'm honest.
- You're never honest.
- You lie about being a dyke!
Fuck you!
- Wassup?
- Get lost!
Hi, gorgeous.
I just got the kinkiest message from you.
I don't want to talk about it.
- Don't, Rasmus.
- Come on.
So, who's the party queen, huh?
What's wrong?
Come on.
We've known each other since first grade.
First grade!
And now it's over.
I'm all alone in the world.
- Are you even listening to me?
- What?
- Stop that.
- Come on.
I said stop it!
Just get lost!
Why did you come with me if you aren't willing?
- Look, I'm through with that.
- Are you playing hard to get now?
I am hard to get.
Fuck, you're pathetic.
Stupid freshman.
Wait.
I'm going to get something.
Do you think you're perfectly normal?
You look like a panda bear.
I'm sorry.
About the blow job and all that.
I feel a little cheated.
- I've ruined everything.
- What have you ruined?
I don't know how to be a human being.
It was much easier to be a kid.
All you had to do was play and eat candy.
I didn't think you wanted to kiss a 15-year-old.
- Hey, have you got a razor?
- Now what?
Hi.
Are you going to be Yogurt's crunch now?
Come here.
You feel so tiny when you look at the world.
It's as if you don't mean anything to anyone.
You do.
Sofie!
Sofie!
Claudia.
I'm not sure I want to be friends with a baldie.
You have to.
You're stuck with me.
- Let's go swimming.
- Now?
- Yes.
- Naked?
Of course.
Come on.

NARRATOR:
Previously on Supernatural:
Sammy.
Take your brother outside as fast as you can.
Go!
DEAN:
Dad's on a hunting trip.
And he hasn't been home in a few days.
DEAN:
This is Dad's book.
I think he wants us to pick up where he left off.
You know, saving people, hunting things.
The family business.
I gotta find Dad.
It's the only thing I can think about.
MAN [ON TV]:
It's coming across the bridge.
Hurry.
Hurry!
[CREAKING]
[DOOR opening AND CLOSING]
[rustling]
Ah!
No!
No!
[screaming]
WOMAN:
I know you're just doing your job, but police have been here all week.
I don't see why we have to go through this again.
The more he tells the story, the more he believes it's true.
Mrs. McKay we know you spoke with local authorities.
But this seems like a matter for the state police.
So....
Don't worry how crazy it sounds, Evan.
You just tell us what you saw.
I was up late watching TV when I heard this weird noise.
-What did it sound like?
-lt sounded like a monster.
Tell the officers what you were watching on TV.
Um Godzilla vs. Mothra.
[DEAN CHUCKLING]
That's my favorite Godzilla movie.
-So much better than the original, huh?
-Totally.
Yeah.
He likes the remake.
-Yuck.
-That's what I--
[CLEARS THROAT]
Evan, did you see what this thing was?
No.
But I saw it grab Mr. Jenkins.
-lt pulled him underneath the car.
-Then what?
It took him away.
EVAN:
I heard the monster leaving.
It made this really scary sound.
What did it sound like, Evan?
Like this whining growl.
Thanks for your time.
So the local police have not ruled out foul play.
Apparently, there were signs of a struggle.
You know, they could be right.
Could just be a kidnapping.
Maybe this isn't our kind of gig.
Yeah, maybe not.
Except for this.
Dad marked the area, Dean.
Possible hunting grounds of a phantom attacker.
Why would he even do that?
Well, he found a lot of local folklore about a dark figure that comes out at night grabs people, then vanishes.
He found this too:
This county has more missing persons per capita than anywhere in the state.
-That is weird.
-Yeah.
Don't phantom attackers usually snatch people from their beds?
Jenkins was taken from a parking lot.
Well, there are all kinds.
Spring Heeled Jacks, phantom gassers.
They take people anywhere, any time.
I don't know if this is our kind of gig either.
Yeah, you're right.
We should ask around more tomorrow.
Right.
I saw a motel about five miles back.
Whoa, whoa, easy.
Let's have another round.
We should get an early start.
You really know how to have fun, don't you, Grandma?
All right.
I'll meet you outside.
I gotta take a leak.
[rustling]
[SCREECHING]
[chattering]
Hey.
Hey.
You guys been outside around here in, like, the last hour or so?
Sam!
Sammy?
Sam.
WOMAN:
So, what can we do for you, Officer Washington?
I'm working a missing persons.
Didn't know the Jenkins case was being covered by state police.
Uh, no.
No.
This is someone else.
Actually, it's my cousin.
We were having a few last night at this bar by the highway.
I haven't seen him since.
-Your cousin have a drinking problem?
-Sam?
Two beers, and he's doing karaoke.
He wasn't drunk.
He was taken.
All right.
What's his name?
Winchester.
Sam Winchester.
-Like the rifle?
-Like the rifle.
WOMAN:
"Samuel Winchester."
So you know that his brother, Dean Winchester, died in St. Louis and was suspected of murder?
Yeah, Dean.
Kind of the black sheep of the family.
-Handsome, though.
-Uh-huh.
He's not showing up in current reports.
Oh, I already have a lead.
I saw a surveillance camera out by the highway.
-Uh-huh.
County traffic cam?
-Right.
Yeah.
I'm thinking the camera picked up whatever took him.
Or whoever.
Well, I have access to the cam footage down at the County Works Department.
But, well, in the meantime, let's do this the right way.
Why don't you fill out a missing persons report and sit tight over here?
Officer, look, he's family.
I kind of....
I kind of look out for the kid.
You gotta let me go with you.
I'm sorry.
I can't do that.
Well, tell me something.
Your county has its fair share of missing persons.
Any of them come back?
Sam's my responsibility.
And he's coming back.
I'm bringing him back.
[gasping]
Greg.
I think we got something.
These traffic cams take an image every three seconds.
It's part of the Amber Alert program.
These images were all taken around the time your cousin disappeared.
-This really isn't what I'm looking for.
-Just wait.
Wait.
Next one.
This one was taken right after Sam left the bar.
Look at the back end of that thing.
Now look at the plates.
The plates look new.
It was probably stolen.
So whoever's driving that rust bucket must be involved.
[ENGINE screeching]
-Hear that engine?
-Yeah.
Kind of a whining growl, isn't it?
WOMAN:
Sure.
I'll be damned.
[GROANING]
You're alive?
-Huh?
-Hey, you okay?
Does it look like I'm doing okay?
-Where are we?
-l don't know.
The country, I think.
Smells like the country.
-You're Alvin Jenkins, aren't you?
-Yeah.
Wow. I was looking for you.
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.
Well, no offense, but this is a piss-poor rescue.
My brother's out there right now too.
He's looking for us.
So....
So he's not gonna find us.
We're in the middle of nowhere waiting for them to come back and do God knows what to us.
-What are they?
Have you seen them?
-What are you talking about?
Whatever grabbed us.
What do they look like?
[DOOR opening]
See for yourself.
Leave me alone.
Don't you touch me.
You leave me alone!
I'll be damned.
-They're just people.
-Yeah.
What did you expect?
-How often do they feed you?
-Once a day.
They use that thing over there to open the cage.
And that's the only time you see them?
So far.
But I'm waiting.
-Waiting for what?
-Ned Beatty time, man.
-l think that's the least of your worries.
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.
-What do you think they want, then?
Depends on who they are.
They're a bunch of psycho, hillbilly rednecks, you ask me.
Looking for love in all the wrong places.
SAM:
Aah!
Okay.
The next traffic cam is 50 miles from here and your pickup didn't pass that one.
-So....
-lt must have pulled off somewhere.
I don't see any other roads here.
A lot of these backwoods properties have their own private roads.
Great.
[BEEPlNG]
-So, Gregory?
-Yeah.
I ran your badge number.
It's routine when working a case with state police for accounting purposes, and what have you.
Mm-hm.
And, they just got back to me.
Says here your badge was stolen.
And there's a picture of you.
I lost some weight.
And I got that Michael Jackson skin disease.
Okay.
Would you step out of the car, please?
Look, look, look.
You want to arrest me?
That's fine.
I'll cooperate, I swear.
But first, please, let me find Sam.
I don't even know who you are.
Or if this Sam person is missing.
Look in my eyes and tell me I'm lying about this.
Identity theft?
You're impersonating an officer.
Here's the thing.
When we were young I pretty much pulled him from a fire.
And ever since then, I've felt responsible for him.
You know, like it's my job to keep him safe.
I'm just afraid if we don't find him fast....
Please.
He's my family.
I'm sorry.
You've given me no choice.
I have to take you in.
After we find Sam Winchester.
ALVIN:
What's your name again?
-lt's Sam.
Why don't you give it up, Sammy.
There's no way out.
Don't call me Sammy.
[coughing]
What is it?
It's a bracket.
Oh, thank God, a bracket.
Now we got them, huh?
Must have been a short.
Maybe you knocked something loose.
-l think you should get back in, Jenkins.
-What?
-This isn't right.
-Don't you want to get out of here?
Yeah, but that was too easy.
I'm gonna get out of here.
Gonna send help.
Don't worry.
No.
I'm serious.
Jenkins.
This might be a trap.
Bye, Sammy.
Jenkins!
Thank you.
[MAN laughing]
ALVIN:
Aah!
[MAN laughing]
[screaming]
Okay, officer.
-Look, I don't mean to press my luck.
-Your luck is so pressed.
Right.
I was wondering, why are you helping me out anyway?
Why don't you just lock me up?
My brother Riley disappeared three years ago.
A lot like Sam.
We searched for him, but nothing.
I know what it's like to feel responsible for someone, and for them....
Come on.
Let's keep at it.
DEAN:
Wait, wait, wait.
Pull over here.
Pull over.
This is the first turn-off I've seen so far.
-You stay here.
I'll check it out.
-No way.
Hey.
You're a civilian.
And a felon, I think.
I'm not taking you with me.
You're not going without me.
[SIGHS]
All right.
You promise you won't get involved?
You'll let me handle it.
-Yeah.
I promise.
-Shake on it.
Oh, come on.
This is ridiculous.
Kathleen, I think you're gonna need my help.
I'll manage, thank you.
I gotta start carrying paperclips.
Hello?
Is anybody home?
Hi.
How are you?
Who are you?
I'm Kathleen, I'm a deputy.
What's your name?
Missy.
Missy.
That's a pretty name.
Missy, is your mom home?
She's dead.
I'm sorry.
What about your dad?
No?
Can I come in for a minute?
I just want you to look at a picture.
You seen that guy?
Look at that picture.
-What?
-That's gonna hurt.
Missy, sweetheart go tell your brothers I wanna see them.
Yes, Daddy.
[ENGINE screeching]
Son of a bitch.
[GRUNTlNG]
[laughing]
But I've never seen him so angry before.
Well, Lee, never been followed by the police before.
SAM:
You all right?
Are you Sam Winchester?
Aren't you?
Yeah.
Your....
Your cousin's looking for you.
Thank God.
Where is he?
I....
I cuffed him to my car.
[DOOR opening]
Sam?
-Are you hurt?
-No.
Damn, it's good to see you.
How did you get out of the cuffs?
I know a trick or two.
All right.
Whoa.
These locks look like they're gonna be a bitch.
There's some kind of automatic control right there.
-Have you seen them?
-Yeah.
Dude.
They're just people.
And they jumped you?
Must be getting a little rusty there, kiddo.
-What do they want?
-l don't know.
They let Jenkins go, but that was some sort of trap.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Yeah, well, that's the point.
You know, with our usual playmates, there's rules.
There's patterns.
But with people, they're just crazy.
See anything else out there?
Uh, there's a dozen junked cars out back.
Plates from all over.
When they take someone, they take their car too.
Did you see a black Mustang?
About 1 0 years old?
Yeah, actually I did.
Your brother's.
I'm sorry.
Let's get you guys out and take care of those bastards.
This thing takes a key?
Key?
-l don't know.
-All right.
I better go find it.
SAM:
Hey.
Be careful.
Yeah.
Yikes.
I'll say it again.
Demons, I get.
People are crazy.
[CREAKING]
[HONKY-TONK music playing ON RADIO]
What the...?
Shh.
It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I know.
-Daddy!
-Jeez.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
[GRUNTlNG]
Aah!
I'm gonna kick your ass first.
And then yours.
Come on.
Let's hunt him.
Yeah, this one's a fighter.
Sure would be fun to hunt.
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
That's what this is about.
You-
- You yahoos hunt people?
You ever killed before?
Well, that depends on what you mean.
I've hunted all my life.
Just like my father, his before him.
I've hunted deer and bear.
I even got a cougar once.
Oh, boy.
But the best hunt is human.
Oh, there's nothing like it.
Holding their life in your hands.
Seeing the fear in their eyes just before they go dark.
Makes you feel powerful alive.
You're a sick puppy.
We give them a weapon.
Give them a fighting chance.
It's kind of like our tradition.
Passed down father to son.
Course, only one or two a year.
Never enough to bring the law down.
We never been that sloppy.
Oh.
Yeah, well, don't sell yourself short.
You're plenty sloppy.
So, what, you with that pretty cop?
You a cop?
If I tell you you promise not to make me into an ashtray?
Only reason I don't let my boys take you right here and now is that there's something I need to know.
Yeah, how about it's not nice to marry your sister?
Tell me.
Any other cops gonna come looking for you?
Eat me.
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
You actually might.
[GRUNTlNG]
MAN:
You think this is funny?
You brought this down on my family.
All right.
You wanna play games?
We'll play some games.
Looks like we're gonna have a hunt tonight, after all, boys.
And you get to pick the animal.
The boy or the cop.
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
No.
Look.
Nobody's coming for me, all right?
It's just us.
You don't choose, I will.
Aah!
You son of a bitch.
Next time, I'll take an eye.
All right.
The guy, the guy, take the guy.
Lee.
Go do it.
Don't let him out, though.
Shoot him in the cage.
What?
You were gonna hunt him.
You were gonna give him a chance.
Lee, when you're done with the boy, shoot the bitch too.
We gotta clean up this mess up before any more cops come running out here.
What are you doing?
Hey.
If you hurt my brother, I'll kill you, I swear.
I'll kill you all.
[YELLING] I will kill you all!
Lee!
SAM:
Damn.
Lee!
Jared, you come with me.
Missy you watch him, now.
Lee?
Where are you?
Lee.
Damn it.
Jared, get the lights.
They must have pulled the fuses.
[YELLING]
You stupid....
Hey.
I'll watch this one.
You go ahead.
Go ahead.
You hurt my family, I'm gonna bleed you, bitch.
You killed my brother.
Your brother.
[laughing]
Now I see.
Just tell me why.
Because it's fun.
-Where's the girl?
-Locked in the closet.
What about the dad?
Shot.
Trying to escape.
-l think the car's at the police station.
WOMAN [OVER radio]:
Backup.
backup units en route to your location.
So state police and the FBI are gonna be here within the hour.
They're gonna wanna talk to you.
I suggest that you're both long gone by then.
Thanks.
I don't mean to press our luck, but we're in the middle of nowhere.
Think we could catch a ride?
Start walking.
Duck if you see a squad car.
Sound great to me.
Thanks.
Listen sorry about your brother.
Thank you.
It was really hard not knowing what happened.
I thought it would be easier once I knew the truth.
But....
It isn't, really.
Anyway, you should go.
-Don't ever do that again.
-Do what?
Go missing like that.
You were worried about me.
All I'm saying is, you vanish like that again, I'm not looking for you.
-Sure you won't.
-l'm not.
SAM:
So you got sidelined by a 1 3-year-old girl?
DEAN:
Shut up.
SAM:
Just saying, you're getting rusty, kiddo.
DEAN:
Shut up.
[chuckling]
[ENGLISH SDH]
NARRATOR:
Previously on Supernatural:
Sammy.
Take your brother outside as fast as you can.
Go!
DEAN:
Dad's on a hunting trip.
And he hasn't been home in a few days.
DEAN:
This is Dad's book.
I think he wants us to pick up where he left off.
You know, saving people, hunting things.
The family business.
I gotta find Dad.
It's the only thing I can think about.
MAN [ON TV]:
It's coming across the bridge.
Hurry.
Hurry!
[CREAKING]
[DOOR opening AND CLOSING]
[rustling]
Ah!
No!
No!
[screaming]
WOMAN:
I know you're just doing your job, but police have been here all week.
I don't see why we have to go through this again.
The more he tells the story, the more he believes it's true.
Mrs. McKay we know you spoke with local authorities.
But this seems like a matter for the state police.
So....
Don't worry how crazy it sounds, Evan.
You just tell us what you saw.
I was up late watching TV when I heard this weird noise.
-What did it sound like?
-lt sounded like a monster.
Tell the officers what you were watching on TV.
Um Godzilla vs. Mothra.
[DEAN CHUCKLING]
That's my favorite Godzilla movie.
-So much better than the original, huh?
-Totally.
Yeah.
He likes the remake.
-Yuck.
-That's what I--
[CLEARS THROAT]
Evan, did you see what this thing was?
No.
But I saw it grab Mr. Jenkins.
-lt pulled him underneath the car.
-Then what?
It took him away.
EVAN:
I heard the monster leaving.
It made this really scary sound.
What did it sound like, Evan?
Like this whining growl.
Thanks for your time.
So the local police have not ruled out foul play.
Apparently, there were signs of a struggle.
You know, they could be right.
Could just be a kidnapping.
Maybe this isn't our kind of gig.
Yeah, maybe not.
Except for this.
Dad marked the area, Dean.
Possible hunting grounds of a phantom attacker.
Why would he even do that?
Well, he found a lot of local folklore about a dark figure that comes out at night grabs people, then vanishes.
He found this too:
This county has more missing persons per capita than anywhere in the state.
-That is weird.
-Yeah.
Don't phantom attackers usually snatch people from their beds?
Jenkins was taken from a parking lot.
Well, there are all kinds.
Spring Heeled Jacks, phantom gassers.
They take people anywhere, any time.
I don't know if this is our kind of gig either.
Yeah, you're right.
We should ask around more tomorrow.
Right.
I saw a motel about five miles back.
Whoa, whoa, easy.
Let's have another round.
We should get an early start.
You really know how to have fun, don't you, Grandma?
All right.
I'll meet you outside.
I gotta take a leak.
[rustling]
[SCREECHING]
[chattering]
Hey.
Hey.
You guys been outside around here in, like, the last hour or so?
Sam!
Sammy?
Sam.
WOMAN:
So, what can we do for you, Officer Washington?
I'm working a missing persons.
Didn't know the Jenkins case was being covered by state police.
Uh, no.
No.
This is someone else.
Actually, it's my cousin.
We were having a few last night at this bar by the highway.
I haven't seen him since.
-Your cousin have a drinking problem?
-Sam?
Two beers, and he's doing karaoke.
He wasn't drunk.
He was taken.
All right.
What's his name?
Winchester.
Sam Winchester.
-Like the rifle?
-Like the rifle.
WOMAN:
"Samuel Winchester."
So you know that his brother, Dean Winchester, died in St. Louis and was suspected of murder?
Yeah, Dean.
Kind of the black sheep of the family.
-Handsome, though.
-Uh-huh.
He's not showing up in current reports.
Oh, I already have a lead.
I saw a surveillance camera out by the highway.
-Uh-huh.
County traffic cam?
-Right.
Yeah.
I'm thinking the camera picked up whatever took him.
Or whoever.
Well, I have access to the cam footage down at the County Works Department.
But, well, in the meantime, let's do this the right way.
Why don't you fill out a missing persons report and sit tight over here?
Officer, look, he's family.
I kind of....
I kind of look out for the kid.
You gotta let me go with you.
I'm sorry.
I can't do that.
Well, tell me something.
Your county has its fair share of missing persons.
Any of them come back?
Sam's my responsibility.
And he's coming back.
I'm bringing him back.
[gasping]
Greg.
I think we got something.
These traffic cams take an image every three seconds.
It's part of the Amber Alert program.
These images were all taken around the time your cousin disappeared.
-This really isn't what I'm looking for.
-Just wait.
Wait.
Next one.
This one was taken right after Sam left the bar.
Look at the back end of that thing.
Now look at the plates.
The plates look new.
It was probably stolen.
So whoever's driving that rust bucket must be involved.
[ENGINE screeching]
-Hear that engine?
-Yeah.
Kind of a whining growl, isn't it?
WOMAN:
Sure.
I'll be damned.
[GROANING]
You're alive?
-Huh?
-Hey, you okay?
Does it look like I'm doing okay?
-Where are we?
-l don't know.
The country, I think.
Smells like the country.
-You're Alvin Jenkins, aren't you?
-Yeah.
Wow. I was looking for you.
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.
Well, no offense, but this is a piss-poor rescue.
My brother's out there right now too.
He's looking for us.
So....
So he's not gonna find us.
We're in the middle of nowhere waiting for them to come back and do God knows what to us.
-What are they?
Have you seen them?
-What are you talking about?
Whatever grabbed us.
What do they look like?
[DOOR opening]
See for yourself.
Leave me alone.
Don't you touch me.
You leave me alone!
I'll be damned.
-They're just people.
-Yeah.
What did you expect?
-How often do they feed you?
-Once a day.
They use that thing over there to open the cage.
And that's the only time you see them?
So far.
But I'm waiting.
-Waiting for what?
-Ned Beatty time, man.
-l think that's the least of your worries.
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.
-What do you think they want, then?
Depends on who they are.
They're a bunch of psycho, hillbilly rednecks, you ask me.
Looking for love in all the wrong places.
SAM:
Aah!
Okay.
The next traffic cam is 50 miles from here and your pickup didn't pass that one.
-So....
-lt must have pulled off somewhere.
I don't see any other roads here.
A lot of these backwoods properties have their own private roads.
Great.
[BEEPlNG]
-So, Gregory?
-Yeah.
I ran your badge number.
It's routine when working a case with state police for accounting purposes, and what have you.
Mm-hm.
And, they just got back to me.
Says here your badge was stolen.
And there's a picture of you.
I lost some weight.
And I got that Michael Jackson skin disease.
Okay.
Would you step out of the car, please?
Look, look, look.
You want to arrest me?
That's fine.
I'll cooperate, I swear.
But first, please, let me find Sam.
I don't even know who you are.
Or if this Sam person is missing.
Look in my eyes and tell me I'm lying about this.
Identity theft?
You're impersonating an officer.
Here's the thing.
When we were young I pretty much pulled him from a fire.
And ever since then, I've felt responsible for him.
You know, like it's my job to keep him safe.
I'm just afraid if we don't find him fast....
Please.
He's my family.
I'm sorry.
You've given me no choice.
I have to take you in.
After we find Sam Winchester.
ALVIN:
What's your name again?
-lt's Sam.
Why don't you give it up, Sammy.
There's no way out.
Don't call me Sammy.
[coughing]
What is it?
It's a bracket.
Oh, thank God, a bracket.
Now we got them, huh?
Must have been a short.
Maybe you knocked something loose.
-l think you should get back in, Jenkins.
-What?
-This isn't right.
-Don't you want to get out of here?
Yeah, but that was too easy.
I'm gonna get out of here.
Gonna send help.
Don't worry.
No.
I'm serious.
Jenkins.
This might be a trap.
Bye, Sammy.
Jenkins!
Thank you.
[MAN laughing]
ALVIN:
Aah!
[MAN laughing]
[screaming]
Okay, officer.
-Look, I don't mean to press my luck.
-Your luck is so pressed.
Right.
I was wondering, why are you helping me out anyway?
Why don't you just lock me up?
My brother Riley disappeared three years ago.
A lot like Sam.
We searched for him, but nothing.
I know what it's like to feel responsible for someone, and for them....
Come on.
Let's keep at it.
DEAN:
Wait, wait, wait.
Pull over here.
Pull over.
This is the first turn-off I've seen so far.
-You stay here.
I'll check it out.
-No way.
Hey.
You're a civilian.
And a felon, I think.
I'm not taking you with me.
You're not going without me.
[SIGHS]
All right.
You promise you won't get involved?
You'll let me handle it.
-Yeah.
I promise.
-Shake on it.
Oh, come on.
This is ridiculous.
Kathleen, I think you're gonna need my help.
I'll manage, thank you.
I gotta start carrying paperclips.
Hello?
Is anybody home?
Hi.
How are you?
Who are you?
I'm Kathleen, I'm a deputy.
What's your name?
Missy.
Missy.
That's a pretty name.
Missy, is your mom home?
She's dead.
I'm sorry.
What about your dad?
No?
Can I come in for a minute?
I just want you to look at a picture.
You seen that guy?
Look at that picture.
-What?
-That's gonna hurt.
Missy, sweetheart go tell your brothers I wanna see them.
Yes, Daddy.
[ENGINE screeching]
Son of a bitch.
[GRUNTlNG]
[laughing]
But I've never seen him so angry before.
Well, Lee, never been followed by the police before.
SAM:
You all right?
Are you Sam Winchester?
Aren't you?
Yeah.
Your....
Your cousin's looking for you.
Thank God.
Where is he?
I....
I cuffed him to my car.
[DOOR opening]
Sam?
-Are you hurt?
-No.
Damn, it's good to see you.
How did you get out of the cuffs?
I know a trick or two.
All right.
Whoa.
These locks look like they're gonna be a bitch.
There's some kind of automatic control right there.
-Have you seen them?
-Yeah.
Dude.
They're just people.
And they jumped you?
Must be getting a little rusty there, kiddo.
-What do they want?
-l don't know.
They let Jenkins go, but that was some sort of trap.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Yeah, well, that's the point.
You know, with our usual playmates, there's rules.
There's patterns.
But with people, they're just crazy.
See anything else out there?
Uh, there's a dozen junked cars out back.
Plates from all over.
When they take someone, they take their car too.
Did you see a black Mustang?
About 1 0 years old?
Yeah, actually I did.
Your brother's.
I'm sorry.
Let's get you guys out and take care of those bastards.
This thing takes a key?
Key?
-l don't know.
-All right.
I better go find it.
SAM:
Hey.
Be careful.
Yeah.
Yikes.
I'll say it again.
Demons, I get.
People are crazy.
[CREAKING]
[HONKY-TONK music playing ON RADIO]
What the...?
Shh.
It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I know.
-Daddy!
-Jeez.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
[GRUNTlNG]
Aah!
I'm gonna kick your ass first.
And then yours.
Come on.
Let's hunt him.
Yeah, this one's a fighter.
Sure would be fun to hunt.
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
That's what this is about.
You-
- You yahoos hunt people?
You ever killed before?
Well, that depends on what you mean.
I've hunted all my life.
Just like my father, his before him.
I've hunted deer and bear.
I even got a cougar once.
Oh, boy.
But the best hunt is human.
Oh, there's nothing like it.
Holding their life in your hands.
Seeing the fear in their eyes just before they go dark.
Makes you feel powerful alive.
You're a sick puppy.
We give them a weapon.
Give them a fighting chance.
It's kind of like our tradition.
Passed down father to son.
Course, only one or two a year.
Never enough to bring the law down.
We never been that sloppy.
Oh.
Yeah, well, don't sell yourself short.
You're plenty sloppy.
So, what, you with that pretty cop?
You a cop?
If I tell you you promise not to make me into an ashtray?
Only reason I don't let my boys take you right here and now is that there's something I need to know.
Yeah, how about it's not nice to marry your sister?
Tell me.
Any other cops gonna come looking for you?
Eat me.
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
You actually might.
[GRUNTlNG]
MAN:
You think this is funny?
You brought this down on my family.
All right.
You wanna play games?
We'll play some games.
Looks like we're gonna have a hunt tonight, after all, boys.
And you get to pick the animal.
The boy or the cop.
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
No.
Look.
Nobody's coming for me, all right?
It's just us.
You don't choose, I will.
Aah!
You son of a bitch.
Next time, I'll take an eye.
All right.
The guy, the guy, take the guy.
Lee.
Go do it.
Don't let him out, though.
Shoot him in the cage.
What?
You were gonna hunt him.
You were gonna give him a chance.
Lee, when you're done with the boy, shoot the bitch too.
We gotta clean up this mess up before any more cops come running out here.
What are you doing?
Hey.
If you hurt my brother, I'll kill you, I swear.
I'll kill you all.
[YELLING] I will kill you all!
Lee!
SAM:
Damn.
Lee!
Jared, you come with me.
Missy you watch him, now.
Lee?
Where are you?
Lee.
Damn it.
Jared, get the lights.
They must have pulled the fuses.
[YELLING]
You stupid....
Hey.
I'll watch this one.
You go ahead.
Go ahead.
You hurt my family, I'm gonna bleed you, bitch.
You killed my brother.
Your brother.
[laughing]
Now I see.
Just tell me why.
Because it's fun.
-Where's the girl?
-Locked in the closet.
What about the dad?
Shot.
Trying to escape.
-l think the car's at the police station.
WOMAN [OVER radio]:
Backup.
backup units en route to your location.
So state police and the FBI are gonna be here within the hour.
They're gonna wanna talk to you.
I suggest that you're both long gone by then.
Thanks.
I don't mean to press our luck, but we're in the middle of nowhere.
Think we could catch a ride?
Start walking.
Duck if you see a squad car.
Sound great to me.
Thanks.
Listen sorry about your brother.
Thank you.
It was really hard not knowing what happened.
I thought it would be easier once I knew the truth.
But....
It isn't, really.
Anyway, you should go.
-Don't ever do that again.
-Do what?
Go missing like that.
You were worried about me.
All I'm saying is, you vanish like that again, I'm not looking for you.
-Sure you won't.
-l'm not.
SAM:
So you got sidelined by a 1 3-year-old girl?
DEAN:
Shut up.
SAM:
Just saying, you're getting rusty, kiddo.
DEAN:
Shut up.
[chuckling]
[ENGLISH SDH]
Previously on Supernatural
Sammy.
Take your brother outside as fast as you can.
Go!
Dad's on a hunting trip.
And he hasn't been home in a few days.
This is dad's book.
I think dad wants us to pick up where he left off.
You know, saving people.
Hunting things.
The family business.
I got to find dad.
That's the only thing I can think about.
I know you're just doing your job
But the police have been here a week already.
I don't see why we have to go through this again.
The more he tells the story the more he believes it's true.
Mrs. McKay.
We know you spoke with the local authorities.
But this seems like a matter for the State Police.
So...
Don't worry about how crazy it sounds Evan.
You just tell us what you saw.
I was up late...
Watching TV.
When I heard this...
Weird noise.
What did it sound like?
It sounded like a monster.
Tell the officers what you were watching on TV.
Um...
Godzilla versus Mothra.
That's my favorite Godzilla movie.
So much better than the original?
Totally.
Yeah, he likes the remake.
Yuck.
That's what I mean.
Evan?
Did you see what this thing was?
No, but I saw it grab Mr. Jenkins.
It pulled him underneath the car.
Then what?
It took him away.
I heard the monster leaving.
It made this really scary sound.
What did it sound like, Evan?
Like this whining growl.
Thanks for your time.
So the local police have novel out foul play.
Apparently there were signs of struggle.
You know, they could be right.
Could just be a kidnapping.
Maybe this isn't our kind of gig.
Yeah, maybe not.
Except for this.
Dad marked the area, Dean.
Possible hunting grounds of a phantom attacker.
Why would he even do that?
Well, he found a lot of local folk law about a dog figure that comes out at night,
Grabs people then vanishes.
He found this too.
This county has more missing persons per capital than anywhere else in the state.
It is weird.
Yeah.
Don't phantom attackers usually snatch people from their beds?
Jenkins was taken from a parking lot.
Well, there are all kinds, you know.
Spring Hill Jack, Spanworm Gases, they take people anywhere, anytime.
Look, Dean.
I don't know if this is our kind of gig either...
Yeah, you're right.
We should ask around more tomorrow.
Right.
I saw a motel about five miles back.
Whoa, whoa, easy.
Let's have another round?
We should get an early start.
Now, you really know how to have fun, don't you Grandma?
You're right.
I'll meet you outside.
I'm gonna take a leak.
Hey, hey.
Have you guys been outside?
Around here like the last hour or so?
Sam?
Sammy!
Sam...
So, what can we do for you Officer Washington?
I'm working a missing persons.
I didn't know the Jenkins case was being covered by the State Police?
Uh, no, no.
It's someone else.
Actually it's my cousin.
We were having a few laughs at this bar down by the highway.
And I haven't seen him since.
Did your cousin have a drinking problem?
Sam?
Two beers and he's doing Karaoke.
No, he wasn't drunk.
He was taken.
All right.
What's his name?
Winchester.
Sam Winchester.
Like the riffle?
Like the riffle.
Winchester, Sam
Samuel Winchester.
So you know that his brother Dean Winchester died in St. Louis.
And it was excepted a murder.
Yeah, Dean.
Kind of the black sheep of the family.
Handsome though.
Well, he's not showing up at any current field reports.
I already have a lead.
I saw surveillance camera above the highway.
County traffic cam.
Right, yeah.
I'm thinking the camera picked up whatever took him.
Oh, whoever.
Well, I have access to the traffic cam footage
Down at the county works department, but...
Well...
Let me tell you this the right way.
Won't you fill out...
A missing persons report.
And sit tight over here.
Officer, look uh...
He's family.
And I kind of...
Look out for the kid.
You got to let me go with you.
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
Well, tell me something.
Your county has a fair share of missing persons.
Any of them come back?
Sam's my responsibility.
And he's coming back.
I'm bringing him back.
Greg.
I think we've got something.
These traffic cam take an image every three seconds.
It's part of the amber alert program.
These images were all taken around the time your cousin Sam disappeared.
This really isn't what I'm looking for.
Just wait, wait.
Next one.
This one was taken right after Sam left the bar.
Look at the back in at that thing.
Now, look at the plates.
The plates look new.
Probably stolen.
So, whoever's driving that rust bucket must be involved.
Do you hear that engine?
Yeah.
Kind of a whining growl, isn't it?
Sure.
I'll be damned.
You're alive?
Hey, you okay?
Does it look like I'm doing okay?
Where are we?
I don't know.
Country, I think.
Smells like the country.
You're Jenkins, aren't you?
Yeah.
Wow, I was looking for you.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Well, no offense.
But this is a piss poor rescue.
Well, my brother's out there right now too.
He's looking for us.
So...
So, he's not gonna find us.
We're in the middle of nowhere.
Waiting for them to come back and do God knows what to us.
What are they?
Have you seen them?
What are you talking about?
Whatever grabbed us, what did they look like?
See for yourself.
Leave me alone.
Don't touch me.
Leave me alone!
I'll be damned.
They're just people.
Yeah, what did you expect?
How often do they feed you?
Once a day.
They use that thing over there to open the cage.
And that's the only time you see them?
So far.
But I'm waiting.
Waiting for what?
Their baiting time, man.
I think that's the least of your worries right now.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
What do you they want then?
Depends on who they are.
They're bunch of psycho hill-Billy red neck if you ask me.
Looking for love in all the wrong places.
Okay, the next traffic cam
Is fifty miles from here and your pickup didn't pass that one.
So...
So, it must have pulled up somewhere.
I don't see any other roads here.
Well, a lot of these back woods properties have their own private roads.
Great.
So, Gregory.
Yeah.
I ran your badge number.
It's routine when working A case with State Police
For county purposes when we have you.
And they just got back to me...
Says here your badge was stolen.
And there's a picture of you.
I lost some weight.
And I got that Michael Jackson skin disease...
Okay.
Would you step out of the car please?
Look, look, look.
If you want to arrest me that's fine.
I'll cooperate.
I swear.
But first please...
Let me find Sam.
I don't even know who you are.
Or if this Sam person is missing.
Look into my eyes and tell me if I'm lying about this.
Identity theft.
You're impersonating an officer.
Here's the thing.
When...
When we were young...
I pretty much pulled him from a fire.
And ever since then I felt responsible for him.
You know, like it's my job to keep him safe.
I'm just afraid if we don't find him fast.
Please...
He's my family.
I'm sorry.
You've given me no choice.
I have to take you in.
After we find Sam Winchester.
What's your name again?
It's Sam.
Why won't you give it up Sammy.
There's no way out.
Don't...
Call me...
Sammy.
What is it?
It's a bracket.
Well, thank God a bracket.
Now we got them, huh?
Must have been a short.
Maybe you knocked something loose.
I think you should get back in there Jenkins.
What?
This isn't right.
Do you want to get out of here?
Yeah, but that was too easy.
Look, I'm gonna get out of here.
I'm gonna send help.
Okay?
Okay.
Don't worry.
No.
I'm serious, Jenkins.
This might be a trap.
Bye, Sammy.
Jenkins!
Thank you.
Okay, officer.
Look I'm gonna press my luck.
Your luck is so pressed.
Right.
I was wondering...
Why are you helping me out anyway?
Why don't you just lock me up?
My brother Riley disappeared three years ago.
A lot like Sam.
We searched for him but...
Nothing.
I know what it's like to feel responsible for someone.
And for them...
Come on, let's keep at it.
Wait, wait.
Pull over here.
Pull over.
It's the first turn off I've seen so far.
You stay here, I'll check it out.
No way.
Hey...
You're a civilian.
And a felon, I think.
I'm not taking you with me.
You're not going without me.
All right.
You promise...
You won't get involved.
You let me handle it.
Yeah, I promise.
Shake on it.
Oh, come on.
This is ridiculous.
Katherine, I really think you're gonna need my help.
I'll manage.
Thank you.
I got to start carrying paper clips.
Hello?
Anybody home?
Hi.
How are you?
Who are you?
I'm Katherine.
I'm a deputy.
What's your name?
Missy.
Missy?
That's a pretty name.
Missy, is your mom home?
She's dead.
I'm sorry, what about your dad?
No?
Can I come in for a minute?
I just want you look at a picture.
Have you seen that guy?
Look at that picture.
What?
That's gonna hurt.
Missy, sweetheart.
Go tell your brothers, I want to see them.
Yes, daddy.
Son of a bitch.
But I've never seen him so angry before.
Never been followed by the police before.
You all right?
Are you Sam Winchester?
Aren't you?
Yeah.
You're...
You're cousin's looking for you.
Thank God.
Where is he?
He uh...
I cuffed him to my car.
Sam?
Are you hurt?
No.
Damn, it's good to see you.
How did you get out of the cuffs?
I know a trick or two.
All right.
Oh.
These locks they're gonna be a bitch.
Well, there's some kind of automatic control.
Right there.
Have you seen them?
Yeah.
Dude, they're just people.
And they jumped you?
Must be getting a little rusty there, kiddo.
What do they want?
I don't know.
They let Jenkins go, but...
That was some sort of trap.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Oh, well that's the point.
You know with...
Our usual play mates there's rules, here's patterns.
But with people...
They're just crazy.
You see anything else out there?
He has about a dozen junk cars out back.
Plates from all over.
So, I'm thinking when they take someone they take their car too.
Did you see a black mustang?
Out there about ten years old?
Yeah, actually I did.
Your brothers?
I'm sorry.
Let's get you guys out of here.
Then we'll take care of those bastards.
It takes a key, key?
I don't know.
All right, I better go find it.
Hey.
Be careful.
Yeah.
Well, I'll say it again.
Demons I get.
People are crazy.
What the...
It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I know.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
I'm gonna kick your ass first.
Then yours.
Come on.
Let's hunt.
Yeah, this one's a fighter.
Sure be fun to hunt.
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
This is what this is about?
You...
You yahoos hunt people?
You ever killed before?
What?
Well, it depends on what you mean.
I've hunted all my life.
Just like my father, his before him.
I've hunted deer...
And bear...
I even got a coo-Coo once.
Oh boy.
But the best hunt...
Is human.
Oh, there's nothing like it.
Holding their life in your hands.
Seeing the fear in their eyes just before they go dark.
Makes you feel powerful alive.
You're a sick puppy.
We give them a weapon.
Give him a fighting chance.
It's kind of like...
Our tradition passed down
Father to son, cost only one or two a year.
Never enough to bring the lot down we've never been that sloppy.
Yeah, well.
Don't save yourself short.
You're plenty of sloppy.
So what?
You're with that pretty cop?
Are you a cop?
If I tell you...
You promise not to make me into an ash tray?
Only reason I don't let my boys take you right here now
Is that there's something I need to know.
Yeah, how about it's not nice to marry your sister.
Tell me, any of the cops go come looking for you?
Oh, eat me.
No, no, no.
Wait.
You actually might.
You think this is funny?
You've brought this down on my family.
All right?
You want to play games?
We'll play some games.
Looks like we're gonna have a hunt tonight after all, boys.
And you get to pick the animal.
The boy or the cop.
Okay, wait, wait.
Look, nobody's coming for me.
All right?
It's just us.
You don't choose, I will.
Oh, you son of a bitch!
Next time, I'll take an eye.
All right, all right.
The guy.
The guy.
Take the guy!
Lee.
Go do it.
Don't let him out though.
Shoot him in the cage.
What?
I thought you said you were gonna hunt him.
You're gonna give him a chance!
Lee!
When you're done with the boy.
Shoot the bitch too.
We're cleaning this mess up before any more cops come running out here.
What are you doing?
Hey!
You hurt my brother, I'll kill you.
I swear.
I'll kill you all.
I will kill you all!
Lee!
Damn.
Lee!
Jack, you come with me.
Missy.
You watch him now.
Lee?
Where are you?
Lee?
Damn it.
Jack, hit the lights.
They must have pulled the fuses.
You stupid...
Hey!
I'll watch this one.
You go ahead.
Go ahead.
You hurt my family.
I'm gonna bleed you bitch.
You killed my brother.
Your brother?
Now I see.
Just tell me why.
Because it's fun.
Where's the girl?
I locked her in the closet.
What about the dad?
Shot.
Trying to escape.
I think the car's at the police station.
Backup units on route to your location.
So...
State Police and the FBI are gonna be here within the hour.
They're gonna want to talk to you.
I suggest that you're both long gone by then.
Thanks.
Hey, listen.
I don't mean to press our luck.
But we're kind of in the middle of nowhere.
You think we could catch a ride?
Start walking.
Duck if you see a SWAT car.
Sounds great to me.
Thanks.
Listen...
I'm sorry about your brother.
Thank you.
It was really hard not knowing what happened to him.
I thought it would be easier once I knew the truth.
But...
It isn't really.
Anyway you should go.
Don't ever do that again.
Do what?
Go missing like that.
You were worried about me.
I'm saying, you vanish like that again I'm not looking for you.
Sure you will.
I'm not.
So you got saddled on by a 13 year old girl, huh?
Oh, shut up!
Just saying getting rusty there, kiddo.
Shut up!
I know you're just doing your job but the police have been here a week already.
I don't see why we have to go through this again.
The more he tells the story the more he believes it's true.
Mrs. McKay.
We know you spoke with the local authorities.
But this seems like a matter for the State Police.

Don't worry about how crazy it sounds Evan.
You just tell us what you saw.

Yeah, he likes the remake.
Yuck.
That's what I mean.
Evan?
Did you see what this thing was?
No, but I saw it grab Mr. Jenkins.
It pulled him underneath the car.
Then what?
It took him away.
I heard the monster leaving.
It made this really scary sound.
What did it sound like, Evan?
Like this whining growl.
Thanks for your time.
So the local police have novel out foul play.
Apparently there were signs of struggle.
You know, they could be right.
Could just be a kidnapping.
Maybe this isn't our kind of gig.
Yeah, maybe not.
Except for this.
Dad marked the area, Dean.
Possible hunting grounds of a phantom attacker.
Why would he even do that?
Well, he found a lot of local folk law about a dog figure that comes out at night, grabs people then vanishes.
He found this too.
This county has more missing persons per capital than anywhere else in the state.
It is weird.
Yeah.
Don't phantom attackers usually snatch people from their beds?
Jenkins was taken from a parking lot.
Well, there are all kinds, you know.
Spring Hill Jack, Spanworm Gases, they take people anywhere, anytime.
Look, Dean.
I don't know if this is our kind of gig either...
Yeah, you're right.
We should ask around more tomorrow.
Right.
I saw a motel about five miles back.
Whoa, whoa, easy.
Let's have another round?
We should get an early start.
Now, you really know how to have fun, don't you Grandma?
You're right.
I'll meet you outside.
I'm gonna take a leak.
Hey, hey.
Have you guys been outside?
Around here like the last hour or so?
Sam?
Sammy!
Sam...
So, what can we do for you Officer Washington?
I'm working a missing persons.
I didn't know the Jenkins case was being covered by the State Police?
Uh, no, no.
It's someone else.
Actually it's my cousin.
We were having a few laughs at this bar down by the highway.
And I haven't seen him since.
Did your cousin have a drinking problem?
Sam?
Two beers and he's doing Karaoke.
No, he wasn't drunk.
He was taken.
All right.
What's his name?
Winchester.
Sam Winchester.
Like the riffle?
Like the riffle.
Winchester, Sam
Samuel Winchester.
So you know that his brother Dean Winchester died in St. Louis.
And it was excepted a murder.
Yeah, Dean.
Kind of the black sheep of the family.
Handsome though.
Well, he's not showing up at any current field reports.
I already have a lead.
I saw surveillance camera above the highway.
County traffic cam.
Right, yeah.
I'm thinking the camera picked up whatever took him.
Oh, whoever.
Well, I have access to the traffic cam footage down at the county works department, but...
Well...
Let me tell you this the right way.
Won't you fill out...
A missing persons report.
And sit tight over here.
Officer, look uh...
He's family.
And I kind of... look out for the kid.
You got to let me go with you.
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
Well, tell me something.
Your county has a fair share of missing persons.
Any of them come back?
Sam's my responsibility.
And he's coming back.
I'm bringing him back.
Greg.
I think we've got something.
These traffic cam take an image every three seconds.
It's part of the amber alert program.
These images were all taken around the time your cousin Sam disappeared.
This really isn't what I'm looking for.
Just wait, wait.
Next one.
This one was taken right after Sam left the bar.
Look at the back in at that thing.
Now, look at the plates.
The plates look new.
Probably stolen.
So, whoever's driving that rust bucket must be involved.
Do you hear that engine?
Yeah.
Kind of a whining growl, isn't it?
Sure.
I'll be damned.
You're alive?
Hey, you okay?
Does it look like I'm doing okay?
Where are we?
I don't know.
Country, I think.
Smells like the country.
You're Jenkins, aren't you?
Yeah.
Wow, I was looking for you.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Well, no offense.
But this is a piss poor rescue.
Well, my brother's out there right now too.
He's looking for us.
So...
So, he's not gonna find us.
We're in the middle of nowhere.
Waiting for them to come back and do God knows what to us.
What are they?
Have you seen them?
What are you talking about?
Whatever grabbed us, what did they look like?
See for yourself.
Leave me alone.
Don't touch me.
Leave me alone!
I'll be damned.
They're just people.
Yeah, what did you expect?
How often do they feed you?
Once a day.
They use that thing over there to open the cage.
And that's the only time you see them?
So far.
But I'm waiting.
Waiting for what?
Their baiting time, man.
I think that's the least of your worries right now.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
What do you they want then?
Depends on who they are.
They're bunch of psycho hill-billy red neck if you ask me.
Looking for love in all the wrong places.
Okay, the next traffic cam is fifty miles from here and your pickup didn't pass that one.
So...
So, it must have pulled up somewhere.
I don't see any other roads here.
Well, a lot of these back woods properties have their own private roads.
Great.
So, Gregory.
Yeah.
I ran your badge number.
It's routine when working A case with State Police for county purposes when we have you.
And they just got back to me...
Says here your badge was stolen.
And there's a picture of you.
I lost some weight.
And I got that Michael Jackson skin disease...
Okay.
Would you step out of the car please?
Look, look, look.
If you want to arrest me that's fine.
I'll cooperate.
I swear.
But first please...
Let me find Sam.
I don't even know who you are.
Or if this Sam person is missing.
Look into my eyes and tell me if I'm lying about this.
Identity theft.
You're impersonating an officer.
Here's the thing.
When...
When we were young...
I pretty much pulled him from a fire.
And ever since then I felt responsible for him.
You know, like it's my job to keep him safe.
I'm just afraid if we don't find him fast.
Please...
He's my family.
I'm sorry.
You've given me no choice.
I have to take you in.
After we find Sam Winchester.
What's your name again?
It's Sam.
Why won't you give it up Sammy.
There's no way out.
Don't...
Call me...
Sammy.
What is it?
It's a bracket.
Well, thank God a bracket.
Now we got them, huh?
Must have been a short.
Maybe you knocked something loose.
I think you should get back in there Jenkins.
What?
This isn't right.
Do you want to get out of here?
Yeah, but that was too easy.
Look, I'm gonna get out of here.
I'm gonna send help.
Okay?
Okay.
Don't worry.
No.
I'm serious, Jenkins.
This might be a trap.
Bye, Sammy.
Jenkins!
Thank you.
Okay, officer.
Look I'm gonna press my luck.
Your luck is so pressed.
Right.
I was wondering...
Why are you helping me out anyway?
Why don't you just lock me up?
My brother Riley disappeared three years ago.
A lot like Sam.
We searched for him but...
Nothing.
I know what it's like to feel responsible for someone.
And for them...
Come on, let's keep at it.
Wait, wait.
Pull over here.
Pull over.
It's the first turn off I've seen so far.
You stay here, I'll check it out.
No way.
Hey...
You're a civilian.
And a felon, I think.
I'm not taking you with me.
You're not going without me.
All right.
You promise...
You won't get involved.
You let me handle it.
Yeah, I promise.
Shake on it.
Oh, come on.
This is ridiculous.
Katherine, I really think you're gonna need my help.
I'll manage.
Thank you.
I got to start carrying paper clips.
Hello?
Anybody home?
Hi.
How are you?
Who are you?
I'm Katherine.
I'm a deputy.
What's your name?
Missy.
Missy?
That's a pretty name.
Missy, is your mom home?
She's dead.
I'm sorry, what about your dad?
No?
Can I come in for a minute?
I just want you look at a picture.
Have you seen that guy?
Look at that picture.
What?
That's gonna hurt.
Missy, sweetheart.
Go tell your brothers, I want to see them.
Yes, daddy.
Son of a bitch.
But I've never seen him so angry before.
Never been followed by the police before.
You all right?
Are you Sam Winchester?
Aren't you?
Yeah.
You're...
You're cousin's looking for you.
Thank God.
Where is he?
He uh...
I cuffed him to my car.
Sam?
Are you hurt?
No.
Damn, it's good to see you.
How did you get out of the cuffs?
I know a trick or two.
All right.
Oh.
These locks they're gonna be a bitch.
Well, there's some kind of automatic control.
Right there.
Have you seen them?
Yeah.
Dude, they're just people.
And they jumped you?
Must be getting a little rusty there, kiddo.
What do they want?
I don't know.
They let Jenkins go, but...
That was some sort of trap.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Oh, well that's the point.
You know with...
Our usual play mates there's rules, here's patterns.
But with people...
They're just crazy.
You see anything else out there?
He has about a dozen junk cars out back.
Plates from all over.
So, I'm thinking when they take someone they take their car too.
Did you see a black mustang?
Out there about ten years old?
Yeah, actually I did.
Your brothers?
I'm sorry.
Let's get you guys out of here.
Then we'll take care of those bastards.
It takes a key, key?
I don't know.
All right, I better go find it.
Hey.
Be careful.
Yeah.
Well, I'll say it again.
Demons I get.
People are crazy.
What the...
It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I know.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
I'm gonna kick your ass first.
Then yours.
Come on.
Let's hunt.
Yeah, this one's a fighter.
Sure be fun to hunt.
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
This is what this is about?
You...
You yahoos hunt people?
You ever killed before?
What?
Well, it depends on what you mean.
I've hunted all my life.
Just like my father, his before him.
I've hunted deer... and bear...
I even got a coo-coo once.
Oh boy.
But the best hunt... is human.
Oh, there's nothing like it.
Holding their life in your hands.
Seeing the fear in their eyes just before they go dark.
Makes you feel powerful alive.
You're a sick puppy.
We give them a weapon.
Give him a fighting chance.
It's kind of like...
Our tradition passed down father to son, cost only one or two a year.
Never enough to bring the lot down we've never been that sloppy.
Yeah, well.
Don't save yourself short.
You're plenty of sloppy.
So what?
You're with that pretty cop?
Are you a cop?
If I tell you...
You promise not to make me into an ash tray?
Only reason I don't let my boys take you right here now is that there's something I need to know.
Yeah, how about it's not nice to marry your sister.
Tell me, any of the cops go come looking for you?
Oh, eat me.
No, no, no.
Wait.
You actually might.
You think this is funny?
You've brought this down on my family.
All right?
You want to play games?
We'll play some games.
Looks like we're gonna have a hunt tonight after all, boys.
And you get to pick the animal.
The boy or the cop.
Okay, wait, wait.
Look, nobody's coming for me.
All right?
It's just us.
You don't choose, I will.
Oh, you son of a bitch!
Next time, I'll take an eye.
All right, all right.
The guy.
The guy.
Take the guy!
Lee.
Go do it.
Don't let him out though.
Shoot him in the cage.
What?
I thought you said you were gonna hunt him.
You're gonna give him a chance!
Lee!
When you're done with the boy.
Shoot the bitch too.
We're cleaning this mess up before any more cops come running out here.
What are you doing?
Hey!
You hurt my brother, I'll kill you.
I swear.
I'll kill you all.
I will kill you all!
Lee!
Damn.
Lee!
Jack, you come with me.
Missy.
You watch him now.
Lee?
Where are you?
Lee?
Damn it.
Jack, hit the lights.
They must have pulled the fuses.
You stupid...
Hey!
I'll watch this one.
You go ahead.
Go ahead.
You hurt my family.
I'm gonna bleed you bitch.
You killed my brother.
Your brother?
Now I see.
Just tell me why.
Because it's fun.
Where's the girl?
I locked her in the closet.
What about the dad?
Shot.
Trying to escape.
I think the car's at the police station.
Backup units on route to your location.
So...
State Police and the FBI are gonna be here within the hour.
They're gonna want to talk to you.
I suggest that you're both long gone by then.
Thanks.
Hey, listen.
I don't mean to press our luck.
But we're kind of in the middle of nowhere.
You think we could catch a ride?
Start walking.
Duck if you see a SWAT car.
Sounds great to me.
Thanks.
Listen...
I'm sorry about your brother.
Thank you.
It was really hard not knowing what happened to him.
I thought it would be easier once I knew the truth.
But...
It isn't really.
Anyway you should go.
Don't ever do that again.
Do what?
Go missing like that.
You were worried about me.
I'm saying, you vanish like that again I'm not looking for you.
Sure you will.
I'm not.
So you got saddled on by a 13 year old girl, huh?
Oh, shut up!
Just saying getting rusty there, kiddo.
Shut up!
Previously on Supernatural:
Sammy.
Take your brother outside as fast as you can.
Go!
Dad's on a hunting trip.
And he hasn't been home in a few days.
This is Dad's book.
I think he wants us to pick up where he left off.
You know, saving people, hunting things.
The family business.
I gotta find Dad.
It's the only thing I can think about.
It's coming across the bridge.
Hurry.
Hurry!
Ah!
No!
No!
I know you're just doing your job, but police have been here all week.
I don't see why we have to go through this again.
The more he tells the story, the more he believes it's true.
Mrs. McKay we know you spoke with local authorities.
But this seems like a matter for the state police.
So...
Don't worry how crazy it sounds, Evan.
You just tell us what you saw.
I was up late watching TV when I heard this weird noise.
- What did it sound like?
- lt sounded like a monster.
Tell the officers what you were watching on TV.
Um Godzilla vs. Mothra.
That's my favorite Godzilla movie.
- So much better than the original, huh?
- Totally.
Yeah.
He likes the remake.
- Yuck.
- That's what I-
Evan, did you see what this thing was?
No.
But I saw it grab Mr. Jenkins.
- lt pulled him underneath the car.
- Then what?
It took him away.
I heard the monster leaving.
It made this really scary sound.
What did it sound like, Evan?
Like this whining growl.
Thanks for your time.
So the local police have not ruled out foul play.
Apparently, there were signs of a struggle.
You know, they could be right.
Could just be a kidnapping.
Maybe this isn't our kind of gig.
Yeah, maybe not.
Except for this.
Dad marked the area, Dean.
Possible hunting grounds of a phantom attacker.
Why would he even do that?
Well, he found a lot of local folklore about a dark figure that comes out at night grabs people, then vanishes.
He found this too:
This county has more missing persons per capita than anywhere in the state.
- That is weird.
- Yeah.
Don't phantom attackers usually snatch people from their beds?
Jenkins was taken from a parking lot.
Well, there are all kinds.
Spring Heeled Jacks, phantom gassers.
They take people anywhere, any time.
I don't know if this is our kind of gig either.
Yeah, you're right.
We should ask around more tomorrow.
Right.
I saw a motel about five miles back.
Whoa, whoa, easy.
Let's have another round.
We should get an early start.
You really know how to have fun, don't you, Grandma?
All right.
I'll meet you outside.
I gotta take a leak.
Hey.
Hey.
You guys been outside around here in, like, the last hour or so?
Sam!
Sammy?
Sam.
So, what can we do for you, Officer Washington?
I'm working a missing persons.
Didn't know the Jenkins case was being covered by state police.
Uh, no.
No.
This is someone else.
Actually, it's my cousin.
We were having a few last night at this bar by the highway.
I haven't seen him since.
- Your cousin have a drinking problem?
- Sam?
Two beers, and he's doing karaoke.
He wasn't drunk.
He was taken.
All right.
What's his name?
Winchester.
Sam Winchester.
- Like the rifle?
- Like the rifle.
"Samuel Winchester."
So you know that his brother, Dean Winchester, died in St. Louis and was suspected of murder?
Yeah, Dean.
Kind of the black sheep of the family.
- Handsome, though.
- Uh-huh.
He's not showing up in current reports.
Oh, I already have a lead.
I saw a surveillance camera out by the highway.
- Uh-huh.
County traffic cam?
- Right.
Yeah.
I'm thinking the camera picked up whatever took him.
Or whoever.
Well, I have access to the cam footage down at the County Works Department.
But, well, in the meantime, let's do this the right way.
Why don't you fill out a missing persons report and sit tight over here?
Officer, look, he's family.
I kind of...
I kind of look out for the kid.
You gotta let me go with you.
I'm sorry.
I can't do that.
Well, tell me something.
Your county has its fair share of missing persons.
Any of them come back?
Sam's my responsibility.
And he's coming back.
I'm bringing him back.
Greg.
I think we got something.
These traffic cams take an image every three seconds.
It's part of the Amber Alert program.
These images were all taken around the time your cousin disappeared.
- This really isn't what I'm looking for.
- Just wait.
Wait.
Next one.
This one was taken right after Sam left the bar.
Look at the back end of that thing.
Now look at the plates.
The plates look new.
It was probably stolen.
So whoever's driving that rust bucket must be involved.
- Hear that engine?
- Yeah.
Kind of a whining growl, isn't it?
Sure.
I'll be damned.
You're alive?
- Huh?
- Hey, you okay?
Does it look like I'm doing okay?
- Where are we?
- l don't know.
The country, I think.
Smells like the country.
- You're Alvin Jenkins, aren't you?
- Yeah.
Wow. I was looking for you.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
Well, no offense, but this is a piss-poor rescue.
My brother's out there right now too.
He's looking for us.
So...
So he's not gonna find us.
We're in the middle of nowhere waiting for them to come back and do God knows what to us.
- What are they?
Have you seen them?
- What are you talking about?
Whatever grabbed us.
What do they look like?
See for yourself.
Leave me alone.
Don't you touch me.
You leave me alone!
I'll be damned.
- They're just people.
- Yeah.

- Once a day.
They use that thing over there to open the cage.
And that's the only time you see them?
So far.
But I'm waiting.
- Waiting for what?
- Ned Beatty time, man.
- l think that's the least of your worries.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
- What do you think they want, then?
Depends on who they are.
They're a bunch of psycho, hillbilly rednecks, you ask me.
Looking for love in all the wrong places.
Aah!
Okay.
The next traffic cam is 50 miles from here and your pickup didn't pass that one.
- So...
- lt must have pulled off somewhere.
I don't see any other roads here.
A lot of these backwoods properties have their own private roads.
Great.
- So, Gregory?
- Yeah.
I ran your badge number.
It's routine when working a case with state police for accounting purposes, and what have you.
Mm-hm.
And, they just got back to me.
Says here your badge was stolen.
And there's a picture of you.
I lost some weight.
And I got that Michael Jackson skin disease.
Okay.
Would you step out of the car, please?
Look, look, look.
You want to arrest me?
That's fine.
I'll cooperate, I swear.
But first, please, let me find Sam.
I don't even know who you are.
Or if this Sam person is missing.
Look in my eyes and tell me I'm lying about this.
Identity theft?
You're impersonating an officer.
Here's the thing.
When we were young I pretty much pulled him from a fire.
And ever since then, I've felt responsible for him.
You know, like it's my job to keep him safe.
I'm just afraid if we don't find him fast...
Please.
He's my family.
I'm sorry.
You've given me no choice.
I have to take you in.
After we find Sam Winchester.
What's your name again?
- lt's Sam.
Why don't you give it up, Sammy.
There's no way out.
Don't call me Sammy.
What is it?
It's a bracket.
Oh, thank God, a bracket.
Now we got them, huh?
Must have been a short.
Maybe you knocked something loose.
- l think you should get back in, Jenkins.
- What?
- This isn't right.
- Don't you want to get out of here?
Yeah, but that was too easy.
I'm gonna get out of here.
Gonna send help.
Don't worry.
No.
I'm serious.
Jenkins.
This might be a trap.
Bye, Sammy.
Jenkins!
Thank you.
Aah!
Okay, officer.
- Look, I don't mean to press my luck.
- Your luck is so pressed.
Right.
I was wondering, why are you helping me out anyway?
Why don't you just lock me up?
My brother Riley disappeared three years ago.
A lot like Sam.
We searched for him, but nothing.
I know what it's like to feel responsible for someone, and for them...
Come on.
Let's keep at it.
Wait, wait, wait.
Pull over here.
Pull over.
This is the first turn-off I've seen so far.
- You stay here.
I'll check it out.
- No way.
Hey.
You're a civilian.
And a felon, I think.
I'm not taking you with me.
You're not going without me.
All right.
You promise you won't get involved?
You'll let me handle it.
- Yeah.
I promise.
- Shake on it.
Oh, come on.
This is ridiculous.
Kathleen, I think you're gonna need my help.
I'll manage, thank you.
I gotta start carrying paperclips.
Hello?
Is anybody home?
Hi.
How are you?
Who are you?
I'm Kathleen, I'm a deputy.
What's your name?
Missy.
Missy.
That's a pretty name.
Missy, is your mom home?
She's dead.
I'm sorry.
What about your dad?
No?
Can I come in for a minute?
I just want you to look at a picture.
You seen that guy?
Look at that picture.
- What?
- That's gonna hurt.
Missy, sweetheart go tell your brothers I wanna see them.
Yes, Daddy.
Son of a bitch.
But I've never seen him so angry before.
Well, Lee, never been followed by the police before.
You all right?
Are you Sam Winchester?
Aren't you?
Yeah.
Your...
Your cousin's looking for you.
Thank God.
Where is he?
I...
I cuffed him to my car.
Sam?
- Are you hurt?
- No.
Damn, it's good to see you.
How did you get out of the cuffs?
I know a trick or two.
All right.
Whoa.
These locks look like they're gonna be a bitch.
There's some kind of automatic control right there.
- Have you seen them?
- Yeah.
Dude.
They're just people.
And they jumped you?
Must be getting a little rusty there, kiddo.
- What do they want?
- l don't know.
They let Jenkins go, but that was some sort of trap.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Yeah, well, that's the point.
You know, with our usual playmates, there's rules.
There's patterns.
But with people, they're just crazy.
See anything else out there?
Uh, there's a dozen junked cars out back.
Plates from all over.
When they take someone, they take their car too.
Did you see a black Mustang?
About 10 years old?
Yeah, actually l did.
Your brother's.
I'm sorry.
Let's get you guys out and take care of those bastards.
This thing takes a key?
Key?
- l don't know.
- All right.
I better go find it.
Hey.
Be careful.
Yeah.
Yikes.
I'll say it again.
Demons, I get.
People are crazy.
What the...?
Shh.
It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I know.
- Daddy!
- Jeez.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Aah!
I'm gonna kick your ass first.
And then yours.
Come on.
Let's hunt him.
Yeah, this one's a fighter.
Sure would be fun to hunt.
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
That's what this is about.
You
- You yahoos hunt people?
You ever killed before?
Well, that depends on what you mean.
I've hunted all my life.
Just like my father, his before him.
I've hunted deer and bear.
I even got a cougar once.
Oh, boy.
But the best hunt is human.
Oh, there's nothing like it.
Holding their life in your hands.
Seeing the fear in their eyes just before they go dark.
Makes you feel powerful alive.
You're a sick puppy.
We give them a weapon.
Give them a fighting chance.
It's kind of like our tradition.
Passed down father to son.
Course, only one or two a year.
Never enough to bring the law down.
We never been that sloppy.
Oh.
Yeah, well, don't sell yourself short.
You're plenty sloppy.
So, what, you with that pretty cop?
You a cop?
If I tell you you promise not to make me into an ashtray?
Only reason I don't let my boys take you right here and now is that there's something I need to know.
Yeah, how about it's not nice to marry your sister?
Tell me.
Any other cops gonna come looking for you?
Eat me.
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
You actually might.
You think this is funny?
You brought this down on my family.
All right.
You wanna play games?
We'll play some games.
Looks like we're gonna have a hunt tonight, after all, boys.
And you get to pick the animal.
The boy or the cop.
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
No.
Look.
Nobody's coming for me, all right?
It's just us.
You don't choose, I will.
Aah!
You son of a bitch.
Next time, I'll take an eye.
All right.
The guy, the guy, take the guy.
Lee.
Go do it.
Don't let him out, though.
Shoot him in the cage.
What?
You were gonna hunt him.
You were gonna give him a chance.
Lee, when you're done with the boy, shoot the bitch too.
We gotta clean up this mess up before any more cops come running out here.
What are you doing?
Hey.
If you hurt my brother, I'll kill you, I swear.
I'll kill you all.
I will kill you all!
Lee!
Damn.
Lee!
Jared, you come with me.
Missy you watch him, now.
Lee?
Where are you?
Lee.
Damn it.
Jared, get the lights.
They must have pulled the fuses.
You stupid...
Hey.
I'll watch this one.
You go ahead.
Go ahead.
You hurt my family, I'm gonna bleed you, bitch.
You killed my brother.
Your brother.
Now I see.
Just tell me why.
Because it's fun.
- Where's the girl?
- Locked in the closet.
What about the dad?
Shot.
Trying to escape.
- l think the car's at the police station.
WOMAN Backup.
backup units en route to your location.
So state police and the FBI are gonna be here within the hour.
They're gonna wanna talk to you.
I suggest that you're both long gone by then.
Thanks.
I don't mean to press our luck, but we're in the middle of nowhere.
Think we could catch a ride?
Start walking.
Duck if you see a squad car.
Sound great to me.
Thanks.
Listen sorry about your brother.
Thank you.
It was really hard not knowing what happened.
I thought it would be easier once I knew the truth.
But...
It isn't, really.
Anyway, you should go.
- Don't ever do that again.
- Do what?
Go missing like that.
You were worried about me.
All I'm saying is, you vanish like that again, I'm not looking for you.
- Sure you won't.
- l'm not.
So you got sidelined by a 13-year-old girl?
Shut up.
Just saying, you're getting rusty, kiddo.
Shut up.
Til.death Season 1 Episode 6
So what do you think of my office,ma?
I love it.
And look at your view.
You can see all those kids smoking.
Bonnie,get a picture of me and the vice principal on the detention couch.
Come on.
Look stern.
Woodcock,we got a problem.
Time to put out another fire,ma.
Yeah,cart 7-a is officially dead.
Your complaint is noted.
I'll bring it up at the next equipment and facilities brunch.
Oh,you mean when you bring a box of mini donuts down to tom in the boiler room?
Called working the system,eddie.
You should try it some time.
Oh,eddie,meet my mom bonnie.
Mom,this is my neighbor eddie, the one I was telling you about.
Yeah,you're right.
He is sort of handsome.
Well,thank you,woodcock.
That wasn't the only thing I said.
Well,it was so nice to meet you.
Oh,the pleasure's all mine,mrs.
W.
Well,we should get going.
Our nail appointment's at 10:00.
And after that,we're gonna hit the sale rack at mervyn'S.
My treat.
Bye,sweetie.
- Nice to meet you.
- A pleasure.
There they go.
Two best girls.
Yeah,it's quite a picture.
It's a shame they hate each other.
- What?
- Well,it's not just them.
It's universal.
The mother and the wife are bitter enemies.
Always have been,always will be.
It's god's way.
Well,my mom and steph, they love each other.
No,they don'T.
Look,here's the thing.
Now that you're married, there's 2 mrs.
Woodcocks, and that's far too many.
Well,one's my wife and the other's my mother.
And they still need to prove who's the alpha female, like 2 she-wolves fighting over the bloated carcass of a dead caribou.
Only the bloated carcass is you.
- You make it sound so - primal?
Savage?
Oh,you betcha.
What's going on in there,woodcock?
Let me in.
I was just wondering if I had the authority to transfer you to another district.
Oh,I know it's hard to hear, but it's all true.
Well,I don't think you're right.
Oh,I am right.
I'm as right as I am handsome.
what a great dinner,huh?
It was delicious.
Oh,it was.
I love chinese food and you know what?
An orange for dessert is plenty.
And I'm sorry you didn't get to order your dumplings,steph.
That's ok.
Those cold noodles you wanted to try were great.
You know what else is great,guys?
This.
This right here.
God,this triangle of love.
Anybody want ice cream?
All right.
Good night,ma.
Hey,I left a bottle of water by your bed just in case you get thirsty.
Look at mr.
Rockefeller with his bottled water.
I love you.
Have a good night.
- Hey,this was fun.
- yeah
Well,uh, she seems all set.
Yeah,you know, I thought the bottle of water by the bed was a good idea,you know.
Chinese food always makes me thirsty.
Isn't it funny how it does that?
Well,it is getting late.
Hey,you know what we get to do tonight.
We get to try the new air mattress.
Bouncy,huh?
Hey,we could pretend we're elves making love on a big marshmallow.
Or we could play that fun little me,we played earlier.
You know,the one where we're caught in the crossfire outside of wu's palace and you save your mother and leave me for dead.
What?
What,is that how you read that?
Come here,you.
Ok,jeff,we are not having sex as elves, or humans or anything else right now.
Don't you think you're overreacting just a little bit?
I mean,it was a scooter backfiring.
Well,it sounded like gunshots.
I don't think it did.
I can't believe this.
You would take a bullet for her, but me,you just pushed to the side.
She was nearest to the shooter.
And she's old.
She can't run.
she had no trouble running through that sale at mervyn's to get to the london fog raincoat rack.
Honey,I just...
I heard a noise and I acted on instinct.
Yeah,your instinct was to protect your mom, just like your instinct was to sell me down the river when I wanted to order my dumplings.
Aha!
Yeah.
See,I knew that was bothering you.
You know as well as I do that we all agreed on the noddles.
No.
You and your mother voted against me.
That's when I went dead inside.
Honey,hey, look, I'm sorry.
Look,I'll do anything to make it up to you, I swear.
From now on, it's all about you.
Jeffey,do you have an extra pillow?
Hey,are you using that other one just for reading?
I'll give her mine.
Where's the milk?
It was either my cereal or your coffee.
My cereal won.
Want me to scoop out a little?
I don't want your used milk.
- It's fine.
- It's pink.
Who's this?
Sorry I'm a little early for car pool, but things are kind of tense at my place.
Want me to get you some coffee?
Sure.
You got it.
Can I get it with just a little milk?
So to what do we owe this mildly annoying intrusion?
I kind of had a little problem in chinatown last night.
Yeah?
Is the kung pao starting to make its move?
What?
No.
No.
Well,I kind of thought someone was shooting at us, and it turns out it was just a scooter backfiring,and, well, I dove to save my mom and kind of left steph for dead.
God,that makes me smile.
What are you trying to do, destroy your marriage?
No,no,I was just-- get this through your skull.
Steph is the most important woman in your life right now,ok?
There is only one mrs.
Woodcock,one, and that is your wife.
Your mother is now the artist formerly known as mrs.
Woodcock.
Listen to big red here.
She speaks the truth.
What is your mother visiting now for anyway?
You've been married, what,like,7 minutes?
You're still laying the groundwork for your marriage.
The foundation isn't dry.
Your wife needs time to... spray her scent?
What?
You've got to send your mother home before it gets any worse.
Put that woman on a plane.
Eddie cares very deeply about his mother, but he made it clear early on in our relationship who was number one.
Mom's a fun lady, but she is not my number one.
Jeff,trust me on this one,ok?
- I got to go to work.
- ok
- Love you.
- Ok.All right, lollipop.
I guess I could change her plane ticket,but-- don't you dare do that to your mother!
What?
You just said to me to put her on a plane.
I don't care what I said in front of her.
That's just what the wives want you to do:
Send your mom home so they can drive that wedge.
Make you alienate the one woman in the world who loves you more than anything else.
They can't love you like that, and it shames them.
'Cause you gotta get rid of that old woman.
Bye.
Do not get rid of that old woman.
Maybe if I put my mom on a plane, steph will calm down and the whole thing will blow over.
- Blow over?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna tell you a story.
The year was 1991.
The place was papa lasagna's, home of papa lasagna's famous veal lasagna.
I was there with my mother and joy and joy orders a personal pan pizza and my mom innocently says,
I've never seen a woman eat a whole pizza pie.
And somehow to joy, that meant your ass is as big as kansas.
Well,you can imagine.
We fought for 3 months, and I defended my mom and I tried to explain to joy that she didn't mean anything by it, but at the end of the day, you have to pick a side,
and I picked the one that I liked seeing naked.
Joy.
First you tell me not to put my mom on a plane.
Now you're telling me to choose my wife.
I'm totally confused.
All right, look,woodcock, this is what you do,ok?
To the outside world, you choose your wife, but you take the relationship with your mother underground.
What do you mean, underground?
Yes,you start phoning her from work.
You set up a secret email with a clever username known only to her.
For you,I suggest freddylipswack52.
- What?
- It's just a little something I noticed.
You also want to have a secret credit card so you don't need her approval to get your mom special gifts, like a combination tv/vcr so she only has to learn one remote.
You have a secret credit card?
I'll do you one better.
With the miles that I earned on it,
I actually took my mom to cabo san lucas on the downlow on what turned out to be one of the most wonderful weekends of both of our lives.
Are you suggesting that I have an affair with my mother?
That's too creepy.
It can be.
Make sure you get two double beds.
Learn from my mistake.
I'm sorry I have to send you home.
It's just steph is still really upset about this whole stupid backfire,gunshot thing.
Yeah.
I took an ambien around midnight.
Did she ever stop yelling?
Not so much.
Anyway,you know, you're only leaving a few days early and,hey,you get that nice,leisurely layover, so you can shop and get some lunch and maybe some dinner and... wish I was flying through detroit, I'll tell you that.
Sweetie,don't worry about it.
I got my book of crossword puzzles and my yogurt.
I'll be just fine.
I know,but... oh,jeffrey,it's important for you and steph to get your life settled.
I'm in the way right now and I should go so you two can work things out.
Honey,you know I love you more than anything.
I know that.
My only goal is to make sure you're happy, even if I'm not there to see it.
You're not going anywhere.
I don't know.
Is it evil that I actually let jeff send him mom away?
Are you kidding?
Jeff was gonna let the chinese guy kill you.
Hey,what are you ladies doing,making a quilt?
No,eddie,we're having what's called a conversation.
Ok,geniuses.
I just--I still feel kind of guilty.
Steph,let me tell you a little story about mother-in-laws.
When we were first married, eddie drags me to this crappy italian restaurant, papa lasagna's,with his mother.
She just can't let it go.
I order this tiny, little personal pan pizza.
She looks me straight in the eye.
Tells me I'm fat.
Come on,eddie.
Back me up on this.
Remember how rude she was?
Yes.
What part of personal pan pizza didn't she understand?
Well,I should go.
Jeff's gonna be home from the airport soon.
I'll walk you out.
I'm going out.
Hallelujah.
Every time I tell the pizza story,
I desperately need to eat a personal pan pizza.
You know what I like to do?
I like to fold 'em in half and eat 'em like a taco.
I couldn't do it.
I was on the way to the airport.
I just couldn't do it.
It's not fair to ma.
Od for you,woodcock.
You did the right thing.
Well,wait.
I just...
I gotta talk this over with steph, so can I just leave mom here for a little while?
Wait.
Here?
That's kind of weird.
You know, there's a red roof inn right near doylestown.
Eddie,please?
All right.
I will give your mother safe harbor.
Are you sure about this,jeff?
Don't worry,ma.
He's huge,but he's kind.
Have you been to cabo?
hi,Honey,listen,
I gotta talk to you for one second.
Baby,I am so sorry about this whole thing.
Oh,so am I. Look--
I know you love your mother very much, and I should never have put you in the position of having to choose between us.
Really?
So you didn't want me to put my mom on a plane?
Oh,no.
I'm so glad you did that.
Now...
I just ordered chinese food, so I can finally get those dumplings and that gives us about a half hour to play elves on a marshmallow.
ok.
Eddie?
Did you clean?
What is that smell?
It's so... delicious.
Who are you?
Oh,this is jeff's mother from next door.
And look.
She baked a gingerbread eddie.
It's delicious.
Try one of my arms.
It's very nice to meet you.
You have a lovely home.
Thank you.
I thought jeff was taking you to the airport.
So did I.
Eddie?
Oh,excuse us for a moment, won't you,mother woodcock?
- Yes?
- Come in here for a second.
Why is jeff's mother in our kitchen giving you a haircut?
Well,you know my regular guy is having boyfriend problems.
All right,look,jeff just wanted to keep her here until he had an opportunity to go home and explain everything to steph.
Wait.
Steph doesn't know that she's here?
Not exactly.
Does she think that his mother's on a plane?
No comment.
You know what?
That is it.
I am not going to be a part of lying steph about this.
We are taking her back.
Oh,no,you're not.
I'm not gonna allow you to chase another mother out of our house.
- What?
- And P.S. My mom never called you fat.
This is not about your mother.
Oh,this is exactly about my mother.
And you wanna know something else?
Just for the record, the only thing my mom said is a whole pizza just for you seems like a lot of food.
She didn't know what she was saying.
She'd never heard of personal pizzas before.
She can from a generation where pizzas only came in one size:
Huge!
And I suppose she didn't mean anything when she snorted when I sprinkled a teensy bit of parmesan on top of it.
What the hell were you trying to do, set a world record for cheese eating?
It is a personal pan pizza.
Personal.
Am I crazy, mrs.
Woodcock, or is this not a pizza for one person?
I wouldn't want to get in the middle of this.
But it does seem like it might be a challenge for a lady to finish that in one sitting.
Just a minute.
You're not chinese food.
Jeff,I am not gonna be a part of this.
Part of what?
What's going on?
Bonnie?
Jeff,I thought you took your mom to the airport.
I did.
I mean I was-- he was hiding her at our house.
- Really?
- Yes.
So he came home, lied to me, and then we made love?
Didn't know that part, but yes.
I can't believe you did this.
How could you lie to me?
He had no choice.
We all lie.
We have to when you make us take your side over our own mothers.
So he kept his mom at our house for the afternoon.
What's the big deal?
But married people don't lie to each other.
What?
Of course we do.
Hell,there was this one time
I actually told joy that I was going to a history teacher's symposium and I was actually with my mother in cabo san lucas.
Silly question.
Is joy still here?
Yep.
Do you happen to own a protective cup?
All right, what about that one?
Oh,that's where I bought my mom a day of beauty.
All right, how about this one?
That was a pair of high-end orthopedic shoes.
Long story short, she's dancing again.
All right,that one.
Oh,that was the commemorative 100th episode matlock boxed set with additional commentary from andy griffith.
Ok,throw in cabo.
That's another two grand.
Carry the one, that comes to...
I'm redoing the kitchen, and I'm buying myself a horse.
ma'am, we've received word that one of our subs is in trouble.
General krieger, what do we know?
Ma'am,at 0450, the "seattle" struck a sea mount 14 miles off the coast of north korea.
Captain duggan, how is your crew?
a little banged up here, but managing to hold their own.
If the north koreans find out where the "seattle" is, we could be dealing with a nuclear confrontation.
Thank you for coming.
Well,the game is afoot,ma'am.
Let's get these young people home.
Do you think the chinese will help?
It's a unprecedented request.
They're gonna ask for a lot.
We need your government's help to save the men on our sub.
I understand.
There are certain purchases we would like to make.
The weapons.
No.
Well,I just don't know what else we have to give.
Look,if you d't want them to buy weapons, how about letting them sell weapons?
It's a deal.
Beijing's accepted it.
They're gonna give us access to their ships and their underwater rescue technology.
How are things at the office?
What do you think about you coming back?
I'm sorry,mr.
Speaker.
I like what I'm doing.
yes.
Turn on the news.
Get him on the line as soon as possible.
North korean state intelligence says the american nuclear submarine was operating within its waters when it went down.
Oh,god.
I'm on my way.
north korea claims the U.S. Nuclear submarine, allegedly crippled somewhere in its waters, was part of a mission preparing for attack.
North korean radio and television are broadcasting orders for reserve soldiers to report to duty.
We will get you details as they become available.
thank you,matt.
So far,the pentagon has only confirmed that an american submarine suffered a collision with an underwater mountain yesterday ana rescue is being prepared.
If that submarine is in north korean waters,though, the stakes could be much higher than a risky undersea rescue.
North korea is, of course,a nuclear power and may have nuclear weapons at its disposal.
We have reports that they are moving more troops to the border, and experts say this is looking more and more like a precursor to war.
What happened?
the north koreans are stepping up their air patrols.
Their jet fighters are making runs into the D.M.Z.
Making runs?
Quick incursions into the airspace-- draw in our fighters, see who breaks off first.
Basically playing chicken with fighter jets.
Rules of engagement for our pilots?
Not to fire unless threatened or the enemy crosses the border.
The problem is, the more they test us, the more chance there is that something happens to escalate.
It also looks like they've got every boat they can sweeping the waters.
Are they close to our sub?
The search patterns are even up and down the eastern coast, indicating they know the sub is down there, but they don't know where.
So basically,they know exactly what we told the chinese.
Well,why would the chinese leak that we have a sub down when we just made a deal with them for a joint rescue operation?
It embarrasses us on the world stage.
Also escalates tension on their own border.
A lot of factions at play in the chinese government.
If someone inside didn't like the idea that they were helping to rescue our sailors, they could have talked to the north koreans.
That makes the most sense.
Now that it's out there that we have a sub in trouble n north korean waters, there's no covert rescue option.
So we have to presume that chinese cooperation on the rescue is up in the air again.
Still no word from the chinese ambassador?
He's making a point of being unreachable.
How much air do they have left?
About 33 hours.
All right.
I don't care what it takes.
We have to get the chinese ambassador back in here, and we have to work with templeton to get ready.
We have to make a new deal with them fast.
Anything else?
Yes,ma'am.
We need to put our troops on high alert, coordinate with the japanese military, step up our awacs patrol so we can track enemy movements in greater detail.
All right.
Put the troops on high alert.
Step up the awacs, but hold off on the japanese.
I want to talk to their prime minister first.
Where's the vice presint?
On his way to cheyenne mountain.
Military and secret service both thought he should be in a secure location given the circumstances.
-Hey.
-Hey.
How about getting owen latimer in here?
Owen latimer?
Mm-hmm.
An old friend from the university of richmond.
He's been studying korea.
for,what,20 years?
More like 30.
Knows the region inside and out.
I'll,uh,let you know as soon as the speaker gets here.
Thank you.
Ma'am?
No running in the halls,vince.
Oh,I'm sorry.
I just-- she's kidding,vince.
People run in the halls,fall, trip,the government gets sued.
The president gets punchy when she hasn't slept.
Okay.
The secretary of state is flying back from bangalore.
He's given ma list of calls that he thinks that you should make.
South korean president, japanese P.M.,
E.U. Leadership,canadian P.M.
I might've forgotten that one.
Also,our ambassador in seoul needs to talk to you about evacuating our american civilians.
The embassy's packed.
We're not evacuating anybody yet.
Let's make the calls.
Start with him.
yes,ma'am.
Jim... the press is already gathering.
Walk with me.
I need a statement, and I don't think "secretary of state's in bangalore" is gonna fly anymore.
There's an american sub in trouble.
It was in the sea of japan on a routine exercise which should in no way provoke a response from north korea.
Main message--we're doing everything we can to save the lives of the crew.
We call on north korea to respect the ws of maritime rescue.
They're gonna ask if we were in north korean waters.
Most countries in the region claim a 12-mile offshore limit.
North korea asserts a 200-mile limit not recognized by the international community.
Not answering,got it.
Our soul focus is on the lives of the crew, and our prayers are with their families.
You know what to say, and we're talking to everyone who matters directly.
Except the north koreans.
They don't exactly have a red line to the oval.
Hey... are we gonna be okay here?
I mean,we're okay,right?
We're fine.
mr.
Speaker,thank you for getting here so quickly.
I finally got through to the chinese ambassador.
And?
well,he's backpedaling.
Says everything's changed since it's gone public.
Nate,can we get them to stick to their agreement on the use of their underwater rescue system?
Well,the best case, they'll probably ask for a better deal.
I'm trying to get him in here to see you, but he stalling.
I know he's just waiting for beijing to figure out where they stand on this thing.
Have we been able to come up with any way to get the sailors out of the sub without the chinese technology?
Ma'am,we've got our crews working nonstop to repair the one submersible rescue module we have in the area, but our sub only has 27 hours of air left, and we won't be ready.
We can't get another one there in time.
Not reassembled,ready to go.
So... the chinese are still our only option.
How soon will we know?
Mm,well,they know we don't have a lot of air left.
They need you an awful lot more than they need the north koreans, so it'll be soon.
Hey,ollie!
Thks for coming down!
I'm--I'm so glad to see you,rod!
-Yeah!
-Anything for mac--
I mean,the president.
Flight okay?
Uh,fine.
Uh...
-good.
-It's just,uh,fast.
I-I didn't think they could go that fast.
You're not afraid of flying,are you?
Uh,I didn't think I was.
general,what's your take on the north korean military position?
Well,their troop and equipment movements indicate they're gearing up for a preemptive attack.
Then again,so do ours.
Which is why we need to de- escalate,back off.
Backing off to those people means backing down, and that is not the message you send to them.
But war is?
Oh,please.
Seoul is a city of ten million, powered by natural gas.
When the north koreans say they're gonna turn it into a fireball, they mean it quite literally.
If north korea pursues a total war strategy, ten million people in seoul will be the least of our problems.
Exactly.
Their goal will be to draw us into a regional conflict.
And if they feel they're backed into a corner, we can't rule out they'll use their nukes.
Right now,all we have is a lot of saber rattling and troop movement, and our guys are still down there on that sub.
Until somebody starts shooting at us, our focus is on getting our sailors home safe.
What's the korean leadership say?
Well,all we're hearing is what's on the news.
Is it true that the sub's inside the 12-mile limit?
Owen,there's something you've got to understand.
From now on,every conversation you're a part of, every document you read,basically, anything that you see or do is classified.
It doesn't matter if the story is public.
Now I don't know the statutory penalties... but if you reveal anything that you learn here,
I expect it's a couple decades in prison.
Yeah,I-I assumed.
Well,good,we're in here.
Everyone... th is owen latimer.
He's the,uh,korea expert we told you about.
Welcome.
We'll do introductions when we finish.
For now,suffice it to say professor latimer has my complete confidence.
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.
All right.
Presuming we can still get the chinese to loan us their rescue technology, what are our options?
Well,the north koreans are gonna be all over anyone near their waters now.
So there's no covert option, but the joint chiefs have worked out a preliminary plan.
Ma'am,the seventh fleet's already in the sea of japan.
Presuming we have a chinese rescue module, we'll need to tether it to a ship on the surface.
Now the plan would be to send in navy battle ships to secure the rescue site, hold it while we take the men out, and make sure all classified technology on the sub is destroyed before we leave the area.
That's too much of a provocation.
Can you imagine what we would do if north korea we would do if north korea tried to put warships 11 miles off the coast of new york or san francisco?
Do you have a better idea?
Yeah.
Acknowledge that we violated their sovereign territory.
Be humble.
Let them save face, and then ask for their help in saving our sailors' lives.
Professor latimer.
Uh,I-in-- in such a scenario,
I-I believe the north koreans would make promises to help, would drag their feet long enough to ensure the crew died below, then plunder the sub for its classified technology.
We have 30,000 troops in south korea... two aircraft carrier battle groups, a marine amphibious ready group, not to mention our I.C.B.M.S.
Let's assume they don't want to mess with them.
We have to get the chinese rescue technology back into play.
That's the priority.
The men in that sub have 27 hos of air left.
We're not gonna let them die.
Commander In Chief Season 01 Episode 11
The president has spoken with the leaders of south korea,russia,england, japan,germany,china,and other nations.
A full list is available at the press desk.
She's also arranged a conference call with the U.N. Security council in advance of their emergency session tonight.
kelly!
Kelly!
Kelly!
Okay,one at a time,please.
Pam?
Yes,we understand that U.S. Troops in the region have been put on alert.
Does this mean the administration feels an attack is likely, and if so, might that by why the sub was there in the first place?
The alert is in response to north korean troop movement, and it's not an indication of anything other than ordinary military protocol.
kelly!
Kelly!
Kelly!
Kelly!
Hello,jayne.
mrs.
Templeton.
please,come in.
Nathan at the white house?
Since yesterday.
Well,he did come home last night for about an hour, but then the news broke, and he went right back i don't think he's slept in 36 hours, and heaven knows when he last had a decent meal.
The man couldn't be happier.
He's good in a crisis.
They're lucky to have him.
Yes.
Yes,you know,what nathan is not good at is,um... is apologizing.
Proud men never are.
Sarah... oh,he won't say it, so I will.
He is sorry,truly.
He wants you back.
He nds you.
I can give you the names of a dozen people qualified to run his-- it's not about qualifications.
It's about understanding and trust.
The truth is,
I don't want to go back.
I like this job, and frankly,I could never make this kind of money on the hill.
And I'm just starting to get my credit card bills paid off.
It--it feels good.
Right now at the white house, they're trying to prevent war.
You could be there... with nathan, right in the thick of it, or you can sit behind this expensive glass desk,and... watch it on television.
By the way, we never had this conversation.
Helping with a covert rescue operation is one thing, but publicly putting our military technology in north korean waters-- it's an at-sea rescue.
Of a U.S. Nuclear attack submarine.
What does beijing want?
Lift your embargo on our weapons imports.
That's not going to happen.
You ask us to act like allies.
We ask you to treat us like allies.
allies... how did north korea find out we had a sub down there?
It had to be a leak from your end,ally.
But we cannot control every faction inside our government.
Which is why congress will never agree to lift the weapons ban.
Mr. Speaker?
Yeah,it's not realistic.
Then neither is our involvement with your rescue operation.
The chinese government is gonna let our sailors die down there?
We were ready to help.
We had a deal.
But you must understand, we cannot publicly take part in a U.S. Military operation in north korea.
What if it isn't public?
I'm sorry?
Now that the north koreans know, we don't need your boats on the surface as cover, but we can't get our undersea rescue module to the area in time.
We need yours.
Let us use it covertly.
Yeah,but the technology is complex.
From what I understand, it would take months to train your pilots.
We would need to use your pilots, but we would tether your module to an american ship.
No one would ever need to know that you were involved.
We'd provide the full protection of the united states military.
And guarantee deniability.
And if it leaks out that we were involved?
If the rescue works, our military will be happy to take full credit.
And you will stand by your original deal?
Weapons exports, not imports,yes.
The original deal would stand.
It's still a big gain for china.
I need to check with beijing, but I will do my bes to get them on board.
No.
I will stand by the original deal, but if the rescue doesn't happen in time,it's off the table.
Those men are running out of air down there.
I will get back to you as soon as possible.
Actually,we can get you to a secure line right here in the building.
-Very good.
-Mr.
Ambassador, please tell your leaders that we appreciate their help in saving these american lives.
It will not be forgotten.
Thank you.
I believe I can get the right people in beijing to agree to this.
But if the U.S. Troops fire on north korean troops without provocation, china will not be with you.
I can assure you that will not happen.
Nathan.
you think he can get them on board?
He--he has a very good feel for the people there.
I told him it was the best deal he could get.
They want the deal.
Now we have to pray that their rescue technology actually works with our sub hatch.
Madam president,you're needed in the sit room right away.
Madam president, 14 minutes ago, five north korean jet fighters scrambled to engage one of our awacs off the coast of wonsan.
Fighters responded, but the awacs took fire before we could pull it out.
Casualties?
Injuries,no deaths.
The plane is heading back to pusan under fighter escort.
Madam president... they've just turned this into a shooting war.
We need a response.
no details yet on injuries to the U.S. Flight crew, but we have been told that the damaged plane has landed safely.
what is the likelihood of a nuclear confrontation?
Well,north korea is a nuclear power.
We know they have the fissile material, the fuel to produce at least six to eight bombs.
Whether or not they have done so is unclear, but it is disturbing we haven't heard at all from president allen as the situation continues to escalate.
She's playing with fire here-- nuclear fire.
my X.O. Has wired the boat for demolition.
If we get off of here, we will be able to destroy all classified data and technology.
We apprecie your crew keeping focus,captain duggan.
It must be tense down there.
Thank you, madam president.
We're following the situation as best we can.
We heard a plane's been hit?
You just worry about your men.
I just wanted to let you know...
I spoke with the entire crew.
We volunteered for this mission.
If a rescue isn't feasible or the costs are too high, we're ready to do what we need to do.
We're not there yet, captain.
Yes,ma'am.
Justnow that the sub has been wired, and we can destroy her at any time on your order.
We're working hard to get you home.
Some of my men have asked, if we get that order... if you could tell our families that it wasn't a choice... say it was an accident.
We're doing everything we can to see that it doesn't come to that.
Thank you,madam president.
We'll stand by for orders.
madam president...
I've just spoken with the chinese ambassador.
We have their rescue system and their pilots-- covertly,but we have them.
-Good news.
-Right.
Now the joint chiefs want an immediate response to the shooting of our plane.
There are missile batteries we can take out, as well as a couple of their warships we can sink on your orders with minimal operational risk.
if we're about to send in our own ships to rescue the "seattle,"
I'm not sure starting a "who can sink more boats faster contest"
is the best move.
it'd be no contest,jim.
We will crush them.
I wish I had your confidence,sir.
Let's table the awac shooting for now.
I want to focus on the rescue.
Unfortunately, the shooting makes it very clear the north koreans will use force to keep us off their coast.
We go in for this rescue, we have to be prepared for confrontation.
That could mean war.
Let's say it's war.
What's the worst case scenario?
The north koreans have a million-man army, chemical and biological weapons, maybe nukes, thousands of missiles.
Worst case-- full scale conflict.
We have 300,000 to 500,000 military casualties inside 90 days.
And civilians?
It's 50 kilometers between pyongyang and seoul.
33 million people live there.
Pick a number.
Are you saying we should abandon the "seattle,"
making me the president who ordered the only mass suicide in U.S. Military history?
I'm urging caution,ma'am.
Jim,don't hedge.
I need answers.
Are you recommending that we destroy the sub and kill the crew?
I don't like it anymore than you do, but that might bring us back from the brink of something far worse.
No,if there is a chance of a rescue-- but that's all there is is a chance, and not a good one.
We could send in ships,start a war and still lose the sub.
I'm with you.
I think we should go in after our men.
If north korea attacks, we fight back, and I'll bet my bottom dollar, we'll be in pyongyang by the end of the week, but if we back down, it'll be a stain on our reputation for decades.
We may never recover.
I don't agree.
I do.
If you back down to bullies today, there's always going to be another bully tomorrow.
Most of the other bullies don't have nuclear weapons.
Oh,come on,I don't go along with that doomsday scenario.
North korea's million-man army, it's a million starving men suffering under a brutal dictatorship.
The key is china.
The ambassador warned us that beijing would not support us in an unprovoked military action, but if north korea attacks our rescue ships, unquestionably, that will be a provocation, and I'm convinced that china will be with us when we respond.
In a war with north korea?
Every year we let north korea get away with this crap, they get stronger.
In five years or ten years, they could have a missile that could hit san francisco or chicago or new york,
-for heaven sakes.
-Ma'am?
The japanese prime minister's on the line.
There's a translator in the oval.
Excuse me,everyone.
Ma'am.
mr.
Prime minister, thank you for calling again.
of course,madam president.
I understand your military leadership is doing an excellent job of coordinating our joint defense preparations.
I understand your desire to do all you can for your trapped sailors, but I assume the military preparations are cautionary.
Sir,at this point, I'm keeping all my options open.
Madam president, may I remind you that while north korean missiles probably cannot reach your country, they can easily reach mine.
I am aware of that.
There is a great deal of concern here.
The airports are growing crowded with people trying to get out of the country.
We are closing the nikkei tomorrow.
The consequences of your actions are already considerable.
We are proceeding as responsibly as possible.
I know you are, but with respect, you govern from thousands of miles away.
It is our people who would die in this war.
I know that.
Thank you.
We await your decisions.
Anything else,ma'am?
No,randy,thank you.
obviously,there are concerns, but the overwhelming response in the international community has been supportive.
Excuse me.
-Yeah?
-I just got a call from carmen tate over at the "times."Apparently, there's a report online that we've ordered an evacuation of americans in south korea?
No,there's been no such order.
You need to step on that,dan.
Got it.
Here's the communication plan gardner asked for.
Great.
Thanks.
Wait.
Hey,need another set of hands?
Yeah,six.
Dan,there's nothing on here for radio, there's no surrogate list.
Got it.
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna sit down and start typing like an intern?
It's all hands on deck.
Don't worry about it.
You have calls to make.
Thanks.
Just heard from my aunt in san diego who asked if she should buy duct tape and plastic sheeting seal her windows.
My mom's just outside portland.
She says her neighbors are saying they should stock up on iodine in case there's radiation poisoning.
Think it's gonna happen?
From the looks i'm seeing on the guys outside the cabinet room,
I'd say it's 50-50.
Hey.
Thank you.
What are you doing here?
How'd you get in?
I told them I wa the speaker's chief of staff.
Oh,you did,did you?
I know that you think i've betrayed you.
I never thought that talking to jim gardner would cause you the embarrassment that it has, and for that, I am sorry, truly,
but if we can put this behind us,
I'd like to work for you again.
Done.
Behind us.
Gone.
All morning long,I've been thinking of how much fun you were missing and how you would have loved to be in on this.
I-I love working with you.
I'm really glad you're back.
We've been talking as if it's either/or, abandon the sub or go to war.
What if we don't do either?
What if we send the rescue mission in without a battleship escort, make clear we have no plan to do anything except get the crew out?
No,no,no,no.
They shot down an unarmed plane.
For sure, they will sink the ships if they're not defended.
Is there anything we could offer the north koreans, a show of good faith?
Good faith,no.
But they could use hard currency, dollars for goods.
Are you suggesting that we pay north korea money, as in what,blackmail,ransom?
I-I was just answering the question.
Madam president, it's possible that you will have a unique opportunity to deal once and for all with a rogue nation that has plagued us for over half a century, and this is a country that's enslaved its own people,
that threatened its neighbors, threatened us.
Do you think it's appropriate for you to go to them hat in one hand and a dollar in the other and ask them for a favor?
No small favor to prevent a war.
I doubt it can work.
It's a tenet of north korean propaganda that they can defeat us in battle, and not just on the peninsula, but here in the united states.
In some ways, I think they want a war.
Owen,do you think that's true?
Do--do the north koreans want war?
No.
They want us to think they want war, but--but they know they have more to lose than we do.
They hate us, they want to humiliate us, but--but,uh, they're not suicidal.
So if we send in our rescue ships with no cover, make clear we have no intention to do anything but get our sailors out alive, will the north koreans withdraw their navy and back down?
No one can guarantee that.
The sub crew has about 17 hours of air left.
If we don't do something soon, it's gonna be too late.
Let's get the north rean rep to the U.N. In here.
I can assure you our nation has both the military power and the political will to defeat the united states in any war of aggression.
We have no intention of attacking your country.
You already have attacked our country.
Your planes have invaded our airspace.
Your nuclear submarine is in our waters.
With due respect,mr.
Nang, if the united states aacked north korea, you'd know it.
You're here because we want to do what we can to prevent that from happening.
You can prevent it very simply-- stand down your military, withdraw from our borders and return to the status quo.
South korea is already an occupied U.S. Outpost.
We won't become another.
I want to send a message to your leadership, and I hear they trust your integrity.
I'm honored to believe so.
Good.
This is the message from the united states of america-- we are going in to save the crew of the "U.S.S. Seattle."
Our rescue operation will take us slightly within your 12-mile maritime limit.
Our rescue vessels will be unarmed.
We have no intention of attacking your nation, but we will consider any aggression against our rescue as an act of war.
Your incursion into sovereign waters will,I assure you, be considered an act of war by our nation.
You shot down an american military plane.
I'm under a lot of pressure to respond.
You respect our rescue mission,
I'll let it go.
I will also guarantee your U.N. Food aid continues, and I will arrange for a payment in cash of $500 million to your country.
We'll call it
"humanitarian aid,"
but there will be no strings attached.
You're offering us
$500 million in cash?
This is not a negotiation, and we don't have time to be polite, but I believe neither of us wants a war.
Well,our leadership will be getting its own pressure toespond, to fire on your so-called rescue mission.
Tell your leadership they don't want to put me in that position.
And if they do?
We will retaliate with the full force of the united states military.
Thank you,madam president.
The north korean U.N. Rep just left.
Rod,she'd like you to join her in the oval.
Thanks.
I'll be in my office catching up on phone calls.catching up on phone calls.
All right,I let you know if she needs you.
Yep.
Mr. Speaker,would you care to join us?
Thank you.
S-so what do we do now?
We wait.
Pray they blink first.
I sat in this room with teddy bridges when we ran the raid on the khyber pass.
The waiting is the worst part.
The deciding isn't so easy,either.
Madam president, our rescue vessels are about a half hour from the 12-mile limit.
The north korean warships are lining up to meet them in battle formation.
Their orders are to keep moving,right?
Yes,ma'am.
Our guess is if anything's going to happen, they'll wait for us to cross over.
Thank you.
Please keep me posted.
Yes,ma'am.
Maybe we should say a prayer.
major businesses are closed throughout asia today, and here in south korea, local markets are emptied by people stocking up on water, canned foods and first aid supplies.
South korean and american soldiers wait by the demilitarized zone.
In the cities, the streets are empty.
Families have cleared out old bomb shelters from the cold war era that had been turned into storage units, leaving bicycles, laundry machines, file cabinets and other possessions outside, so they can huddle together inside.
Mrs. Allen.
Oh,mr.
Speaker.
Excuse me.
Everything okay?
Actually,I came down here to ask you exactly that.
Um,well,amy can't sleep, but she's going to be all right.
Sorry.
There's nothing to be done here, so I'll go.
You know what?
They've barely seen me for two days.seen me for two days.
I'll go talk to them.
"Each morning, as the sun rose from the east,
"ping and his mother and his father
"and sisters and brothers and aunts and uncles
"and his 42 cousins all"-- hey.
What are you still doing up?
I can't sleep.
I told her I'd read to her.
The news is scaring her.
Yeah,thanks,baby.
You having nightmares?
On the news,they said there might be a nuclear bomb.
Ey're talking about someplace very far away.
We're safe here.
What about the people over there?
I'm gonna do everything I can to make sure nothing bad happens,okay?
All right,try to get some sleep.
hey.
Sorry.
Vince is here.
They need you downstairs.
We'll finish putting her to bed.
Thanks,baby.
Mom... good night.
madam president, the U.N. Ambassador would like a word.
We have him on a secure line.
Where are our ships?
About to cross the 12-mile limit.
North korean warships are standing firm,ma'am.
Put him on the speaker.
Representative nang, this is president allen.
I have passed your offer along to our leadership, madam president.
They have a request.
Go ahead.
They would like you to make a public apology to our nation, acknowledge what you did wrong.
Our rescue mission proceeds without incident, you'll have your apology.
I will let them know.
Thank you,madam president.
Thank you.
What do we tell our rescue ships?
The order stands.
Ma'am,they're heading right for a north korean battle fleet.
Mae we should wait-- they have the president's orders.
I haven't heard her change them.
N.S.A. Reports intercepting new commands to the korean warships.
They're being told to give our rescue operation a 1-kilometer working area.
Getting reports from field recon.
North korean warships are moving.
Which direction?
Away.
They're backing off, letting our rescue ships in.
Once we get the ships in place, how long before we know if the rescue is working?
Well,they have to drop anchor, bring down the rescue module, and we still don't know if the hatches will open.
How long?
Six hours.
All right, let's not celebrate yet.
How long has it been?
Uh,well, it's been five minutes since the last time you asked, so I'm gonna guess six hours and ten minutes.
Water?
You should get some sleep.
At least go to the residence.
Someone'll call the minute there's news.
I know.
You're right.
I just... can't leave the desk while they're still down there.
Kids up yet?
No,just your mom.
She said she'd call when they're awake.
I keep thinking... if templeton were president right now, we might very well be at war.
Yeah,well,it's reason enough to be president right there.
Yeah.
And reason enough to run again.
madam president, they want you in the sit room.
madam president, we have a secure transmission from the "U.S.S. Brighton,"the lead rescue ship.
They've asked that we put it through when we have you in the room.
"U.S.S. Brighton," you have secure transmission with the president of the united states.
Madam president, this is captain andrew duggan of the "U.S.S. Seattle,"
radioing in to report that all classified material on our ship has been destroyed and our entire crew is now safely aboard the "U.S.S. Brighton."
It's very good to see your face, captain duggan.
It's good to be seen, madam president.
You had us a bit worried for awhile.
We knew you'd come get us.
It's an honor to serve under you,madam president.
Thank you,captain.
You tell everyone there you all have made us very proud today.
General krieger, let's turn those ships around and get our sailors home.
yeah!
Madam president... we just wanted to say... thank you for your leadership through this, and we're honored to serve under you,too.
Thank you,general.
Thank you,madam president.
Thank you.
Madam president.
I just heard.
How do you want to make the announcement?
Release the video uplink to the press.
Let them know the crew is safe, and we'll move the presidential press conference a day early, this afternoon.
Great.
Jim,I want to talk to world leaders first.
I'll set it up.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I really appreciate all your help.
It was a brilliant ploy, telling them you'd apologize.
It wasn't a ploy.
y-you're not actually going to apologize to the north koreans?
I promised I would.
With all due respect,ma'am, as a strategy, it was brilliant, but a public apology will do nothing but make you look weak.
I want them to know they can trust us.
Better they should fear us.
They already fear us.
A little trust won't hurt.
well, let's hope you're right.
I want to thank you for allowing me to be a part of this process.
Thank you.
Mr. Speaker.
Good morning.
...All classified material on our ship has been destroyed.
Our entire crew is now safely aboard the "U.S.S. Brighton."
remember how I said the president needs to do something to help clarify her image with the american people?
-Done?
-Done,and done.
Money can't buy this kind of P.R.
I mean, this is a very good day.
I mean,do you realize how good this is?
It'S... it's a good day.
Okay,then.
when our sub got into trouble, it was too close to the sovereign waters of north korea.
That was a mistake.
As commander in chief of the united states military,
I take full responsibility for that.
madam president.
Are you saying the north koreans share no blame for the escalation of the past days?
This isn't a time for blame.
It's a time for moving forward.
And in that spirit,
I would like to offer the people of north korea my personal apology for our part in this incident and my pledge to do better.
Ma'am.
Ma'am.
Roger.
Thank you,ma'am.
North korea is a totalitarian dictatorship.
They shot down an american plane.
Aren't they the ones who should be pledging to do better?
We don't see eye to eye on most issues with the north korean leaders, but today,we saw eye to eye on the most important issue-- peace.
I think we can all be proud of that.
Thank you.
madam president.
I know you all probably have two million calls each to return.
We just want to grab you for a minute.
Actually,it's more like three million, but,hey, you're the president.
Speaking of which...
I wanted to tell you all how proud I am of you, of us,of this team.
We accomplished something amazing in the last 48 hours, and I can't help but feel that there's so much more we could accomplish.
You're going to run.
I think this team deserves another four years.
at least.
absolutely.
Thank you.
When our sub got into trouble, it was too close to the sovereign waters of north korea.
That was a mistake.
As commander in chief...
I thought you were gonna go straight home.
I can't sleep when it's light out.
How was the press conference?
She's spinning it pretty well right now.
How was she in the crisis?
Well... the good news is, she did a hell of a job for the country.
What's the bad news?
The bad news is, she did a hell of a job for the country.
She's not gonna be easy to beat.
"and when the last chick was safe in its nest,
"ricky winged up into the sky where he found his friends
"waiting to take him home."
Could you read me another one?
No,but good try.
Bedtime.
Good night,baby.
Is everything really okay now?
Mm-hmm,just like the chicks in their nest, promise.
Hey.
Hey,mom.
You okay?
Yeah,I just,um...
I just wanted to tell you,um...
I'm really proud of you.
Thank you.
I'm proud of you,too, you know.
Well,it's not like i just brought us back from the brink of nuclear war.
That was pretty good, wasn't it?
Yeah,well,don't let it go to your head.
good night,mom.
Good night.
I smell cookies.
Oh,you always liked to snack after a long day.
This has been a long couple of days.
Hey!
Hands off.
I made you some hot cocoa, help you sleep.
You always had fresh cookies waiting when I got out of school.
Mmm.
You know why?
'Cause you're the best mom ever?
Well,of course,that.
You'd come home for the cookies.
Tell me about your day,
I'd have you at the table for ten minutes.
It was our special time together, every day, guaranteed.
so how was your day?
The kids were really freaked.
That for taking care of them.
We were all really freaked.
You did a wonderful job, you know.
The kids were really impressed with their mother today.
It's not me.
It's the presidency.
If the skirt fits... you want to know the truth?
It was a rush.
Being the most powerful person on earth, it's a hell of a rush.
Happy to see you're enjoying your job,dear, but you might not want to mention the
"most powerful person on earth" part to your husband.
You're probably right about that.
what have we got here?
My chocolate chip.
These are the plain.
I made some nut,but I haven't gotten them in the oven yet.
What you made is too many cookies.
I know.
THE UNIFIED SOCIALIST YOUTH (JSU) WAS CREATED ON MARCH 1936.
DURING THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR, JSU MILITANTS PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN DEFENDING THE II REPUBLIC.
WHEN THE WAR ENDED, THE YOUTH ORGANIZATION WAS MASSACRED BY THE NEW POLITICAL REGIME.
RELATIVES OF THE VICTIMS AND JSU SURVIVORS CAN NOW TELL THEIR OWN STORY.
We fought for an ideal.
We belonged to JSU.
We were socialist and communist united.
We were and we are very proud ofit and very happy because we fought for the youth.
We fought for freedom and to make the world a better place, where workers could live as they deserved.
We defended the II Republic that had been elected on 1931.
We tried to improve the II Republic.
We took a decision: in Spain, we would not allowfascism to conquer political power easily, like in the rest ofEurope.
In Spain we wouldn't wake up one day with a newpoliticaI regime that would gradually destroy democratic organizations and kill democrats.
We would reject it even with guns in our hands.
My political conscience arose during the war.
The war gave me courage, we were only fifteen but we had to fight, we had no chance.
DO NOT LET MY NAME BE FORGOTTEN
in the elections on November 19th, 1933, the CEDA (Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right) won.
On December 18th, 1933, Lerroux assumed the presidency of the government.
Lerroux's radical Party betrayed the II Republic.
He wanted to hand political power over to the CEDA in a parliamentary way.
The CEDA wasn't a christian democratic party, as some say now, but a clerical fascist party.
We thought that we had to be united, young socialists and young communists shouldn't be separated.
We had the same enemy and the same objectives: to defend freedom and not allowfascism to conquer political power easily.
In 1934, at a Socialist Youth Congress, I was elected general Secretary.
Socialist Youth decided to leave II international.
Young communists and young socialists had public meetings and we tried to reduce the gap between our positions.
In 1936, Popular Front won the elections and the two organizations joined together to create the JSU, Unified Socialist Youth.
The youth organization was born on March 1936, and very soon had more than 500,000 members.
The JSU was very important because it was an example of unity.
It had a bigger communist influence and it was a model of unity, something very difficult to obtain.
It was an example of organized and militant youth, in which participated men and women.
The organization was born with a great popular support, as we had never seen before, and was directed by very young men and women, we were twenty or twenty-one, really young.
The organization had a key role during the popular insurrection, as a response to the military coup d'état on July 17th and 18th.
Generai Francisco Franco, military chief in the Canary islands, declares a state of war on the archipelago on Juiy 18th, 1936.
From Tetuan, he commands the colonial army.
Cariist, faiangist, monarquist and popular action members will support the military uprising.
in the rebel zones, political headquarters are occupied and union members are arrested and murdered.
The war had begun, a war in which the army rose up against the people.
The JSU immediately began a general mobilization to defend the Repubiic.
The Propaganda Department began a national campaign to increase members.
Many young Spaniards went to that call.
I joined JSU in 1936.
I was very young, I joined JSU during the war when I was sixteen.
By the time I was eighteen, I was already in jail.
I joined it when JSU was created in my village.
That was in 1937, I will never forget it.
I joined JSU when I was fifteen.
I went immediately to the school ofPolitics.
We studied a lot of political books and they weren't adapted for girls of fifteen, but generally it was right.
The JSU showed us the way.
People who had studied politics taught us many things.
Martinajoined JSU on January 1937.
She worked at a workshop making overalls for militia men.
Julia Conesajoined JSU at the end of 1937.
She was sports instructor for kids and she became Secretary of Sports.
Dionisia Manzanero worked with international Red Help.
She was a humanitarian aid worker.
She worked as nurse.
Eventually, she worked with the October Battalion.
The Republic reveals a newimage of women and increases women's participation in civil society.
Women were very important in the JSU.
They reached the leadership and represented a newmodeI of women.
Men and women were political colleagues.
The JSU gave me a great knowledge.
I felt like I was older, more helpful, feeling like fighting.
It was very important, not only their political activity, but also representing a model, an example.
By that time, in republican zones, women represented a very important role, sometimes more important than men's.
Women, eventually, got some ofthe rights that today are still being demanded.
On that period, all these things were done spontaneously, with no fuss.
Women held jobs that were typically held by men, like ticket inspector, stajanovist worker.
We were very determined, resolute.
I always love knitting.
I worked at a workshop, with 100 women.
I was the manager and we knitted 50 sweaters every day.
We made a workshop.
We had sewing machines and made clothes for militia men who were fighting in the trenches.
We made overalls and that's what we did.
There were many women, many.
Some ofthem held managementjobs and many women became political leaders.
The JSU was led by many women because most ofthe men were fighting in the front lines.
War was enthusiastically taken up by people.
We defended the Republic.
We knewwe were doing everything we could.
We fought on all fronts, courageously and with great determination.
The JSU was an organization thatformed numerous battalions during the war.
The Repubiican Popuiar Army, created by Madrid's Government, and the fighting spirit of the people made possible the resistance to Franco's troops.
The republican zone began an heroic resistance.
Civii population was heavily attacked.
One day, I got really scared because I started to hear a sound.
I went out to the street, I looked up and sawa black cloud.
I said to my mother:
'Come on, lets go to the subway, there are many planes coming'.
Kids, old women, everybody went down into the shelter.
We went running across the street.
We were very scared.
'Alerta' was a branch ofthe JSU.
For example, after an air raid on Gran Via Street, people from 'Alerta' put on white coats and went out to the street and helped injured people.
Everybody cooperated.
We worked really hard and we didn't take care about bombs, we didn't think of ourselves.
We wanted to cooperate.
Once you noticed other's devotion, you also wanted to make an effort.
The resistance had a specific purpose: w II was going to break out soon and, obviously, democratic foreign powers would finally support the II Republic.
We considered the Spanish civil War as the first battle ofw II.
The main defender of the political movement of resistance was the sociaiistJuan Negrín.
He was elected President of the Government on May, 1937.
Due to Negrin's view, in my opinion a great statesman, internal differences ofthe Republican Sector could be solved.
The slogan 'To resist is to win' made possible, after spring 1937, the continuity ofthe war.
NegrÍn was accused of being a cryptocommunist.
NegrÍn was a center socialist.
He assumed with a lot of courage and resolution the task of defending the Republic until the end, without surrender.
He was supported by the Communist Party and the JSU.
On March 5, 1939, Negrin's strategy was ruined.
Coionei Segismundo Casado constituted a Defence Nationai Council to negotiate peace.
The Republic suffered a second coup d'etat.
Inside the Regular Popular Army there was a right liberal sector, and during the war, they wanted to come to an agreement with the opponent.
They had built up hopes of negotiating peace with Franco.
The fact is that there wasn't any possibility of negotiating a peace agreement.
Franco's victory meant the destruction of republicans, socialists,...
JSU militants were mobilized to try to quash the uprising right inside the civil War and inside the republican rear.
It was a dramatic situation, because those units were fighting against the cabinet that had betrayed the resistance, but behind them were Franco's troops, surrounding Madrid.
Inside the JSU, we agreed to go to every village to spread the slogan 'It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.
We don't have to give up'.
When we were at Chinchón, a tall man, he looked like a truck driver or something, came and told everybody that Franco's troops had reached Madrid and that the situation was really bad.
He said to me: 'I'm going by truck, if you want I'll take you'.
That man was really worried.
I asked him many things and he answered 'Yes, no, yes, no'.
He was very worried and when we arrived to Goya Street, at the cross-roads, he said to me 'Good luck, baby.
Good bye'.
We knewthat as soon as they reached Madrid, they would destroy it, and that's what they did.
I arrived home, and soon afterward, my father came.
I asked him: 'Dad, why don't you run away?
'
And he said: 'Because they have put up posters informing that people without blood on their hands will be safe, and I am that kind, so I'm not going'.
And I said: 'Come on, Dad, you told me four days ago they had done terrible things, they had killed the poet.
And he told me: 'That's true, but that things only happened at the beginning'.
And I said: 'Come on, Dad.
Nowyou are on time.
Nowyou are on time.
Go'.
But he didn't.
It was terrible.
Families were crying.
All was terror.
You couldn't defend yourself.
It was terrible.
The rebel soldiers had committed the highest crime a soldier can commit: sedition.
That crime is penalized with death, according with the Code ofMilitary Justice.
The rebels had to legalise this coup d'etat and they began to legislate without any authority.
They reinterpreted the Code ofMilitary Justice on their favour, and they created legislative instruments to apply the Code ofMilitary Justice to civil people.
They redefined some ofthe crimes, for example, the crime of military rebellion.
They were the rebels, but they blamed the loyalist people.
They sentenced to death, to life imprisonment, and they judged by action or omission.
If somebody said: 'I didn't knowanything, I didn't make anything'.
'That's why I judge you, because you didn't make anything'.
Franco wanted to destroy the 'reds' in this country.
And when I say 'reds', I'm meaning the democrats, the liberals.
He wanted to destroy the memories ofthe days when Spain was a free country.
I belonged to a Socialist Circle.
We were very young, sixteen years old.
I was arrested because I had a socialist card.
I couldn't be accused of anything.
Something terrible happened in Madrid, and in the rest of Spain.
Anybody could bring charges against you and you can be executed for this.
When the war ended, my mother and my father were arrested.
My father belonged to the UGT Union but my mother wasn't a militant.
She was against war, she hated executions.
It was said that she belonged to the JSU, but that was not true, I could swear it.
The point of viewof the repression is very big.
The purpose ofthe repression is passivity, subjugation.
civil people are condemned for belonging to a union or a political party, or for being in favour ofthe Republic.
The experience has showed that fascism wanted to destroy political parties, people, races.
It was impossible to reach a peace agreement with fascism.
The post-war period was worse than war.
When Franco reached the power, the money ofthe Republic was useless.
We couldn't buy food, we couldn't buy bread in the black market because we have no money.
We were hungrier than in jail.
Property expropriation was permitted and thousand of families were condemned to live in extreme poverty.
That was an humiliation.
Repression instruments were very precise.
In 1939, according to official reports, 280,000 people were in jail for political reasons.
The most important leaders of the JSU were in jail since March, 1939.
The organization was almost dismantled.
Courage ofJSU militants was the only thing that could save the organization.
If you want to create an underground structure, which is very difficult, you have to concentrate efforts and we concentrated efforts on creating an underground communist party.
JSU militants were very young and they were going to live longer and cause trouble to Franco in the future.
Short, medium and long term.
The JSU was a challenge.
Those who didn t submit to Franco s regime were enemies and the JSU was one ofthese enemies.
Most ofthe men were on exile, in concentration camps or in jail.
Women and young people made support work.
We wanted to reorganize the JSU to keep fighting.
We wanted to collect money to help prisoners, to free them, and I wanted to free my brother too, but we couldn't.
We agreed to meet at angel Square at 7:00 p. m.
We arrived there, shook hands, and in a second, we were surrounded by the police.
We wanted to reorganize the JSU, but we didn't have enough time.
People were arrested I don't knowhow.
People try to hide themselves, but they find them anyway.
JSU Militants had to reorganize the JSU in very dangerous conditions.
Madrid was a sad and reserved city.
Nobody dared to look in the face.
At the subway, everybody was crestfallen.
The attempts of reorganization were neutralized by the new regime.
A lot of people were arrested.
Each person arrested was tortured and often betrayed other members.
So, the organization fell like a domino.
I was arrested because I was betrayed by a comrade working underground.
He was arrested and taken to the basement ofthe police headquarters' building.
He was tortured and spoke.
Mine was one ofthe names he gave and the police came for me to my house.
I was home and someone knocked and it was the police.
Two young men showed me the badge and asked for Maruja.
I said: 'Please tell me the surname, there are lots ofMarujas'.
And they told me my surnames.
They asked me where my room was.
They searched it but didn t find anything and they took me to the police station.
We went by streetcar and they didn't want to pay so they showed the badge and said they were on duty.
Some ladies said: 'Oh, look, she is only a girl'.
Prisoners were taken to the streets, the police set a trap to see ifthey met anybody.
They were followed by the police.
I was arrested this way, because I met a comrade.
The police was with him, and he knew, but I didn't.
I sawhim and went to say hello.
Then I went to send a letter but I couldn't.
A police came and showed me the badge.
The police was an instrument of repression.
The origin was an inquisitorial mentality.
Everybody was very scared because anyone could press charges against you, and this could lead to death.
Julia Conesa was arrested because someone made a formal complaint on May 4th, 1939.
On May 6th, two falangist came to her home and took her away.
They said that it wasjust a formality, that nobody should worry about Julia, she was going to be back in a fewhours, but Julia never came back home.
A group of men came to our home, they said they were police and told my grandfather that they wanted to talk to Dionisia Manzanero.
My grandfather opened the door and said that Dionisia wasn't home but, they insisted.
Dioni came out and said:
'Father, they are asking for me.
Let me go with them'.
Dioni never came back home.
On May 12th, they burst into my great grandparent's house.
They made a lot of noise.
They kicked the door down and went into the bedroom where the girls were sleeping.
The girls were crying, they messed up everything.
They broke a lot ofthings.
They took away all the pictures, they took away everything.
They said to my grandmother: 'We are going to destroy everything'.
And that's what they did.
in Madrid there were many raids.
The identification and detention ofJSU militants was carried out by spies infiltrated in the organization during the war.
Roberto Conesa was one of them: he became a famous police inspector of Franco's police, but he had begun his career as a JSU militant.
Roberto Conesa came very often to the JSU head office, every week.
He was a spy and nowI understand why he didn't go to Santiago's office or to the men's office.
He always came to my office.
Roberto Conesa occupied an important position in Franco's police and in the first years of democracy, but he began his police career by betraying his own comrades.
At 3:00 a. m, my sister and I began to hear noises in the caretaker s yard.
We heard doors opening.
I told my sister: 'I think it is the police'.
And she said: 'No'.
And I said: 'Yes'.
So, we leant out ofthe rear window, over the caretaker's yard, with the lights out, and I sawa tall man, watching the house, and I said to my sister, who knewhim too: 'He is Conesa, the man standing there is Conesa'.
A little bit later, they knocked the door and came into the house.
They said: 'Get dressed!
', but they didn't get out ofthe room.
I said: 'Could you leave the room, please?
' and they said 'Get dressed!
'
So we got dressed, they put us in a car and took us to the police station at 5 Jorge Juan Street.
in the summer of 1939, thousand of young girls were arrested in Madrid.
On those days, the girls went through hell.
The state of Franco began to sow the terror.
These actions where made in order to control people under the power ofthe Generalisimo: Head ofthe State, Head ofthe Government and Head ofthe Army, an omnipotent and omniscient man.
Franco wanted to control the will ofthe people.
I think Franco wanted to punish the revolutionary youth ofMadrid, because during three years, they didn't allow him enter the city.
We were interrogated at the police station.
I was asked first, they asked me ifI was a member ofthe JSU.
And I said: 'Yes, sir, I was a member ofthe JSU'.
And they slapped my face and I fell to the floor.
Those days were terrible.
I missed my family, my mother and I couldn't tell them I was arrested.
The next day, we were interrogated again.
They asked the same question again and again, every fifteen minutes.
They asked me who was the link between the Party and the Youth and what information did he have.
They told me to sign at the bottom ofthe sheet but I didn't, I signed just under my statement and they told me I was very astute, clever.
Four or five days later, we began to hear shouts.
And we thought: 'They have already begun torturing'.
And that was very demoralizing.
They applied electric current to Martina's hands.
She had stiffhands, black nails.
Her clothes were bloodstained and my mother washed them before my grandmother noticed it, so my grandmother didn't know what was really happening, but she was tortured.
They have everything on the table: castor oil, electric current, a whip for beating people.
Everything was ready.
They really liked my hair and they said: 'We are going to shave her hair.
She is going to be very pretty'.
And that's what they did.
When they finished, I was prettier.
They cut my hair, and every time they cut a curl, I had very curly hair, they said: 'Are you sad about this little curl?
'
They treated us very bad at the police station.
They beat us.
Many humiliations
The haircut, the castor oil, was an humiliation.
Your sister, your mother, your daughter.
Although you were in jail, that was not enough, all your relatives had to make amends for your wrongdoings.
You have to have a strong spirit, and dignity, and never give up.
Howcould I resist?
I don't know, I was thinking about my mother all the time.
If my mother knew what I was suffering.
Women, in civil wars, suffer a lot, even more than men.
Franco's regime wanted to destroy the female spirit of freedom created by the Republic.
Franco did as much as he could to destroy it.
I went to prison on June 19, 1939.
I was in prison for sixteen years and I lost the best years of my life, of my youth.
I was nineteen years old when I came into and thirty six when I left.
The prison of Ventas in Madrid began to be built at the end of 1931, following the instructions of Victoria Kent, Generai Director of Prisons at the time.
Victoria Kent wanted to rehabilitate prisoners, but Franco's regime didn't want to rehabilitate, Franco's regime wanted to inflict pain, to punish.
When I arrived to Ventas Prison, I fell to pieces.
When I sawthe door ofthe prison, I was only fifteen, it reminded me ofthe tales my grandmother used to tell me.
The prison was big, but full of people.
We slept in the yards on thin mattresses our families sent us.
until my mother got me one, I slept on the floor on a blanket.
There were twelve, thirteen and even fourteen women in each cell.
All the galleries were full of people, the leisure rooms were full.
There were women with bedrolls everywhere.
I was really shocked.
We don't knowthe exact date when Dioni came into prison.
According with Dioni's letters, it was between the 20th an the 25th May, 1939.
At the beginning, Julia was quite good, but my grandmother and my great grandmother told me that, very soon, she began to turn pale, emaciated.
12,000 people spread out in toilets, showers, downstairs, yards.
Horrible, horrible, horrible!
I was in a corner, covered by a blanket, and a prisoner told me: 'Get your head out ofthere!
The bugs will bite you!
'
I was inexperienced.
I got my head out, but the bugs bit me on my feet.
While I was walking I stepped on legs and they told me:
'Fellow, be careful!
'
And I was laughing and crying at the same time.
I fell to pieces.
I hadn't cried up till then, but that day, I fell to pieces.
At the end ofthe war, the prison was an anthill.
That caused psychological and health problems.
Besides, the food was really bad.
We were isolated for one month, and we had to shut our eyes to eat the food.
There were so many bugs in the food, that we couldn't remove them.
On Christmas Eve we ate a boiled potato.
At the beginning, every 24 hours.
We ate Negrin's lentils.
We said: 'We were eating our lentils'.
A lot oflentils were left over and lentils stocks were in warehouses.
Nobody washed the lentils.
You could find everything:
stones, sticks.
It was disgusting.
The aluminium plate had a black edge, revolting, repulsive.
But we had to eat it because we had only one meal a day.
The Catholic Church was very important to Franco's regime.
Members of religious orders worked in prisons.
The church also handed over buildings, first for free and later in exchange for money, to be used as prisons.
Generally, the nuns behaved very bad and because ofthat many people lost their faith.
There was a warder called 'Miss Poison', who slapped your face every time she met you.
She did it because she felt like it, because you were 'red', that's what she said.
I didn't want to pray because I had lost my faith.
I used to fall asleep while praying, and nowI couldn't, and I thought: 'What could I do?
'
And I said to myself:
'Multiplication table'.
2x1=2, 2x2=4, 2x3=6.
And I began to fall asleep again.
Franco's regime proclaimed that republicanism and atheism were the same thing.
There were a lot of republicans that had a religious belief but Franco tried to monopolize the religious faith.
The Catholic Church wanted to coerce and humiliate republican prisoners until the end.
Two or three days later, we were distributed across the prison: some in the cells, others in the galleries, in the toilets.
We were taken to Santa MarÍa school, because we were minors.
The department of minors had some advantages, for example the girls had more space.
The girls had visitors every fifteen days.
They were given clean clothes and they could talk to their families for ten minutes.
There was a prisoner, Miss MarÍa, who was a teacher.
She taught us many things but she wasn't a Government employee, she was a prisoner.
I couldn't take lessons because I had to crochet.
My mother sold my works on the streets to get some money to eat.
The Department ofMinors was in the upper floor.
It could hold up to sixty girls.
The minors couldn't leave the department, so they couldn't be connected with the other prisoners.
We weren't allowto leave the Department ofMinors, but as soon as we could, we run away and joined the rest ofthe prison population.
We looked for our friends, family.
Each girl was on a different cell but they got together and sang funny songs.
There is a basement in Ventas Prison and inside the basement there are some girls who laugh at everything.
The bell rang at six o'ciock in the morning and the girls didn't want to get up because they laugh at Faiange.
Franco's little soldiers take advantage of the situation and shoot the minors of the prison.
Fortunately, most of us were political prisoners.
We were members ofthe JSU and very closed to each other and we helped each other a lot.
Some girls didn't have anybody to bring them food to the prison and we shared our food with them.
People were very supportive, for example, some didn't have money money to buy stamps and they couldn't write to their families, then the JSU was there, but in a silent way, to help these people.
The JSU militants were in prison, waiting for trial.
The days passed monotonous.
They didn't know that a crime was going to be committed, and this fact would change their lives forever.
On Juiy 29, 1939, the major of the Civii Guard isaac Gabaidón were travelling by car along the Extremadura road with his daughter, towards Taiavera de ia Reina.
At Km 131, the car was assaulted by a group of men who opened fire and shot the passengers.
in the terrorist attack died isaac Gabaidón, his fifteen years oid daughter Piiar, and the driver agent, Luis Díaz Madrigai.
The triple murder was hardly investigated.
Franco's regime accused the JSU militants, although they were in prison for a long time before the incident.
We didn't know anything about Gabaldón, but the police asked us again and again what we knew about Gabaldón's murder.
We didn't knowanything.
isaac Gabaidón was the chief of the intelligence Service.
He had to watch over the masonry and communism files.
These files contained the names of masons and communists.
Some ofthe officers ofFranco were masons and they were high-ranking officers.
Gabaldón wanted to reveal the truth.
Gabaidón had a blacklist.
This was a threat to his own colleagues.
The family of Gabaldón never believed the official version.
They thought Gabaldón hadn't been murdered by JSU militants, they thought that Gabaldón had been murdered by the Intelligence Service ofFranco's Government.
JSU militants were accused of murdering Gabaldón, but in fact it could be a Government conspiracy.
A confession had to be obtained to close the case.
They took me down to the basement, they undressed me.
Afterwards, I began to do exercises to warm up.
They sawme, they went down and told:
me 'Are you cold?
'
I said: 'A little bit'.
And they told me:
'Don't worry, you'll warm up'.
They started to beat me, and they told me: 'You have to say this'.
I told them: 'I can't say this, I don't knowanything'.
At twelve o'clock at night, they told me: 'You haven't talked yet, but you will.
You'll see where we are going'.
They put me into a car and they took the east road to the cemetery.
They took me out ofthe car and put me against the wall.
They told me: 'Do you see all these holes?
These are your friend's holes and the next one is going to be yours'.
I told them that I didn't care.
I started thinking about how my mother would suffer.
I didn't think anything else.
I don't knowhowlong I was there.
Afterwards, they told me that I had to talk and they took me to Ventas Prison...
I was confined to a punishment cell until the trial.
Without any proof or evidences, hundreds ofJSU militants were judged for the murder of Gabaidón in military courts.
My charges were read and death penalty was asked.
You couldn't say anything.
Everybody was sentenced to death.
One hundred and sixty-four people were arrested for the murder of Gabaldón in Madrid and Talavera.
Most ofthem were sentenced to death and executed.
One of the most cruel trials took place on August 3, 1939, at the Saiesas of Madrid.
Fifty seven young men and women were sentenced to death and executed.
Thirteen were women and seven were minors.
From then on, they were known as 'the thirteen roses'.
Officiaiiy they were accused of committing sabotage.
Some as organizers, others as links.
Dioni was accused ofbeing the link between the Secretary of the Communist Party of Spain and the district of Cuatro Caminos.
Julia Conesa was accused of being a member ofthe JSU and working as sports secretary.
She also was accused of sabotage and for working as streetcar conductress.
So, she was sentenced to death just for working.
I don't knowwhy they were found guilty.
I can't understand it.
They were only eighteen or twenty and they hadn't done anything wrong during the war.
Why were they sentenced to death?
Because they were members ofthe JSU.
They wanted to punish the JSU as a reprisal for the murder of Gabaldón.
My aunt was already arrested when Gabaldón was murdered.
They were innocent.
It was a revenge.
The thirteen roses case showed that Franco's regime was implacable.
Peopie were sentenced to death although they were minors.
The trial of the thirteen roses, one of the most abominable incidents of the post-war period, remains as an indelible imprint in the memories of their prison mates.
Three ofthe thirteen roses were in the Department ofMinors: Victorita Muñoz, Anita López y Martina Barroso.
They were also members ofthe Communist Party.
In the cell beside me, I was in cell number 6, so they were in cell number 7, lived Julia Conesa, she was very nice, talkative, and Virtudes González.
Virtudes was very young.
I have heard she was nineteen years old.
By that time, it was said she was seventeen, and she didn't look older.
These women occupied secondary posts in the JSU.
Franco would have loved to hold a public trial ofDolores Ibárruri or manuel Azaña, but he couldn't, although he tried it hard.
The thirteen roses became the scapegoat.
The evening after the trial, Virtudes (one of the thirteen roses), came at the Department ofMinors.
She told me: 'We are sentenced to death'.
She started talking about politics and the hard times we've been through.
She said that only w II could save us.
She told me: 'Remember, unity is the most important thing.
You will have to fight for it, the unity ofthe party and the unity ofthe working class.
But baby, don't be hopeful.
They will not commute the death penalty'.
On August 5th, 1939, was the execution, only forty-eight hours after the judge passed sentence.
In 1939, in Spanish prisons, prisoners condemned to death were mixed with the rest ofthe prisioners.
Ventas prison wasn't an exception.
The women imprisoned experienced together, what in those days was known as a 'saca' night.
A 'saca' was when prisoners condemned to death were called and taken out of prison to go to the execution place.
The 'sacas' undermined the moral ofthe women prisoners, because they could see with their own eyes, howtheir friends went to death.
On August 4, at night, we went to bed like any other night.
I had my bedroll beside Victorita and we fell asleep.
I heard a strange noise.
Every night the doors were closed.
I heard a strange noise.
I sat up and saw something like a lantern and I saw some ofthe prison warders.
Victoria sat as well, and told me: 'What's going on?
'
And I asked: 'I don't know.
And then she took her dress from the ground and I took mine and we stood up.
Victoria hugged me tight and told me: 'Mary, Mary I'm going to be killed!
My brother was already killed, my poor mother!
I'm going to be killed!
'
I wanted to take her hands in mine but I couldn't.
I couldn't talk either.
Meanwhile Anita and Martina came to us and Anita said:
'Victoria, you have to be brave'.
And Victoria released her hands from me and left us.
Martina turned to me and said: 'Mª Carmen, put your papers in order, otherwise, they will kill you too'.
The doors were opened and shortly after everybody went to the cells to see what was happening.
It was very crowded because everybody knewthat they were going to take the minors out.
I stood between two cells.
I was still.
I heard talking in one ofthe cells, but didn't dare to come in.
They were dressing Virtudes, because she couldn't dress herself.
She was shattered.
She wore a black suit and was very pretty.
Julia told her: 'You are very pretty'.
This woman looked like death.
I remember her white lips, very white.
It seemed she couldn't say a word.
Even though, she moved her lips to say: 'Please, tell my mother I'm innocent'.
After this, Julia pushed her carefully and they began to walk towards the exit door, surrounded by their prison mates.
They left this way.
I didn't understand anything, I couldn't talk, I couldn't shout, I didn't see what the others were doing, what the professors were doing.
Suddenly, I fell on my knees and somebody else fell on her knees as well, and the only thing I knewis that Victorita left the room, whit her ringlets hanging down and her head low.
I have a very, very bitter memory ofthat.
The convicts were taken to the chapel of the prison, where they wrote their last will.
We found Dioni's letters by chance.
The letters were hidden in my grandparent's house and it was terrible to read what had happened, written by her own hand.
Dear parents, brothers and sisters.
Don't be worried.
Keep serenity and calm until the end.
Piease, don't cry.
i don'tfeei nervous or scared.
i am calm, controlled.
i'm not a criminal nor a thief.
i sacrifice my life for an ideal.
Lots of kisses of your innocent daughter and sister.
Dioni.
Honestly, I'm not able to read my mother's last letter, and even after years I burst out crying.
I feel a lump in my throat and my son feels the same way, because it is a very hard and sentimental letter.
Dear son, i will die with my head held high.
i only ask you to love everybody and don't bear a grudge against the murderers of your parents.
You have to be a hard-working and good man, like your father.
An eternal kiss from your mother Bianca to you.
Julia's last letter is full ofhumanity.
It's really surprising that she is still worrying about her family, instead of saying 'howcrueI and unfair is the world with me, I haven't done anything wrong'.
An innocent will be killed and i will die as an innocent woman.
Mother, i will meet my Dad and sister in heaven butyou have to know that i'm a honest person.
Do not let my name be forgotten.
Everything was ready outside the prison.
The Security Forces were waiting for the thirteen girls to take them to the East Cemetery, the place of the executions.
All prisoners were in silence.
The only thing we heard was the engine of a van, but over that sound we began to hear a voice singing the Young Guard hymn.
She began to sing:
'We are the Young Guard who forges the future'.
The Young Guard is the hymn ofthe youth, the hymn ofthe JSU.
'We are the Young Guard, the red flower ofthe nation the extreme poverty tempered us we are the work in progress.
It is noble to free people from slavery.
Maybe the road has to be irrigated with the blood ofthe youth'.
I had sworn it was Julia Conesa's voice, but immediately, the voices ofthe others also began to sing.
They arrived to the East Cemetery, singing the Young Guard hymn.
We are the Young Guard who forges the future.
The extreme poverty tempered us.
We will win or die.
As days passed, we didn't feel like talking, we looked each other, said short words, were always crying, always crying.
Everything happened exactly as I have told you.
There was a lot of fear and sadness.
We were all crying and hugging each other.
We missed friends who had been killed last night.
We didn't knowwhat would happen to us.
I am alive but they kept killing people.
We were shattered, shattered.
Pain, pain, pain.
We couldn't even talk.
Executions were very distressing to us.
At this time, we suffered more because they were very young.
Julia Conesa's family found out that Julia had been executed when her mother went to Ventas Prison to obtain a pardon application and was told that it wasn't necessary because she had been killed this morning.
Martina's sister went to the prison to bring food and clean clothes to her sister.
When she arrived she was told that her sister wasn't there and wasn't going to need those things anymore.
An of course, she was at the cemetery.
When she found her sister, she wanted to bury her but was told that if she didn't go away she would be killed too.
The only consolation for the family, after such an unfair death, is to take some flowers to Julia's grave and talk to her as if she was alive, but we were not allowed to do that.
These girls were from Madrid.
I had met them and I had worked with them during the war.
They were very young, girls.
Their execution was a big shock for me.
I feel sorrowfor those boys and girls that I have met when I was young, and who were unfairly executed.
The case was fully reported in the Spanish newspapers as a punishment and as a warning, but it wasn't said that were executed thirteen women, seven ofthem minors.
The case ofthe 'thirteen roses' was also reported in the international press, so Franco's regime didn't execute minors again.
It was a big shock to be absolved because I was sure I was going to be executed.
I heard 'Concepción Carretero: absolved' and the rest of my friends were sentenced thirty, twenty and twelve years imprisonment.
I wasjudged and sentenced to twelve years and a day imprisonment but I was released after three years.
I was in prison for one year and fifteen days.
I was released without a trial but during two years I had to go to the police station every fifteen days.
I was in prison for sixteen years but I don't care, the past is past.
I recovered my freedom just in time to have two children.
I was afraid I couldn't have a baby but, in the end, I had two wonderful children.
I was in prison for three years.
I was in four different prisons.
I was given parole for thirteen years and I had to go to the police station every fifteen days.
I said I would survive and I'm surviving.
Previously on ER:
Glass of wine and a hot bath at the end of the day helps.
Hmm, it sounds good to me.
...our water bill 'cause I need to...
- Do you live with someone?
- We love you.
- I can't do this anymore.
- There's a little girl.
Curtis Ames.
He was a patient of mine.
He followed my wife and child to the park.
Help me protect my family.
My mom used to put it in a trash bag.
Chicken broth and a can of Crisco.
Yikes.
Grill it on the barbecue.
You'll never go back.
I read that brining keeps the juices in.
Hey, did you remember to take the giblets out of the marinade?
- Take what out of what?
- C-spine is clear.
Well, we should at least try to pull off the gravy.
All right, sir, I'm gonna take this collar off.
Let us know if anything hurts, okay?
Deep fried turkey is a religious experience.
- Gross.
- You'd rather cook it in a trash bag?
Americans, so sentimental about their holidays.
This from the guy that celebrates Croatian Independence,
Croatian State Day and something called Patriotic Gratitude Day.
- Oh, no.
- What?
I have ten minutes left in my shift and the transport pager goes off.
- I'll go.
- No, you can't.
You're an intern.
Maybe the dispatcher just wants to say "Happy Thanksgiving."
Yeah, right, I'm sure that's what it is.
- Jane?
Jane!
- Abby.
You're supposed to carry the transport pager overnight, right?
- Uh, yeah.
- Well, it just went off, and I was thinking maybe you could just take it?
- Mmm... no.
- No?
Come on.
Why not?
Five more minutes, it would've been your call anyway.
Sorry, Abby, it just doesn't really work that way.
What way?
Well, if the pager goes off during your shift, then you have to go.
Yeah, but I just want to spend Thanksgiving with my kid.
You know, it's like that story with the guy who's hunting dinosaurs and he strays off the path and steps on a butterfly and then everything in the future's ever so
- slightly different.
- What?
It's bad karma to mess with the universal order of things.
Erase unicycle man.
He can go.
- Ray.
- Yeah?
- Take this run, I'll owe you big time.
- Ooh, I'd love to.
- Great.
- I can't.
Pratt thinks I'm losing too much ER time.
He banned me from transports.
Well, I just like having you near me, Ray.
Surprise, surprise-- you all get me instead of Morris tonight.
He begged me to switch so he could spend time with his kids.
That's why I'm here.
What's your excuse?
Henry went to Orlando with his grandparents.
I figured I might as well come in.
Oh.
I love working on Thanksgiving.
Everybody's at home eating and watching football, even the freaks.
Ah, the great American tradition of sanctioned gluttony.
No, thanks.
I'm not trying to block the run,
I'm just asking does a garden variety MI really need a doc on board?
Miss Lulu Davis, age 12, vomiting and abdominal pain times two hours.
- Hi, I'm Dr. Figler.
- Hey, Lulu.
We'll take care of you.
I got this.
- Oh, I got here first.
- Yeah, but I'm good with kids.
- Are you saying that I'm not?
- No, hold on.
Wait a minute.
H-H-Hold on a second.
Lulu, are you okay?
Oops.
Cranberries.
Sorry, Jane.
Karma sucks.
Three hours at 450.
- And don't forget to baste.
- How often?
I don't know.
30 minutes?
I don't know.
I'll probably be home in time to mash the potatoes.
- Okay, what do I do with the pumpkin?
- Oh...
I forgot about the pie.
- Dr. Kovac, you got a minute?
- Uh, yeah, just a second.
I thought pumpkins were only for Halloween.
You know what, screw the pie.
I never really liked pumpkins anyway.
Are you sure you just don't want to order Chinese?
But baste, remember to baste!
I went to see your guy, Curtis Ames, yesterday.
He didn't know anything about any kid's toy.
Did he admit to following them to the park?
He didn't know what I was talking about.
Look, the guy's had a pretty tough time at things.
You know, he's barely getting by.
Okay, I realize that, but that's no excuse for messing with my family.
If you want my opinion, he's too busy trying to feed and clothe himself to mess with anyone, Doc.
Right.
- You get airsick?
- No.
Claustrophobic?
Maybe you should just tell me about the patient.
88-year-old female, anterior MI.
I can't tell you how many docs think they can handle this,
- then freak out at altitude.
- I work in an ER.
- It's pretty hard to freak me out.
- You do okay with heights, honey?
Loud noises?
Yeah, but mice make me jump on a chair and say, "Eek."
Danny!
Meet Dr. Lockhart!
- Hi!
- Sit!
Don't stand.
Don't disembark till we tell you to.
Keep your headset and your seatbelt on at all times.
If you need to speak to us, slide this switch this way to activate the intercom.
Do not press that button.
That transmits over the radio.
This baby is tight.
Excuse me?
First night out after two months of upgrades.
Satellite phone, GPS, new hoist.
All the cool toys.
I'm Jasper.
This is Evan.
Hey.
What'd you say your name was?
- Abby.
- Abby.
# Come fly with me #
# Let's float down to Peru #
# In llama land # # There's a one-man band #
# And he'll toot his flute for you #
# Come fly with me, Abby #
# Let's take off In the blue #
Does it hurt when I press or when I let go?
About the same.
- I'm thirsty.
- Too bad.
You're NPO.
- What's that?
- "Nil per os." Nothing by mouth.
Food or liquids may exacerbate or complicate an obstruction, volvulus or inflammation.
Not to mention increased aspiration risk during intubation should you be going to the OR tonight.
Um...
I'm sorry I threw up on you.
Oh, I don't mind the fact that I had to take a shower to get the chunks out of my hair.
I just honestly don't know how I'm gonna survive a whole shift dressed like this.
Hey, Lulu, I'm gonna order up a few tests to see what's going on in there, okay?
I mean, bunnies, puppy dogs-- I'm like breaking out in hives.
Jane, why don't you let me take it from here.
- Your parents are on their way, right?
- Uh, yeah, definitely.
I think it's hip.
I think it's fetishy.
I think you totally pull it off.
Shut up, Gates.
Hey, Sam, I need a CBC on the little girl in two.
And order up an extra red top if you can just in case the blood bank needs it.
- Got it.
- Hey, Alex.
Don't ya have anything better to do than hangout with a bunch of losers like us on Thanksgiving?
If he stayed at home, he'd play video games all night, so
I figured I'd bring him in here and make him do a little community service.
That's cool, man.
Yeah, handing out cookies to sick people.
That's really cool.
Hey, it could be worse.
You could be one of those sick people.
Four pages in the last 20 minutes?
- What's the crisis, Dr. Gates?
- Oh, no crisis.
It's just an incarcerated hernia, a gluteal abscess, road rash that needs skin grafting, an imbedded drill bit, rule-out appy on a 12-year-old girl.
- You're making this up.
- I wish I were.
You're sure it's not just an excuse to keep me down here?
Oh, please, I would never dream of wasting your time like that.
But really... must you look so hot all the time?
I mean, even in that ridiculous hat, I can't concentrate.
- I can't even talk.
- You know, enough of this harassment.
I have work to do.
Are you the team from County?
Yeah.
Watch it.
Watch it.
Hi, I'm Dr. Lockhart.
Mom was fine, cooked a 20-pound turkey.
She carved it and then she just collapsed.
- We thought she was kidding around.
- But then we couldn't wake her up.
- That must've been scary.
- Get the history later.
- You guys stay out here.
- We need to examine your mother.
Excuse me, I'm looking for a patient, Elizabeth Timmons.
Thank heavens.
This way.
You didn't say anything about her being intubated.
- They never tell the whole story.
- Vitals?
- Tachy to 124, sat 92.
- You got a BP?
Last one was 74/38 on dopa.
- Great.
What about an EKG?
- Right here.
- Dr. Russo, thanks for coming.
- Abby Lockhart.
This place gets really backed up when we have a patient like this.
- Sat's 82.
- She's tombstoning.
- What about thrombolytics?
- Already gave it, no response.
Okay, okay.
I'm sorry.
Can we have a reality check here?
Does this family know how sick she is?
They know she's having a heart attack.
Do they know that she's not breathing and her blood pressure sucks and she's probably not perfusing her brain enough?
I mean, we can't move her.
- She's unstable.
- The family wants her out of here.
- She won't make the trip.
- You don't know that.
If she survives the helicopter, she will probably die before the family makes it to County.
- What's your point?
- Well... she's 88 years old.
She's not coming back from this.
Don't you think dying here with her loved ones is better than dying alone in the ICU at County?
Listen, Doctor.
Our job is to scoop and run.
The longer we stay and jaw about it, the more unstable this little lady's gonna get.
All right, you know what, just give me five minutes.
I'm gonna make sure they understand.
52 years, rain or shine.
He drives me around the lake on a tandem bike after Thanksgiving.
Ah, isn't that sweet.
You're blind, Mr. Hunter.
Maybe you should let her drive.
Oh, that wouldn't work at all.
I can't carry a tune.
He drives, I sing.
It's tradition.
Send him to radiology and call me hen the films get back.
Ray, help.
I need an order for sumatriptan.
- Migraines?
- I get one every Thanksgiving.
- It's the stuffing.
- Okay, 20 milligrams intranasally.
Then why do you eat it?
Because it's amazing.
Mom makes it with bacon and almonds.
Lands me in the hospital every Thanksgiving.
Hmm, but it's worth it.
I'll be right back with your medicine.
Holidays weird me out.
The special foods, the little rituals.
- It's not my thing.
- Yeah, when I was a kid, Thanksgiving was just an excuse to stay home all day and watch TV.
I always figured when I grew up and had kids of my own,
I'd do the whole family thing, a big banquet, but you know, here we are, just me and Alex, hanging out in the hospital.
Didn't your parents demand you come home for the holiday?
Nah, my mom's in Trinidad with her new boyfriend and my dad's never even heard of a home-cooked meal, so...
Ah, well.
At least you got something hot waiting for you at home.
What?
Missing your cell phone perhaps?
What?
Yeah, how did you...
Hematology needed you, so we called your cell phone and you will never guess who answered.
Surgical med student Katey Alvaro.
- Oh, well, we were studying.
- Right.
I mean, well, she couldn't talk 'cause she was baking you something.
A little treat.
Any chance you could be wrong about this?
Well, y-yes, but I just- based on my experience...
- Well, which is it?
First, you tell us that he won't survive the trip and now you say that you might be wrong.
I know this is hard.
I'm sorry.
- I just think it's important that you take...
- Time's up.
Let's go.
- All right, just wait.
- Find the clerk, sign the consent.
- We'll be at County in 45 minutes.
- But she just said that we should think...
It's your mom's only chance.
Okay.
Uh, take her.
Come on.
She is going to die.
Yeah, and I'm doing my best to facilitate a good death for her.
- That's not your job.
- Not your call.
Here's how it works.
The referring hospital refers and the accepting hospital accepts and we're just the deliverymen.
- Sorry, delivery people.
- You're denying the responsibility
- that comes with your job.
- I'm not the one who's in denial here.
Good death?
No such thing, babe.
If you think you can make this a good experience for that family, you're even more arrogant than I thought.
Mom, if you can hear me, we'll see you in Chicago.
Okay?
Hey, in a few weeks, you're gonna be a great-grandmother.
Everyone stay back.
God bless you, Dr. Lockhart.
Systolic's holding above 80.
- Yeah, on 20 mikes of dopamine.
- Still counts.
All right, you know, maybe you were right,
- maybe...
- D-Don't say it.
Don't say it.
Nothing more painful than listening to a lady eat crow.
- I'm not eating crow.
- Which reminds me, I am starving.
- Good idea.
- Turkey, cranberry sauce.
- Wife even baked the bread.
- We got a patient here.
She's fine.
You know, I feel sorry for your old man.
What's that supposed to mean?
- It's just the turbulence.
- I don't think so.
Charge the defibrillator now.
Febrile to 101, vomiting and mild rebound.
How long has this been going on, sweetie?
It started during the salad.
Salad for Thanksgiving?
Your family's weird.
- Tell me about it.
- White count?
Pending.
Are those chocolate chip?
Uh, no.
- Could I have one anyway?
- Um, yeah, sure.
You know, this holiday is a lie.
Really?
Yeah, the only thing the pilgrims shared with the Indians were measles.
- Okay.
- I'm Lulu.
- Thanks for the cookie.
- Yeah.
Hey, you can't eat that, honey; you're NPO.
Oh, yeah, nil per os.
It's Thanksgiving and I can't even eat.
Alex, what did I tell you about asking the doctors or nurses before giving away the cookies?
Labs are back.
Her white count's 14.
Let's get a CT.
I'll call the scanner.
All right, you know, we talked to your mom on the phone earlier and she gave us permission to give you a very special X ray on your tummy.
She didn't want to talk to me?
No, but she said to make sure we treat you like a VIP.
- I'm sure she'll be here soon.
- That's okay.
Alex can wait with me.
Right, Alex?
Yeah.
Clear!
- Still v-fib.
- Damn it.
- She's 88 years old.
- Yeah, I tried to make that point an hour ago.
- We're committed now.
- Lido's in.
All right, another mig of epi.
- She's had five rounds of meds.
- Yeah, well, let's make it six.
We never should have brought her up here.
- Darling, it's the job.
- Oh, spare me the platitudes, okay?
Go again.
Go !
Clear!
Nothing.
If the scar shows above my bikini, I'm suing both your asses.
Need some help here!
Ladies, we're in a hospital now.
- Time to grow up.
- Don't tell me what to do, Grandma.
- Grandma?
- You bobble-headed little bitch!
Okay, let's settle down.
All right, what happened?
- She pushed me into the display.
- I fell, she fell.
These three were fighting over a bag at Bovards' midnight sale.
- All right, come on.
Let's go.
- Midnight sale?
It's not even 8:00 yet.
The name's just tradition.
It starts at 4:00 in the afternoon now.
Bendi Brioche 80% off.
- Normally $1,800.
- They only did a limited run.
Somehow during the scuffle, Mandy fell into the nativity display.
- I was pushed.
- Nativity display?
It's Thanksgiving.
Yeah, well, that's when the Christmas decorations go up.
Impaled by a fiberglass Star of Bethlehem.
Jane, call surgery.
With all that's happened, I can't keep this now.
Oh, that's so sweet, honey.
Give it back, evil grandma whore.
Wow, this is really sad.
- Hello.
- Hi.
I was just calling to say it's still probably going to be a while.
Are you okay?
Abby?
Abby?
You there?
Don't worry.
We're taking good care of your girl.
Are you listening?
Who's that?
You guys are assholes.
- Abby?
- Luka, I'll call you when we land.
Hang up the phone.
- You didn't say good-bye.
- Hang up the phone!
Sorry about that.
- I accidentally mixed up my channels.
- What, are we in fifth grade here?
- Airmedic 6, dispatch.
- Airmedic 6.
Airmedic 6, we have a report of a vehicle over the side of Highway 16 at Neosha Ravine.
Are you available?
- Why aren't you answering her?
- We're about to time out.
Pilots are only allowed to fly for a max of 12 hours.
I've been up for almost 11.
Airmedic 6?
So you're just going to ignore her?
Don't worry.
Another unit will get it.
Yeah, but we're not far from Neosha.
Tell her where we are.
You don't have to look to Daddy for permission.
Just do your job and tell her where we are.
Dispatch, Airmedic 6.
We're at Highway 12 and county line.
- Are we the closest unit?
- Airmedic 6, that's affirmative.
Then put us on the call.
Airmedic 6, you're assigned to the incident.
Who is this?
Abby Lockhart.
I'm the doctor on board and we're responding.
Darling, it's the job.
No free air, no fluid.
Looks like the star missed the peritoneum.
The Thanksgiving sales, the parades, the blockbuster movies.
Those are all just to prime you for the bald- faced commercialism of the holiday season.
Syringe.
Lidocaine, 1%.
- Your wounds are superficial.
- You got lucky.
Yeah, right.
By the time I get back to the sale, all they'll have left are bad colors and big sizes.
You were impaled while fighting over an overpriced vessel for credit cards and lipstick.
Doesn't that sorta kinda feel like a sign?
Wake up.
A gram of Ancef, 3-0 silk and irrigation tray.
Jane, uh, stay and assist the doctor.
We should be close!
She said "vehicle," not "bus."
Cheap trick.
How are we supposed to get down there?
If you're taking that long to find a pulse, it's not worth looking.
Don't waste time with resuscitations.
- Help the people you can help.
- I know how to triage.
Thank you.
That bus is unstable.
Keep triaging until the cavalry gets here.
Help-- my arm!
It won't stop.
I'm telling you, it won't stop.
Okay, okay, okay, let me see.
Let me see.
Just sit down.
Sit down.
Keep pressure on this and keep your arm up, okay?
We're all gonna freeze to death out here!
We're gonna get you out of the cold soon, okay?
How?
!
Help!
Please!
Somebody!
- Over here!
- Stay like that.
- Stay like...
- Wait!
Wait!
- I don't know what to do!
- Are more people coming?
- What's the plan?
Do you have a plan?
- His foot is pointing the wrong way.
Can you tell me what your name is?
- It's Matt.
- Hi, Matt.
- I'm Abby.
I'm a doctor.
- Hey, doc.
No, no, no, no, don't move.
Don't move.
Can you hold his head like this?
Make sure he doesn't move his neck.
I can't feel my leg!
Oh, God.
- Can you move your feet at all?
- No!
- Baby, no!
- It's all right.
I'm gonna go find something to splint your leg with, okay?
Help!
Somebody...
Somebody help!
Please!
Help!
Mom, don't close your eyes.
Stay awake, somebody's coming.
- Mom?
Mom!
- All right, don't move.
- I'm gonna come back there.
- Mom, she's here now!
It's gonna be okay!
Hello?
!
- Are you hurt, too?
- No, it's just my mom.
Please.
- Hang on.
- You got to get her out.
Mom, it's okay.
Please get her out.
I'm Abby.
I'm a doctor.
- Can you tell me your name?
- Melanie.
- Melanie, can you move at all?
- She's stuck!
Okay.
We're gonna get you out of here, all right?
- Come on.
Let's go!
- Are you ready?
One, two, three.
Is...
Is that all my blood?
I don't know.
I don't know where that blood's coming from.
Come on.
Fix her!
I can't.
I can't move you now.
- I understand.
- Okay.
- You should take Milo out.
- No!
I won't go!
- Baby, go with the doctor.
- No!
Milo, there are people coming with special equipment.
They're gonna help us.
- And I'll wait here with her!
- Milo, I love you.
- This is gonna help you with the pain.
- I need you to be a brave boy now, okay?
- Please, just get him off this bus!
- No!
- Go with the doctor, baby.
- No.
- Milo...
- You can be a good helper.
- No!
- Go ahead.
Milo, come on.
Please, just make sure he's okay.
Let's go, now.
Come on.
- No!
- Let's go.
Watch your head.
See, I told you it wouldn't hurt.
It's my mom.
She won't stop calling me.
You're lucky.
My foster mother only keeps me for the money she gets from the state.
When I started barfing at dinner, she... loaded me into the ambulance and then went back to her ham.
So... she's not coming.
- That boy is smitten.
- Boys are easy.
You know, Meg and Sarah are out of town tonight?
Liver looks good.
Which means I have the place all to myself.
- And why are you telling me this?
- 'Cause Meg and I, it's over.
I thought you weren't together.
We weren't.
But now we're not even not together anymore.
- Fat stranding and a cecal phlegmon.
- She needs the OR.
I'll call Crenshaw.
Sit down.
I have a very important job for you, okay?
I don't want my mom to be alone.
I want you to take that flashlight, and point it wherever I'm working.
Someone's gonna help her, right?
The fire department's gonna be here soon.
And they'll get her off the bus?
Yeah.
Promise?
All right, don't move, okay?
Just shine that light at me.
Four dead, nine criticals, 14 minor injuries, 11 delayed.
The driver had a passenger manifest, and the numbers all match up.
Good job.
Good job.
All the criticals are off site.
Does this include the woman on the bus?
No one's going back on that bus until it's stabilized.
Well, how long is that gonna take?
The anchors aren't holding;
it could be hours.
- She can't make it that long.
- There's nothing we can do about it!
- We are not gonna endanger our guys!
- Calm down.
Hey, nobody's getting back on that bus!
- But she promised!
- She said you guys would go back!
- Oh, yeah, what else you tell him?
!
- Why don't you just back off...?
- Mom!
- Hey!
Hey!
Mom!
Milo!
Hey!
Hey!
Milo, you...
Milo, you cannot get on that bus right now!
- You said they would get her.
- I know.
- You said they'd try.
- Okay.
- You said they'd try.
- I know.
It's gonna be okay.
Come on, guys.
Give him to me.
Pass him down.
No!
No!
Get away!
Melanie?
- Melanie?
Can you hear me?
- Milo, he can't...
All right.
All right, everything's gonna be okay.
- No, it's...
- Everything's gonna be all right.
Hey!
I need an IV and a liter of NS in here!
His dad's in Milwaukee.
- Would you... please tell him...
- Okay, Melanie.
Melanie, listen to me.
Help is on the way, all right?
Milo...
Milo likes it...
if you break up his toast...
- and scramble it with his eggs.
- Okay.
He'll only let you comb his hair... if he's wearing his Ronaldinho jersey.
Uh, uh, uh, uh.
No, no, no.
Melanie, stay with me.
Melanie, come on.
Stay with me.
Melanie, tell me some more about Milo.
What does Milo like?
He... he likes to sleep with an inchworm named Charlie.
- Okay, that's good.
What else?
- Trying to get us all killed?
I'm trying to keep her alive.
- You are out of your mind.
- Well, what are you doing here?
Thought you might need this.
Hey, Katey, it's me.
Uh, I think you have my cell phone.
Want to come by later and pick it up, if that's okay.
Call me.
Marsupialized the abscess on your shooter, sent the implanted chip to pathology, convinced Captain Kangaroo to stop eating erasers, and what's the deal with the new nurse?
- You mean Jane?
- Yeah.
- What about her?
- Nothing.
You know, just wondering.
You like her.
- Quiet, you silly infant.
- What about radiology?
Alex loves the fluoroscope.
- I went there.
Nobody's seen him.
- Okay, can you check MRI?
The tech there lets him man the controls sometimes.
Sam, I got work to do.
Jasmine Chastek, 17, fell down a couple steps, positive LOC.
- Hey, I'm Dr. Barnett.
- What happened?
We were doing hits of nitrous from whipped cream cans at Grandma's.
She went a little overboard, passed out on the basement stairs.
Okay, this should clean up just fine.
Uh, I have to go find Alex.
Teenagers are such idiots.
Push harder!
It's stuck!
Come on!
Got to go!
Now!
- Can I have a cookie?
- Uh, yeah, but they really suck.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Listen, your mom's looking for you.
- Ah, man, now I'm in trouble.
No, she'll understand.
No, I mean, everything I do makes her angry.
Sometimes you have to go the extra mile for a girl.
She'll get it.
Trust me.
Lulu's in recovery.
She's doing fine.
Good.
- Go get her.
- Yeah.
We're getting a critical victim in from a bus crash.
I've got to go meet a helicopter on the roof.
Don't you need to be in the ER or something?
- No, my shift ended hours ago.
- Well, what are you still doing here?
Waiting for you, dummy.
Tony, you know, it's going to be a while.
I've got to get sign-out;
- then I've got to take the patient to CT...
- All right, here's the deal.
You're going home with me tonight.
Why is that the deal?
Because there's nobody at my house.
It's Thanksgiving.
And I really, really want to make you... dinner.
Okay, chocolate cherry.
Amazing, right?
- Wow.
- Looks great to me.
Hey, Greg.
- Hey, I'm Dr. Greg Pratt.
- Oh, nice to meet you.
Courtney Brown.
- Courtney is my producer at Channel 5.
- Wow.
You know, I think I might be able to hang out for a while, if I can get my neighbor to let the dog out.
- I'll give her a call.
- Great.
- Who is that?
- I just told you who she was.
Come on, now, hook a brother up.
You know what, your gaydar is terrible, even for a straight man.
Oh, well, you...
You have excellent taste in women, Dr. Weaver.
Of course I do.
Hey, uh...
Can I ask you something personal?
Maybe.
All right.
How, um...
No, no.
When... did you know you were gay?
Are you coming out to me, Greg?
No, no, no, no.
I came home and found my brother with another guy.
- Really?
- Yeah.
He says he's just experimenting, that it's only a phase.
- And what do you think?
- I don't know.
Can a straight guy go through a gay phase?
I think it's more likely that he's gay.
Hey, and he's telling you what he thinks you want to hear.
Okay, but for today, right, he's taking some hot girl from school to the family Thanksgiving.
Now, if he was gay, why is he doing that?
I don't know your brother.
I mean, I-I don't know what's going on in his head, but I do know that when I was that age, I brought a lot of boys home to meet my parents.
- You did?
- Hell, yeah.
I mean, I was 30 before I faced up to being gay, but my life got a lot better once I did.
- Hey, Abby.
- Hey.
- Your transport go okay?
- Um... yes.
Well, be grateful you got to skip out on this freak show.
- It's been a real madhouse around here.
- Just got lucky, I guess.
Hey, Lockhart.
Hurry up and sign this before I get called out again.
Bye.
And thanks.
You're pretty tough for a girl.
Go to hell.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I was afraid you weren't going to show up.
Sorry, Crenshaw made me do an ID on my way out.
Come on in.
Hope you're hungry.
Couldn't do the turkey thing so I made tacos.
Homemade salsa, I got these tortillas from the Salvadorian market on Fulton.
- You ever been there?
- Uh, don't think so.
Some wine.
You okay?
- Uh, yeah.
- Some more wine.
- Want to take your jacket off?
- Uh, yeah.
All right.
Are you sure you're cool?
'Cause if you don't like Mexican food,
- just say the word and you know.
- No, I'm fine.
Really.
It's just I haven't been in a situation like this for a long time.
- I know.
- It just feels a bit weird standing here knowing we're about to do what we're about to do.
What?
Have dinner?
Tony, I-I want to be here, I do.
I mean, I've thought about it a lot.
Not creepy-a-lot, but it's definitely been on my mind and I wouldn't want you to be worried that I don't really want...
I'm not worried.
We can take it as slow as you want.
Slow?
- Hey, stranger.
- Hey.
Well, thank you.
- And what are you doing here?
- Working.
Surgeons are such bastards making med students come in on Thanksgiving.
That is really, really low.
No, actually, it's the bastards in the ER who scheduled me for this.
- What?
- I started an ER rotation.
Tonight.
Now, see, you said you were never going to...
Yeah, radiology fell through at the last minute.
I got reassigned.
Don't freak out.
I'm not stalking you.
- Okay, look, I can't evaluate you.
- We'll work it out.
And I can't have these people thinking...
- We'll work it out.
- Okay.
Hey, Abby.
What took so long?
You were out all night.
Well, you know, sometimes these things can take hours.
You sure you weren't just having sundaes with the team?
Last run I did we burned off the whole shift at the Plush Horse.
Good for you, Ray.
Well, well, well, look who's back.
She got to soar over Chicago while we dealt with maggots and colostomy bags.
I guess I must have done something good in a past life.
Yeah, well, you look wiped.
Transports can do that to you if you're not used to it.
- So you want me to get you a coffee?
Or...
- No, thanks.
Right now I really just want to go home.
No, stay.
We just got here.
I missed you guys.
I know we had no water or toilet paper...
Oh, my God.
Meg, Sarah, this is Neela.
How many times do I have to tell you, Tony?
When you leave the glass directly on the wood, it leaves a stain.
- You hungry?
- Yeah, I'm starving.
All right, let me get my stuff, and then, uh, we can pick up something at the chicken place.
Sam, Alex, Happy Thanksgiving.
There's some food over there, help yourselves.
Wow, thanks, Luka.
- Tofurkey anyone?
- Uh... no.
- I'll try it.
- Are you really a vegan?
Surgeons just shouldn't be carnivores.
It's a known fact.
- What the hell is that?
- Looks like milk Jell-O.
Mmm, no, coconut flan and it is killer.
Oh, hey, Dr. Weaver, do you remember me?
- Katey Alvaro.
- Oh, hi, Katey.
How are you?
I'm good.
Um, I started my ER rotation about an hour ago.
Oh, yeah, well, I hope Ray's giving you the lay of the land.
Oh, yeah, he is.
Definitely.
All right, how do you stay so skinny and eat so much?
Uh, look who's talking, little skinny mini.
Well, it seems like good genes to me.
You want to come over and watch some football with me and Kerry tomorrow?
Damn, you're lucky.
- I can't believe you made all this.
- Well, maybe I cheated a little.
If anything happens to me you'll remember that
Joe likes strawberries but raspberries give him hives, right?
- What are you talking about?
- And... and if you put the ceiling fan on in the bathroom, he doesn't cry when he's in tube.
- I know that.
- And it's absolutely mandatory that he be exposed to everything Stevie Wonder recorded in the '70s.
Dr. Lockhart, that trauma you choppered in did well in the OR.
Oh, great.
That's great.
Yeah, it required over 12 units but, uh, she's holding her own in recovery.
Thanks.
Are you okay?
How did the transport go?
Hey, I have my kid here.
It's Thanksgiving.
I'll tell you tomorrow.
E. R.
E. R. 13x09 "SCOOP AND RUN" Subtitles subXpacio
My mom used to put it in a trash bag with chicken broth and Crisco.
Grill it on the barbecue, you'll never go back.
I read that brining keeps the juices in.
Did you take the giblets out of the marinade?
Take what out of what?
- C-spine is clear.
- We should try to pull off the gravy.
All right, I'm gonna take this collar off.
Let us know if anything hurts, okay?
- Fried turkey is a religious experience.
- Gross.
You'd rather cook it in a trash bag?
Americans, so sentimental about their holidays.
This from the guy that celebrates Croatian independence Croatian State Day, and something called Patriotic Gratitude Day.
- Oh, no.
- What?
I have 10 minutes left in my shift and the transport pager goes off.
- I'll go.
- No, you can't, you're an intern.
The dispatcher wants to say "Happy Thanksgiving"?
Yeah, right.
I'm sure that's what it is.
- Jane?
Jane.
- Abby.
- You carry the transport pager overnight?
- Uh, yeah.
Well, it just went off, and I was thinking maybe you could just take it.
- Mm, no.
- No?
Why not?
Five more minutes, it would have been your call anyway.
- Sorry, it just doesn't work that way.
- What way?
If the pager goes off during your shift, you have to go.
Yeah, but I wanna spend Thanksgiving with my kid.
It's like that story with the guy hunting dinosaurs.
He strays off path, steps on a butterfly and the future's ever so different.
- What?
- It's bad karma to mess with the universal order of things.
- Your ace unicycle man, he can go.
- Ray.
- Yeah?
- Take this, I'll owe you.
- I'd love to.
- Great.
I can't.
Pratt thinks I'm losing too much ER time.
- He banned me from transports.
- I just like having you near me.
Surprise.
You get me instead of Morris tonight.
He begged me to switch so he could spend time with his kids.
- What's your excuse?
- Henry went to Orlando with his grandparents.
I might as well come in.
I love working Thanksgiving.
Everybody's at home eating and watching football.
Even the freaks.
Ah, the great American tradition of sanctioned gluttony.
No, thanks.
I'm not trying to block the run.
I'm just asking, does garden-variety MI really need a doc on board?
Miss Lulu Davis, age 12, vomiting and abdominal pain times two hours.
- Hi, I'm Dr. Figler.
- Lulu, we'll take care of you.
I got this.
- I got here first.
- I'm good with kids.
- Are you saying I'm not?
- No.
Wait a minute.
Hold on a second.
Lulu, you okay?
- Cranberries.
- Sorry, Jane.
Karma sucks.
The book says three hours at 450.
And don't forget to baste.
How often?
I don't know.
Q-30 minutes?
I'll probably be home to mash the potatoes.
- Okay, what do I do with the pumpkin?
- Oh, I forgot about the pie.
- Dr. Kovac.
You got a minute?
- Yeah.
Just a second.
I thought pumpkins were for Halloween.
Screw the pie.
I never really liked pumpkins, anyway.
- Sure you don't wanna order Chinese?
- No.
But baste.
Remember to baste.
- Hey.
- I went to see Curtis Ames yesterday.
He didn't know about any kid's toy.
Did he admit to following them to the park?
He didn't know what I was talking about.
Look, the guy's had a pretty tough time.
He's barely getting by.
Okay, I realize that, but that's no excuse for messing with my family.
If you want my opinion he's too busy trying to feed and clothe himself to mess with anyone, doc.
Right.
- You get airsick?
- No.
Claustrophobic?
Maybe you should just tell me about the patient?
Eighty-eight-year-old female, anterior Ml.
I can't tell you how many docs freak out at altitude.
I work in an ER.
It's pretty hard to freak me out.
You do okay with heights, honey?
Loud noises?
Yeah, but mice make me jump on a chair and say "eek. "
Danny, meet Dr. Lockhart.
- Hi.
- Sit.
Don't stand.
Don't disembark till we tell you to.
Keep your headset and your seatbelt on at all times.
If you need to speak to us slide this switch this way to activate the intercom.
Do not press that button.
That transmits over the radio.
This baby is tight.
- Excuse me?
- First night out after two months of upgrades.
Satellite phone, GPS, new hoist.
All the cool toys.
- I'm Jasper, this is Evan.
- Hey.
What'd you say your name was?
- Abby.
- Abby.
Come fly with me
Let's float down to Peru
In llama land there's a one-man band
And he'll toot his flute for you
Come fly with me, Abby
Let's take off in the blue
When I press, when I let go?
- About the same.
- I see.
- I'm thirsty.
- Too bad.
You're NPO.
- What's that?
- Nil per os, nothing by mouth.
Food or liquids exacerbate or complicate an obstruction, volvulus or inflammation.
Not to mention increase aspiration risk during intubation should you go to the O.R. tonight.
Um, I'm sorry I threw up on you.
Oh.
I don't mind the fact I had to shower to get the chunks out of my hair.
I just don't know how I'm gonna survive a whole shift dressed like this.
I'm gonna order a few tests, see what's going on in there.
I mean, bunnies, puppy dogs.
I'm, like, breaking out in hives.
Jane, why don't you let me take it from here?
- Your parents are on their way, right?
- Yeah.
Definitely.
I think it's hip.
I think it's fetishy.
I think you totally pull this look off.
Shut up, Gates.
Hey, Sam, I need a CBC on a little girl in 2.
And order up an extra red top if you can, just in case the blood bank needs it.
- Got it.
- Hey, Alex.
Don't you have anything better to do than hang out with us on Thanksgiving?
If he stayed home, he'd play video games all night.
I figured I'd bring him in, make him do community service.
Hey, that's cool, man.
Handing out cookies to sick people?
That's cool.
Could be worse.
You could be one of those sick people.
Four pages in the last 20 minutes?
What's the crisis, Dr. Gates?
Oh, no crisis, just an incarcerated hernia a gluteal abscess, road rash that needs skin grafting embedded drill bit, rule-out appy on a 12-year-old girl.
- You're making this up.
- I wish I were.
You sure it's not an excuse to keep me here?
Please.
I would never dream of wasting your time like that.
But really, must you look so hot all the time?
I mean, even with that ridiculous hat, I can't concentrate.
I can't even talk.
You know, enough of this harassment.
I have work to do.
- Are you the team from County?
- Yeah.
Watch it.
Hi, I'm Dr. Lockhart.
Mom was fine.
Cooked a 20-pound turkey, carved it, then she collapsed.
- We thought she was kidding.
- But then we couldn't wake her up.
- Must have been scary.
- Get the history later.
Stay here.
- We need to examine your mother.
Okay.
Excuse me, I'm looking for Elizabeth Timmons?
Thank heavens.
This way.
You didn't say about her being intubated.
They never tell the whole story.
- Vitals?
- Tachy to 124, sat 92.
- You got a BP?
- Last one was 74 over 38 on dopa.
- Great.
What about a EKG?
- Here, Dr. Russo.
Thanks for coming.
Lockhart.
- Place gets backed up...
- ...when we have a patient like this.
- Sats 82.
She's tombstoning.
- Thrombolytics?
- I gave it.
No response.
Okay, a reality check here?
Does this family know how sick she is?
- They know she's having a heart attack.
- She's not breathing her blood pressure sucks and she's not perfusing her brain enough?
- We can't move her.
She's unstable.
The family wants her out.
- She won't make the trip.
- You don't know that.
If she survives the helicopter, she will die before the family makes it to County.
- What's your point?
- Well-
She's 88 years old.
She's not coming back from this.
Don't you think dying here with her loved ones is better than dying alone in the ICU at County?
Listen, doctor, our job is to scoop and run.
The longer we stay and jaw about it, the more unstable this lady's gonna get.
Know what?
Just give me five minutes.
I'm gonna make sure they understand.
Fifty-two years, rain or shine he drives me around the lake on a tandem bike after Thanksgiving.
- Isn't that sweet?
You're blind, Mr. Hunter.
Maybe you should let her drive.
That wouldn't work.
I can't carry a tune.
Oh, he drives, I sing.
It's tradition.
Radiology.
Call me when the films get back.
- You got it.
- Ray, help.
Need order for sumatriptan.
- Migraines?
- I get one every Thanksgiving.
- It's the stuffing.
- Okay, 20 milligrams, intranasally.
Then why do you eat it?
Because it's amazing.
Mom makes it with bacon and almonds.
Lands me in the hospital every Thanksgiving.
It's worth it.
Be right back with your medicine.
Holidays weird me out.
The special foods, little rituals.
- It's not my thing.
- Yeah.
When I was a kid, Thanksgiving was an excuse to stay home and watch TV.
I always figured when I grew up and had kids of my own I'd do the whole family thing, a big banquet, but well, here we are.
Me and Alex, hanging out in the hospital.
Didn't your parents demand you come home?
No.
My mom's in Trinidad with a new boyfriend.
And my dad's never even heard of a home-cooked meal, so...
Ah, well, at least you got something hot waiting for you at home.
What?
Missing your cell phone, perhaps?
What?
Yeah.
How did you-?
Hematology needed you, so we called your cell phone and you will never guess who answered.
Surgical med student Katey Alvaro.
- Oh, well, we were studying.
- Right.
I mean, well, she couldn't talk.
She was baking you something.
A little treat.
- Any chance you could be wrong?
- Well, yes.
- But based on my experience-
- Well, which is it?
You tell us she won't survive the trip, now you say you might be wrong.
I know this is hard.
I just think it's important-
- Time's up.
Let's go.
- All right, just wait.
Find the clerk, sign the consent, we'll be at County in 45 minutes.
- But she just said that we should-
- It's your mom's only chance.
Okay, uh.
Take her.
- She's gonna die.
- Uh-huh.
I'm doing my best to facilitate a good death.
- It's not your job.
- Not your call.
Here's how it works.
The referring hospital refers the accepting hospital accepts.
We're the delivery men.
- Delivery people.
- You're denying the responsibility...
- ...that comes with your job.
- I'm not the one who's in denial.
Good death?
No such thing.
If you think you can make this a good experience for that family you're more arrogant than I thought.
Mom, if you can hear me, we'll see you in Chicago, okay?
In a few weeks, you're gonna be a great-grandmother.
Everyone, stay back.
God bless you, Dr. Lockhart.
Systolic's holding above 80.
- Yeah, on 20 mics of dopamine.
- Still counts.
All right.
You know, maybe you were right, maybe she-
Don't say it.
Don't say it.
Nothing more painful than to listen to a lady eat crow.
- I'm not eating crow.
- Which reminds me, I am starving.
- Good idea.
- Turkey, cranberry sauce.
Wife even baked the bread.
- We got a patient here.
- She's fine.
You know, I feel sorry for your old man.
What's that supposed to mean?
- It's just the turbulence.
- I don't think so.
Charge the defibrillator.
Now.
Febrile to 101, vomiting and mild rebound.
- How long this been going on, sweetie?
- It started during the salad.
Salad for Thanksgiving?
Your family's weird.
- Yeah, tell me about it.
- White count?
Pending.
Are those chocolate chip?
- Uh, no.
- Could I have one anyway?
Um, yeah, sure.
- You know, this holiday's a lie.
- Really?
Yeah.
The only thing the Pilgrims shared with the Indians were measles.
- Okay.
- I'm Lulu.
Thanks for the cookie.
Yeah.
Hey, you can't eat that, honey.
You're NPO.
Oh, yeah.
Nil per os.
It's Thanksgiving and I can't even eat.
What did I tell you about asking doctors or nurses before giving away cookies?
Labs are back.
- Our white count's 14.
Let's get a CT.
- I'll call the scanner.
All right.
We talked to your mom on the phone.
She gave us permission to give you a very special x-ray on your tummy.
She didn't want to talk to me?
No, but she said to make sure we treat you like a VIP.
I'm sure she'll be here soon.
Oh, that's okay.
Alex can wait with me.
Right, Alex?
Yeah.
Clear.
- Still V-fib.
- Damn it.
- She's 88 years old.
- I tried to make that point an hour ago.
- We're committed now.
- Lido's in.
- Another mg of epi.
- She had five rounds.
Yeah, well, let's make it six.
- We never should have brought her up.
- Darling, it's the job.
Spare me the platitudes, okay?
Go again.
Go.
Clear.
Nothing.
If the scar shows above my bikini, I'm suing your asses.
- Need some help here.
- We're in a hospital.
Grow up.
- Don't tell me what to do, grandma.
- Grandma?
You bubble-headed bitch.
Let's settle down, all right?
What happened?
- She pushed me into the display.
- I fell.
These three were fighting over a bag at Bovards' midnight sale.
- Come on, let's go.
- Midnight?
It's not even 8:00.
The name's just tradition.
It starts at 4 now.
Bendi brioche, 80 percent off.
- Normally, $1800.
- They only did a limited run.
During the scuffle, Mandy fell into the Nativity display.
- I was pushed.
- Nativity display?
It's Thanksgiving.
Yeah, that's when the Christmas decorations go up.
Impaled by a fiberglass Star of Bethlehem.
Jane, call Surgery.
With all that's happened, I can't keep this now.
Oh, that's so sweet, honey.
Give it back, evil grandma whore.
This is really sad.
Hello?
Hi.
I was just calling to say it's still probably gonna be a while.
You okay?
Abby?
Abby?
You there?
Don't worry, we're taking good care of your girl.
Are you listening?
Who's that?
You guys are assholes.
- Abby?
- Luka, I'll call you when we land.
Hang up the phone.
- You didn't say goodbye.
Hang up the phone.
Sorry about that.
I accidentally mixed up my channels.
What are we, in fifth grade here?
Air Medic 6, Dispatch.
- Air Medic 6.
- We have a report of a vehicle over the side of Highway 16 at Neosha Ravine.
Are you available?
- Why aren't you answering her?
- We're about to time out.
Pilots are only allowed to fly for a max of 12 hours.
I've been up for almost 11.
Air Medic 6?
So you're just gonna ignore her?
Don't worry.
Another unit will get it.
Yeah, but we're not far from Neosha.
Tell her where we are.
Don't look to Daddy for permission.
Just do your job and tell her where we are.
Dispatch, Air Medic 6, we're at Highway 12 and county line.
Are we the closest unit?
Air Medic 6, that's affirmative.
Then put us on the call.
Air Medic 6, you 're assigned to the incident.
Who is this?
Abby Lockhart.
I'm the doctor onboard, and we're responding.
Darling, it's the job.
No free air, no fluid.
Looks like the star missed the peritoneum.
The Thanksgiving sales, the parades, the blockbuster movies.
Those are to prime you for bald-faced commercialism of the holiday season.
Syringe?
Lidocaine, 1 percent.
Your wounds are superficial.
You got lucky.
Yeah, right.
By the time I get back to the sale, all they'll have are bad colors and big sizes.
You were impaled while fighting over a vessel for credit cards and lipstick.
Doesn't that sort of kind of feel like a sign?
Wake up.
A gram of Ancef, 3-0 silk, and irrigation tray.
Jane, stay and assist the doctor.
We should be close.
She said vehicle, not bus.
Cheap trick.
How are we supposed to get down there?
She's alive.
- Hang on.
- Hang on.
- I don't know how to help.
- We're coming to help.
Let go.
Let go.
We got you.
Well, you stay put, I'll get her.
Don't worry.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Stay right there.
Hold on to her.
Don't move her.
If you're taking that long to find a pulse, it's not worth looking.
Don't waste time with resuscitations.
- Help the people you can help.
- I know how to triage, thanks.
Oh!
That bus is unstable.
Keep triaging until the cavalry gets here.
Help.
My arm.
- It won't stop.
- All right.
- I'm telling you, it won't stop.
- Okay, let me see.
Let me see.
Okay, sit down.
Sit down.
Keep pressure on this and keep your arm up, okay?
Hell, we're all gonna freeze to death out here.
We're gonna get you out of the cold soon, okay?
- How?
- Help!
Please, somebody!
Over here!
- Stay like that.
Stay like that.
- Wait!
Wait!
- Wait!
Are more people coming?
- I don't know what to do.
Please, his foot is pointing the wrong way.
Okay.
- Can you tell me what your name is?
- Matt.
Hi, Matt.
I'm Abby, I'm a doctor.
- Hey, doc.
- No, no, no.
Don't move.
Don't move.
Could you hold his head?
Make sure he doesn't move his neck.
I can't feel my leg.
Oh, my God.
- Can you move your feet at all?
- No.
- Okay.
- Don't.
I'm gonna find something to splint your leg with.
- Okay.
- Help!
Somebody!
Somebody help!
Please.
Help!
Close your eyes.
But stay awake.
Somebody's coming.
Mom?
Mom?
All right, don't move.
I'm gonna come back there.
Mom, she's here now.
It's gonna be all right.
Hello?
- Are you hurt too?
- No, it's just my mom.
Please.
- Hang on.
- You gotta get her to help.
Milo?
- Okay.
- Oh, please, get her out.
I'm Abby.
I'm a doctor.
Can you tell me your name?
- Melanie.
- Okay.
Melanie, can you move at all?
She's stuck.
- Oh, God.
- All right.
Okay.
We're gonna get you out of here, all right?
- Okay.
- Come on, let's go.
Are you ready?
One, two, three.
Is that all my blood?
I don't know.
I don't know where that blood's coming from.
- Come on, fix her.
- Okay.
I can't, uh...
I can't move you now.
Okay, I understand.
Okay.
- You should take Milo out.
- No, I won't go.
- Shh.
Baby, go with the doctor.
- No!
People are coming with special equipment.
- They're gonna help us.
- And I'll wait here with her.
- Milo, I love you.
- This is gonna help you with the pain.
But I need you to be a brave boy now, okay?
Please, just get him off this bus.
- No!
- Go with the doctor, baby.
- Milo.
- You can be a good helper.
No!
- No.
- Come on.
Please, just make sure he's okay.
- Mom.
- Let's go now.
Come on.
- No.
- Let's go.
Watch your head.
See?
I told you it wouldn't hurt.
That's my mom.
She won't stop calling me.
You're lucky.
My foster mother only keeps me for the money she gets from the state.
When I started barfing at dinner, she loaded me into the ambulance then went back to her ham.
So she's not coming.
- That boy is smitten.
- Boys are easy.
You know, Meg and Sarah are out of town tonight.
- The liver looks good.
- Which means I have the place to myself.
And why are you telling me this?
Because Meg and I, it's over.
I thought you weren't together.
Well, we weren't.
But now, we're not even not together anymore.
That's fat stranding a cecal phlegmon.
- She needs O.R.
- I'm gonna call Crenshaw.
Sit down.
I have a very important job for you, okay?
I don't want my mom to be alone.
I want you to take that flashlight and point it wherever I'm working.
Someone's gonna help her, right?
The fire department's gonna be here soon.
- And they'll get her off the bus?
- Yeah.
Promise?
All right.
Don't move, okay?
Just shine that light at me.
Up.
Four dead, nine criticals, 14 minor injuries, 11 delayed.
The driver had a passenger manifest and the numbers all match up.
Good job, good job.
All the criticals are off-site?
Does this include the woman on the bus?
No one's going back on that bus until it's stabilized.
How long is that gonna take?
The anchors aren't holding.
It could be hours.
- She can't make it that long.
- There's nothing we can do.
We are not gonna endanger our guys.
- Calm down.
- Hey, nobody's getting back on that bus.
But she promised.
She said you guys would go back.
- Oh, yeah?
What else you tell him?
- Why don't you back off?
- No!
- Hey.
Hey.
- No!
- Out of the way.
- Milo, you
- Hey.
- Get that-
- Hey!
Hey!
- No!
- No!
- Milo.
Milo, you cannot get on that bus right now.
- You said they would get her.
- I know.
- You said they would.
- Okay.
- You said they'd try.
- I know.
It's gonna be okay.
Lockhart.
Give him to me.
Pass him down.
No.
No!
Where the hell's those guys?
Go ahead, pick it.
Lockhart!
Melanie?
Melanie?
Can you hear me?
Milo, is he...?
All right.
All right, everything's gonna be okay.
- This is not okay.
- Everything's gonna be all right.
Hey, I need an IV and a liter of NS in here.
His dad's in Milwaukee.
- Would you please tell him-?
- Okay, Melanie.
Melanie, listen to me.
Help is on the way, all right?
Milo likes it if you break up his toast...
- ...and scramble them in his eggs.
- Okay.
He'll only let you comb his hair...
- ...if he's wearing his Ronaldinho jersey.
- Yeah.
Oh, damn it.
Ah, ah, ah.
No, no, no.
Melanie.
Stay with me.
Melanie, come on, stay with me.
Melanie, tell me some more about Milo.
What does Milo like?
He likes to sleep with an inchworm named Charlie.
- Okay, that's good.
What else?
- You trying to get us all killed?
I am trying to keep her alive.
- You are out of your mind.
- Well, what are you doing here?
I thought you might need this.
Hi, Katey, it's me.
Uh, I think you have my cell phone?
I wanna come by later and pick it up, if that's okay.
Call me.
Marsupialized the abscess on your shooter sent the "implanted" chip up to Pathology convinced Captain Kangaroo to stop eating erasers and, uh what's the deal with the new nurse?
- What, you mean, Jane?
- Yeah.
- What about her?
- Nothing, you know?
Just wondering.
- You like her.
- Quiet, you silly infant.
What about Radiology?
Yeah, Alex loves the fluoroscope.
- I went there.
Nobody's seen him.
- Okay, can you check mri?
- The tech lets him man the controls.
- Sam, I got work to do.
Jasmine Chastek, 17, fell down a couple of steps, positive LOC.
- Hey, I'm Dr. Barnett.
- What happened?
We were doing hits of nitrous from whipped-cream cans.
- She went overboard and passed out.
- Okay, this should clean up just fine.
Uh, I have to go find Alex.
Teenagers are such idiots.
Push harder.
It's stuck.
Come on.
Good job.
- Okay, I got her.
- Come on, come on.
There she is.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Gotta go.
- Can I have a cookie?
- Yeah, but they really suck.
Oh, yeah?
Eh.
- Listen, your mom's looking for you.
- Oh, man.
Now I'm in trouble.
No, she'll understand.
No, I mean, everything I do makes her angry.
Well, sometimes you have to go the extra mile for a girl.
She'll get it.
Trust me.
Lulu's in recovery.
She's doing fine.
Good.
- Go get her.
- Yeah.
Getting a critical victim from the crash.
I've gotta meet the helicopter.
All right.
Don't you need to be in the ER or something?
- My shift ended hours ago.
- What are you still doing here?
Waiting for you, dummy.
Tony, it's gonna be a while, I've gotta get a sign-out, then I've-
All right, here's the deal.
You're going home with me tonight.
Why is that the deal?
Because there's nobody at my house it's Thanksgiving and I really, really wanna make you dinner.
Okay, chocolate cherry.
- Amazing, right?
- Mmm.
Wow.
- Looks great to me.
- Hey, Greg.
- Hey, I'm Dr. Greg Pratt.
- Oh, nice to meet you.
Courtney Brown.
- Courtney is my producer at Channel 5.
- Oh.
I might be able to hang out here if I can get my neighbor to let the dog out.
- I'll give her a call.
- Great.
- Who is that?
- I just told you who she was.
Come on, now.
Hook a brother up.
You know what?
Your gaydar is terrible, even for a straight man.
Yeah, well, you have excellent taste in women, Dr. Weaver.
Of course I do.
Hey, uh...
- ...can I ask you something personal?
- Maybe.
All right.
How, um...?
No, no.
When did you know you were gay?
Are you coming out to me, Greg?
No, no, no.
I came home and I found my brother with another guy.
Really?
Yeah.
He says he's just experimenting, that it's only a phase.
And what do you think?
I don't know.
Can a straight guy go through a gay phase?
I think it's more likely that he's gay.
Hey, and he's telling you what he thinks you wanna hear.
Okay, but for today, right he's taking some hot girl to the family Thanksgiving.
- If he was gay, why is he doing that?
- I don't know your brother.
I mean, I don't know what's going on in his head.
But I do know that when I was that age I brought a lot of boys home to meet my parents.
- You did?
- Hell, yeah.
I mean, I was 30 before I faced up to being gay but my life got a lot better once I did.
- Hey, Abby.
- Hey.
Your transport go okay?
Um, yes.
Be grateful you got to skip this freak show.
It's been a real madhouse around here.
Just got lucky, I guess.
Hey, Lockhart.
Hurry up and sign this before I get called out again.
Bye.
And thanks.
You're pretty tough for a girl.
Go to hell.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Was afraid you weren't gonna show.
Sorry, Crenshaw made me do an I and D.
Come on in.
I hope you're hungry.
Couldn't do the turkey.
Made tacos.
Homemade salsa, I got these tortillas from a Salvadorian market on Fulton.
- You ever been there?
- I don't think so.
Some wine.
You okay?
- Uh, yeah.
- Here's some more wine.
- Wanna take your jacket off?
- Uh, yeah.
You sure you're cool?
If you don't like Mexican, say the word and, you know.
I'm fine.
Really.
It's just I haven't been in a situation like this for a long time.
- I know.
- It feels weird standing here knowing what we're about to do.
What?
Have dinner?
Tony, I wanna be here.
I do.
I mean, I've thought about it a lot.
Not creepy a lot, but it's definitely been on my mind and I wouldn't want you to be worried that I don't really wanna...
I'm not worried.
We can take it as slow as you want.
Slow?
What's slow?
- Hey, stranger.
- Hey.
Well, thank you.
And what are you doing here?
- Working.
- Oof, surgeons are such bastards.
Making med students come in on Thanksgiving?
That is really low.
No, actually, it's the bastards in the ER who scheduled me for this.
- What?
- I'm starting an ER rotation.
Tonight.
Now, see, you said you were never gonna-
Radiology fell through at the last minute.
I got reassigned.
- Don't freak out.
I'm not stalking you.
- I can't evaluate you.
- We'll work it out.
- I can't have these-
- We'll work it out.
- Okay.
Hey, Abby, what took you so long?
You were out all night?
Well, you know, sometimes these things can take hours.
Sure you just weren't having sundaes with the team?
Last run I did, we burned off the whole shift at the Plush Horse.
Good for you, Ray.
Well, well, well, look who's back.
She got to soar over Chicago while we dealt with maggots and colostomy bags.
I guess I must've done something good in a past life.
You look wiped.
Transports do that to you if you're not used to it.
- Want me to get you a coffee?
- No.
Right now, I really just wanna go home.
No, stay.
We just got here.
I missed you guys.
I know.
We had no water or toilet paper.
We looked-
Oh, my God.
Meg, Sarah, this is Neela.
How many times do I have to tell you?
When you leave the glass directly on the wood, it leaves a stain.
- You hungry?
- Yeah, I'm starving.
Let me get my stuff.
Then we can pick up something at the chicken place.
Okay.
- What do you got?
- I have a cupcake over here.
Sam, Alex, happy Thanksgiving.
There's some food over there.
Help yourselves.
Wow.
Thanks, Luka.
- Tofurky anyone?
- Uh, no.
- I'll try it.
- Are you really a vegan?
Surgeons just shouldn't be carnivores.
It's a known fact.
- Woman, what the hell is that?
- Looks like milk Jell-O.
Mmm.
No, coconut flan, and it is killer.
Oh, hey, Dr. Weaver, do you remember me?
- Katey Alvaro.
- Hi, Katey.
How are you?
I'm good.
I started my ER rotation about an hour ago.
Oh.
Yeah, well, I hope Ray's giving you the lay of the land.
Oh, yeah, he is.
Definitely.
All right.
How do you stay so skinny and eat so much?
Look who's talking, little Skinny Minnie.
Well, it seems like good genes to me.
You wanna come over and watch some football with me and Kerry tomorrow?
Damn, you're lucky.
- I can't believe you made all this.
- Well, maybe I cheated a little.
If anything happens to me, remember Joe likes strawberries...
- ...but raspberries give him hives, right?
- What are you talking about?
If you put the fan on in the bathroom, he doesn't cry in the tub?
And it's mandatory he be exposed to everything Stevie Wonder recorded in the '70s?
Dr. Lockhart.
That trauma you choppered in did well in the O.R.
Oh, great.
That's great.
Yeah, it required over 12 units, but she's holding her own in Recovery.
Thanks.
Are you okay?
How did that transport go?
I didn't know you got skills like this, doc.
Hey, I have my kid here.
Be quiet with that kind of talk.
Hey, it's Thanksgiving.
I'll tell you tomorrow.
All right, let's give a toast to Dr. Kovac.
Or Chef Kovac, as he wants to be called now.
Hear, hear.
Thanks.
- Cheers, guys.
- Cheers, guys.
Happy Thanksgiving.

In the golden evening sunset, got stuck with the evening, the pottu can the young heart bear it?

- Exactly how often should we change our mattresses?
We should change it every 5 to 1O years.
An old mattress that's lost its supporting Ability, can be detrimental to your health.
Below are some signs of an ageing mattress.
You'll get back aches when you wake up.
Also, when you often wake up feeling very tired and still feel sleepy, as if you didn't have enough sleep.
-I feel the same when I buy a new bed.
You may have trouble falling asleep too.
-That is so bad.
Also the mattress gets noisy and smells bad.
It will smell bad too?
-Yes.
And lastly, if the mattress appears sunken...
What do you want to eat?
-Nas Kandar.
Have you given them their food?
I'll do it.
Do you want a drink?
Yes, I need water.
No, no thanks.
You don't want water?
No, I don't want it.
He doesn't want a drink.
Shiva, wake up.
What is it?
Wake up and sleep over there.
What?
Go sleep at your usual spot.
Who's coming?
Just get up and move over there.
Hurry up.
Hold on, hold on.
I'II move.
You're such a pain.
Always bringing strangers here to sleep.
My pitiful love, my pitiful love.
What is pitiful love but an execution ground?
Tears, death, misery and a fair lady, ridden by love and drowned by sorrow,
Sorrow in acts of kindness and of righteousness, a drop of kindness for a million sorrows,
I didn't know myself, so I sought the wisdom of Buddha,
But now, I learn the truth.
What is the use of praying?
Why even bother seeking Buddha's help?
Oh fly!
Fly away!
Fly oh Sister Hong!
Hurry, fly back to me.
I'll follow you through great storms.
And if I still can't find you,
I'd rather wear my monk's robes, and rest in my coffin.
Piao Hong!
Piao Hong....!
I vow to bring you back.
If you fly to the skies, I will fly to the skies.
If you sink to the ocean floor, I will sink to the ocean floor.
So, let it be, oh Sister!
Piao Hong!
Piao Hong!
My voice is weakened and my body frail,
but you are still not in sight.
Only the waves keep rolling by,
if not for you,
I would have flown, into the depths of an alligator's belly.
If not for you 'Sister Piao Hong',
I would have sunk into the ocean
deep under water,
pity this pitiful monk.
I cry and I cry but no one responds.
Sigh, my love,
pity this pitiful monk.
If you'd like to support this song, please vote for aI10 10170.
That's aI10, space, 10170, Or just send me a text.
You know, there is a saying?
What is it?
Plum Blossom river is full of beauties, like tens of thousands of plum blossoms.
The composer is Yao In,
Yao Li's older brother.
Right.
And the lyricist is Chen Ge Xin.
This song is very meaningful.
Chen supposedly wrote it for himself.
He was in love with Lee Hsiang-Lan then.
Chen is said to have been very handsome.
Unfortunately, he was already engaged, or maybe even married.
You can imagine what it was like then.
Very conservative.
It was an ill-fated romance.
Besides, Lee Hsiang-Lan was a mega star.
That's why he wrote the song.
It was first called 'Untimely Romance'.
Back in those days, there were very few male singers.
So Lee Hsiang-Lan sang it in the end, and the title was changed to suit her.
A spring breeze in the winter night,
awakens my heart with a ripple.
Although only a brief moment of warmth, who can forget this dream we've lost?
It's prettier here.
Look outside.
Come over here, Mystery.
That's the taxi and bus stop over there.
Restaurants and banks.
Very convenient.
The houses here are all well designed.
Some of them have even been renovated.
It needs upgrading.
It's not worth it.
Don't worry, Mr Tan is a rich man.
Can I have a copy of the Land deed?
Of course, no problem.
You can check with the Land Office.
You only think about seeing the house.
Where will your brother live then?
Will your wife look after him?
You never come to visit us.
Except with a big group of strangers.
I'm tired of seeing you.
We'll talk about this later.
All the sweetness, regrets and sorrows are beyond any spoken words.
A room for two?
I need your ID,
a passport will do.
No, I need your passport.
The fire is sometimes 3m underground.
More time is needed to put out the fire.
On the other hand, the local police suspect that the fire may have been started by illegal workers who burn their rubbish in the open.
These foreign construction workers live in makeshift houses nearby.
Police are investigating the suspects.
A government spokesperson pointed out, the main cause of the haze is not the fires at the Putra Jaya plantations, but forest fires in neighbouring Sumatra.
The North-western winds carried the smoke, and brought it to the Kiang river area.
Government Minister Sazmi bin Miah says, the Government will not blame Indonesia, for their annual forest fires that brought about the haze.
But he urges the Indonesian Government, to Look actively into ways to curb this problem in the future.
The Red Cross Society is handing out gas masks to the public, as the PSI index has risen to above 650.
The sharp increase in demand caused a shortage in gas mask supplies.

- Exactly how often should we change our mattresses?
We should change it every 5 to 1O years.
An old mattress that's lost its supporting Ability, can be detrimental to your health.
Below are some signs of an ageing mattress.
You'll get back aches when you wake up.
Also, when you often wake up feeling very tired and still feel sleepy, as if you didn't have enough sleep.
-I feel the same when I buy a new bed.
You may have trouble falling asleep too.
-That is so bad.
Also the mattress gets noisy and smells bad.
It will smell bad too?
-Yes.
And lastly, if the mattress appears sunken...
What do you want to eat?
-Nas Kandar.
Have you given them their food?
I'll do it.
Do you want a drink?
Yes, I need water.
No, no thanks.
You don't want water?
No, I don't want it.
He doesn't want a drink.
Shiva, wake up.
What is it?
Wake up and sleep over there.
What?
Go sleep at your usual spot.
Who's coming?
Just get up and move over there.
Hurry up.
Hold on, hold on.
I'II move.
You're such a pain.
Always bringing strangers here to sleep.
My pitiful love, my pitiful love.
What is pitiful love but an execution ground?
Tears, death, misery and a fair lady, ridden by love and drowned by sorrow,
Sorrow in acts of kindness and of righteousness, a drop of kindness for a million sorrows,
I didn't know myself, so I sought the wisdom of Buddha,
But now, I learn the truth.
What is the use of praying?
Why even bother seeking Buddha's help?
Oh fly!
Fly away!
Fly oh Sister Hong!
Hurry, fly back to me.
I'll follow you through great storms.
And if I still can't find you,
I'd rather wear my monk's robes, and rest in my coffin.
Piao Hong!
Piao Hong....!
I vow to bring you back.
If you fly to the skies, I will fly to the skies.
If you sink to the ocean floor, I will sink to the ocean floor.
So, let it be, oh Sister!
Piao Hong!
Piao Hong!
My voice is weakened and my body frail,
but you are still not in sight.
Only the waves keep rolling by,
if not for you,
I would have flown, into the depths of an alligator's belly.
If not for you 'Sister Piao Hong',
I would have sunk into the ocean
deep under water,
pity this pitiful monk.
I cry and I cry but no one responds.
Sigh, my love,
pity this pitiful monk.

You know, there is a saying?
What is it?
Plum Blossom river is full of beauties, like tens of thousands of plum blossoms.
The composer is Yao In,
Yao Li's older brother.
Right.
And the lyricist is Chen Ge Xin.
This song is very meaningful.
Chen supposedly wrote it for himself.
He was in love with Lee Hsiang-Lan then.
Chen is said to have been very handsome.
Unfortunately, he was already engaged, or maybe even married.
You can imagine what it was like then.
Very conservative.
It was an ill-fated romance.
Besides, Lee Hsiang-Lan was a mega star.
That's why he wrote the song.
It was first called 'Untimely Romance'.
Back in those days, there were very few male singers.
So Lee Hsiang-Lan sang it in the end, and the title was changed to suit her.
A spring breeze in the winter night,
awakens my heart with a ripple.
Although only a brief moment of warmth, who can forget this dream we've lost?
It's prettier here.
Look outside.
Come over here, Mystery.
That's the taxi and bus stop over there.
Restaurants and banks.
Very convenient.
The houses here are all well designed.
Some of them have even been renovated.
It needs upgrading.
It's not worth it.
Don't worry, Mr Tan is a rich man.
Can I have a copy of the Land deed?
Of course, no problem.
You can check with the Land Office.
You only think about seeing the house.
Where will your brother live then?
Will your wife look after him?
You never come to visit us.
Except with a big group of strangers.
I'm tired of seeing you.
We'll talk about this later.
All the sweetness, regrets and sorrows are beyond any spoken words.
A room for two?
I need your ID,
a passport will do.
No, I need your passport.
The fire is sometimes 3m underground.
More time is needed to put out the fire.
On the other hand, the local police suspect that the fire may have been started by illegal workers who burn their rubbish in the open.
These foreign construction workers live in makeshift houses nearby.
Police are investigating the suspects.

Five thousand years ago, when Greece and Rome did not pass ... of distant dreams, a civilization conceived the impossible ... and built the unimaginable.
For millennia, the Egyptians built in dimensions ... much larger than all the others.
Enriched by his conquests and strengthened by their gods ... the indomitable pharaohs erected the first monolith stone of the ancient world.
The tallest building.
The oldest dam.
The most impregnable fortress.
The largest city.
And the supreme monument the ego of a ruler.
The message is clear:
Do not mess with Egypt.
The Egyptian engineers redefined the boundaries ... of architectural possibility.
But his path to eternal glory was permeated with blood ... betrayal and disaster.
Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET
Summer 3000 year.
C. ..
Rain clouds were forming above the Ethiopian ... 1.280km south of the Egyptian border.
Before long, a drizzle became torrent ... streams and awakened dormant with a furious flurry ... red as blood, due to sludge darkened by the sun of East Africa.
Downhill, these currents were joined to form the Blue Nile ... that sped before 1.360km colliding with his brother ... the White Nile in Sudan
States, both advancing northward, Egypt inside, like the Nile ... a central river ascending civilization.
If the flood did not occur that year, there would be famine.
No one would eat.
All Egyptians would be hungry.
If the flood was very strong, could destroy everything.
In late July, the Nile overflowed its banks ... and consumed the whole valley, leveling everything in its path.
Over 960km south of Egypt ... to the Mediterranean Sea, villages were flooded ... and thousands were homeless.
In Egypt, the flood is an annual event ... but the effects of the devastation could last a lifetime.
Excess water caused disasters of unimaginable proportions.
Fields were submerged and rotted.
Children surely die ... there was no possibility feeding families ... and even, as we know by some literary texts ... the worst times of hunger Cannibalism was ... and other terrible disasters.
While the flood swallowed every corner of Egypt ... his new capital, Memphis, remained dry ... thanks to the dam 16m that surrounded her.
It was the first dam recorded by history.
The force behind the dam and the city that protected ...
Menes was the first pharaoh the first Egyptian dynasty.
He was a warrior passionate about building ... and his army recently unify Upper and Lower Egypt ... into one great kingdom.
The first king of Egypt was much more powerful than ... because previous leaders had all Egypt under control.
The king was placed on earth by the gods ... to help maintain order ... and operation correct universe.
And he gives the Egyptians not only this life ... but also the afterlife.
In Memphis, Menes imposed his will on mother nature ... with the aid of an innovative building technology.
Hello, I'm Peter Weller.
The flood that describe happened several times .
in 5000 years history of Egypt.
There are few archaeological records the reign of Menes ... but we know that he gave very important steps ... prevention of major floods.
His engineers built a set of barriers ... to protect Memphis floods.
And this dam should be firm enough to change the course of the Nile ... and ensure the safety of Memphis.
The idea that a civilization of 5000 years ago ... has achieved this effect is simply outstanding.
Today, the dam built by Menes lost in the dust of ages ... but another old dam survives east of Memphis.
Known as El Sadd Kafara and dated 2700 BC, this ruin ... gives us an idea of the techniques Egyptian construction of dams.
Consisted of two massive walls stone with 11m height ... 5m unless the dam Menes.
The width of each wall ... was 24m at the base and 12m at the top.
Earth and boulders filled the space between them.
100 tons of stone and gravel were extracted ... and transported to build this dam ... and even more so that Menes built.
Five thousand years ago, a project of such magnitude required work and effort incalculable.
Today, if you say someone to carry ... a block of ten tons, this person ... will immediately hire a crane.
200 years ago, this was not necessary.
Three thousand years ago, it was also not necessary.
People did not think in machinery ... but in terms of skilled manpower.
The dam Menes lasted millennia but second archaeological evidence ...
Sadd El Kafara was monumental failure.
There is a range of 35m at its center ...
This suggests that broke under the water pressure should dam.
May have occurred a flood in some crucial ... dam construction.
The water entered ... and ruined absolutely everything.
For the ancient Egyptian engineers ... pioneering projects never designed ... disasters were part the learning process.
There was no precedent for the kind ...
Construction they created.
They knew they wanted represent the power of the pharaohs and ... to look at the world around, had only nature as a guide.
It was necessary to use your imagination ... and use many natural materials.
The mysterious pharaoh Menes was fundamental transition in Egypt ... a coalition of tribal farmers ... for a regional superpower.
They say that his reign lasted 62 years.
ended abruptly when it was ... injured by a hippo during a hunt.
But the dam he built still standing ... long after the last pharaoh returned to the gods.
She was the cornerstone the legacy builder of Egypt ... a feat that would inspire generations pharaohs to undertake ... works increasing and bolder.
Egypt is on the way between Africa and the Middle East.
It is the presence of this river, the Nile, making it the only country ... the Sahara desert a nature reserve with water.
Since when humans began to walk upright ... there are hundreds of thousands of years, they were attracted here ... for the river.
nitially, the nomadic tribes migrating from sub-Saharan Africa ... to the Middle East, following the course of the Nile.
Later, with the emergence of agriculture ... in 9000 BC, the tribes ... settled permanently on its banks.
When Menes finally united all under one flag ... more or less 3,000 B.C. was born the Egyptian Empire.
Since then, several human dramas permeated the history of Egypt.
But the Nile remains the only constant presence.
And despite the occasional catastrophic floods ... he is the reason why the first empire of the world came here ... and not elsewhere.
At the dawn of the third millennium BC, with the consolidation ... the Egyptian city-states By means of achievement ... the river that has long represented basic survival ... assumed a new role, The expansion engine ... territorial and economic unprecedented.
A network of ports and channels was constructed to approximate ... distant regions and irrigate a desert landscape.
Barges have become huge trucks of the time ... and channels formed equivalent an interstate highway system.
The Egyptians did not need worry about roads and wheels ... because they had the Nile because the river runs from south to north ... and it was possible to use the wind to go from north to south.
After the Egyptians made channels for walking ... in east-west directions and go elsewhere.
They were great builders channels.
And engineers built canals with miles long.
And they were used to carry all ... want to be a large number of people ... they were grains, food or stones.
Almost 2000 years before the Romans build the first huts ... the pharaohs were building on an unprecedented scale.
And for the first time in history, technology revolutionizing ... not only the way people lived, but also as a die.
Nowhere in the ingenuity of Ancient Egyptians was more apparent ... than their superb tombs.
The concept of life after the death of Ancient Egypt ... is very different the Judeo-Christian concept.
For example, it is much more palpable.
The dead need us.
Their survival is somehow important ... for everything to work properly.
Tombs are stone houses, underground homes ... because you will live there after death.
It is your home after death.
Initially, the tombs of the Pharaohs ... were simple brick structures called "Mastabas."
They consisted of two main elements.
a superstructure rectangular surface ... that could be visited by priests and loved ones ... and a sub-chamber sealed and underground.
These chambers housed the sarcophagus of King ... and all he could need in eternity.
and all he Could need in eternity.
They clearly believed who would live ... the underground parts of the tombs.
As their graves became more sophisticated ... pharaohs began building separate altars ... so that the priests worship their spirits.
It was the first step in the evolution the royal tombs ... mere mastabas the colossal complex that still ... dominate the Egyptian desert:
The Pyramids.
In total, the ancient Egyptians erected over a hundred.
Eighty still standing and contain stone and mortar sufficient to ... build a wall of 3m high by 1.5 m thick ...
New York to Los Angeles.
The volume of rock that was brought from quarries all over Egypt ... placed, neat and positioned at the construction site ... and the whole organization was required for this ... is in my opinion, awesome for us.
Today, the pyramids remain the biggest attraction of antiquity.
But there were successes sudden.
It took six Pharaohs four generations of builders ... and many engineering disasters to achieve such perfect proportions.
The pyramid builders began their search ... the architectural perfection in a place called Saqqara.
It was there, in the year of 2667 A.C. ... that Zoser, a pharaoh young entrepreneur ... first ordered superstructure Stone world.
Your project tomb solidify the position of Egypt ... how civilization world's most advanced ... and raise his pioneering architect the status of a god.
2667 a.
C...
In Egypt a new king was crowned.
Zoser was the second ruler the period of the Old Empire.
Zoser earned reputation of wise and pious ruler.
Two millennia after his death ... he remained a model to be imitated by the pharaohs.
During his reign, was so popular ... which ceased to be a mere mortal in the minds of his subjects ... and became the first pharaoh to be worshiped as God.
He was worshiped later the 19th Dynasty as ...
"He who Opens the Stone" which is quite significant.
They made a connection between Zoser and the discovery of the stone.
One of the first acts of Zoser when he took power ... was ordering the construction his tomb complex ... last resting place that would have vital importance ... in their eternal destiny.
It was a traditional concept, because the kings of Egypt built ... sumptuous tombs for centuries.
But the result of this time would be revolutionary.
In addition to its unprecedented scale, the tomb complex of Zoser ... would be different from their predecessors in something fundamental ... would not be built brick, but stone.
Much of the rest of the world, as the Americas and Europe ... was not far from simply stacking stones.
There was activity in Mesopotamia.
There was no large-scale architecture, made with adobe bricks.
But Egypt is a special case, it is simply unique ... the use of stone at that time.
To extract the stone the grave of his dreams ...
Zoser turned to his right arm.
An architect of humble named Imhotep.
Imhotep was not only the real architect ... was also treasurer High Priest and Grand Vizier ... equivalent position the Prime Minister.
But it was his pioneering work the funerary complex of Zoser ... that gave him immortality.
Even the Romans themselves, great engineers ... come to worship him as a god.
But the architectural revolution Imhotep ... that would culminate in the building the first pyramid in the world ... did not begin with a sudden revelation.
Initially, he intended only build the largest mastaba of Egypt.
The first step of the process was to select a ... location for the pharaoh's tomb.
Choosing a place for the tomb was a complicated matter.
The sun rose in the east and went down in the west, died in the west.
And if you're like the sun god, would be buried in the west.
But the graves should be facing east ... facing the rising sun ... with the promise of rebirth and resurrection.
Chose Zoser Saqqara, a national cemetery ... dating back to the time of King Menes.
It is on the west side of the Nile ... adjacent to the Egyptian capital, Memphis.
With the chosen location, the task Next was to gather hand labor.
The portal of the pharaoh to the afterlife ... would have to be built with the sweat of his subjects.
When we talk about slavery, normal ... is thinking about what happened with blacks in the past.
It is clear that in Egypt there was this kind of slavery.
But the idea that ordinary Egyptians ... went to work on the pyramid of Pharaoh ... imbued with a sense of love also is probably an exaggeration.
The workers would be awarded with food ... beers, clothes and exemption from taxes.
Were organized into divisions 20 men each.
Altogether, these 500 divisions totaling 10,000 men ... were employed to build the funerary complex of Zoser.
In addition, thousands women had the task of ... to maintain men clothed and fed.
What is important the construction of the pyramids ... are not only engineering techniques, but administration.
how to organize more than ten thousand workers?
They lived in barracks, 55 workers each.
they worked cutting the stones in the quarry ... then took a day off ... to hunt or fish in the Nile.
With his team work to put ...
Imhotep began construction of first stone structure in the world.
But before building up, needed to build down.
He began digging a vertical shaft 7m wide ... by 28m deep, to house the sarcophagus of the pharaoh.
Then the workers of Imhotep dug a second well ... where would be taken the body of the pharaoh.
Across the burial chamber had underground chambers ... which serve as royal palace in the afterlife.
Approximately 304m south ... the second tomb complex was opened in bedrock.
How many pharaohs before and after him ...
Zoser had two tombs.
Each serve a essential spiritual purpose.
In the tomb of the north, his body mummified would be buried.
In the south, their internal organs be preserved ... in canopic jars.
During mummification was one of the important parts ... emptying the body cavity and take all the internal organs.
If they were left there, the body rot and ... basically explode.
Thus, the lungs and the liver ... the stomach and intestines were were then removed and dried ... the use of a combination salt and sodium bicarbonate.
Then, after drying by, I do not know, a few weeks ... they were cleaned, greased, wrapped in bandages ... and placed into boxes.
The mummified body Zoser is buried ... this labyrinth of tunnels under his Step Pyramid in Saqqara here.
Nearly 7km secret passages here ... they are completely banned for tourists ... since it tends to collapse the ceiling, from time to time.
At the time Moses left Egypt ... it was here over a thousand years.
The purpose of the tunnels is still a mystery.
Some may have served to confuse grave robbers.
Others may have been own work of thieves.
But since hardly anyone comes here ... nobody knows what we'll find turning a corner.
As a secret passage or a staircase.
It is very easy to get confused here.
For example, if you arrive ... at an intersection and go right ... which should have gone to left, are lost.
I'm getting very close to the room where Zoser was buried ... but rather there are several rooms ... which will serve as a kind of memorial palace.
Here, these rooms are the luxuries Zoser that would ... in life after death, or the mummies of their relatives.
It is remarkable that I has fallen this pyramid ... hundreds of meters and give face with this room perfect.
Here are ... the bones of relatives Zoser ... as well.
Engineers Zoser built dozens of rooms ... like this, for your palace mortuary.
Down here, we find this ... a bandage mummy.
Or pottery 5000 years.
Or this wall ornate ... with this beautiful inlay seawater.
Or these hieroglyphs so well preserved ... they seem carved yesterday.
I'm sitting on the camera Zoser's main mortuary.
Above me, there's a will, as you can see.
The body was lowered and deposited here.
This room is the center the funerary complex of Zoser.
Before, it was sustained by these beams of Phoenicia ... what is now Lebanon, and should have 4600 years.
Are as close as possible Zoser's tomb ... and some people say that precedes this area.
Well here is the sarcophagus made of alabaster massive ... which is perhaps the sarcophagus a relative of Zoser.
above is the Step Pyramid.
Perhaps, the first construction stone on the planet.
But that's only half the story, what we see on earth ... is only half because it is down here that is ... the real palace funeral Zoser.
And sure enough was done to a pharaoh very powerful ... and working with the best engineers of Egypt.
With the construction of the substructure the funerary complex of Zoser ... ongoing, Imhotep Minded superstructure above ... that would protect against the outside world.
With limestone mountains and a extensive hand labor at their disposal ...
Imhotep proceeded with fingers crossed ... towards an unknown frontier.
2659 a.c.
Centuries before Stonehenge the Egyptians were building the first ... stone structure in the world.
A colossal tomb complex for the pharaoh Zoser.
Ahead project was Imhotep ... real architect of Zoser.
On a hill of limestone near of Saqqara, thousands of workers ... inaugurated a new industry, "quarrying".
They perfected the system cutting, extracting ... and transporting huge blocks construction.
His first challenge was to carve the surface of the hill ... symmetrical slabs.
The mining was done grinding the rock ... em sulcos com martelos de pedra.
And it was only with the effort, digging ditches ... and stacking the blocks and then cutting them down ... to roll them out of the quarry.
Once extracted, the stones were swept deserts tortuous ... the quarry to the construction site, using nothing but ropes ... sleds, muscles and sweat.
Everything indicates that they knew the wheel.
But for dragging heavy objects on the sand ... the wheel was not very appropriate.
Sleds were much more appropriate ... and that was what they used.
With the design of your tomb in safe hands ...
Zoser turned his attention the strengthening of the empire.
He was a pioneer in mining in the Sinai Peninsula ... fattening the coffers of the nation ... with regular supplies turquoise and copper.
He also extended the southern border of Egypt to Aswan ... the first call cataract of the Nile ... would remain the limit Southern nation.
After 10 years of reign Pharaoh still felt strong ... and sent the Egyptian tradition that works in his grave ... continue until his death.
With the ground floor finished and plenty of time ... to build more and better Imhotep started ... a series of expansions to revolutionize architecture.
About his mastaba, he added a second smaller ... a third of this then a fourth ... stacking them as layers of a wedding cake.
E le, then wanted to make it even bigger ... extending the four layers to the west ... about them and adding two more.
The tomb of Zoser assumed gradually a different format ... all that the Egyptians had seen.
This new structure would be known as the Step Pyramid.
It's almost like Imhotep worked ... in architectural form this simple structure ... whole evolution of the hills that existed ... before that big construction ... that set the standard for all the pyramids that came after.
After nearly two decades of work ... the Step Pyramid of Zoser ... stayed with the height of 20 floors.
Around her, a complex ... under construction establish a new standard for real burial mounds.
To the north, a small palace was built.
Adjacent to it, two houses ceremonial ... represented the high and lower Egypt.
Surrounding the entire complex higher a football stadium ... a robust wall of limestone reached a height of three storeys.
Today, as in priscas eras, the only way into the complex ... is through a gate torreante colonnades that contains ... the first forty stone columns already raised on the ground.
Each of 10m and measuring its finish testifies ... amateurism engineering at the time of Imhotep.
Fearing that its columns tombassem, architect ... each coupled to a wall to support them.
They built this way because they knew it was possible ... erect a stone pillar sustain that.
They were in a the steps of the architecture ... it was trial and error.
Zoser died in the 2648 a.c ...
His reign of 19 years was a time ... innovation edifying unprecedented.
When word got out his death ... people from the cantons Egypt's most remote ... came mourn him.
There was a grand procession who left the Valley ... with priests, professional mourners ... they were shouting, tearing their hair ... and crying the death of the king.
Maybe a boy named Seneferu ... were present the last farewell of Zoser.
Seneferu grow in the shade Step Pyramid of ... and one day rule Egypt.
As pharaoh, would be obsessed with achieve perfection in engineering.
But his relentless desire build a pyramid better ...
Pharaonic cause disasters.
2613 a.c. ... 35 years after the death of Zoser ... a pharaoh called Seneferu ascended the throne ... and founded the 4th Dynasty of Egypt.
He was the son of a pharaoh previous Huni ... but his mother was a queen secondary.
Thus, to consolidate its claim to the throne ...
Seneferu married his half-sister Hetepheres ... whose royal blood was purer.
In the royalty of ancient Egypt ... these incestuous alliances were almost routine.
Forget the "half-sister".
Egyptian pharaohs often ... intermarried with blood sisters.
And the reason for this dates back to Egyptian mythology.
The gods were married.
Iris and Osiris are brother and sister.
To marry his own sister ...
King behaves like a god.
Craving divine status ...
Seneferu sought to raise sympathy of his subjects.
He drove to the peasants as "my friend" or "my brother."
In order to transcend the shadow cast the opulent reign of Zoser ...
Seneferu embarked in a relentless search ... the perfect engineering that would make him a legend.
According to the Greeks, there were seven wonders in the ancient world ... the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Colossus of Rhodes ... the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, and the Pyramids of Egypt.
But all these wonders ... only survived the pyramids time and man.
It is the realm of Seneferu that provides the essential link ... between the step pyramid, innovative but primitive ... and the Great Pyramid of Cheops at Giza ... three generations later which is considered the pinnacle ...
Construction of pyramids.
Was Seneferu who corrected the flaws during a hard ... process of trial and error, and became the engineering of the pyramids ... in an art.
Seneferu managed funds these projects ... defeating their neighbors.
He sacked the Nubia, Libya, the Sinai Peninsula ... and among his subjects, received the title "Destroyer of Barbarians".
It consolidated its reputation as one of ... the history of the greatest pharaohs Egito.
The first challenge Seneferu appeared in Meidum ... cemetery south of Saqqara.
Ali, the ruins of his pyramid collapsed ... today dominate the desert landscape.
The pyramid is a Meidum puzzles.
She collapsed?
The stone was simply stolen?
Remained unfinished?
There are several questions.
Meidum represents a decisive step the construction of the pyramids.
The core consisted of the pyramid eight stone floors ... high at a sharp angle.
Seneferu ordered the decks were filled ... up and down with stones.
Then coated the frame with a layer of polished white limestone ... giving you the smooth sides he wanted.
It's as if he did not want to use Seneferu the stairs:
He wanted a lift.
He had an abstract that drove ... straight to heaven, that is what makes the pyramid.
It represents, concretely, the immaterial thing of all ... the rays of the sun light.
Apparently, the new version Pyramid was a success ... but beneath his bright facade had a problem.
If you look at a pyramid today, it seems to have stripes.
These stripes represent smooth outer face ... of two pyramids of internal steps.
They clearly do not have much friction, then to build something ... beside them, if it starts to slide, there is not much ... to hold in place.
Today, 4600 years after the construction Pyramid Meidum ... are clearly visible the signs of their destruction.
Only 3 of the original floor 8 remain intact ... and the shell added later ... lies on a huge lot at the base.
Should be evidence of catastrophic collapse?
I do not believe the theory that the pyramid collapsed Meidum ... is true, because we have evidence that in the New Kingdom ... there was a man who came visit the pyramid.
He spoke of his glory.
If she had fallen during the Old Kingdom ... he would not talk about her glory.
But what did next seems Seneferu confirm the theory of collapse.
In its second decade as pharaoh, he abandoned the pyramid Meidum ... and started another at Dahshur ... a desert region very close to Saqqara.
Ali, his engineers began the construction of the first pyramid ... itself.
But as the work progressed ... they turn on the brink of another disaster.
When she was about halfway ... seems to have been some difficulty ... which generated some kind structural damage.
In the inner apartments of the pyramid, no cracks ... cracks in structures.
And one of the arguments is that ... the pyramid was built on shaky ground.
Á as they climbed the pyramid ... the inner apartments began to show cracks ... and they had to reduce weight.
Seneferu was determined not abandon his second pyramid ... despite its flaws.
The builders rushed to shore structure problematic ... increasing its founding in more 15m on all sides.
Then to build vertically did something even more drastic:
Abruptly changed the angle inclination of 54 º to 43 º.
Today, the building is awkward known as Pyramid Curve.
The Pyramid Romboidal is one of my favorites.
It shows the man ... trying to fix.
Although Seneferu insisted on complete your Pyramid Curve ... archaeological evidence suggests ... the king was not satisfied.
Another pyramid, only 1.5 km to the north.
Registration nearby indicates that ... known as Red Pyramid, also belonged to Seneferu.
After failing twice in its mission to build ... the first pyramid perfect story ...
Seneferu risked all the remaining resources of Egypt:
Hand labor, money, and the best engineers ... in a last attempt to glory.
What we see at this time determination is a fantastic ... in creating the ideal shape of the pyramid.
It must have been so great a will worth spending exorbitant ... emptying the state coffers ... and an enormous amount of workers, we imagine ... to extract stones and build these grand monuments.
Build a third pyramid for the same pharaoh ... mean drain the resources of the nation ... but Seneferu, astute politician who was ... could sell their fish and finance his obsession edifying.
Seneferu was a genius public relations.
He was the first king to use his personal name ... and not a special name for the throne.
He debased to win, so to speak.
It has become more accessible ... to become larger, most famous and most divine.
In order to avoid structural problems that had plagued earlier ... engineers of Seneferu chose ... an inclination angle more gradual the Red Pyramid ... and also strengthened its foundation ... using large blocks Best limestone.
These new blocks were much larger in size.
And builders were confident ... to move and position correctly huge blocks of stone ... weighing several tons, instead of small blocks ... which were used the Step Pyramid.
To drag each stone to their final destination ... 20 men pulled on a sled wood on a ramp ... made of clay, stone and gravel.
Water was poured in front of the sled to reduce friction.
4600 years later, there is no consensus ... regarding the configuration of the ramps.
Three theories prevail:
The 1st is a huge ramp and straight was erected on a side of the pyramid.
The theory says that there were two systems of spiral ramps around her.
And the 3rd theory advocates a combining the first two.
Never find evidence these ramps around the pyramids.
Everyone has a theory, but we can not be completely sure ... how they were real
After all stones were stacked ... stone ridge and put on top ... a coating of fine white limestone overlaid abroad.
The builders worked from top to bottom ... polishing the coating with copper chisels.
The finish of the cover exterior of the pyramids ... must have been a labor highly specialized.
Can you have a good idea what must have happened ... at Dahshur, the pyramid Romboidal.
You can stand under and look straight up ... you can see it is still smooth.
The covering is kept smooth so far.
It's like looking at a glass surface.
It took three attempts and many decades, but in the end ... the search for perfection Seneferu had huge success.
Behind me is Red Pyramid, the first ... true pyramid ever built.
Engineers Seneferu found not only ... the secret to building a monument smooth and symmetrical ... but also dominated the process of building ... open saloon inside.
The chambers within the Red Pyramid ... can be accessed through an opening to 28m high at its northern side.
At the end of a long corridor it falls back to the ground floor ... space opens in first three quarters ... built to house the remains of Seneferu and its immortal treasures.
Build a camera huge, like this ... within the superstructure a pyramid ... was a unique challenge to an engineer old ... because of the pressure that was top of tons ... stones forcing down.
And to distribute this pressure, builders Seneferu ... created an ingenious innovation:
The vaulted ceiling.
They made steps on the sides, about 10cm ... in each step, and then built a kind of ... form of an inverted pyramid the ceiling of the burial chamber.
Then we come to a narrow point at the top ... that sustains easily.
The innermost chamber in Red Pyramid is the burial chamber.
whose roof rises to 15m.
It was here in 50, which were discovered the bones of a middle-aged ... but there were no entries to identify it ... then we have no idea who it was.
Some Egyptologists think were the bones of Seneferu own.
Others say no, that the pharaoh was buried ... the Pyramid Romboidal, because she has ... a complex funerary more complete.
In any case, we do not know what happened to Seneferu.
It is a mystery that perhaps never be unraveled.
The reign of three decades of Seneferu ended around 2589 a.
C. ..
But its monuments assured him immortality.
Excavations at Dahshur revealed ... 2000 years after the death of Seneferu ... offerings of incense were still made in his memory.
The son and successor of Seneferu, Cheops ... would build on the foundation left by his father ... and create a greater and more perfect pyramid ever built.
The great pyramid of Giza.
Each of the four sides of the Great Pyramid is almost perfectly symmetrical ... rising at an angle need 51.
When Khufu raised his torreante monument ... the period of the Old Empire was at the height of his wealth and power.
But in the space of four centuries, the great empire of the pyramids ... submerged in darkness.
In XXII and XXI centuries.
A.c. ..
drought, famine and chaos consumed the country.
Until a new strain pharaohs emerged from the South ..
willing to restore the lost glory of Egypt.
his relentless military campaigns would expand ... the borders of the empire more than ever, leaving behind ... a trail of blood, fear and impenetrable fortifications ... renew the stranglehold of Egypt and its absolute power.
1864 a.c. ..
A warrior pharaoh spread terror by Nubia ... in a devastating campaign of conquest.
It was the Egyptian period Empire of the Middle ... remembered by later generations ... as "The Golden Age" of Egypt.
Pharaoh was Sesostris III ... and its purpose was threefold guard the southern border ... control the routes Nubia and commercial ... plunder the most gold Nubian that his troops could carry.
Nubia, to begin with, was very important to the Egyptians ... because it was a source of gold.
And gold was paramount importance to them.
The path to the gold spent by a group of warriors Nubians ... known as quermanos.
Sesostris had a great and well organized army ... but had quermanos a deadly weapon.
The Nubians were known, even in the early Middle Ages ... for being excellent archers.
The Arab invaders called them of "shooters pupils" ... they could set eyes Riders who attacked.
The quermanos were a formidable obstacle ... but Sesostris, pensive figure, towering ... and commanding presence, was not an opponent whatsoever.
In many cases, we can not say anything ...
On the personality of a king, or about its nature.
On the personality of a king, or about its nature.
However, Sesostris is an exception, because we have it ... a series of portraits who survived ... and do not resemble anything that was produced for the previous kings.
In the portraits, Sesostris appears sometimes ... arrogant, sad.
He's thrilled, this is very, very human.
The experience did something to him.
It is a pharaoh that has personality ... has depth in his face ... he shows sadness, concern and age.
His face reflects his concern for the people of Egypt.
As quermanos discover, the love of his people by Pharaoh ... did not extend to his enemies.
His army swept Nubia taking treasures and territories ... leaving a trail death and destruction.
In a monument to the kingdom horror at its southern border ...
Sesostris boasted of having burnt plantations of the enemy ... killed their men, enslaved their wives and children ... and poisoned their wells.
It comes as a Roman general.
He goes on to say: "He who protects my borders is my son.
He descended from me. but that not protect my boundary ... than advocates this is not my son.
He is not descended from me. " It is quite surprising and direct.
As his army advancing southward Sesostris rose ... in the Nile Valley, a series of imposing fortresses ... would guard the border Nubia and exhibit the power ...
Egyptians and superiority.
This was built for more than 3700 years ago ... at a time when the architecture military was not known.
Maybe just huts.
In the army of antiquity, they lived in huts.
But for the Egyptians, have thought it was very clever ... because they knew Nubia was very important.
And they knew the danger that could come from there.
The ruins of fortresses constructed by Sesostris ... stood still in the twentieth century ... stood still in the twentieth century ......
And still here.
But there's just one little problem ... making visits a bit complicated ... they are all at the bottom This lake of crocodiles.
This is Nassar an artificial lake formed ... the construction of the dam Aswan, in the 60s.
He has more than 600km wide and 120m deep.
And all traces fortresses of the Middle Kingdom ... are lost in its depths.
One of the greatest strengths of Sesostris was built in Buhen ... mercantile center since the former empire.
The fortress had Buhen extension two soccer fields and ... employed technology used by strongholds of the European Middle Ages.
Had never been built nothing like the Fortress Buhen ... in the ancient Mediterranean world.
One reason to be so important from the point of view of engineering ... is that it had layers of defense and positioning points ... for archers, where they could shoot arrows ... in all directions against an invading army.
Even outside these walls there was a gap ... and after the pit wall.
So any enemy army who tried to attack the fortress ... had to climb this wall, pass through the gap ... expose yourself to archers outer walls ... and there were still two walls fortified ... before reaching the interior the fortress.
The fortress could Buhen accommodate thousand soldiers ... including captive Nubians required to serve for six years ... in Pharaoh's army.
At the end of his reign, the network of forts Sesostris .
stretched over 320km south of Aswan ...
Sudan of today, and solidified Egyptian dominance in the region.
Sesostris reigned for 39 years.
For centuries after his death, in 1831 a.
C. ..
their garrisons protected the border Nubia.
But they were not always composed of Egyptians.
Over the next two centuries, his achievements were abandoned ... as the Middle Kingdom be dismantled.
He became brittle, weakened.
Kerma emerged as a power in Nubia and fortresses ... just passing for control of Kerma ... apparently with no sign of great conflict and destruction.
While quermanos resurfaced in the south, the ... warrior tribe of the Middle East, known as the Hyksos ... conquered the north.
The once glorious Egyptian Empire disintegrated.
Egypt remained surrounded during the next 100 years.
But in the sixteenth century BC, a new empire of native pharaohs ... would rise and reinstate the preeminence of Egypt.
Among these monarchs, There was a queen opportunistic ... that exceed the barrier between sexes and obtain absolute power ... 14 centuries before Birth of Cleopatra.
1479 a.c.
Death of the Pharaoh Thutmose II left a power vacuum in the royal palace.
Your child with a woman from his harem was proclaimed king Thutmose III ... but he was a child and could not govern alone.
Então a rainha viúva, Hatchepsut, decidiu preencher o vácuo de poder.
She became co-regent of the boy, but reigned as pharaoh legitimate.
Hatshepsut began to reach political power and increasing ... by the seventh year of the reign set of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III ... she began to call herself "king".
Hatshepsut should not reign because in Ancient Egypt ... only men ruled.
Women, no.
For her sex did not constitute obstacle, she changed.
Your body has acquired contours male ... and she wore as accessory Traditional Egyptian beard.
Your body no longer possessed female characteristics.
To be taken seriously as pharaoh, Hatshepsut knew ...
I needed to build as a.
Thus, to immortalize his reign, she ordered a huge ... mortuary temple on the bank west of Thebes, hometown ... and power base of the Pharaohs new empire.
It would serve as an altar for her spirit after death ... and perpetuate their association with the gods.
To build it, she enlisted his royal architect, Senemut.
He was a commoner who had a relationship very special woman pharaoh.
Many feel that the relationship between Hatshepsut and Senemut was ... more than professional.
And it is true that ... well there are some obscene graffiti, with their names ... show the positions compromising ... and this feeds the rumor.
independently loving your talent ...
Senemut demonstrated be an excellent engineer.
The Temple of Hatshepsut in Deir el-Bahari is a proof perennial ... of his genius and a testament his undying dedication.
He did this with the feeling of love ... not as a service for the queen.
No.
He did it for his beloved, Hatshepsut.
And for this reason, the temple is special.
It is different from all other temples of Egypt.
Today, the temple is surrounded by desert.
But in ancient times, gardens and lakes made ?
him ... one of the superb monuments in the world.
It stands on three levels terraces built ... the slope of a limestone hill.
The terraces are linked by a wide central staircase.
The upper levels are suspended for long colonnaded porticoes.
The inner walls of one of them ... there are reliefs depicting the divine origin of Hatshepsut.
The mortuary temple Hatshepsut was ... in fact, a great propaganda vehicle.
There is a scene showing the god Amon approaching their mother.
Then there are a species of intimate moment ... after which is designed Hatshepsut with the help of various goddesses.
And in the next scene, she appears being hailed ... with a great ovation various gods, and proclaimed ...
Pharaoh by divine right.
In Deir el-Bahari, the architect Senemut managed to create ... a temple unmatched for a pharaoh without equal.
The project took 15 years to complete, during which the stepson ...
Hatshepsut, Thutmose, the young pharaoh heir came of age.
Soon he would claim his rightful throne.
To stay in power, Hatshepsut launched an advertising campaign ... to remind his subjects that she was descended from a god.
She designed a series sumptuous monuments ... to convey this message, obelisks propagandizing ... his bond with Amon-Ra.
The format of the obelisk is quite simple.
It is a high tower and solid four side ... with a pyramid-shaped tip, carved from a whole piece ... and decorated in relief.
At first glance, an obelisk can not seem a great feat of engineering.
But if you think about it, is one of buildings more artistic ... and impressive of all time.
The history of obelisks began the former granite quarry in Aswan.
The 184km south of Thebes.
Was left where the majority ... the Egyptian obelisks, and where a still lies unfinished ... carved on three sides.
With 42m tall and weighing over 1100 tons ...
I stand on what should have been the largest obelisk in the world ... if it had been completed.
It was abandoned when cracked.
But, nowadays, this obelisk still gives us a good idea ... how they were carved.
workers entalhavam granite ...
Ball diabase, like this one.
The diabase is harder than granite, so if you slam ... for a long time, will form chips.
For carving an obelisk this size ... were the experts think required 130 men ... for an entire year.
So, imagine yourself beating ... and hammering a stone for a year of your life ... and then see what you was working crack ... and you have to leave.
Well, in one respect, they were lucky:
They did not need transport.
Once the needle is thought free from its bed of granite ... the next challenge was to carry it, often for hundreds of miles, to its final destination.
To do this, engineers Egyptians resorted ... the old and trusted Nile and used the annual flood ... to their advantage.
The problem of transporting blocks of stone statues ... and obelisks, it was moved a huge amount of water and ... the hulls of the boats touched the bottom Nile and sometimes washed up onto.
So, it was better try to carry ... these huge pieces of stone during flood ... when the waters rose and left the bed of the Nile ... much deeper.
After the obelisk was sent downstream, engineers ... faced its last and biggest obstacle:
Lift it.
How exactly ... they did it was a mystery, but there is a current theory ... about the process.
First, builders settled a base granite ... strong enough to withstand the weight of the obelisk.
Then surrounding this base a wall of bricks ... and this enclosure was filled with sand.
On both sides of the wall towered brick ramps.
Using ropes and sleds beneath the obelisk ... workers pulled the cart up a ramp, as they went down by another ... until it aprumasse in the sand.
The sand was then removed gradually, with the obelisk ... held vertically to sit on its base.
Unfortunately for Hatshepsut, his reign did not end smoothly.
Around 1459 a.
C, her beloved Architect Senemut ... disappeared without a trace.
The following year, the Queen herself perished under mysterious circumstances.
The most powerful woman in Egypt patroness of the most modern ... architectural feat of empire waned in history.
Do not know much about how she died.
His body was never found.
We find the grave, but did not find the body.
And this is another mystery we are investigating.
35 centuries later there are no clues.
But there is a prime suspect, Hatshepsut's stepson ...
Thutmose III.
So long stifled by stepmother perhaps the rightful heir ... got rid of it.
After he took over, the statues and monuments of Hatshepsut ... were destroyed and her name, erased from official records.
Tuthmose shaft becoming a great conqueror ... extending the frontiers of the empire more than any other pharaoh ... from Syria to central Sudan.
After Thutmose III ruled Egypt first of these territories.
They were vassals of the Egyptian king.
In this sense, he was a conqueror.
1200 years after the construction the first pyramid ...
Egypt was the height of its power.
But just when he seemed invincible emerged a pharaoh revolutionary ... to shake the foundations of the empire.
His worship of a single god would generate the construction of a new capital ... designed to position itself as the center of the universe.
Thebes, the 1352.
A.c. ...
The temple of Karnak epicenter of the Egyptian society ... was in great expectation.
The beloved pharaoh Amenhotep III had died and his son ...
Amenhotep IV was about to become ... the most powerful man on earth.
The new Pharaoh did not take long to show signs that his reign would be quite different.
The name Amenhotep means "Amun is satisfied".
With the rise of the new empire and the prominence of Thebes ... as the main city of Egypt, Amon was elevated to king of the gods.
The priests of Amun were concentrated here, in the temple of Karnak.
These priests controlled one-third of wealth throughout Egypt.
And when it comes to religion, which they were sent.
But the new pharaoh, Amenhotep IV, had no intention ... to let someone else send in anything.
Thus began the struggle classic between church and state.
There were several gods associated Ammon and one was Ra ... spiritual strength invisible behind the sun.
The shape and the rays of the sun, or what we can see ... was a God named Aton, Amenhotep and developed ... one entire religion around Aten, less than a god until then ... had secondary role.
But thanks to the new Pharaoh ... he was elevated to a new status.
On a trip north in the fifth year of his reign ...
Amenhotep encountered an excerpt protected desert ... torreantes by limestone hills.
Ali, Aton told him, saying that one where the creation began.
deeply moved by this spiritual encounter ...
Pharaoh changed his name to Akhenaten, which means the server Aton.
He decided to abandon the capital Egypt, Thebes, modern Luxor ... and build a new city this virgin site, the 288km.
Imagine if President U.S. closed the Capitol ... change everything to Texas and said ...
"The new Capitol will be here."
Imagine what would happen people in Washington.
It was the same with people of Luxor ... suddenly, everyone loses their job, the center of power is shifted ... and they have to follow Akhenaton to a new place.
The rebel pharaoh called their new city of Akhetaten ... meaning horizon of Aten.
Is now known as Amarna ... and retains little of the enormous structures that made ?
her ... the most thriving metropolis Egyptian for more than 3300 years.
Akhenaten wanted your city built immediately ... to be able to move soon.
His impatience stimulated its engineers ... to invent a new how to build fast.
Their response was a technological innovation ... small blocks of limestone cut into standard size ... to be easily loaded and stacked.
The blocks called "talatat" by archaeologists ... were precursors of the modern old Materials prefabricated building.
The "talatat" were very useful because become very fast ... the construction of buildings.
Were not needed ... those huge groups of workers pulling blocks.
It is much easier have several people loading ... each block and using them as bricks.
The city's project was equally innovative.
Amarna covering 61.44 km ², 12.8 km along the east bank of the Nile ... and 4.8 km inland.
Its design was irradiated ... the royal tomb as sunlight emanating from the spirit of the king.
A royal road ran parallel the river, connecting the city center ... the palaces and temples of Pharaoh.
He went to a place untouched.
A place completely clean ... and there established a city.
That is why it is special.
Akhetaten was perhaps the first planned city in the world ... and the most important.
The new city of Akhenaton sprouted with unprecedented speed.
Within two years of its founding was home to 20,000 people ... and had all the necessary facilities to meet a growing population.
The city limits were demarcated by great monuments ... called boundary stelae.
Several of these have survived ... and their applications transmit in a very accurate ... that land was consecrated to the god Aton.
In Amarna, Pharaoh had created their own universe ... placing oneself and his family at the center of it.
In all representations of Amarna all who are not part ... the royal family appear bent, always bowing ...
Akhenaten and the royal family.
He appears to have required ... people bowed in his presence in a way ... never seen between the earlier pharaohs.
The Sun King had four major palaces in your city.
Each serving a personal purpose and spiritual.
The only surviving mode discernible is the palace of the north.
Traces of stables and fabulous frescoed with wild birds ... found here, indicating this is the private retreat of the pharaoh.
But there is also evidence a garden paradise ... and a throne room with colonnades where Akhenaten may have received ... important visits.
Obsession by Pharaoh magnitudes stretched ... the sacred sites of Amarna.
Three miles south of palace of the north lie the ruins ... a complex known how small temple of Aton.
The word "small" is inappropriate.
The complex covers almost 6.503m ² ... an area twice the White House.
The entire temple was once surrounded by a brick wall.
Inside were three courtyards, separated by Cyclopean walled gates ... called pylons.
Religious belief of Egypt The pylons are associated ... the two mountains on the horizon.
So when a god ... enters or leaves the temple by these pylons, it's like the sun ... was rising or setting in the mountains on the horizon.
Within the first pylon of the temple, had a courtyard with rows of tables ... offerings and a ramp rising the high altar of bricks.
Then there was another courtyard, which contained the home of the resident priest.
In the third pylon, was the heart of the temple ... the holy of holies inhabited the spirit of Aton.
Some archaeologists believe the small temple of Aton ... may serve as a sanctuary permanent spirit of Akhenaten.
Increasingly turned for religion ...
Pharaoh neglected government affairs.
In the second decade of his reign, he began to lose control ... about the Egyptian empire.
Everything indicates that Akhenaten began to take their religion ... increasingly serious and avoid the responsibilities as head of state.
He did not know what was happening beyond the city's borders.
The empire of Egypt began to sink because several other powerful people ...
Near Eastern began to dominate territory.
Many details about the last few years Akhenaten are unknown.
But one thing is undeniable:
His mysterious death in 1336 a.c. ..
unleashed the vengeful fury the priests of Amon.
Their statues were broken, buried and destroyed.
Inside the tomb Meryre, high priest of Pharaoh ... the walls are covered with scenes life under the reign of Akhenaten.
The most shocking of all is the King driving a chariot ... with his head and body deleted.
Although it was too late to avenge him in life ... had time to destroy it after death.
Destroy the statue of a dead person was a terrible act ... the imaginary Egyptian why kill the chance ... that person had returning to his eternal abode.
So we know that was the thing more brutal than could be done ... someone after his death.
After Akhenaten's enemies crippled her spirit ... his city was abandoned.
A few years after the death of Pharaoh, Amarna seemed ... a ghost town of Western.
The government soon passed to his son Akhenaten, Tutankhamun, 9 years.
Eager to distance himself from his father, he returned the supreme power ... the god Amon, changed his name to Tutankhamun ... and brought the capital back to Thebes.
Ali Pharaohs who succeeded would build the most sumptuous ... tombs of Egyptian history, filling them with treasures ... most precious ever assembled.
These tombs are still nested silently ... among the hills of the cemetery world's most famous, the Valley of the Kings.
1280 a.c. ...
When the sun rises, on the western border of Thebes ... begins another week in the service of Pharaoh for a team of workers ... who lived here, in the village of Dier el-Medina.
Every morning, these workers kissed their wives and children ... and began a journey an hour walk to work ... across these mountains ... in a place that today known as the "Valley of the Kings'.
Today, we associate the Valley of the Kings the Tutankhamun ... popularly known as King Tut, whose body was found ... intact in 1922.
Mas, taking the gold and artifacts, the tomb of Tut is actually ... um minors and most simple of the whole valley.
Construction of the tomb engrenou same So after 40 years of burial of Tut ... during the reign of Seti I.
Quando Seti I came to the throne, in 1294 had inherited an empire fragile.
In the six previous decades, Egypt faltered ... after the chaotic reign of Akhenaten.
There was a real need for strengthen the Egyptian power ... in its traditional form and return to the heights that the Empire ... was known under Thutmose III.
Seti I was a real challenge ... before him:
His goal was recreate the empire again.
Seti was an experienced soldier, who had served as ... supreme commander of Egypt.
With discipline and determination that expected of a military veteran ... he would return order to the realm and absolute power of the pharaoh.
His strategy was based two time-tested tactics ... conquest and construction.
In the temple of Karnak Seti leave your brand when ordering ... the legendary hypostyle hall, one the wonders of ancient architecture.
It is a forest with 134 torreantes columns ... some height a building of 7 floors.
The columns are as wide which can only be embraced ... ten men holding hands.
The ancient Egyptians were trying to create a large room.
Unfortunately, they did not dominate building interior spaces.
So, if you want a large room, had to fill her column.
Hidden in a remote corner of Karnak there is a column unfinished ... that reveals how builders Seti ... created these gigantic pillars polished stone.
First, the area around the base of the column was covered with mud and debris.
Then circular slabs stone were dragged ... over a ramp clay and stacked.
When they reached the ceiling level, began to take the rubbish ... and lined the surfaces the columns and walls.
And then, when all the debris had been removed ... and the coating removed, had a column perfect.
If the columns in the lobby Hypostyle cemented ... the legacy builder Seti, the carvings on the walls ... extol his tough guy image.
Pharaoh was determined to claim lost territory ... during the Amarna.
Launched a series of offensives Syria and Palestine ... where Phoenicians controlled ports and trade routes.
The reliefs at Karnak Seti show capturing and killing ... prisoners of war during these campaigns.
While the soldiers of the King terrorizing neighbors ... northeastern Egypt builders tomb ... preparing your home eternal in the Valley of the Kings.
Ali worked with the works efficiency of an assembly line.
First, a team of masons curdled the tomb of solid rock ... using simple copper chisels.
They received oil lamps, and knew how long ... and lasted oil wick.
So if they used the lamp ... was not known whether they were working ... the right amount of time.
But if the fuse did not end ...
I could see that they were misleading.
Tugs came after of Bricklayers covering the rustic walls ... with a layer of plaster and lime to make them smooth.
When the walls were ready, various artists came to ... draft to the artisans. the drafts were made ?
in black ink.
Then came the master correct in red ink.
And in some places there are still patches.
You can see where people were wrong.
Drafts identify Pharaoh with the sun god Ra ... and depict his journey the underworld at night.
In the burial chamber, behind the tomb, this trip would culminate ... with the rise of the king to the skies the following morning ... to start your journey the firmament.
After these scenes were drafted ... the walls were delivered the sculptors ... that cinzelavam meticulously surface around each drawing ... to create three-dimensional reliefs.
Some were specialized in hand, others only made ?
faces.
There were various types of workers, at different times ... in several parts of the walls.
When the wall was already fully carved, painted them.
As the work progressed inland mountain ... became clear that the tomb of Seti would be different from all the others.
It began with a long corridor input, followed by two stairs ... before reaching a well designed capture floodwater and thieves.
The grave robbing was a constant danger.
And we know, from Documents from Deir el-Medina ...
What is the city in which thieves lived ... that from time to time, people involved ... in thefts tombs were found and brought to trial.
If the thieves were able to cross Well, find ... an elaborate ruse on the other hand, a false burial chamber.
It was large enough for a tomb Pharaonic, but empty and unfinished ... conveying the message that no one was buried there.
However, below ground, left chamber of the false ... lurked a secret staircase.
It led to another long hallway leading to the true ... burial chamber.
Seti I was buried here.
The tomb of Seti was the most fantastic.
Before, there was nothing like it ... and, although there are several other tombs beautiful ... in the Valley of the Kings, the Seti was the most beautifully decorated of all.
Seti I, whose triumphs in building and war had restored ... the ancient glory of Egypt died unexpectedly in 1279 a.
C. ..
An examination of his mummy suggests he had less than 40 years.
After the death of the king, the scepter passed to his son, Ramses II.
Ramses would have more than a hundred children, survive the most legendary ... battle of ancient Egypt and cover every corner of the empire ... with colossal monuments to his own ego.
His reign of 67 years mark the height of glory Egyptian ... and also lie the seeds of its bankruptcy.
1964 d.c. ..
An international army engineers and archaeologists ... ran to save from annihilation one of the monuments ... most precious of Egypt.
The place is Abu Simbel, in southern Egypt ... where colossal temples built during the reign of Ramses the Great ran the risk of submerging under the waters of Lake Nassar.
The new lake was formed because of the construction ...
Dam Assuam, 124km downstream.
Contractors of five nations raced against the clock ... to deconstruct the temples and transport them, stone by stone ... to higher ground.
First, the engineers cut temples blocks transportable ... and led them to a new location, 60m higher and 182m inland.
Here, the blocks were mounted two artificial mountains ... reinforced cement. after four years of steady work ... and 3200 of existence, the temples Abu Simbel earned a new home.
It was a miracle.
A sign of cooperation.
It was a work of genius, a combination engineering old ... with modern engineering.
The temples at Abu Simbel Ramses II and his queen Nefertari ... were magnificent buildings, made the greatest pharaoh ...
Egypt's history.
They were carved .... directly on the slope of the gorge.
Imagine Mount Rushmore ... with a huge church inside the mountain ... behind the heads of the presidents.
Ramses ruled in the thirteenth century.
C. At this point ...
Egyptians were already cutting stones 1500 years ago ... and they've dominated the technique as a science.
But if someone questioned as a science could become art ... this is the answer.
This temple, actually ... is a monumental sculpture, that shows what is possible ... when art and engineering come together with a little ego.
With his reign of nearly seven decades, Ramses II was the Pharaoh of Pharaohs.
Since childhood, all hopes for his dynasty fell in it ... which was treated with reverence usually reserved for gods.
Its status as golden boy Egypt made ?
him ... the most eligible bachelor in the country.
He had about 21 children, at age 21 ... and at least 17 ?
wives.
Throughout his life, he would have 110 kids ... and perhaps an equal number of daughters.
Why so many children?
Well, that's part of the manhood.
The pharaoh was considered a bull, and the bull is a kind ... large symbol male virility.
The blood of Ramses probably expanded to a percentage ... so incredible that, a thousand years later ... there were thousands of people ... which probably had the blood of Ramses the Great.
Ramses distinguished himself not only in love, but also in the war.
For centuries, Egypt had been involved in struggles for control ... ports and trade routes Middle East.
Seti, the father of Rameses, had inroads there recently ... but the dominant tribe the region, the Hittites ... remained formidable an adversary.
Like his father, Ramses wield weapons to expand the borders of Egypt.
He would attack the Hittite kingdom, Syria, with 20,000 men ... greater strength Egyptian that history knows.
They had, by this time, discovered the chariot, the double arrow ... several other weapons and instruments of war.
Certainly, in the ancient world, they were among the greatest warriors.
Although the forces of Pharaoh were formidable ... the Hittites were still more soldiers.
Even fewer, Ramses fought to a bloody stalemate ... and returned home a hero.
Bas-reliefs were carved to commemorate the bravery of the pharaoh ... walls numerous buildings ... including his great temple Abu Simbel.
The construction of began around 1269 a.C. ..
in the 10th year of the reign of Ramses.
Their engineers used similar process ... the construction of graves in the Valley of the Kings.
All colossal sculptures were carved ... by a set of people working together ... built all these pieces colossal.
And we know ... by representations the tomb of Rekhmire ... showing the workshops of the temples, the sculptors worked ... with statues of proportions huge, three-dimensional ... appear and carving the face, shoulders, arms ... the body and legs.
And all this huge community effort ... they created a work of art with perfect proportions.
they created a work of art with perfect proportions.... are the largest and already carved in Egypt.
Inside a complex Templar was cut ... within a colossal rock.
Only the first lobby has more eight majestic statues of the pharaoh.
Besides them, there are a number other quarters.
In the second hall, a shrine and lower chambers that can ... have served as deposits for sacred offerings.
Every facet of the temple was designed to send a clear message ... to all who entered.
Ramses the Great was a god among men.
Ramses II appears not only worshiping the gods ... but also worshiping deified his own image.
So we Pharaoh Ramses II Ramses II worshiping God.
And all this happened throughout his life.
The heart of the temple is your sanctuary ... lying 60m inside the mountain.
Inside are four statues the most powerful gods of Egypt:
Ptah, the creator god, Amon, the supreme god ...
Ramses the living god and Ra-Harakhty, the sun god.
Twice a year, on February 22 and October ... the rays of the rising sun reach busts of three gods ... associated with it, Rameses, Amon-Ra and Harakhty.
Some Egyptologists attribute significance of these dates ... as Pharaoh's birthday and his coronation.
Others, attribute to mere chance.
This is very normal.
If you look in your home, anywhere ... the sun hits certain place twice a year.
This is very natural.
Beside the great temple is another, built ... in honor of the beloved Queen Ramses, Nefertari.
Pharaoh could have any woman he wanted, but his heart belonged only to her.
Nefertari is absolutely beautiful in their representations.
She must have been really stunning and actually ... no inscriptions say she was a woman ... by whom the north wind blew.
At the outside of the her temple, there are six statues.
Four of Ramesses and two of Nefertari, each with a height of 10m.
This is the oldest Egyptian temple in which the statues of Queen ... are as high as those of the King, which demonstrates the high prestige of it.
As is deified Ramses in his temple ...
Nefertari also is in your own temple.
Nefertari, in fact, it was shown as the goddess Hathor.
She became a deity, equal to her husband.
During the reign of Ramses the Great The Abu-Simbel temples in ... rose like stately reminders for travelers from the north ... that a powerful empire amounted to just over the horizon.
That empire built in nearly two millenniums ... would spend a thousand years following declining.
In a few centuries after the death Ramses the Great in 1212 a.c. ..
New Empire had fallen, victim of the same circumstances ... which had destroyed previous:
Leaders increasingly weak ... and economic depression.
Through the centuries, strong attacks of foreign conquerors ...
Nubians, Libyans, Assyrians, Persians and by Alexander the Great and the Greeks ... took Egypt.
Finally, the suicide of legendary Cleopatra VII ...
Octavian and the legions of Rome invaded their land ... and that was the end of ancient Egypt.
Through the centuries, the temples were buried by the sands of the desert ... lost in history as the civilization that built them.
But in our time, they were reborn and again stand ... to proclaim power and ingenuity ... the first world empire.
The Egyptians built foundations of engineering.
It was they who invented engineering.
Without the help of computers or cranes, Egyptian engineers have created ... monumental masterpieces.
Witnesses not only ... sophisticated understanding of their of architectural principles ... but also their ability gather in large quantities ... of men and materials to execute it.
The Egyptians built in much larger ... than all others for millennia.
They must have had an immense confidence in themselves ... and capacity building.
But the imposing structures left Egyptians are the result ... much more than granite, limestone and workers.
They represent the unrivaled genius, technology unmatched ... and the beginning of the eternal struggle of mankind to build a bridge ... between the human and the divine.
Ancient Greece ... the cradle of Western civilization.
For over a thousand years, this strong and charismatic people ... developed the most advanced technological feats ... the world has ever seen.
Then came a new generation thinkers ... they had a reason to build things ... to understand the nature, to create technology.
Engineering works so awesome ... ancient people believed ... which had been constructed by the gods.
one thing What really impresses ... is how those people could raise ... these huge rocks, giant.
These technological marvels ... were stimulated by leaders whose thirst for greatness ... a people united and launched the heights of an empire.
But this brilliant explosion culture and creativity ... succumbed, victim of fierce battles ... who launched brother against brother.
Deadly duels that would the end of a golden era.
September 480 a.c. ..
dawn on the island of Salamis ... and the narrow channel that separated Greece.
The calm sea showed no signs the great battle ...
I was about to start there.
But at the end of the day, the Mediterranean would be red ... dipped in blood.
At stake is nothing less than the future and the independence of Greece ... a country of islands and city states ... that was beyond the reach of most Empire of the known world ...
Persia (=Modern Iran) .
Persia was the super power at that time.
Wealth, great confidence ... the greatest empire multiethnic and multicultural ... that the world had ever seen.
On the horizon, an invading force of epic proportions.
700 ships with 150,000 warriors ... determined to attach Greece to his empire
But a Greek was watchful and ready for battle.
Your name, Themistocles.
An Athenian admiral and ... which for years was preparing for this moment.
But facing Persia, the greatest power in the world at the time ... would not be an easy thing for Themistocles.
Hello, I'm Peter Weller.
First, the Greek navy fleet was outnumbered two to one.
Second, Themistocles faced a problem almost insoluble ... trying to put together a group of warriors completely different ... and controversial under one command.
The good thing about the development Civic Ancient Greece ... was the city-state.
Each city-state was a type of mini independent country ... a self control, in Greece.
And the bad thing about the development Civic Ancient Greece was ... the city-state.
Because as much as these cities speak the same language ... venerate the same gods, not had an idea of national unity ... and their only priorities were their particular agendas and regional.
At best, they did not get along ... at worst, they were violent with each other.
If there was someone I could join the Athenians ... that someone was Themistocles.
A man who does not came from aristocracy ... and was not ashamed to his countrymen knew it.
He was always an outsider.
He saw himself as an outsider.
And prided its lack of refinement.
He said he could do not know how to sing a lyre ... or sing well, but that knew everything he needed ... to make a city great and free.
It was not the first time Themistocles who faced the Persians.
Ten years earlier, a force smaller Persian ... invaded Greece first ... and fought against the Athenians and its allies ... in the city of Marathon.
Now Themistocles would that experience to Salamis ... its strategy and concentrate in a failure ... it detects that the machine Persian War:
The Navy.
He knew that the water was not the natural element of the Persians.
Persia had the power of the earth.
In fact, the Persian religion considered salt water demon.
Themistocles wanted the Greeks build a navy different ... of all that the world had ever seen.
Work began immediately in a fast pace ... to construct a fleet of 200 triremes ... the ship most deadly the ancient world.
A trireme has approximately 40m in length.
It is light and smooth.
It has a spur wood covered in bronze ... the water level, and that is the weapon of the trireme.
You can think of the trireme like a guided missile.
The trireme consisted of 170 rowers on three separate levels ... 62 at the highest level, 54 in the middle and 54 on the lower level.
At the lowest level ... rowers sat so low, in the ship's hold ... their oars were only 45cm above the line of the sea.
So, you have a boat, a wooden boat paddle.
So, you have a boat ... a wooden boat paddle.
You can get up to 8, 9 we ... what an incredible speed to the ancient world.
And can strike like a missile.
The rowers, of course, had to learn to work in teams.
They had to learn how paddle together at the same time ... something easy to start doing but very difficult to master.
The fleet of triremes Themistocles' ... was ready in a few years and the exact time.
N the spring of 480.
C. ..
Persia launched a massive attack against Greece.
Themistocles knew that the Persian fleet ... was greater than the fleet Greek, in the proportion of two to one.
Then he engendered a simple plan, but artful ... to keep the Greeks united and leveling forces.
He had to transform disadvantage into advantage ... the fact that fewer vessels the Persians.
So he had to lure the Persians, may say so ... to a battlefield they could not move ... with the entire fleet, for him to actually ... concentrate its power and attack.
So, the best place him to do it ... was in the Straits of Salamis.
Themistocles engendered a ruse ... to lure the Persian fleet the straits of Salamis.
Themistocles was a man very smart ... a great trickster.
He knew that the Persians preferred to win battles ... diplomacy, intimidation and bribing traitors.
On the eve of battle, he sent a trusted servant ... to persian field.
The servant played the traitor ... counting the Persian king that the Greeks were disorganized ... and if the send Persian their ships at night ... could amaze the Greek navy morning.
The Persians took the bait.
Then, at dawn, the Persians discovered, to his shock ... that the Greek fleet, instead of being withdrawing ... was in battle formation ... and that they, the Persians, would have to face them.
So it was a perfect setting battle, planned by Themistocles.
200 triremes moved by 34,000 rowers Greeks ... put themselves in line not giving way ...
Persians for maneuver the straits.
The trap worked perfectly.
The attacks were maintained by day ... the Greek triremes surrounded the Persian ships ... and then swooped with its front beams.
The Persian officers died in unusual proportions.
The battle was so confused, chaotic and terrifying ... that at the end of the day, even the Greeks were sure they had won.
But the thousands of enemy corpses the beaches of Salamis ... revealed a decisive Greek victory.
Some historical sources claim that the Persians ... lost 200 ships and the Greeks, 40.
The Persians had no drowned ... were killed by Greek soldiers waiting on the beach.
If the Greeks had not won the Battle of Salamis ...
Greek civilization, or Ancient Greece and values ?
that we share ... in today's world, could never have existed.
After stunning victory at Salamis, Themistocles was acclaimed hero.
But their personal ambitions began to grow ... hatred of his many political enemies.
It was only a matter of time ... until the wrath of the assembly overflow.
Athens at this time had a practice ... it was called "ostracism" an annual debate ... in which people voted in political ... they thought it was more dangerous to the political process
And exuded by 10.
In 471 BC, Themistocles was ostracized.
For a stunning irony, was forced to duck for cover ... that both the enemy endeavored to defeat.
He never saw Athens.
Incredibly, he was forced to go to Persia ... where he found refuge and ended his life speaking Persian ... working as administrator to the Persian king ... and helping the Persians to govern western Asia Minor.
Themistocles had played its role in an epic story ... power and achievements that is inspired in a glorious past.
The legendary tales about gods and heroes ... narrated in epics as the "Iliad" and "Odyssey."
Stories can be myths ... but the achievements of these Greek ancestors were real ... and still remains today.
Around 1300 a.c. ... a people who spoke an ancient form of Greek ... inhabited large parts of Greece.
They were known Mycenaeans as ... and, for years, his wars and scandals, feats and achievements ... were the raw material of legend ... and laid the foundation of Greek civilization.
Mycenae, the capital, was surrounded by a massive citadel ... built over 150 years.
According to the myth, in this city ... the Mycenaeans were led by a king named Agamemnon ... whose epic fights were recorded by the poet Homer ... in the eighth century BC, in two of narrative history's most famous ... the "Iliad" and "Odyssey".
Well, the "Iliad" was something like the Bible to ancient Greece.
It contained a moral history ...
She said how you should live.
She described gods ... described religion but also described the people.
She described situations.
She suggested ideal you should seek.
The narratives of the "Iliad" and the "Odyssey" became famous.
The abduction of Helen by Paris ... the ten-year siege inflicted by Agamemnon to Troy ..
and the giant wooden horse used by the Greeks ... to enter Troy and destroy the city.
Although the exploits of Agamemnon ... during the Trojan War had been heroic ... his return to Mycenae had a very warm welcome.
He was murdered by his wife.
scholars argue Homer was for centuries ... actually wrote or not the "Iliad" and "Odyssey" ... joined stories and songs ... or if it had something to do with the works.
But if the ancient Greeks return today ... they make fun of this story, because for the ancient Greeks ...
Homer was not only a great folk singer ... or a writer of bestsellers of pulp fiction.
Homer was a historian ... and these legends were not stories ... to tell children the light of oil lamps ... were provable facts.
This is what's left of Mycenae, the city which Homer wrote ... and many, including me ... would like to believe Agamemnon ruled.
These ruins show us the ancient Greeks ... were not only great builders ... but they were able great feats of engineering.
When you approach Mycenaean ... the first thing you see are the walls of the fortress ... which are very impressive ... and immediately cause a feeling of bewilderment.
The walls of the citadel of Mycenae are formed by blocks of stone ... and each weighs about ten tons.
Were placed with such precision ... each stone fits seamlessly into the adjacent block.
But how inspiring view, nothing in Mycenae ... comes close to the colossal main entrance to the citadel ...
Lion's Gate
This is the Lion's Gate, the main entrance of the city of Mycenae.
It is one of the youngest impressive of all antiquity.
It is a majestic piece of symbolism.
A majestic piece of engineering.
Two lions, fully erect, with the legs on the base of the column.
Their heads, missing, should be facing out.
Anyone approaching this portal ... know that Mycenae represented one thing:
Power.
structurally, the portal seems to have technical ... standard construction engineering columns and lintel.
These vertical elements here, these massive pillars ... are the columns which support the lintel ... the horizontal element, which weighs about 12 tons.
But it is above the portal where are the lions ... engineers went a step further.
If you look at this triangle jagged rocks beside the lions ... there is an element we call arc forward.
Suppose you have these four stones.
And instead of piling them ... you try to create an opening outside ... and you steal a little space ... thereby placing them.
Is the bow forward.
If we a little more ambitious ... because it is not large enough ... and try to move stones a little more ... still in progress, we run this risk.
Will fall.
So what's the catch?
It is simple.
You get to put balance ... after each advanced of these stones.
This triangle ... first, we must say this is a true ...
Mycenaean innovation.
It's something that we see first ... probably worldwide.
So in that sense ...
We are facing something very innovative, very new.
The engineers took Mycenaeans the arc advanced a step further.
They applied the idea to create a revolutionary interior space ... with a cover called vault.
The cover was used only in a type of building:
Tombs.
Like the Egyptians, the Mycenaeans built ... extraordinary structures to house their leaders killed.
These tombs were called "tholoi".
his buildings left something ... engineers Mycenaeans had never done.
The circular shape is completely absent ... in architectural thinking the Mycenaeans.
they worked lines and right angles.
So, the circle was only for this type of structure.
This makes the idea the symbolism of the circle ... related death even stronger.
Building a "tholoi" was a gigantic enterprise engineering.
The first step was digging the side of a hill.
They dug this trench and it formed the "dromos" ... which in Greek means "road" or "way".
In this case, is an entrance to the tomb ... and is surrounded on both sides, by these beautiful stones ... aligned side and longitudinally.
3,200 years ago, in 1200. a.c. ..
a visitor would approach that "dromos" ... and would be faced by an unbelievable place ... magnificent and impressive this huge portal.
The portal had two fantastic giant columns ... carved green marble ... with zigzags and spirals throughout its length.
Each of these giant stones is 77cm in height.
And there are 33 circles these stones cone shaped.
Each layer of stone is placed on the last ... will highlight, is what call the style "breakthrough."
Then they are shaved to become smooth.
For the structure is stable ... you need constant pressure ... from the outside inwards.
Like a barrel ... you need the metal strip ... to keep the parts together.
This pressure comes placing earth.
As built, they put earth around ... much land, and there was a point they ended ... shaped structure of a beehive at the same time ... that built a lot of dirt on top.
Around 1100 a.c. , this Greek civilization ... disintegrated and disappeared suddenly and mysteriously.
There are many theories about it.
I think that protrudes is that new tribes ... new barbarian tribes, came from the steppes ... civilizations of Egypt and attacked and civilizations of Mesopotamia ... causing problems trade routes.
And this led to his downfall.
With the fall of Mycenae, Greece entered the Dark Ages.
For four centuries, their culture fell into a deep slumber.
Then in the eighth century a.c. , the city-state ... started independently to develop and flourish ... each forging their own identity ... competing for superiority economic, military and technological.
A Greek island in particular, Samos ... would see the construction one of the engineering feats ... most impressive the ancient world ... moving mountains to bring water to the people.
Sparta, Athens, Corinth, Thebes.
These are just some of more than one hundred city-states ... that emerged throughout Greece, 400 years after ... the disappearance civilization of Mycenae.
Before the advent democracy in Greece ... many of these city-states were led by a sole ruler ... called a tyrant, in Ancient Greece.
Around 540 a.c. , called a tyrant Polycrates ... ruled the island and city-state of Samos ... in the eastern Aegean.
He had good performance on the international scene ... he made tactical alliances not only with the Persians ... but also with the Egyptians.
He was an ambitious figure.
Polycrates saw the path to power ... as an island Samos was by the sea.
He built a fleet 100 ... triremes terrorizing the neighboring city states ... and taxing ships passing through the region.
Under domain Polycrates Samos, his native island ... became power maritime dominance.
And that was the beginning their wealth and power.
With its wealth recent Polycrates built defensive walls ... around the capital and fell ... solve a problem that plagued many cities ... in the arid Mediterranean climate, drinking water.
Samos was a city lot, very important and powerful.
They needed a lot of water.
And the water was running.
There was a spring bumper ... but it was the 274m, in Monte Castro.
Polycrates and his engineers had to figure out a way ... connecting the city to the source.
Build an aqueduct around Mountain was not an option.
You could build a system of water supply ... around the mountain, but the first thing an enemy would do ... would cut off water and there you are with your fortress ... with its incredible barriers and running out of water.
The solution required something out of the ordinary.
Polycrates sought an engineer called Eupalinos.
This came with a solution ... which meant literally move a mountain ... a tunnel that crossed Monte Castro.
It would be a huge project and extensive.
The time required to make such a tunnel would be enormous.
Therefore, the decision was to make ... tunnel from both sides.
This is a problem mathematical and technical.
As today's engineers made under the Channel ...
Eupalinos dug tunnels on both sides of the mountain ... for they meet in the middle.
To do so, would making sure that each tunnel ... started at the same time on opposite sides of the mountain.
The tunnels also had to match the horizontal ... otherwise they would next to one another ... like ships in the night.
No sophisticated equipment examination topographic ... was a remarkable challenge engineering.
The theory involved a short walk ... around a large mountain.
Simulating a path from the source to the city ... in short lines perpendicular ...
Eupalinos could measure each small extension ... to calculate both sides of a right triangle.
With two sides of the triangle known ... the hypotenuse was the path of the tunnel through the mountain.
What made this prodigious engineering feat ... even more impressive that is involved not only a tunnel ... but two.
The main tunnel was dug ... the height and width of about 2 by 2 feet ... to be used only work space ... to dig a second tunnel adjacent and below the main ... and that would serve as the aqueduct.
The tunnel was dug Work on flat ground ... and on the side of the aqueduct and below that.
This second tunnel needed have a slight slope ... allowing smooth flow water toward the city.
The risk of death was permanent ... those dark and dangerous bowels of the mountain.
Once in the mountains ... difficulties must have been enormous ... because the rocks could move unpredictably ... water could sprout suddenly and cause a catastrophe ... then, was a constant danger.
Furthermore, it was dark ... and they needed lighting.
And ever needed to know where they were ... to keep straight.
After minor adjustments ...
430 00:25:24,689 -- 00:25:26,289 the two teams met halfway ... almost exactly where Eupalinos originally had determined.
The floors of the two tunnels have connected ... with only 60cm difference.
A discrepancy of less than 1% ... 1.066m length of the tunnel.
this awesome engineering feat ... may have been the luminous moment the reign of Polycrates.
But his political fortunes would not be so bright.
The Persian governor, on the coast of Asia Minor ... decided that that degree of autonomy that Polycrates enjoyed ... was not appropriate for the development of Persian power.
He was arrested ... brutally tortured and crucified.
Polycrates was only one among many tyrants ... who ruled the city-state Ancient Greek ... between 800 and 500 a.C. ..
The power of the few over the many ... was the only form of government that humans knew.
But this was about to change.
The city-state of Athens would change the course of history.
The visionary leader that would make it happen ...
Pericles was called.
His legacy would be an eternal monument Athenian Acropolis ... that rose above the clouds.
A striking example precision engineering ... called Parthenon.
In 480 BC, when Themistocles defeated the Persians ... at the battle of Salamis, he saved not only Athens ... but also their young democracy ... he was born 25 years ago.
For Athens, the time the sole ruler over.
Athens was rich in military power ... treasures, technology and ideas.
was ready for its golden ... and a man to lead you there.
His name was Pericles ... an intellectual Democrat and clarified that supported the arts.
an intellectual Democrat que clarified and supported the arts.
through other means, including threats ... bribery and brute force.
Pericles came from a family aristocrats of Athens.
A family type already expected of him ... 's career leader political and military.
Began his climb to power when he was elected, still young ... for the post of "strategists" in a group of ten men ... who commanded the army and defining foreign policy.
born politician and gifted speaker ...
Pericles soon became the statesman most influential and powerful of Athens.
Pericles was the typical political animal.
This man was a politician.
He could talk and persuade.
He was completely dedicated what he did.
Pericles became leader Athens in 461.
A.C. ..
Thanks to the fleet of triremes that Themistocles built ... the Athenian navy beat remained ... in the eastern Mediterranean.
But, despite defeat the Persian Empire in Salamis ... always looming threat another invasion.
At 478 a.C. ..
Athens and the city-states of the Aegean ... formed an alliance for mutual defense called Delian League ... version of NATO the ancient world.
In 450 BC, Athens had become ... undisputed leader of the Delian League ... which was a source money for the city-state.
And Pericles as leader undisputed Athens ... found ways to make the best use of that money ... in large public buildings, to better reflect ... greatness and magnitude Athens.
Legend has it that Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea ... and Athena, goddess of wisdom ... came to the Acropolis to compete the patronage of the city ... that would be decided by the people.
Poseidon thrust his trident on the ground and a spring appeared.
Athena thrust his spear and emerged an olive ... suggested that not only food for the Greeks ... but also a product for trade.
Thus, it became Athena the patron goddess of the city.
Over the centuries, There were many temples to Athena ... most were destroyed.
But it was Pericles who gave the world the most notable example ...
Greek Architecture of all antiquity:
The Parthenon.
Pericles decided to rebuild the Parthenon on the Acropolis ... using the foundations of an ancient temple of Athena.
It took thousands workers and skilled craftsmen ... to create this magnificent temple.
It cost more than any other building designed by the Greeks ... thirty million drachmas, the equivalent of billions of dollars.
This is an incredible amount.
But remember that it was a great development of the State.
The construction of the giant project began in the 447.
C. ..
the Parthenon should have two-thirds of a football field.
Its external dimensions:
70m long ... by 31m in length.
The first challenge was removed marble ... from a quarry on the mountain, 16km.
Altogether, it would take 30 000 tons ... the delicate white stone.
The quarry workers used the natural cracks ... to remove the mountain giant blocks of marble.
The first step is to locate these cracks ... and calculate if the piece of marble ... is sufficient for the specific objective.
The second step is to put wedges within these cracks ... horizontal and vertical.
The Eram with iron.
Why?
Because a large energy was applied ... for hammering all simultaneously with the ... to the fragility the material itself ... help to break down.
With flipcharts ready ... groups of men used levers, ropes and pulleys ... to maneuver the marble ... and prepare it for transport to the Acropolis.
Accidents were frequent.
There was a huge risk ... one of the sliding blocks ... illing people that were below.
Cut and carry the Marble Mountain ... was only half the battle the construction of the Parthenon.
Engineers now had to answer the question ... how to lift those monsters Ten tons of marble ... and erect the largest temple the world has ever seen?
447 to July.
A.C. ..
the construction of a magnificent temple started on the Athenian Acropolis.
The Parthenon was the great project of Pericles ... a dynamic leader and ambitious Athens which would ... a Golden Age ever seen in Ancient Greece.
It was a statement ...
"We are the most powerful city.
We are the cauldron of democracy and free thought.
We have the best people.
We have the best army, the best navy, are the leaders. "
The Parthenon differ from most the temples of the time ... consisting of a building hex-style ... portico with six columns and thirteen side columns.
The Parthenon would be an octa-style, eight columns of seventeen.
This makes the construction very different ... because they all have basically the same proportions.
To make it larger, just increase the ratio.
To make it more extensive, have to give an extra dimension.
The columns provided a main support for the structure.
Each column consisted eleven barrels ... stacked one above the other.
How were carved, fit perfectly ... when placed in the column.
For this, the top each drum was divided ... in four concentric circles, with each ring flattened or not ... depending on the intensity required for setting ... to fit with the next drum.
In the center of each drum, the masons opened a rectangular cutout ... 15cm in size and 7 to 10 cm depth.
Then the carpenters inseriam pegs into slots ... that served to align and centralize the barrel from above.
The next challenge was to raise the very heavy drums ... especially the session higher.
A single column of the Parthenon ... weighs between 63 and 119 tons.
A crane is a tool extremely simple.
Has only one stem ... and a series of pulleys ... which, as we know, enables ... lift a weight, let's say ... 10 tons with a balance of 100k.
Engineers held the stone the crane in several ways.
The most commonly used method was to tie the end of the rope ... on the top a hook metal in S. ..
signing strings shorter the bottom of the hook ... and snare them in small buttons that were left ... raw marble in precisely with this goal.
Typically, they were left 4 buttons or the drum boulder ... evenly distributing the force needed to lift the object.
The walls of the indoor spaces should be placed ... with great accuracy ... because builders Greeks did not use mortar.
To keep together the ends of each block ...
To keep together the ends of each block ......
Then insert iron rods to keep them together.
With speakers and the blocks in position ... the buttons used to hoist them were drawn and brands flattened.
There is a saying that there is no straight lines Parthenon.
This means that architects incorporated ... a series of optical illusions when built.
Begins with the steps, rises from the speakers ... to the pediment, the triangular point on top of the construction.
Let's take a look the steps.
They seem to be straight, but not.
Looking closely ... they arch in the center and retreat at the tips.
This trick goes to the columns.
This column is the Doric ... there is no basis, seems to leave directly from the stone.
Each column has 20 splines ... which means that the column rippling as you pass by it.
Then, the column is arcuate in the center, and then back at the top.
This process is called "entasis".
These long lines, the level of the horizon ... tend to bend.
So to eliminate this effect ... they are curved across ... and the result is again ... more harmonious and you see the lines.
If they were totally straight ... in perfect angles, you would see that.
The main function of the Parthenon was sheltering ... the monumental statue of Athena.
The Parthenon was a construction extremely expensive ... but the statue inside had a cost almost equal ... to the actual construction.
If it was not more expensive.
The statue of Athena was about 10, 11m in height.
About 30-35 feet.
And it was made ?
of gold and ivory.
Hundreds of sculptors created figures that were alive ...
This demonstrates that there talent not only in construction.
The most famous work the construction of the temple ... was the frieze that runs inner walls.
It was carved in low relief ... very close to the figures Background.
Portrays Panatenéia, a celebration to the goddess Athena ... held every four years.
What survived the Parthenon ... were the remains of white marble construction.
In antiquity, addition to the carvings ... many parts of the construction were decorated with paintings.
However, not all citizens were delighted with the Parthenon.
Some considered the project estimation of Pericles horrible ... and a simple monument to his own glory.
Many Athenians hated the Parthenon and the temples.
659 00:39:29,734 -- 00:39:33,471 They thought the disgusting and terrible.
Plato hated them.
Plato hated them.
these new constructions that incorporated new features ... felt that they broke with the past.
The murmurs discontent in Athens ... not limited to the Parthenon.
As Pericles continued expand the domain of Athens ... rivals began conspiring against him.
Before long, they began to launch attacks on their allies.
Topping the list was a beautiful and cultivated ... called Aspasia, member of the elite caste hetaira ... and companion of Pericles.
The courtesans were heteras of high class ... often compared to geishas ... gives Japanese culture.
The heteras circulated refined environments ... cultural life of Athens and Greek.
In Athens, women should submit to the domination of men ...
Aspasia was the exception but the rule.
Pericles treated her as an equal ... and his companion quickly became part of the Athenian elite.
They have become a couple known ... and the perplexity ... scandal and the Athenian people ...
Pericles was still seen kissing Aspasia in public.
And of course, demonstrations Public displays of affection ... were not expected in Classical Athens.
In 432 BC, after nearly 15 years of construction ... the Parthenon was completed.
This tribute to Athena Pericles did what I wanted ... disclose the power of Athens to the world.
disclose the power of Athens to the world.
was already in decline ... and Sparta, the longtime nemesis Athens, on the rise.
When Athens established the system of alliances ... or as some like to call it, "Athenian Empire" ... what actually became ... the Spartans began suspicious of the Athenians ... and, finally, about 430 ... feel threatened by them.
In 431 a.c. , Sparta attacked Athens.
For two long years, Athens resisted the siege of Sparta ... but the luminous city of Pericles was about ... to suffer the attack an invisible enemy.
After a few years ... because of overpopulation in Athens ... a disease that seemed to come Near Eastern ... attacked the Athenian people.
It is known as the "Great Athenian Plague".
Many people died due to the plague.
Pericles, with more then 60 years, survived the plague ... but was physically weakened ... and he weighed about guilt the misery of the city.
In 429, the plague and the war ... eclipsing his beloved city ...
Pericles died.
The bloody conflict between Athens and Sparta ... known as the Peloponnesian War ... continued for 25 more years.
Then in 404 BC, Athens succumbed.
At the end of the Peloponnesian War ... the time of Pericles and the domain Athens had ended.
But the wonders of culture Greek and engineering survived.
Ironically, the two largely responsible ... the legacy of the classical era Athenians were not.
The names of these two men ... would be synonymous not only of conquest, but of Hellenism.
The spread of the Greek ideal culture and values ?
... throughout the world to this day.
One was Philip II, Macedonia ... and his son, a man who would envy all those generals and emperors ...
Julius Caesar to Napoleon and George Patton.
A man who would travel most of the world ... who knew in his few 33 years.
A student of Aristotle, who proclaimed himself God ...
Alexander the Great.

FACTORYTO GO TO CHINESE WITH DOUGH
Now what do we do?
Welcome to Italy.
This blast furnace was built in 1976, it was then revamped, that is, partially restructured, in 1985.
It was rebuilt a second time in 1996.
Production output is 4,000 tons a day.
Annual production is approximately 1 million 200 thousand tons.
Halted just two months ago, so it's still intact.
If you treat it well, it will last a lifetime.
It's fed from above by carts carrying iron and coke.
Hot air is pumped from below where it is heated to 1,200 degrees, about 170 thousand cubic meters an hour...
A snapshot!
Good evening, can we help you?
Do you speak Chinese?
Just "Nihao", that's all.
My name is Vincenzo Buonavolonta, maintenance worker.
Please, sit down.
Beautiful place, I worked nearby for 30 years and never saw it.
Thank you anyway.
I don't want to impose on Mr Chong's time, but I need to speak to him.
Mr Chong listens, no secrets for anyone.
The facility you just bought has a structural weakness.
Defect, flaw... translate defect.
Where defect?
I don't know yet, but the machine is dangerous, it can cause serious accidents, as it already has.
Don't be concerned, every problem has a solution.
I've been on it a while and guarantee I'll have it fixed before dismantling is finished.
Blast furnace in Italian, translate!
But you have to promise one thing.
The structure must be dismantled slowly, no rush and above all you mustn't use a blowtorch on steel.
Time saved here, you'll pay in China.
We don't want to burn the blast furnace.
Who said you did?
I didn't, how are you translating?
I can do it faster myself.
This is it.
How do you say this?
Blowtorch!
No.
I don't understand.
Done in a flash with a blowtorch.
THE MISSING STAR
Vincenzo Buonavolonta, Mr Chong.
- Please, wait over there.
- Thank you.
Hello, Mr Buonavolonta.
Hello.
My name is Xu Xi.
You have good flight?
Slept all the way.
Good!
We are pleased you here.
Me too.
Where is Mr Chong?
Please sit down.
You were offered something to drink?
No, thank you, I'll wait for Mr Chong.
Director Chong not here today, gone for other work.
- When will he be back?
- Who knows?
How do you say in your language?
Discarded.
But if you speak me about your problem that is just as good.
Soft... strong.
Two joints.
You speak Chinese!
But I don't know what you want from us.
I have to make a modification on machinery you purchased in Italy.
You come in China for this?
Yes.
Always good business with your country, never a problem.
But this time there's a problem and Mr Chong knows it.
Mr Chong has no more to do with your machinery.
Who does, then?
We don't own the factory, we are brokers.
- What machinery was it?
- A blast furnace.
Maybe sent to Wuhan, there is a big steel mill.
Give to me your joint and I give to new owners.
I haven't been discarded yet.
I'm sorry you made such a long trip for nothing, Mr Buona...
Volonta!
We know how to say "Buonavolonta" in Chinese.
Miss?
Do you remember me?
In Italy, the factory.
Vincenzo Buonavolonta, maintenance worker.
This is yours.
I'll leave it here.
Comrade Deng said:
"Those who can swim will have good life, the others hard life".
- I can't swim.
- That is bad for you.
Where's the city called...
- Right!
Where is it?
- In the Hubei region.
- Is it big?
- Eight million people.
I have to find a factory.
I finally found the flaw in the machinery.
- Now I know how to make it work.
- Technicians are good in China too.
Sure, but it wasn't easy.
Will you take me to the factory?
In Italy you spoke Chinese better than me.
No, just a few technical terms!
It was just to help out.
Your fault I lost job.
I'm sorry.
How much do you want to take me to the factory?
Wait!
How do I get to Wuhan?
Tomorrow take the train at eight, arrive next day.
Wuhan!
Where is train?
Track for Wuhan?
Your ticket is like mine...
Your train leaves from over there.
Excuse me!
I even bought two 100-year-old eggs.
How come you speak Chinese?
It's a curious language and easy to learn.
- Do you know what "bendan" means?
- 100-year-old egg.
The way you pronounce it, it means "cretin".
Cretin!
Then how do you say it?
Like that?
I'm glad you're coming with me.
- How much will you give me?
- Whatever you want.
Whatever you give is alright.
- Are you from Shanghai?
- No.
Your family... did you tell them you were coming with me?
I'm here to translate, not for answer questions.
My name is Liu Hua.
Or, more simply, Liu.
Mine, Vincenzo.
Or, more simply, Vince.
Good.
- Can I have factory address?
- What address?
Address of factory where we go.
I don't know exactly, I know it's in Wuhan, we're in Wuhan.
You don't know factory address?
No, what's the hassle?
We'll ask somebody.
How many steel mills can there be?
I don't need it!
I don't need it!
Did you find it?
Did you find it?
Say who I am and why I'm here, the truth.
When you tell the truth, there can be no problems.
No, wait here.
A Chinese factory bought a facility in Italy.
And where's he fit in?
A couple of shirts, trousers, I'm just staying a few days.
He says... that it's flawed.
What did he do?
Took it all apart?
Wait, translate, help me.
This is a control unit, hydraulic work, I modified it myself.
Translate!
The movement of the ladle of the steel mill, translate steel mill, of the flawed machinery you bought in Italy...
Look, I'll show you, this goes here...
It's not a bomb!
Wait, it's not a bomb!
Translate, tell him it's a delicate instrument,
I modified it, explain that to him!
Where are you taking me?
Sit down.
No, your hands to yourself!
Where are we going now?
Where's the girl?
I want to speak to your chief, with someone in charge.
Where is he?
Is this him?
Listen to me.
It's all here, passport, wallet.
I'm not signing anything, I want to know where the girl is.
Where is she?
I'm not leaving without her.
I'm not leaving.
I'm not leaving!
Aren't you eating?
How can you eat this stuff first thing in the morning?
We're used to it.
You have a bad temper.
I can't stand people saying:
"You have a bad temper".
Not bad... excitable, too much.
Didn't you see that cop's face?
There's the death penalty here, isn't there?
The Chinese trip you and then put you back on your feet.
Yeah?
Know why I was in there so long?
Why?
The officer woke lots of his friends to find out where is your factory.
Factory maybe in Chongqing, to the west.
Maybe!
Or surely?
The officer said very maybe and very surely.
We have to go back, they lost a piece of the unit.
Well done.
I'll have a little rice.
- How is it?
- Good, tastes a little flat.
Of course, it's white rice.
- Don't they put salt on the table?
- There's soy sauce.
- This.
- No, that's vinegar.
Vinegar?
This?
I just pour it on?
No, that's not how the Chinese eat.
- Then I'll eat the rice as is.
- With a little vegetable...
- What's this?
- "Soy Flower".
- Do I drink it?
- No, spoon.
- It's soup!
- Yes.
Want to taste?
How is it?
Interesting.
Eat up.
- You like to eat.
- Yes, my passion.
Good sign.
- Where are we?
- On the Yangtze, the Blue River.
When do they take those beautiful postcards?
When the sun's out, once a year.
It's pretty just the same.
It soon become a lake 600 kilometers long, here is biggest dam in the world.
That dam's here!
- Will we go by?
- No, it's behind us.
It produces 18 thousand megawatts of electricity for Shanghai and seven or eight other provinces.
Sugar cane is never sweet at both parts.
Meaning?
People had to leave their homes, everything you see will be flooded.
Progress.
One of these days I'll buy a cell phone too.
You got one?
Yes, but the battery's always run down.
Need to phone?
Do you?
- You never phone anyone.
- Who should I?
You married?
- Devoured?
- Devoured?
Yes, devoured, meaning no wife, wife somewhere else.
Divorced.
Divorced!
Sorry, I don't speak well.
- Why did you study Italian?
- Because it's minor language.
Minor... meaning?
My high school wasn't good, not many points for university, not enough for major language.
This is only city in China with no bicycle, all hills.
Is this the hotel?
Hotel expensive, this better than hotel.
They build skyscrapers and forget the elevators.
There are elevators, from 10th floor.
You pay ticket, if they're working.
How many floors are we going?
You always questions!
I always walked up.
There are twelve more.
You here?
Come in.
What am I supposed to do?
Fix fast, they waiting us in factory in an hour.
Done.
Lady went to ask about your machinery.
Those kids?
Families clean factory and fix broken things of workers.
They live in here?
They should close this, like in Italy.
Go hear what the lady says.
Maybe there's misunderstanding.
They bought a machinery from Italy, but ten years ago.
So much the better.
You are in the rain long time, come upstairs and dry off.
Vincenzo Buonavolonta from Italy, returns to Italy.
No, Vincenzo Buonavolonta finds his factory and after that returns to Italy.
How many people live here?
When I lived here, 8,000.
I never imagined China like this.
What do you know about China?
We found steel mill.
This country is full of steel mills.
This one bought blast furnace from Italy three months ago.
We can leave tomorrow.
You have wet shirt, not good for you.
Just look at you!
Nice stuff you're up to...
And with a foreigner.
Foreigners pay great.
Give you a thousand a go?
A thousand?
Let's make a deal...
I set you up and you give me three hundred.
How dare you?
I know you're a whore.
Get lost, dickhead!
You've got balls, eh?
But watch your step.
Don't show up around here again.
What did he want?
Nothing.
What did he say to you?
He didn't say anything.
Where's he from?
He's Italian.
Are Italians Iraqis?
No, Italians are Europeans.
Know where Italy is?
No.
Far away.
He looks sick.
Give me my briefcase.
No, I'll carry.
- Why did we get off?
- You have fever, you must rest.
- Where are we?
- I was born here.
Until five years ago there wasn't even a grocery store here.
This is house I was born in, now my grandmother lives here.
She's never seen a foreigner.
Wait here, it's best not to enter suddenly.
Grandmother!
I'm back.
You've lost weight...
Your hair's long...
Where's Sao Li?
Outside playing.
Go on... go on...
Noodles.
Let him be!
It's not a toy, if it gets lost?
He's sharp, he can already take it apart and remount it.
Your hair is very becoming.
- How long since you'd seen Grandma?
- A year.
Lot of things change in a year for the elderly.
For kids too.
He's got no one, my grandmother is raising him like a son.
He seems angry even when he's laughing, just like you.
In China, if you have one child too many, they fine you.
Many children don't exist, they're not even registered.
When some people have another child either they hide him
or they abandon him.
Things aren't going very well here either.
Imagine China with no Chinese?
Or Italy with no Italians.
I wouldn't go that far!
Just fewer profiteers, braggards, scoundrels and a little more respect.
Some say the stars on our flag stand for honesty,
patience, justice, solidarity.
I heard something different but anyway, a few are always missing.
Don't leave with me tomorrow.
Why not?
Because...
I want to get there on my own.
You haven't even asked me where the steel mill is, if it's near or far.
Why are you doing this?
I haven't given you a cent.
Pay me now, not few money,
lots.
All you can.
I go to ask when truck leaves.
Do you need anything?
Want water?
Leave me the map.
You can't read it, even the cities are in Chinese.
I say sorry to you, I didn't understand.
I did.
Truck stop here, doesn't continue traveling.
- And you didn't know it?
- No.
I took truck to save your money.
Your mind's always on my money.
Now put your mind to going back by yourself.
I'll work something out.
Excuse me!
Is there truck leaving from here?
I leave, go...
Is truck leaving?
Sure, okay!
I'm sorry.
You know nothing about my life and you say "I'm sorry".
I'm sorry anyway.
Where's your boy's father?
He puny, weak man.
Disappeared.
Happens.
Not to everyone.
I came into the world crooked.
We're just born, when problems come, we push ahead.
So, I tell you all the problems.
Problem:
A child and unmarried.
Problem:
Betrayed my parents trust.
Problem:
Betrayed my country's trust.
Problem:
Didn't finish university and didn't get work.
What's that mean?
You are a good person.
You don't know anything about my life either.
I found truck to leave tomorrow.
Maybe it's best you return to your son tommorrow.
My son doesn't even know I was born.
The girl, back.
Eat.
Baotou...
Me to Baotou.
Little.
Stop!
What are you doing?
What are you saying?
Soft steel and strong steel.
Here's the new modified unit control to go into the Italian structure.
But we've got loads here...
What is it?
Another control unit.
What'll we do with it?
How did you make it all this way?
Straight road always shortest.
Rails are straight roads.
How are you?
Fine.
Take this money, there's mistake, I kept my part.
- I was flat broke.
- You need it now.
- Want half?
- I'm not hungry.
I am.
Later maybe.
Later, surely.
My son started crying, but I told him you know how to fix.
Once toys got fixed, now we toss them out, like our shoes.
We'll buy him a new one.
- Do you have a cookie left?
- No.
It was the last one, I'm sorry.
That's okay.
No, no, it worked out fine.
I was lucky.

Do you remember me?
In Italy, the factory.
Vincenzo Buonavolonta, maintenance worker.
This is yours.
I'll leave it here.
Comrade Deng said:
"Those who can swim will have good life, the others hard life".
- I can't swim.
- That is bad for you.
Where's the city called...
- Right!
Where is it?
- In the Hubei region.
- Is it big?
- Eight million people.
I have to find a factory.
I finally found the flaw in the machinery.
- Now I know how to make it work.
- Technicians are good in China too.
Sure, but it wasn't easy.
Will you take me to the factory?
In Italy you spoke Chinese better than me.
No, just a few technical terms!
It was just to help out.
Your fault I lost job.
I'm sorry.
How much do you want to take me to the factory?
Wait!
How do I get to Wuhan?
Tomorrow take the train at eight, arrive next day.
Wuhan!
Where is train?
Track for Wuhan?
Your ticket is like mine...
Your train leaves from over there.
Excuse me!
I even bought two 100-year-old eggs.
How come you speak Chinese?
It's a curious language and easy to learn.
- Do you know what "bendan" means?
- 100-year-old egg.
The way you pronounce it, it means "cretin".
Cretin!
Then how do you say it?
Like that?
I'm glad you're coming with me.
- How much will you give me?
- Whatever you want.
Whatever you give is alright.
- Are you from Shanghai?
- No.
Your family... did you tell them you were coming with me?
I'm here to translate, not for answer questions.
My name is Liu Hua.
Or, more simply, Liu.
Mine, Vincenzo.
Or, more simply, Vince.
Good.
- Can I have factory address?
- What address?
Address of factory where we go.
I don't know exactly, I know it's in Wuhan, we're in Wuhan.
You don't know factory address?
No, what's the hassle?
We'll ask somebody.
How many steel mills can there be?
I don't need it!
I don't need it!
Did you find it?
Did you find it?
Say who I am and why I'm here, the truth.
When you tell the truth, there can be no problems.
No, wait here.
A Chinese factory bought a facility in Italy.
And where's he fit in?
A couple of shirts, trousers, I'm just staying a few days.
He says... that it's flawed.
What did he do?
Took it all apart?
Wait, translate, help me.
This is a control unit, hydraulic work, I modified it myself.
Translate!
The movement of the ladle of the steel mill, translate steel mill, of the flawed machinery you bought in Italy...
Look, I'll show you, this goes here...
It's not a bomb!
Wait, it's not a bomb!
Translate, tell him it's a delicate instrument,
I modified it, explain that to him!
Where are you taking me?
Sit down.
No, your hands to yourself!
Where are we going now?
Where's the girl?
I want to speak to your chief, with someone in charge.
Where is he?
Is this him?
Listen to me.
It's all here, passport, wallet.
I'm not signing anything, I want to know where the girl is.
Where is she?
I'm not leaving without her.
I'm not leaving.
I'm not leaving!
Aren't you eating?
How can you eat this stuff first thing in the morning?
We're used to it.
You have a bad temper.
I can't stand people saying:
"You have a bad temper".
Not bad... excitable, too much.
Didn't you see that cop's face?
There's the death penalty here, isn't there?
The Chinese trip you and then put you back on your feet.
Yeah?
Know why I was in there so long?
Why?
The officer woke lots of his friends to find out where is your factory.
Factory maybe in Chongqing, to the west.
Maybe!
Or surely?
The officer said very maybe and very surely.
We have to go back, they lost a piece of the unit.
Well done.
I'll have a little rice.
- How is it?
- Good, tastes a little flat.
Of course, it's white rice.
- Don't they put salt on the table?
- There's soy sauce.
- This.
- No, that's vinegar.
Vinegar?
This?
I just pour it on?
No, that's not how the Chinese eat.
- Then I'll eat the rice as is.
- With a little vegetable...
- What's this?
- "Soy Flower".
- Do I drink it?
- No, spoon.
- It's soup!
- Yes.
Want to taste?
How is it?
Interesting.
Eat up.
- You like to eat.
- Yes, my passion.
Good sign.
- Where are we?
- On the Yangtze, the Blue River.
When do they take those beautiful postcards?
When the sun's out, once a year.
It's pretty just the same.
It soon become a lake 600 kilometers long, here is biggest dam in the world.
That dam's here!
- Will we go by?
- No, it's behind us.
It produces 18 thousand megawatts of electricity for Shanghai and seven or eight other provinces.
Sugar cane is never sweet at both parts.
Meaning?
People had to leave their homes, everything you see will be flooded.
Progress.
One of these days I'll buy a cell phone too.
You got one?
Yes, but the battery's always run down.
Need to phone?
Do you?
- You never phone anyone.
- Who should I?
You married?
- Devoured?
- Devoured?
Yes, devoured, meaning no wife, wife somewhere else.
Divorced.
Divorced!
Sorry, I don't speak well.
- Why did you study Italian?
- Because it's minor language.
Minor... meaning?
My high school wasn't good, not many points for university, not enough for major language.
This is only city in China with no bicycle, all hills.
Is this the hotel?
Hotel expensive, this better than hotel.
They build skyscrapers and forget the elevators.
There are elevators, from 10th floor.
You pay ticket, if they're working.
How many floors are we going?
You always questions!
I always walked up.
There are twelve more.
You here?
Come in.
What am I supposed to do?
Fix fast, they waiting us in factory in an hour.
Done.
Lady went to ask about your machinery.
Those kids?
Families clean factory and fix broken things of workers.
They live in here?
They should close this, like in Italy.
Go hear what the lady says.
Maybe there's misunderstanding.
They bought a machinery from Italy, but ten years ago.
So much the better.
You are in the rain long time, come upstairs and dry off.
Vincenzo Buonavolonta from Italy, returns to Italy.
No, Vincenzo Buonavolonta finds his factory and after that returns to Italy.
How many people live here?
When I lived here, 8,000.
I never imagined China like this.
What do you know about China?
We found steel mill.
This country is full of steel mills.
This one bought blast furnace from Italy three months ago.
We can leave tomorrow.
You have wet shirt, not good for you.
Just look at you!
Nice stuff you're up to...
And with a foreigner.
Foreigners pay great.
Give you a thousand a go?
A thousand?
Let's make a deal...
I set you up and you give me three hundred.
How dare you?
I know you're a whore.
Get lost, dickhead!
You've got balls, eh?
But watch your step.
Don't show up around here again.
What did he want?
Nothing.
What did he say to you?
He didn't say anything.
Where's he from?
He's Italian.
Are Italians Iraqis?
No, Italians are Europeans.
Know where Italy is?
No.
Far away.
He looks sick.
Give me my briefcase.
No, I'll carry.
- Why did we get off?
- You have fever, you must rest.
- Where are we?
- I was born here.
Until five years ago there wasn't even a grocery store here.
This is house I was born in, now my grandmother lives here.
She's never seen a foreigner.
Wait here, it's best not to enter suddenly.
Grandmother!
I'm back.
You've lost weight...
Your hair's long...
Where's Sao Li?
Outside playing.
Go on... go on...
Noodles.
Let him be!
It's not a toy, if it gets lost?
He's sharp, he can already take it apart and remount it.
Your hair is very becoming.
- How long since you'd seen Grandma?
- A year.
Lot of things change in a year for the elderly.
For kids too.
He's got no one, my grandmother is raising him like a son.
He seems angry even when he's laughing, just like you.
In China, if you have one child too many, they fine you.
Many children don't exist, they're not even registered.
When some people have another child either they hide him
or they abandon him.
Things aren't going very well here either.
Imagine China with no Chinese?
Or Italy with no Italians.
I wouldn't go that far!
Just fewer profiteers, braggards, scoundrels and a little more respect.
Some say the stars on our flag stand for honesty,
patience, justice, solidarity.
I heard something different but anyway, a few are always missing.
Don't leave with me tomorrow.
Why not?
Because...
I want to get there on my own.
You haven't even asked me where the steel mill is, if it's near or far.
Why are you doing this?
I haven't given you a cent.
Pay me now, not few money,
lots.
All you can.
I go to ask when truck leaves.
Do you need anything?
Want water?
Leave me the map.
You can't read it, even the cities are in Chinese.
I say sorry to you, I didn't understand.
I did.
Truck stop here, doesn't continue traveling.
- And you didn't know it?
- No.
I took truck to save your money.
Your mind's always on my money.
Now put your mind to going back by yourself.
I'll work something out.
Excuse me!
Is there truck leaving from here?
I leave, go...
Is truck leaving?
Sure, okay!
I'm sorry.
You know nothing about my life and you say "I'm sorry".
I'm sorry anyway.
Where's your boy's father?
He puny, weak man.
Disappeared.
Happens.
Not to everyone.
I came into the world crooked.
We're just born, when problems come, we push ahead.
So, I tell you all the problems.
Problem:
A child and unmarried.
Problem:
Betrayed my parents trust.
Problem:
Betrayed my country's trust.
Problem:
Didn't finish university and didn't get work.
What's that mean?
You are a good person.
You don't know anything about my life either.
I found truck to leave tomorrow.
Maybe it's best you return to your son tommorrow.
My son doesn't even know I was born.
The girl, back.
Eat.
Baotou...
Me to Baotou.
Little.
Stop!
What are you doing?
What are you saying?
Soft steel and strong steel.
Here's the new modified unit control to go into the Italian structure.
But we've got loads here...
What is it?
Another control unit.
What'll we do with it?
How did you make it all this way?
Straight road always shortest.
Rails are straight roads.
How are you?
Fine.
Take this money, there's mistake, I kept my part.
- I was flat broke.
- You need it now.
- Want half?
- I'm not hungry.
I am.
Later maybe.
Later, surely.
My son started crying, but I told him you know how to fix.
Once toys got fixed, now we toss them out, like our shoes.
We'll buy him a new one.
- Do you have a cookie left?
- No.
It was the last one, I'm sorry.
That's okay.
No, no, it worked out fine.
I was lucky.

There seems to be a little light over there.
I wonder if it's Sally.
Yes, I can see Mona!
Yes, now I can see them...
Yes... now I can see them.
There's some movement over there.
It must be them...
I think so.
It could be them...
Yes, it's Linda!
Now I can see them!
Now I can see them...
THE HORSE MAN
Modern people need someone like Stig-Anders.
He is like a mirror.
They can see what they have become.
God tests those he loves.
There is some truth in that.
I haven't had so much contact with him lately.
I no longer live so close to him.
He has coped, even though he has had a hard life.
He has been hard on himself and his body.
I haven't worried so much about that but he has needed help to get in hay for his animals.
But you can't run a farm like that if you are sick... and on your own.
The first time I saw Stig-Anders he was standing in the garden... or was he by the barn?
His long beard fascinated me.
I waved and he waved back.
He stopped and waved.
Mona, you need something to drink.
I was born with this interest in horses.
I've been out cycling and seen other horses and stopped and said:
"What lovely horses!"
I'm careful so as not to frighten them.
Come on, Sally!
Good girl!
What I think is important for Stig-Anders now is for him to be able to do what he wants.
He can be helped, of course, but only on his own terms.
He shouldn't be hurried or pressured.
That would take away all the joy for him.
I was about nine or ten when I started coming here.
I would spend all summer and practically every week-end here.
Mother said all week-end was too much.
I was so tired on Mondays, I almost missed school.
She said that one day was enough:
Not both Saturday and Sunday.
We worked hard and had lots of fun.
It was great.
Come on!
Giddy-up!
This will do!
We'll work here.
Can you hear the birds singing?
What kind of birds are they?
What beautiful birdsong!
How wonderful it is to listen to birds!
That's a bit tight.
It shouldn't really be so tight back here...
I'd better ask the horses to give me a hand in a moment.
I think they should be able to.
Do you think it's dangerous?
I don't think so.
Is it the umbrella that bothers you?
They're just running, that's all.
- Giddy-up!
- Wait!
- Out of the way of my horses!
- Wait!
Are you deaf or something?
I've got wax in my ears!
Do they mean I can't cart manure because they're running around?
Work before pleasure!
It isn't Saturday night yet!
Tomorrow is a working day too.
They have to give way to horses.
And it's my farm after all...
Well done!
Good work!
That's it!
Now we're really moving!
That's it!
That's the ticket!
Well done!
It says here to use...
that's about the same...
Let's see...
three is what we want, I think that would be about it you always have to check three rows with this type of sower...
Then there's the type of seed... and the space between rows matters...
I'd better put this back.
I'd better put this back and keep it safe.
I must cut fodder for the cows as soon as possible and let them out.
I have to deal with the fences too.
This should be enough for a meal.
Maybe more than enough.
Those are pretty big clouds.
Ah well, it's mostly sunny though...
They can go out as long as the weather is good.
No, no, no!
Silly horse!
Come along now!
In we go!
Be a good girl now!
Stay in there.
Linda!
You certainly know what you want...
It's amazing how much cows can eat...
Isn't that delicious, Priscilla?
Nothing but the best, eh?
I'll sit here for a while and watch.
My boots have split at the back again!
Damn!
Have I been doing such a lot of walking?
What kind of stitching did they use?
Take it easy now!
Good horses!
There's a car coming this way.
It can't be them, can it?
Yes, it was them after all!
I have some timber over there and some I haven't taken out yet.
- Is there a lot?
- Not so much:
About 30 or 40 logs.
There's some lovely pine.
Not all of them are such good quality.
- You can leave them.
I'll show you.
- We can find them.
They're down there on the left.
You can't miss them.
- Thanks.
- We'll manage.
Most kind of you...
That went very smoothly.
I'll cycle down and make sure they find it.
I think I'll do that.
Oh dear!
That was good.
Thank you for letting me supply Eksjöhus.
It's the nearest sawmill and they make houses for people to live in.
That's right.
- These will make splendid houses.
- I certainly hope so!
Yes indeed...
It will all work out fine.
The truck driver can pick it up here.
- You'll put all the labels on then?
- I'll see to it.
That's fine.
So long.
Is that straight?
I reckon so.
I think it's okay.
There we are!
I should have sawed both ends.
Never mind.
Is there anything else missing?
No...
Well, this should do the trick.
This should work okay, I reckon.
Whoa!
Any cars coming?
I don't think so.
Do you hear anything?
Not a sound.
Off you go then!
Walk on!
That sounds like a harvester coming this way.
Sounds like it anyway...
Lots of flowers here all right!
Buttercups...
some orchids over there.
Being here taught me a lot.
I've had many talks with Stig-Anders.
He explained why you shouldn't use a tractor.
It compresses the soil.
That's why it's much better to use horses.
That's true.
But there isn't time to do everything with horses now unless there are several of you.
It was around here that I thought I heard something.
I held the horse to one side.
It's quite steep.
He reared and I was thrown back.
- What are we looking for?
- The coupling.
It's a clasp used to link the reins to the cart.
There it is!
That's amazing!
Marvellous!
It's where I thought it would be!
The rake did the job!
Listen to that click!
That's what links everything together!
That's what I needed!
I bought it at the market.
An old friend sold it to me.
Doesn't that sound good?
!
That spring keeps it closed!
That's the ticket!
Now we can go home!
I wouldn't have been able to buy this separately.
I would have had to buy the whole thing: 450 kronor!
It's good we came this way!
Now we can go home!
What a joy!
Let's go home!
Well, my little cow, I was wondering if it would be completely impossible for you to get up.
Here comes a horse.
You want to take a look as well, eh?
And you want to take a look too...
I thought I might milk you.
Don't you like the idea?
Don't you want to get up?
There's a good cow...
What a good cow you are, but you really should get up.
So you don't want to get up, eh?
Come on now!
Come on, little cow!
Heave!
Heave ho, little cow!
Heave ho!
So you just want to sleep, eh?
Now it's time to get up!
Heave ho!
There we are!
What a good cow you are!
So youcanstand!
What a good cow!
That wasn't so bad!
So lwas able to get you up after all!
That's about it...
That will just have to do.
It means a lot being able to get fresh milk.
It makes a difference to be able to have milk when it's available.
It's really good.
Porridge is so much better with milk rather than water.
What on earth have I done now?
No... just a moment.
Maybe I need to lash it together in this corner.
I must get some new straps next year.
Silly me!
I should start at the front...
No, that seems to be right...
When I was six I sat on the cart with my father and asked him if I could drive and he let me.
The road was flat and he was with me.
Since then I have tried to carry on the same way.
I had my first ploughing lesson when I was eleven.
I went up and down the field, up and down, up and down.
I became very sweaty.
He asked if I wanted him to take over.
I said no and carried on until it was all done.
It went better than I'd expected.
I've had no accidents ploughing.
Just some bashes in the ribs after hitting a stone.
I've worked with two horses and three.
Four occasionally.
It was different with two men in the family.
It was easier loading hay:
One man passed it to the other.
Mother was good with the animals.
She did the milking.
I wouldn't want to have missed the experience of being young and working with Stig-Anders.
It was good for our development to try different things with him.
We rode on the heifers and herded them.
We took the cows out in the spring.
We learnt lots of things that we might not have tried elsewhere.
I remember lying on my stomach in the mud being dragged by a cow.
I didn't dare let go lest she strayed onto a neighbour's land.
The life we lived on his farm was a bit lawless.
And now for the weather forecast.
There is a warm front over the north-west of Sweden.
There will be some snow ahead of the front.
It should reach the north of Sweden by tomorrow.
The rest of the week will be mostly cloudy.
There will be light snow showers and somewhat cooler temperatures.
He was always easy to talk to.
It's not always easy for 10-year-olds to chat to adults.
Adults soon lose interest.
Stig-Anders was always very interested in what we had to say.
You wanted to tell him things.
He listened very attentively and animatedly.
"Really?
Good heavens!
Is that a fact?
!"
I've always thought of him as a friend.
I think I always will.
When I'm done in the barn it's good to eat something.
There's a passage about a man who built his house upon a rock.
Another man built his house upon the sand.
And the storm came and the rain came down and the house collapsed.
The house built on rock stood firm.
It's time for the weather forecast.
I'll switch on the radio.
A storm is approaching southern and central Sweden from the west and will reach Sweden on Saturday.
Winds will be over 100 kilometres per hour reaching hurricane force at times.
Eastern Sweden and the island of Gotland will be worst affected.
According to the Meteorological Office this will be the worst storm for several years.
I'll be glad to get my boots on.
It's getting chilly.
They say there's a bad storm on the way.
I'm worried about the forest.
In November 1973 there was a terrible storm.
By morning even the barn was creaking.
A storm is no fun at all.
I have every respect for it.
There we are!
The bread seems to have turned out all right.
It would be easier with the other knife...
- You're in a hurry!
- Have you caught a cold?
It began after New Year and has got worse.
I have a terrible sore throat.
I feel like I'm freezing inside too.
- I can't stop working though.
- You should have a lie-down.
- We're off home for a coffee break.
- Have a good time.
HOSPITAL
The storm that hit southern Sweden was the worst for 35 years.
Trees fell like ninepins.
It was dangerous to be outside.
Seven people have died.
It is still too early to say how much damage the storm has caused.
It struck yesterday.
Winds of up to 150 kilometres per hour...
If he were replaced by someone else, everything would change.
The barn might be demolished, perhaps the house as well.
His fences would probably go.
Atractor parked in his yard would look strange.
Do you think I'll be here for the rest of my life?
I don't think so.
I don't know what plans they have for you.
But you need a comfortable home.
You've got to keep warm.
I can't make that out of thin air.
I can't sell my home:
I'd have nothing left.
I've never had a large income.
- Did all your forest blow down?
- No, but it was pretty bad.
I always liked working there too.
- My left foot moves quite well now.
- Is the other not so good?
I manage.
A bandage helps.
I'll put another on.
We just need to hold it in place...
This should do it.
I'll fold it back.
- I'll be back on Thursday.
- It should be all right by then.
I'll have a look at it then and put more ointment on.
So long.
When I asked him he said he had been very sad.
He became more introverted.
His beloved cattle had been taken away.
With both his cows and horses gone and the storm on top of that you can understand why he gave up completely.
I would have done the same...
- Do you want to go home?
- I certainly do.
Everything needs to be arranged so you can manage at home.
- I always baked a lot.
- Man cannot live by bread alone...
That's mostly what I ate.
You've tried other food here.
I don't think every home has food this good.
It's the sort of food we would eat on special occasions.
Is that okay?
Enjoy your meal.
I'm doing all right here, but I'd rather be at home nonetheless.
Someone at the door...
What on earth?
!
Madelene!
I can't believe it!
Fancy you turning up!
- Shall we visit the horses?
- Sure.
You're looking smart.
That's very kind of you.
I have some things with me.
I...
I...
I can hardly believe it's true!
I'm trembling!
I'm so glad to see you!
Me too!
You're so kind!
Do you remember when you rode my horses?
- Yes.
- You're so big now!
Well, I've grown a bit since then.
How very kind of you to visit!
I would have come earlier, but I've been terribly busy.
You missed me so much that you even thought about my work.
- Yes.
- You're my saviour, Madelene!
We have worked together before.
We certainly have!
We know how things are done.
They don't believe it, but you believe in me.
- Yes.
Will they send you home?
- I hope so.
I have asked.
It's not impossible.
- Can you walk now?
- Yes, I can.
The most important thing is your interest in the horses.
We'll have a look at them.
That's good to see!
It's a miracle that I still have my horses.
I'm so glad to see you again!
Thank God for that!
Thank God for that!
This is tiring work for a sick man, Sally.
But it feels so good to see you again!
What a good horse you are!
In May I might be doing some work on a farm for a day.
- Would you like to come along?
- Yes I would.
That would be fun.
The last time I did this I was about 12 or 13.
I don't think much cleaning has been done since then.
I think that's when we hung that plate above the clock.
The clock doesn't show the right time.
It always shows winter time.
That's fine by Stig-Anders.
All three horses pulling the harrow...
Here are some splendid horses.
The reins look very good.
She can help with the equipment if I can't manage.
Yesterday is past, tomorrow is yet to come, today the Lord will help you
There's such a lot of stuff...
I wish I could come home again.
What did you say?
I hope I can return to Råskog.
I'm sure many others want you to come back.
We just have to deal with the rubbish.
- Were you able to fix the tyre?
- It's a bit tricky.
- Let me know if you need any help.
- Thanks.
They have put these up to indicate where the machines should work.
If I had been feeling well it might not have looked so bad, but I was ill...
There is still some forest left.
It's a real mess.
It's as they said:
The trees have snapped off higher up.
What a mess...
All knocked over.
Three here.
Three in a row here.
Four really.
One, two, three, four.
Three in a row and one more.
It's a responsibility having to deal with this.
It certainly is.
This truly is my home on this earth.
Råskog is my home on this earth.
Nowhere else.
The machines went into his forest that the storm had felled.
It was a bit like seeing a blacksmith putting horseshoes on a kid's unruly pony.
You can tell by looking at the kid:
When the blacksmith grabs the pony, it hurts the kid just as much.
That was how Stig-Anders looked when they sawed up his forest.
It caused him physical pain.
This isn't good at all.
Look at all the breakage!
I wouldn't have done that.
Look at all these bits!
I really need to fix things at home as well...
I just need to put my coat on, then I can go.
Come in!
Hello.
Hello.
I just wanted to say goodbye, Stig.
Thank you for everything you've done for me, Fahira.
My feet are so much better since you've been bandaging them.
- We're sad to see you go.
- You needn't be sad!
- We'll miss you.
- I'll miss you too.
- Perhaps we can meet some time.
- Yes.
We'll just have to visit you and keep an eye on you.
- Look after yourself now.
- I will.
So long!
The weather's nice anyway.
- Good luck.
- Same to you.
Take care.
- I'm moving back home now.
- Really?
That's a shame, but I can understand you wanting to go home.
FROST-DAMAGED SURFACE
CHILDREN PLAYING DRIVE SLOWLY
What beautiful birdsong!
The birds are welcoming me home.
The fellow at the stable who looked after Linda and Mona said I should teach my nephews how to plough with horses.
He said that once I'm gone, it can't be done.
He said people want to learn but have nobody to teach them.
When I think of Stig-Anders now-
- I want him to live his own life in his own house on his farm...
That's the way!
Full speed ahead!
Linda needs to back up a little.
Back you come!
Good...
Good.
You need to move a little.
If he can keep his horses for five or ten years and look after them-
- I think he will be living the same life provided nobody interferes and his body endures that long.
I miss the cows and the milk.
Only having water on your porridge is not much fun.
On the other hand it's nice not having the responsibility and work...
I'm content.
I feel at home here.
I take the horses out now and again.
I've harvested a lot of hay from the fields.
Hello, Madelene!
Would you like a sandwich?
Thanks.
How are things going?
Okay, but there are huge machines in the forest.
That feels strange.
Does the nurse still bandage your feet?
She said they are okay.
I can put ointment on myself.
So you're cured?
Doesn't anyone come and look after you?
People have said they might call in, but nobody has been here yet.
You didn't think you'd be able to go home, but here you are!
- But now you're home...
- I certainly am!

The evacuation of passengers and flight crew has been completed as per the terrorist incident response plan.
All incoming flights are to remain circling outside the airport control zone and await further instructions.
Flights low on fuel are to divert to land at another airport.
305 to 102 -
Public Security Section 9 has arrived.
Please advise.
This is an priority transmission.
Section 9 has been given full authority to direct this operation.
We already have fatalities over here.
Even if that's the arrangement, they should give us some say in how this operation is run.
That's enough.
Recognize your own role.
We do not have the capability to deal with an incident of this type.
Found it.
All outgoing flights have been suspended.
The immigration checkpoint is closed for operations.
According to our preliminary reports, the fugitive is willing to submit to an inspection, ... but when he heard that Public Security was taking charge, he seemed almost... delighted.
Delighted?
I have no idea.
So?
I guess dai-sempai won't be meeting up with us after all?
He said that he was in the middle of another personal inquiry for an investigation.
Indeed, it was thanks to Batou that we could piece together the complete picture from the disjointed clues in this case.
Pazu and Boma, bring another two men to the North Gate.
Understood.
We are storming in from the front.
Yes, sir!
However, you've changed, sempai.
You finally gave up on that Mateba autorevolver of yours.
Not really.
According to our information, Ka Gae-Ru shouldn't be augmented.
Then on the ground there is your proverbial unexpected problem.
In other words, he may have seized the gun.
Even so, it's just a 9mm pistol.
Oh, my.
Colonel Ka Gae-Ru!
This is Public Security.
We can consider allowing you safe passage from the country as you demand.
First let the hostage go, then we can further discuss this.
Colonel Ka Gae-Ru!
Do you hear me?
Ka Gae-Ru!
Put the gun down!
Everyone hold your fire.
Hand the gun over.
Togusa.
That guy appears to have inhaled fast-acting military grade microsteroids.
Understood.
Colonel Ka Gae-Ru!
The Puppeteer is coming
- I don't want to die!
If you don't want to die, then put the goddamn gun down now!
What did you say?
I won't let you take me in!
Stop!
Damn it!
What the hell just happened?
The Puppeteer, huh?
The name's not half bad.
Prime Minister Kayabuki.
Operatives marked with "bon*" character tattoos belonging to Generalissimo Ka Ru-Ma's loyalist group ...
*The kanji character 梵 (bon), meaning Buddhist.
... have been commiting suicide one after another in the country.
Even his eldest son Colonel Ka Gae-Ru has just killed himself.
And yet, you still insist that there is no need to interrogate the Generalissimo?
Regarding Colonel Ka Gae-Ru's death, it has also been reported that it was due to a botched arrest.
Even if we suppose that this is an unspecified terrorist threat by Seok Republic remnants, we can't prove that Generalissimo Ka Ru-Ma, isolated under house arrest, was involved as well.
While the Refugee Naturalization Act is being implemented, please avoid any incidents that may fuel the opposition parties.
It is my understanding that this is why Public Security Section 9 exists.
I understand.
Ishikawa!
Dig up the record of Ka Gae-Ru's confession.
Yes, sir!
We're moving out!
Is this really fine?
We have yet to obtain authorization.
As long as no one finds out that Pandora's Box has been opened, it won't count as breaking faith.
Has any new evidence been discovered at the scene?
No, not yet.
Find witnesses concerning the victim's...
Batou!
Do you hear me, Batou?
I hear you.
Where are you right now?
I'm over at the thirteenth tattooed man's place.
Another suicide?
Yeah.
This place looks similar to our safehouses.
It's likely that this was just one of their dens.
Leave that end to the prefectural police.
Bring a subordinate down to check out this location.
A hideout revealed by Ka Gae-Ru himself in his confession.
Oh?
But isn't such mainstream work more Togusa's province?
Togusa and I are heading to the enemy's main headquarters.
I see.
Togusa.
How long has it been since the Major left Section 9?
Almost two years now, I think.
It's been that long...
I must deeply apologise for the Ka Gae-Ru incident.
That couldn't be helped.
This case could deal Prime Minister Kayabuki a fatal setback.
She probably wishes to suppress any bad publicity.
But wasn't it Prime Minister Kabayuki herself, concerned that the Six Powers Pact would object to her Refugee Naturalization Act, who had Ka Ru-Ma placed under house arrest as a bargaining chip, sparking off this whole fiasco?
That's because Generalissimo Ka Ru-Ma, before seeking asylum in Japan, had once threatened to launch retaliatory acts of terrorism.
That at the moment of his death, he would visit terror upon the entire world.
Is this the oath of vengeance mentioned in his Seok dissolution speech?
Isn't it our job to find that out and prepare countermeasures?
Although we don't know how he sends out his orders from isolation, we need only to capture Ka Ru-Ma himself to break the case and bring the truth to light.
The problem right now is - how far along is this terrorist plan of his?
Chief.
The Coast Guard report that they have cleared the airspace along the route.
Right.
Thank them, then prepare to land immediately.
Remember to alter the flight records.
Yes, sir!
No firearms or knives detected.
Clear!
Proto.
Turn the power on and lift the blind.
Roger.
What's the matter?
Chief.
Hmm?
It looks like he did himself in.
This looks bad.
This guy killing himself could mean that his plan has already been set into motion.
That thing is... ?
A healthcare monitoring network terminal.
Simply put, it's a device to exchange medical data with a medical establishment.
It was rumored that Ka Ru-Ma was suffering from serious health problems before he went into exile.
Looks like the rumor was true.
Still, I can't believe that the government is oblivious to Ka Ru-Ma's death.
Hmm?
Bingo!
This guy planted a backdoor in the system.
Looks look he was a smarter-than-your-average-dictator.
Looks like it.
The log records his communications with his associates.
Although we need to bring this back to the lab for analysis, there's no doubt that at one time he was attempting to use a micromachine virus to carry out terrorist attacks.
What do you mean by "at one time"?
Back when his operatives were beginning to kill themselves off one after another, they once discussed with Ka Gae-Ru whether or not to suspend the plan.
What does that mean?
In other words, their commiting suicide did not in any way mark the beginning of their plan?
I'm not sure.
However, what puzzles me is that a program that made it seem as if Ka Ru-Ma were still alive was installed by an outside intruder.
At this time, the administration probably still doesn't know the truth about his death.
An assassination disguised as a suicide?
Yeah.
By someone who didn't want the administration to know that Ka Ru-Ma had already been taken out of the picture, perhaps.
What about the micromachine virus?
It seems to have been delivered to a certain Ma Sha-Ba.
If Batou isn't slacking off, he should be retrieving it any time now.
Togusa.
What's this, then?
"The Puppeteer"?
Azuma, just before Ka Gae-Ru died, didn't he also mention something about about "The Puppeteer"?
What if he did?
The log contains references to "The Puppeteer" as well.
The term appears to designate one of their associates.
Looks like we have to apprehend Ma Sha-Ba quickly.
Make a copy of the log, then rendezvous with Batou.
We must uncover the full scope of their plan at all cost.
What do we do with the corpse?
Leave everything as it was.
Regretfully, we were never here.
Yes, sir.
A clinic?
What's a nice car like you doing in a dump like this?
Pretty hefty security system...
Go flank in from the other side!
Acknowledged.
What?
There's no way for you to hack my cyberbrain in here.
Die, Puppeteer!
Over there?
Batou?
That's... ?
Dodge!
You dumbass!
Until I get back, play dead.
Acknowledged.
Halt!
Major？
It's been a while, Batou.
What are you doing here?
I knew it.
I might ask you the same question.
Call it conducting a personal inquiry for an investigation.
It's coming!
Wait.
What the...
Hold this a moment.
Isn't this...
Ma Sha-Ba?
It appears that you know quite a bit.
Know quite a bit... ?
Hey, what exactly are you up to?
Who knows?
I'll be having that back.
I see that you've changed your taste in cars.
When did she... ?
But this one's not bad either.
Batou, I'm guessing that you're here to investigate the serial suicides of those tattooed men.
A word to the wise, stay away from the Solid State society, or you'll end up killing yourself just like them.
You'll have to find your own ride.
Did I not order you to bring a subordinate along?
That's why I brought that tincan with me.
We came too late.
Ma Sha-Ba's already dead.
The cause of death?
He suffered a fatal concussion when he lost control of the robot and crashed.
It looks like Ma Sha-Ba wasn't the Puppeteer after all.
Batou, why did he come at you with that thing?
Who knows?
That's what I would have liked to ask him.
Perhaps he attacked you because he mistook you for the Puppeteer?
Hey, what is this Puppeteer you keep mentioning?
At present, the hypothesis is that it may be the codename for a suspect who may have caused the deaths of the tattooed men and Ka Ru-Ma by hacking into their cyberbrains and forcing them to kill themselves.
Judging from his skill, he might be a hacker surpassing wizard class.
Wizard class...
Chief.
We've found out what Ka Ru-Ma's plan for terror was.
What was it?
You should come over and see for yourself.
Ka Ru-Ma intended to implant micromachines into these children in order to disseminate a virus.
What the hell?
This isn't a retaliation plan, this is utter inhumanity!
Sooner or later, Section 9 will probably track me back to this place.
Loki, Conan, I leave the rest to you.
It seems that I can only handle at most two concurrent cybernetic bodies.
The only way left may be to wipe and retrain them from scratch.
I see.
We've even tried natural oil.
However, due to the different subjects, we were unable to achieve results of the same degree.
You're still concerned over the development of these guys?
Africa was much tougher than I had expected.
Even with upgraded augmentations, I'm still exhausted.
Further implants could mess up your cardiopulmonary function, you know.
Can't be helped.
It's an occupational hazard.
Togusa and you, I really take my hat off to you guys.
From the roster we found at the scene, the operatives involved in the plan include :
the thirteen suicides, Ka Gae-Ru, Ma Sha-Ba, and a certain Raj Poot.
In all, sixteen people.
Who is this Raj Poot?
Could he be the Puppeteer?
It appears that he is not yet in the country.
The communications log would also indicate this.
Not many people would stick with a leader who insisted that they follow him to the grave.
Such is often the sorry end of dictators.
But there were actually sixteen people, huh...
You're late, Batou!
Oh？
When did you get back?
Just now.
Azuma!
Please carry on.
Moving on.
Lieutenant?
Regarding the missing micromachine virus:
A case containing 144 ampoules containing a genetically modified organic virus has been brought into the country, a biological weapon with a time delayed mechanism.
And this hot potato has vanished into thin air.
Batou.
Are you certain that you didn't run into anyone else at Ma Sha-Ba's clinic?
Yeah.
And there was no sign of anyone who might have caused the robot to go out of control?
Nope.
I see.
What exactly are you trying to ask here?
Ah, nevermind...
Actually, we still haven't traced the owner of that smashed car.
Isn't it possible that it was stolen?
From the look of the car security system installed, I would say no.
Furthermore, the surveillance camera footage was somehow partially erased.
This seems to indicate that someone else was present at the scene.
By someone else, you mean the Puppeteer?
Perhaps.
Although Ka Ru-Ma's plan was never implemented, but there is a possibility that this hacker called the Puppeteer may commit independent acts of terror.
While we are tracking down the micromachine ampoules, we also need to focus on investigating this Puppeteer.
Yes, sir!
Togusa.
What do I do?
Go take a break.
Individual body maintenance should take precedence.
Understood.
I'll do that, then.
By the way, Batou?
This morning the Chief had a talk with me and said that it's about time for you to choose your next assignment.
Would you rather concentrate on your duties as training officer, or participate in the Puppeteer investigation under my direction?
It's your call.
Which will it be?
Isn't it obvious?
The Puppeteer, of course.
I see.
Did you find anything?
Yeah, we hit paydirt.
Let's have it.
Firstly, medical examination of the sixteen children reveal no sign of their having been implanted with micromachines at all.
Although suffering from dehydration and injuries from maltreatment, basically, they're fairly healthy.
However, the sixteen of them have had their memories partially erased, and their personal IDs altered to assign them fake parents.
They could remember their names and addresses, but as far as their parents were concerned, they had not the slightest recollection.
Furthermore, upon investigation, the addresses given by them turned out to be residences of old folks living alone.
Could those old folks actually be their parents?
No.
From a granny living in a four-and-a-half-tatami flat, to the rich old codger who could afford personal nursing support robots, there were all sorts, but without exception, all were "Kifu* Aged" hooked up to the healthcare monitoring network.
*貴腐 (kifu), meaning noble rot.
Obviously, there was no sign whatsoever that they had ever lived with children.
Although the household registrations list them as the parents, most likely, these records were doctored.
What's a "Kifu Aged"?
It refers to the bedridden elderly connected to an automated monitoring system which tends to their basic healthcare needs, just like noble-rot infested grapes withering away on the vine.
That's where the name comes from.
This system was originally developed to deal with the problem of an aging population, and at the same time, prevent old folks living alone from dying unnoticed in their homes.
Unexpectedly, connecting to the network instead rendered its users comatose.
The LPO slammed it as the "vegetable legacy retrieval system".
You're pretty well-informed.
The old bags at the parlor often chat with me about it.
It's sort of like an economy model of the terminal Ka Ru-Ma had.
Wait a minute.
Wasn't it Ka Gae-Ru's intent to make human bombs out of the children?
Why then did he specifically erase their memories of their parents?
Rather than planting them somewhere after infecting them with the virus, would it not have been simpler to erase their memories of the abductions, and send them back to their parents?
How should I know?
That's true.
They even had cyberbrains specially implanted.
It really is too extravagant.
Actually, the implants seem to have been performed prior to the abductions.
The transform components also appear to be legit.
In that case, there should be records of the implants at the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.
A guardian is required to sign off on the procedure before it can be performed on a six year old.
There were 144 missing ampoules.
To be on the safe side, let's check this out.
Try and find if there are any matching children in the records.
Assuming that those sixteen kids we rescued had their implants done through through legitimate channels, their records would have been automatically registered with the Ministry of Health's database.
If they were abducted and had their household records doctored after the implants had been registered, the number of children with cyberbrain implants listed in the Ministry of Internal Affairs' resident registry should conflict with the number of such children registered with the Ministry of Health's database.
Now I see.
Since those sixteen had their family names altered to match those of the elderly invalids, in theory this should work.
Twenty thousand?
There must be some kind of mistake.
If children were being abducted in such vast numbers, surely someone would have noticed by now.
True.
In any case, this figure far exceeds anything we ever expected.
What now?
Let's start by eliminating the impossible.
First, sort the list of extraneous children in the data by name and address.
Leave that to me, I'll be done in a sec.
A trap?
!
This is an emergency warning.
Presence of a Level E class virus has been confirmed.
Please shutdown all machines immediately.
Emergency warning...
Emergency warning...
Level E class virus...
Please shutdown all machines...
Engaging emergency server lockdown...
It's no use, the system is not accepting commands.
Hiragi, Soma, backup the data now!
We can't, it's already been infected!
Our only option is to cut the power!
Help me out.
Was the virus embedded in the Ministry of Internal Affairs database?
We've lost the data on that end.
Is the data from the Ministry of Health intact?
Yes, but why?
Out of the way!
Right now, it must be buzzing like an overturned beehive over at the Ministry of Internal Affairs as well.
Dammit!
We just chopped away our best lead.
In any case, it seems now that there must actually have been twenty thousand abductions, huh?
What do you mean?
Normally, twenty thousand is an implausible number of abductions for Ka Gae-Ru's outfit to have pulled off.
The perpetrator's modus operandi is also too amateurish for it to have been the work of the Puppeteer.
We need only look at the facts of the abductions - the discrepancies due to the tampering of the household registrations is like a big sign saying "I nabbed them, come and find me!"
I can't help but think that the Puppeteer has some other purpose in mind.
I agree with your point of view.
Chief.
This case was dropped off at the Ministry of Health's Pathogenic Microbes Repository Unit.
Subsequent analysis proved that it was indeed the Seok manufactured micromachine virus.
This proves that the information we gathered was right on the money.
Do we know who dropped the case off?
There were no records whatsoever of when the case was dropped off, nor any footage of the courier.
Could this could be the Puppeteer?
That's possible.
If so, what is the Puppeteer's motive in all this, if not to commit acts of terror?
From the looks of it, this Puppeteer might be a hacker working for some governmental agency or other.
I was bewildered by the elaborate coverup of Ka Ru-Ma's death.
After some digging of my own, I discovered that Prime Minister Kabayuki and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had canceled a volatile conference on the threat posed by him.
In other words, Ka Ru-Ma, the thorn in the administration's side, had already been dealt with by the hacker employed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as far as they were concerned.
At present, that would seem to be the situation, yes.
If so, maybe we should write this mass abduction thing off as a bluff after all.
Which section was responsible for this?
This case carries great international significance.
Considering the events that have occurred to this point, our stance on the matter should be similar to that of the administration.
I believe that we should leave well alone on this matter.
Therefore, concentrate on establishing the identities of those sixteen children.
Put the Puppeteer investigation on hold for now.
That is all.
Aw, geez.
All that work for nothing, and a huge mess to clean up.
We at least have to help those kids find their parents quickly.
I'm just setting off now.
Sorry about that.
I have a question.
What is it?
Was it the Treaties Bureau that made an old warhorse like you back off from the case?
About that?
I cut a deal with Nakamura.
I turn a blind eye on their covert operations, and in return, we get a free hand to investigate the matter of this micromachine virus.
And that is fine?
If purging Ka Ru-Ma was required for the good of the country, surely we should be dismayed that we were passed over for this vital task?
What, then, was the point of you expanding Section 9 over these past two years, old timer?
If we keep going like this, she won't come back.
Whether being passed over for an assassination order should bring regret or rejoicing, that question may determine what direction the Section will go in the future.
I know what you are trying to say, but we must also consider the possibility that the Major may never return.
Her talent is more precious to me than even an esper's.
In truth, no one can ever live up to her.
Likewise, it's impossible for me to stick around at this post forever.
Therefore, instead of having to expend all of our strength to crack one case,
I would rather build an organisation where we can use an eighth of our strength to crack three cases.
Don't you think that, in this way, we can better carry on our ideals?
This was what I had in mind when I expanded Section 9.
Promoting Togusa to squad leader was also part of this process.
Though, if you had been willing to accept the post at the time, things might be entirely different now.
I'm not suitable for that position.
If you say so.
That might even be true.
But not for Togusa.
Even so, in order for his potential to flourish, he must learn to overcome adversity.
I hope that you can help him along.
I thought as much.
But he's done quite well, actually.
Much like the Major, he's always fair and balanced, whether at home or at work.
For the sake of Section 9, he's even discussed cybernization with his family.
But gaining the acceptance of another is hard to do.
Indeed, I myself have not been able to gain that.
We haven't had a good long talk like this for a while now.
Looks like I won't be coming home tonight, either.
That can't be helped.
You have heavy responsibilities at work now.
Have the kids been good?
Yeah.
But last week our girl asked to sleep on her own in her room.
It's been calm, but I do kind of miss the sibling fights.
Really?
She's a big girl now.
Oh course!
She's already six.
Six, huh?
Snap a picture of her asleep and send it to me, will you?
Sure.
Togusa, we have an situation!
Get over to Area 47 right now!
What happened?
Sempai, I'm sorry, all the children...
They had all gone missing by the time I got here.
Is this the same thing that happened with Ka Gae-Ru?
Looks like it.
The Puppeteer...
If Proto had really wanted to kill himself, he could have pulled the trigger anytime.
This is nothing but a ploy to stall for time!
Ishikawa, Boma!
Use the IR system to locate the children immediately!
Given our current situation, that may have limited use.
At the same time, request support from the prefectural police.
Bring Proto over to the analysis lab.
Togusa, we need to talk!
Later!
Right now, we need to find the missing kids!
This is important!
I may have some insight into the Puppeteer's identity!
It's Aramaki.
Thank you.
You're late.
Sorry, I was delayed by work.
Colonel Tonoda, how's your health?
Back to his old hobby, I see.
Cut the man some slack already.
They say that his health problems arose from the psychological stress of his time in the penitentiary.
What's with Tsujisaki?
He didn't drop by even once.
And to think that I favoured him the most.
He's forgotten me, the ingrate!
His memory seems to be going as well.
Step out for a moment.
I have something for you.
So ends the legendary Akaoni Poacher in ignominy.
You should consider marrying again.
Tragic is the fate of lonely old men.
I have no desire for something that I can't bring with me to the grave.
The same old retort, I see.
So, what is it that you have for me?
Right, take this.
Actually, I ran into the Major back at Ma Sha-Ba's clinic.
The Major... ?
It couldn't be... ?
I didn't think it was possible at first as well, but now I'm getting increasingly worried that she might actually be the Puppeteer.
I missed my chance to speak up earlier.
Did you see her do Ma Sha-Ba in?
No, but I did see her take the case of ampoules.
Previously, I would intervene every time we crossed paths with the Major during an investigation.
I've always assumed that she, in her own way, was there to guide us along to break the case.
But it's different this time.
Exactly what does the Major intend?
That I don't know.
But even odds are, the Major was present at the scene of those suspected assassinations.
Batou.
Hurry to Daikyuu ring highway No. 16 with Saito immediately.
This is a matter of utmost priority!
Chief, we have a situation here as well.
The Puppeteer has turned up at Section 9.
What did you say?
Old timer, the Puppeteer appears to...
Let's not jump to conclusions.
I want to confirm this for myself.
Chief.
Since that fellow moved preemptively against us, can we further pursue this matter?
Since that's the case, carry on.
Roger that.
What happened on your side?
Two hours ago, surveillance cameras in the Engan area happened to pick up the image of a known international criminal.
Hmm?
Who would that be?
He sounds formidable, if you need me and Saito to take him down together.
A former Seok Republic class A+ sniper Lieutenant Raj Poot.
Raj Poot？
That's...
That last man who was not yet in the country?
He was head of Ka Ru-Ma's personal bodyguard.
It's believed that he fled to China after Seok was dissolved.
For him to take to the stage at this point is mighty suspicious.
Fortunately, the Intelligence Division has managed to pinpoint his current whereabouts.
The two of you shadow him and try to discover what he is up to.
Roger that.
Togusa, if the Major is the Puppeteer, then she has become our enemy.
I don't even want to think about that.
One of these days, I will return this favor.
Colonel Tonoda, I take my leave of you for today.
Like father, like son...
Like man, like robot...
You didn't turn out to be anything like me.
It is gratifying to know that a phoenix can fledge from an old crow's nest.
Do take care of your health.
Thank you.
Colonel, you take care as well.
How will that guy take out his target?
Like me, he will use his Hawkeye to acquire the target through real-time satellite imaging before taking the shot.
In that case, there will come a point when our GPS tracker will fail due to the inteference caused by the Hawkeye satellite downlink.
We need to apprehend him before that happens.
Got that.
Let's visually confirm the target.
Be sure not to alert him.
Target confirmed.
There's no mistake, it's him alright.
Togusa.
The IR system has located one of the missing children.
Really?
Where?
He's moving through a small construction lot in Kohoku Park.
That's near my place.
Right.
I'll check it out.
I'll inform the prefectural police as well.
Meanwhile, we'll return to investigating the twenty thousand child abductions.
I see.
Damn.
I guess I'll have to put this matter of the Major aside for now.
The Puppeteer, I presume?
I don't really need to ask, no?
Public Security Section 9 just called to inquire if I knew a hacker called the Puppeteer.
I told them I didn't.
So, you were looking for me?
I've come to refund your fee.
It doesn't matter to us whether you actually had anything to do with it or not - your mission objective was achieved.
I regret to say that this is the end.
I am going now.
Leave some way to contact you over the net, then.
Anything will do.
Was this was a puppet too?
What a waste.
Her talent and skill were outstanding.
It'll be daybreak soon.
I wonder why he even bothered turning up now when their plan is already in shambles?
Perhaps to avenge Ka Ru-Ma's death?
That sounds plausible, but how in the world did he get a hold of that intelligence?
Even we were almost left in the dark about that.
That's true.
How long does he intend to keep driving around, anyway?
Speaking of which, look over there.
That's...
Togusa.
The boy has entered apartment no. 602 of block M-26.
You know the way?
Yeah.
I know this neighborhood like the back of my hand.
A "Kifu Aged"?
Return him to me!
I've left all my assets to the child.
I'd rather have him as my heir than forfeit it all to the government.
The poor thing would just have ended up being abused to death, if we had done nothing.
This is the common resolve of all the residents of Solid State, our little game - nay, our grand enterprise.
Do not meddle in our affairs, if you wish to avoid becoming yet another suicide.
You have been warned.
My gut feeling tells me that his target is somewhere over there.
Turn off the cyberbrain, then help him find a guardian.
Yes, sir.
Death has been confirmed.
Requesting permission to dispose of the remains and retrieve the system terminal.
Dispose?
That's strange.
Didn't he have family?
Our data indicates that he should have a six year old son.
A mistake in the records?
Oh joy.
Even more work for us.
A mistake in the records?
No, that's not it.
That's only because I rescued him.
Which means that, but for my intervention, those social workers would have found and taken the boy into protection as planned.
The suicides of those operatives.
The missing children.
"Kifu Aged".
The common resolve of all the residents of Solid State.
No, what is this Solid State in the first place?
What did that old man mean?
It's me.
Thank goodness I finally got through, please hurry home, our girl's gone missing!
This is it.
Now!
Wait!
Damn, therm-optic camouflage?
How did this happen?
I've been cut off from the GPS system.
The Puppeteer?
But my kid doesn't have a cyberbrain!
I need you to trace which satellite that bastard is using.
Since we've lost visual contact, our one and only chance to stop him will be the moment before he takes the shot.
I might be able to trace the satellite, but how do we stop him?
That should is his field of fire.
From up here, we should have line of sight to his sniping point, although he will spot us easily as well.
Wear this, or you'll be exposed.
There's no time, our opponent is about to act.
We play to win.
It's begun.
Done!
Send it.
That's his target?
The satellite tracks him at SE37.
There he is.
Drop the link before it feeds back!
He's on to us!
Saito!
Did I nail him?
Wait here, I'll go confirm.
Come on, come on...
Huh?
Papa!
How is it?
Have some faith in yourself.
I see.
Hey, who was that man you were trying to off?
Why were you trying to kill him?
To avenge the Generalissimo, I will kill every last one of you Jap motherfuckers!
Avenge?
Don't fuck around with me!
Now, what was the source of your intel?
A mole turned it over to me.
He told me who was behind the Generalissimo's death, so that I could cap the bitch.
And does this mole have a name?
A representative named Munei Ito who frequents the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Old timer, have this Munei fellow taken into custody immediately.
Also, this is an image of Raj's intended target.
Looks like he was the mastermind behind Ka Ru-Ma's assassination.
Eh?
Unless I'm mistaken, that man is Munei Ito.
How could this be?
Your informant is the exact same guy you were trying to kill!
God knows.
Maybe he was suicidal or something.
Suicidal... ?
Hey, could it be that the Puppeteer set you up as well?
Fuck.
You may just be right.
Were he only human, I'd take that bastard out first of all.
Instead, I got myself taken out by a superior foe.
The Puppeteer is not human?
It's an abduction infrastructure built into Solid State.
Solid State?
Hey, what does that mean?
You don't know?
That is to say, the healthcare monitoring network.
The government of your so-called democratic country takes part in child abductions.
What a farce.
Old timer, dispatch a paramedic team and helicopter over to this place.
Also, run a background check on this Munei.
This is too weird.
I understand.
Then, I found her just after calling you.
It seems like she went over to the neighbor's place in the morning.
Is that so?
Thank goodness it turned out to be nothing.
You shouldn't run off by yourself without telling Mama the next time.
Yeah.
Well then, I'll send you to school.
I feel a bit guilty about heading right back to work like this.
Is that alright?
You look exhausted to me.
I'm invigorated just by seeing your faces.
Really?
That's great.
See ya!
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing.
Togusa!
I've bagged Raj Poot over here.
The Puppeteer appears to be involved as well.
You mean... the Major?
Yeah, but as it turns out, the Major is most likely not the Puppeteer.
Raj Poot claims that the Puppeteer is an abduction infrastructure built into the healthcare monitoring system.
Abduction infrastructure?
He referred to the healthcare monitoring network as "Solid State", and insinuated that our government was mixed up in this somehow.
Back when I ran into the Major, she had actually warned me to stay away from the Solid State society.
Initially, I had thought that "Solid State" was a reference to "soshi*", ...
*The kanji characters for electronic element 素子(soshi) can also be read as motoko, the Major's name..
... in other words, to stay away from the Major herself.
*The kanji characters for electronic element 素子(soshi) can also be read as motoko, the Major's name..
But in fact, she was telling us to stay away from the healthcare monitoring network.
Ka Ru-Ma and company were most likely purged because they discovered the infrastructure, and tried to use it for their own ends.
So that's how it is.
It's from Mama.
Hold for a moment.
Hello?
You ignored our warning.
Who is this!
For that, we will take your adorable daughter.
Togusa!
Togusa!
Ishikawa, can you pinpoint Togusa's present location?
Eh?
Not a problem, what's wrong?
Togusa's cyberbrain's been hacked into!
Papa, we're going the wrong way.
You're the Puppeteer?
Why are you abducting all those children?
Where have twenty thousand kids vanished to?
We only wish to utilize resources that have slipped through the net of society.
Soon, you will experience this for yourself.
Batou!
I've found Togusa's present location.
The Cyberbrain Implant Hospital in Kohoku Ward.
Now I get it.
You could get the implant performed without arousing any suspicions if you made a parent bring his child down to the hospital himself.
Erase the child's memories, send her over to an elderly invalid's home, and the abduction is complete.
Afterwards, you'd only need to alter my memories to make me think that I had lost her.
Don't feel too bad about getting your memories altered.
In today's world, the incidence of such cases are already more common than, say, traffic accidents.
You're offering me one last alternative?
That's the place!
I won't let you take my daughter.
Listen, will you do as Papa says?
Start running as fast as you can when Papa lets go of your hand.
Run?
That's right.
There will be a loud bang, just like at the school sports meet.
Once you hear that, run that way and keep running.
Don't stop, and don't ever look back.
Can you do that?
Yeah.
Good girl.
Close your eyes.
I'm so sorry.
Goodbye.
Togusa!
I love you.
TOGUSA!
Max, Musashi!
It's OK, everything's fine.
Major!
I must apologize for holding off until the last moment to save you.
Major, you're not the Puppeteer?
Where were you all this time?
Papa!
Wandering on the net alone after leaving Section 9, I came across this unconventional case by chance.
Eventually I found out about the abductions, and began my own investigation into the matter.
I can't believe that you actually used Togusa as bait!
Didn't you stop to think that you might be endangering his family as well?
I set him up with safeguards, of course.
Thanks to him, we can finally unmask the Puppeteer.
Isn't the Puppeteer just a system built into the healthcare monitoring network?
Rather than a system, I would call it a collective consciousness formed by the elderly invalids hooked up to the network.
However, there must also exist a hub cyberbrain who integrated them in the first place.
A hub cyberbrain?
Hey, isn't that...
The data from my network trace being extracted from Togusa's cyberbrain.
Ah, Batou!
Long time no see!
You're looking well!
Good to see that you've been taking care of yourself.
The elderly monitoring system has contained a backdoor function ever since it was designed.
Look.
This is the full scope of the rhizome formed by the collective consciousness of those elderly invalids in the network.
There is no concept of a center in a rhizome, therefore the hub has no fixed position within the rhizome, or rather, the rhizome itself is constantly in flux.
I get the idea, but who does that hub cyberbrain belong to?
Max, Musashi, report your findings.
Well?
Ah, how do I put this...
You failed?
b..but we managed to locate his current whereabouts.
And where would that be?
The complex grounds of the Seishomin* Welfare Center which takes charge of the elderly monitoring system.
*聖庶民 (seishomin), meaning "Sacred Citizen".
The personnel have arrived.
Releasing locks.
It's been a while, Major.
Indeed.
Though I wish it could have been under happier circumstances.
Why did you change your mind and return?
We'll talk about that later.
Right now, our priority should be to catch the Puppeteer.
Munei Ito, member of the Diet's House of Representatives.
Finding out why he was marked for death is our one key to uncover the Puppeteer's identity.
Munei has long been an advocate of a racially pure Japan, a reactionary conservative nationalist.
He frequents the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and has close ties with the Treaties Bureau.
He participated in the plan to assassinate Ka Ru-Ma.
Major, you mean...
I had a contract with the Treaties Bureau to covertly assassinate Ka Ru-Ma, but the Puppeteer got there first.
So you were only responsible for the subsequent coverup?
That's more or less it.
We also discovered that Munei instigated an management reshuffle at the Seishomin Welfare Center in order to solidify his control over the facility.
How will that benefit him?
Isn't this a welfare facility that provides elderly healthcare monitoring and vocational training?
Right.
But several rogue politicians are using it as a front for something entirely different.
In actual fact, he is using his cover as treasurer to run a power elite education project.
In other words, a glorified brainwashing facility.
So this is what Raj Poot meant about government involvement.
If the Puppeteer was using this place as a temporary holding center for the abducted children, then Munei turning it into a brainwashing facility would pose a problem for him.
Chief.
How about we conduct a forced search?
Finding the children should be our top priority,
But conducting a raid will cause a scandal.
When that happens, those shitty politicians won't be the only ones whose asses get toasted.
Ishikawa, how's the situation?
Is that the Major?
Geez, you could have turned up sooner.
Although we've verified the receipt of a massive quantity of components that may have been used to construct HC-25 brainwashing devices, that alone is insufficient evidence to justify a raid.
What about images from the inside?
I could only obtain footage from the workshop zone.
The education zone is protected by a firewall in the form of complex barrier maze.
It looks to be completely impenetrable.
There are only refugees here.
The abducted children are being held in the education zone, then?
That can only mean that this facility was built with the abduction infrastructure in place from the start.
If not, it's hard to imagine that a politician would dare to introduce such an audacious policy.
You mean to say that the Puppeteer have must have been one of the system designers behind this project?
Ishikawa, prepare the decoder for an attempt to hack through the barrier maze.
I'll make the dive.
If worse come to worst, Section 9 can carry on so long as you and Togusa remain.
Batou.
I absolutely refuse to hear such talk from you.
Are you implying that you'll be retiring as well after this?
I appreciate your sentiments, but I only came here to unmask the Puppeteer.
It's true that we may need to hang someone out to dry this time, and at this point, I have nothing left to lose.
Chief.
It's unfortunate, but I say we raid them.
The Puppeteer is waiting for a chance to eliminate Munei.
I do not wish to see this opportunity slip us by.
But how are we going to pick out the Puppeteer?
At this point, we still have yet to determine his identity.
Leave that to my ghost's whisper.
Woo!
It feels great!
Hi!
Long time no see, everyone!
Here goes.
Move out!
As I thought, nothing beats the thrill of racing along in a physical body again.
Really?
My joints seem a bit creaky though.
Look like another intrusion like before, but something feels different this time.
In any case, secure the perimeter.
Understood.
Professionals like us, huh?
In that case let's get to know each other a bit.
Another hacking attempt by the Investigations section?
What a complete waste of effort.
Let's do an inspection before we leave.
Pazu and Boma, secure our route of withdrawal.
Roger that.
Who are you people?
Why would you want to know?
I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
Huh?
The comms were cut off.
Security cyborgs incoming.
Major, go on ahead.
The one who went in is done for.
Go after those still outside.
Understood.
They opened fire without any warning.
So this place really is a highly sensitive government front.
He's coming after us.
Over there will be fine.
No heat signatures or shadows a Kyo-Re cloaking device?
That means...
Your information is antiquated.
They don't refer to the Model 3302 as a cloaking device anymore.
Finish them.
Roger!
Back me up.
I've almost taken control of the system.
Leave it to me.
Hasn't it always been this way?
Togusa, where are you now?
Major.
I'm currently approaching the roof via the outer wall.
Good.
Carry on and rendezvous with the Chief on the roof.
I've located the children.
Let's go!
Representative Munei, this is Public Security Section 9.
We have already verified the situation here.
It seems we have no choice but to insist on a full scale search of this facility.
Public Security?
Although not under its official auspices, this is a vital facility for the nation.
How dare you Public Security people come barging in here with your overinflated sense of justice!
Representative.
Even so, it is clear from the situation here that it is our job to intervene in such matters.
For a public official, you do not seem to be able to comprehend the crisis facing our nation right now.
If we carry on as we are, in the near future, our nation's prosperity will be displaced by that of foreigners.
To prevent this from occurring, we are investing in this education program for these wards of the state, entrusting our nation's future to them.
Is there anything wrong with that?
The funding for this investment wouldn't happen to have been procured through the exploitation of those elderly invalids and refugees in your care, would it?
That couldn't be helped.
Just think, what have they ever done for this country?
They never started a family, or raised children, and are themselves exempt from taxation.
Selfishly wasting away their lives, and then expecting us to take care of them in their dotage.
What a shameless lot.
If it were up to me, I would even lay a tax on them to make up for the loss to the state caused by their being no longer fit for the workforce.
This is nothing but rhetoric.
What, then, have politicians like you ever done for this country either?
Indulging in egotism, and placing political self-preservation above the needs of others.
Who was responsible for ignoring such social problems until things came to a head?
I am proud to say that I, for my own part , have always been conscientious towards my duties.
Even if it infringes upon human rights, and violates cyberbrain ethics?
That is an unfortunate but necessary sacrifice.
You really are a bloody-minded fellow.
Major. we've verified the number of the children being held here.
It's nowhere near twenty thousand, at most three thousand kids.
Is that right?
Switch over to autistic mode.
Roger that.
Representative.
Did you know that the system in this center has been automatically abducting children?
These children aren't orphans.
A large proportion of them have been abducted.
It was our investigation into the abductions that led us here, therefore, you are an important witness in this case.
Although I was the director of this project, this is the first I've heard of such a bug in the system!
In that case, allow us to question the system designers involved.
It was I.
It was I who designed the core principles behind the Solid State system.
Togusa, take the lot of them into custody!
Yes, ma'am!
Batou, before this guy's memories vanish, I want to dive into his cyberbrain.
Back me up!
Going manual!
Batou, are you reading his signal?
Yeah.
I'll amplify the output.
I see the memory unit, but the signal strength is dropping fast.
Batou, can you amplify his output signal any further?
I'll get a Tachikoma to help.
You disengage for now.
There's no time for that.
Do you see me, Puppeteer?
Do you see me, Puppeteer?
Puppeteer?
I mean the hub cyberbrain who integrated the rhizome of the "Kifu Aged".
Hub?
His visual signal has dropped out...
We're losing him...
Hey, what's wrong?
Batou, I'm routing his audio signal over to my speech center.
I should offer you my thanks.
This has gone far enough, disengage now!
Munei posed the greatest obstacle to Solid State.
I have considered purging him myself many times, but the problem was that the man is a luddite who eschews the use of cyberbrain technology.
Who are you?
What was your motive in abducting those children?
Who I am is not important.
As for my motive, perhaps it is not that different from Munei Ito's.
This country has reached the stage where we must take drastic measures in order to shift it from its doomed course.
The problem of the more than six million so-called "Kifu Aged", the rising unemployment rate in contrast with the shrinking able working population, and the low birth rate.
There is no end to the issues that need to be dealt with.
Did you know that even in this society so plagued by a low birth rate, annually no less than fifty thousand children die needlessly before they reach the age of six?
A full thirty percent of these can be attributed to domestic violence and abuse...
Well?
Can you do it?
... another eighty percent...
I can try.
... another eighty percent...
Even if the counselors, police, or other relevant authorities are are made aware of the situation, they are powerless to prevent it.
The social welfare system has failed them.
And so the potential of these children is lost to us.
Major!
If you keep this up, he'll take your consciousness with him when he dies.
Therefore?
Therefore I have focused on gathering and recycling these inadvertently misplaced resources.
I look for children listed on the abuse watchlist network as living in high-risk homes, and change their household registrations in order to give them a new life.
This is the core principle behind the Solid State system?
Correct.
Of course, aiding the "Kifu Aged" was also an indispensable goal.
They were desperately seeking their own raison d'etre.
Although they were unable to leave behind genetic progenies to inherit their DNA, at least they were able to leave successors for posterity, so that their assets would not be escheated to the state.
Furthermore, they were offered an opportunity to achieve something greater by participating in this grand enterprise.
Needless to say, they were elated, and agreed to join my cause.
You realize that this is criminal conspiracy?
Certainly.
But the ends justify the means, and there were no other means.
Removing those high-risk children from jeopardy was my foremost concern.
Even though I sacrificed my own life in the process, I regret nothing.
On the contrary, I may have finally found my reason for becoming a public official.
All that remains now is to establish Solid State as a permanent institution, and to enhance its infrastructure.
But by purging everyone who came in contact with the system one after another, you drew our attention to your plan.
I had not considered how those who were killed must have felt, but like I said, there were no other means.
With Ka Ru-Ma I can understand, but why did you want to eliminate Munei?
Because he intended to keep the children here in detention.
It was pointless to turn them into brainwashed elite cadres, when they could be given a new life of their own.
Although education is important, the children must be allowed free will to make their own choices out in the world.
That is the difference between I and Munei, and the main reason I must eliminate him.
However, this time round, you people intervened.
Still, my tactics seem to be working fairly well to this point, since I have managed to hack directly into your virtually impenetrable cyberbrain from across the plug link.
Major!
You committed suicide just to lure me into connecting?
You are one tough customer, but while I trap you within a thought maze, the rest of Section 9 can easily be dealt with.
Now that's something you don't see everyday.
A rare competent bureaucrat, if an arrogant and self-righteous ass and one who actually knows me.
Who are you, really?
Haven't you figured it out yet, Kusanagi Motoko?
How many arrogant, self-righteous asses do you know?
Until this moment, I was incarnated across a myriad of egos.
Come now, that a collective consciousness can unconsciously begin to act autonomously, is not so hard to believe.
With this, Solid State is established, and I, the vanishing mediator, now move on to the society beyond.
I can't see a thing.
Can someone give me a situation report?
You finally woke up.
Batou, there you are.
How's the situation?
Where am I?
Then, lastly, what do we do with the children?
Hmm... we probably should send them back to their real parents for the time being.
Even though their memories have been altered, and even though we know about their maltreatment at home?
But that may be for the best.
I can't answer that right now - and that decision may be out of our hands anyway.
The kids who found adopted parents before the brainwashing program began, those who that have already left the facility, what is to become of them?
It will be dealt with on a case by case basis.
They'll just have to wait while our complex judicial system comes up with a decision.
Chief, is there anything we can do?
To that, I can only answer that we can only continue struggling within the rules, and hope for the best.
We can only watch and pray that they may one day grow up to achieve their potential and answer the question that we could not.
Solid State system.
Now that I think about it, it really is an ironic name.
He actually used the cyberbrain network formed by those old folks as a transistor to store his own consciousness.
Just like a arrogant bureaucrat to think of such an idea.
Anyway, when we finally identified the Puppeteer, I got the shock of my life.
What do you mean?
It came to light after that guy died and while you were out of it.
In truth, that official has been dead for the past two years.
His name was Koshiki Takaaki, age thirty-three.
Coming from a family of bureaucrats, he was groomed from youth to be a member of the elite cadre.
After graduating from college, he immediately began working for the Ministry of Health.
Perhaps the only reason he became a bureaucrat was because he did not have anything better to do with his life.
Soon afterwards, he began refusing to turn up at the Ministry for work for some reason.
Because he was an information technology prodigy, he received special permission to remote a cybernetic body to work from home.
Eventually, he distinguished himself through his work at the Ministry.
Two years ago, his talent was recognized, and he was reassigned to the Health-Welfare joint project headed by Munei.
He secretly built his own infrastructure into the project sometime during its development.
But here's the thing.
Because he was an such an unobtrusive non-descript fellow who kept to himself, even with all the work that he had done, no one ever found out that he had really died at home from illness.
Thanks to him, the true identity of the Puppeteer will remain forever a mystery.
Are you implying that the guy's remote cybernetic body was used to impersonate him by persons unknown?
Possibly.
Or rather, that is probably the case.
If we consider those old folks, it might also have been a subconscious action taken by their collective consciousness, but we have no way of verifying that now.
I see.
Except for the record of your conversation with Koshiki taken by the Tachikoma.
Do we still have that record?
We should, although for some reason when Koshiki died, the Tachikoma insisted that the record had no further value.
Batou, did you hear the conversation?
Who knows.
At this point, it doesn't really matter, does it?
The old folks, the abused children, both matters are being brought to a resolution.
Although we were unable to unmask the Puppeteer, we can consider this case more or less closed.
This scandal will really hurt those rogue politicians, eh?
I'm mystified, Batou.
In retrospect, what was I thinking back then?
What was I searching for, when I decided to sojourn in the net alone and loitering?
The truth?
My true self?
Or that special someone?
Perhaps I was only projecting the frustration at my own helplessness onto the system.
What?
Are you getting introspective on me now?
You should be satisfied after all that, right?
So, what do you plan to do in the future?
Continue with your lonesome personal-inquiry-for-an-investigation?
I think I've had enough of that.
Although being bound by constraints was tedious, I couldn't bring myself to accept a life free of them.
In the end, it made no difference whatsoever.
Does that mean what I think it does?
Are you thinking of returning to Section 9?
But what about Togusa?
Won't that affect his career?
If his career were so easily stalled, then clearly, this was the furthest his ability would have gotten him anyway.
That's not for you to worry about.
Maybe.
But you know, Batou, the net is indeed vast and infinite.
Soon, the next unimaginable stage of society will begin to take form.
Passengers and crew have been evacuated as per terrorism response manual.
All arriving and departing flights are in a holding pattern or waiting on the apron.
Divert only those planes that are expected to run low on fuel to other airports.
305 calling 102.
Public Security Section 9 has arrived.
Give any assistance they need.
This is priority one.
Full authority for this incident has been transferred to them.
my people have taken casualties!
there'd better be a damn good reason for us to...
Keep this line clear.
There's no telling if there's a back-hack on it.
what's going down here is way out of our league.
Found him.
Immigration Gates Currently Closed
the initial reports say that the suspect willingly submitted to questioning. he almost seemed happy about it.
Happy?
Yes...
That doesn't make much sense.
the Big Man isn't gonna meet up with us?
He said he's gonna stick with his "I only work cases that I pick... too.
the fact is that we were only able to connect the dots in this case because Batou stuck his nose where it didn't belong.
take the two rookies with you and come in through the north gate.
We're on it.
The two of us are taking the frontal approach.
Roger that.
Boss.
I can't believe you outgrew that Mateba fixation of yours.
Nobody said I outgrew it.
right?
Yeah.
then.
What does it look like?
It's an unexpected development.
So now there's a chance that he's armed?
it's just a 9mm.
This is just peachy...
Colonel Ka Gael!
We're with Public Security!
We're willing to consider granting you safe passage out of the country as you demanded.
Start by releasing your hostage.
Then we can talk.
Ka Gael!
Are you listening?
Ka Gael!
Drop your weapon!
give me the gun.
The Enemy Cannot Be Allowed to Live Under the Same Sky looks like he's high on a military-use reflex booster.
Understood.
Ka Gael!
The Puppeteer is coming!
I don't want to die!
hurry up and drop the piece!
What did you say to me?
You're not gonna make a public spectacle outta me!
Don't!
Shit!
What the hell did he do that for?
!
huh?
Not a bad name at all...
Prime Minister Kayabuki.
Special operatives tattooed with "true believer" to show their loyalty to General Ka Rum have been committing suicide one by one here in Japan.
too.
You still insist there is no need to interrogate the General in spite of these incidents?
Some reports are saying that Col. Ka's death was the result of a botched arrest attempt.
I find it hard to imagine that General Ka is involved in the plan while under house arrest.
Please do your utmost to avoid fueling the actions of the opposition faction that have accompanied my enactment of the Refugee Naturalization Policy.
I was under the impression that such work falls under Public Security's purview.
ma'am.
Ishikawa.
Send me the files from Ka Gael's debriefing.
Coming right up.
We're moving out!
sir?
I don't believe she gave you authorization for that.
I didn't break my word to her.
7072.
Has the scene provided you with any new material data?
I haven't found anything yet.
Call in the Supervisor.
There's some old...
Batou.
Batou?
I'm listening.
Where are you?

We found the body of a 13th tattooed man.
- Is this one another suicide?
- Yeah.
This place looks a lot like our own safehouses.
It was probably one of their hideouts.
Let the Prefectural Police handle this.
Grab one of your subordinates and go to this location.
It's a secret hideout that Ka Gael told us about in his debriefing.
You sure that a mainstream job like that isn't more up Togusa's alley?
Togusa's coming with me to the Dungeon.
I follow you.
Togusa.
How long has it been since the Major resigned from Section 9?
I guess.
That long...
I'm sorry about what happened with Ka Gael.
There was nothing you could have done.
This is a vital matter which might prove to be Prime Minister Kayabuki's Achilles' heel.
Her intention is probably to keep a lid on things that she doesn't want to see right now.
Kayabuki was scared that the other countries at the six-party talks would look too closely at the real motivation behind the Refugee Naturalization Policy.
This whole damn mess got started because she was forced into looking after Ka Rum! he said that he'd carry out acts of terrorism in retaliation.
I will visit terror throughout the world.
huh?
right? we should be able to get a feel for the overall plan.
We'll also learn how far along this terrorist plot is right now.
Chief.
We just got word from the Coast Guard that they've opened up the airspace over the island.
Good.
Thank them for me and take us down at once.
Make sure you doctor the records of our flight plan!
Roger that!
No firearms or knives detected!
Clear!
Proto.
Turn the power back on and open the blinds.
Roger.
What's the matter?
Chief...
It looks like he pulled them out himself.
This is bad news... their plan might already be in motion.
What's that?
This?
It's a terminal that links to the nursing net.
it's used to exchange a patient's medical data with all medical facilities.
Looks like those rumors about Ka Rum being seriously ill before he fled his country were true.
even though he was hooked up to that?
Hm?
Bingo!
He was going through a back door in the system!
I guess there was more to the good General here than meets the eye.
Looks that way.
The comm log shows that he was in contact with his people. but they definitely seemed to be planning a terrorist strike using a micromachine virus.
were planning? he talked with Ka Gael about whether they should abort the plan for the time being.
What do you mean?
Are you saying that the suicides weren't meant as the plot's "go" code?
I don't know.
But what really worries me is that there was a program planted in here from the outside designed to make it look like Ka Rum was still alive.
The government probably still hasn't caught on to the fact that this guy is dead.
an assassination set up to look like suicide?
Yeah.
Committed by somebody who doesn't want the goverment to know Ka Rum is dead.
or... what about the micromachine virus?
Looks like it was delivered to that Ma Shaba guy's hospital.
he might be able to recover it for us.
Togusa!
What the hell is this?
Puppeteer"?
didn't Ka Gael say something about a puppeteer just before he died?
I think he did... too.
Looks like it's the codename for one of his men.
Looks like we need to apprehend Ma Shaba as soon as possible.
go meet up with Batou.
It's imperative that we ascertain the full scope of this plot.
What should we do with the stiff?
but we were never here.
Understood.
A hospital?
That car sticks out like a sore thumb around here...
This security system setup kinda reminds me of...
You head around from the outside!
Roger.
What the hell?
You can't hack my cyberbrain if I'm in here!
Puppeteer!
huh?
Batou?
That looked like... 657)}Open
Get clear!
You dumbass!
I'll come back for you later.
Play dead.
Roger.
Hold it!
Major?
what brings you to this part of town?
I knew it was you...
I should ask you the same thing.
I guess you could say.
Here it comes!
Just a second.
What the hell?
Hold on to this for me.
Hey!
wait a minute...
Isn't that Ma Shaba?
I'm surprised you know who he is.
surprised"?
What the hell are you up to?
give that back.
Hey!
Has your taste in cars changed?
When did she swipe my... this isn't too shabby at all.
I'm guessing that the reason you're here is because you're following a lead on that string of suicides of tattooed men.
But let me give you a friendly warning.
Stay away from the Solid State.
you'll end up killing yourself just like they did.
wait a...
- You can find your car yourself.
Didn't I tell you to bring along one of your men?
!
that's why I brought this hunk of junk.
too.
Cause of death?
Neck trauma resulting from impacts during the runaway.
Looks like Ma Shaba wasn't the Puppeteer.
why the hell did he attack you in that thing?
Beats me.
That's what I'd like to know.
Maybe he attacked you because he thought you were the Puppeteer.
what's this "Puppeteer" you keep talking about?
but it seems to be a rebel's codename.
We have reason to believe that deaths of the tattooed men and Ka Rum were all crimes orchestrated by this person.
He hacks other people's cyberbrains and forces them to commit suicide.
we seem to be dealing with a super-wizard class hacker.
Wizard-class?
we figured out how Ka Rum's terrorist attack was going to work.
What did you learn?
You should come see this for yourself.
It looks like Ka Rum was trying to spread his virus by implanting children with micromachines.
my ass!
No human being could come up with something this sick!
Section 9 is going to figure out my M.O. one of these days.
hold the fort while I'm gone.
Looks like controlling two prosthetic bodies at once is my limit.
I suppose our only option is to start their training again from square one.
and we even tried using natural oil again... so perhaps this means that their previous environment hasn't been perfectly replicated.
huh?
Africa was a lot harsher than I imagined.
but it still hit me hard. your O2 extraction rate's gonna take a hit.
I didn't have much choice.
Not as long as I'm working here.
now you...
I gotta hand it to you guys. we've determined that the group is composed of 16 members: and someone named Raj Puhto.
Who's this Raj Puhto guy?
What's the likelihood of him being the Puppeteer?
He doesn't seem to have successfully entered the country yet.
We've verified that much from their communications log.
There aren't a whole lot of people who will follow you to the grave when you tell 'em to die with you.
Things always seem to work out that way when dictators buy the farm.
16 people is nothing to sneeze at...
Batou?
When'd you get back?
don't let me interrupt you.
let's continue.
Next. was brought into the country. a genetically-engineered form of smallpox that's had a time-release function added.
That's one nasty little bug that they lost track of...
Batou.
There's something that I need to make sure of.
You're sure that you didn't see anyone at Ma Shaba's hospital?
Yeah.
there wasn't any indication of intervention by a third party?
Nope.
If you say so.
What exactly are you getting at?
Well... we weren't able to ID the owner of that crushed car in the parking lot.
Maybe it was stolen.
that's pretty doubtful.
part of the security camera footage had been deleted.
I'm thinking that we should work under the assumption that someone else was there.
And that "someone" was the Puppeteer?
Possibly. but there's lots of evidence to suggest that this "Puppeteer" hacker will pick up where Ka left off. while investigating the Puppeteer at the same time.
Roger.
Togusa.
What do you want me to do?
get some RR.
Eliminating the main cause of human error is your top priority.
Gotcha.
I'll take you up on that offer.
and Batou?
"It's about time you reeled him in. or you can work under me on the Puppeteer investigation.
I'll leave the choice up to you.
What'll it be?
Do you even need to ask me that?
I'm on the Puppeteer.
All right.
Learned anything?
a few things.
Skip the preliminaries and fill us in.
I got the results back from the medical checks we ran on the 16 kids.
There were no signs that they'd been injected with micromachines. they're all basically healthy. and their ID's had been rewritten to turn them into somebody else. they had no memories whatsoever. there was just old people there living by themselves.
Any chance that those old people are really their parents?
Not likely.
We saw everything from an old woman living alone in a 10-by-8 room to a rich old coot who could afford to pay for nursing robots out of his own pocket.
they were all Noble Rot Senior Citizens who were hooked up to the nursing system.
there were no signs that any children had ever lived there. too.
What are these "Noble Rot Senior Citizens"?
the term came from the way old people who are hooked up to what's called the "Fully Automatic Nursing System" and given bare minimum medical treatment lie there like grapes infested with noble rot shrivelling on the vine. to prevent them from dying alone and unnoticed. they started mocking it as a thinly-disguised asset collection system.
You sure know a lot about this.
I've heard all about it from the old ladies who come to my pachinko place.
It's kind of like a bare-bones version of the model that was next to Ka Rum's bed.
wait a minute.
right?
why did he go to the trouble of erasing their memories of their parents? wouldn't it have been smarter to erase the memories of the abduction and then send them back home?
you're asking the wrong guy.
you definitely have a point there.
he's going to an awful lot of trouble.
The operations seem to have been performed prior to the abductions.
as well.
Labor and Welfare. a consent form signed by a parent or guardian is required by law.
There were 144 missing ampules... we should probably check to see if there are any kids listed there who fit the same description.
Good call.
and Welfare the records would've been automatically recorded in the databases of the MHLW and the Management Ministry.
If they were abducted afterwards and their family registries were altered... there'll be a discrepancy in the number of kids listed as cyberized in the national ID system... and Welfare.
I follow you.
Since we have 16 here who say they have the same last name... that should be true.
000?
!
There has to be some kind of mistake.
somebody would've noticed.
you're right.
that number's way larger than anything we expected.
What do you want to do?
Let's start by eliminating the worst case scenario.
figure out the names and addresses of the excess children in the database.
I'm on it.
I can have that for you in a few seconds.
A trap?
!
This is an emergency.
Class E virus detected.
Shut down all equipment immediately.
This is an emergency...
Beginning virus scan.
- Vaccine pattern match in progress.
- Shut down all equipment immediately.
Incursion into server has reached...
It's no use!
It's not accepting any commands!
Higaki!
Soga!
Lock down the backup server!
Too late!
It's already been compromised!
then!
Gimme a hand!
There was a virus planted in the Management Ministry's database?
too!
The MHLW's data is intact?
though.
Move it!
Management Ministry database is...
I bet the Management Ministry's buzzing like a poked beehive right about now.
we just lost the best lead we had... 000 abductions.
What do you mean?
Common sense says there's no way that Ka Gael's crew could have pulled off that many abductions.
the Puppeteer.
The M.O. is just too sloppy. don't you think it's strange that he'd leave traces of tampering in just the national ID system?
now please find them.
I think he's got something else in mind.
I have to concur with your opinion.
Chief?
These were delivered to the MHLW's Pathogenic Microorganism Isolation Facility.
Analysis has identified them as a Seok-produced micromachine virus.
This would certainly seem to suggest that our intel was indeed correct.
What did the person who delivered it look like?
or when.
So there's a chance that this person might be the Puppeteer?
It's certainly possible.
what's the Puppeteer's final objective in all this?
It wasn't to keep Ka's terrorist plot rolling?
It would seem that there's a chance that the Puppeteer is a hacker sent by some government agency or other.
The skill with which Ka Rum's death was covered up has been nagging at me.
I heard rumors of a rather suspicious conversation that took place between the Prime Minister and the Foreign Affairs Ministry not long ago. the man who was such a big thorn in the government's side?
yes.
we should probably think of the abductions as a decoy.
Which Section was it that took the job? we and the government are on the same page.
I believe we should let sleeping dogs lie and avoid worsening the situation.
but it ends there.
I'm temporarily pulling you off of the investigation into the Puppeteer.
That is all.
man... and now we've got an assload of loose ends to tie up.
the least we can do is track down those kids' parents as soon as we can.
I'm on my way there now.
Sorry I'm late.
I need to ask you something.
what?
Who made you pull us off this case?
The Treaty Review Department?
you mean that.
I cut a deal with Nakamura. we were allowed to take possession of the micromachine virus.
And you're okay with that? you should be offended that they didn't ask us to do it.
old man?
not when we're like this.
or do we rejoice?
The answer to that question will determine what path we will walk down in the future.
I completely understand the point you're trying to make.
But we also must consider the possibility that the Major will never return to Section 9.
Her talents were even rarer than ESP.
no one can fill her shoes but her.
I myself won't be able to stay here forever. shouldn't we create an organization capable of tackling three at once using only 80%?
Don't you think that's the best way for it to carry on our ideals even after we're gone?
That's what I had in mind as I worked to expand our organization.
Making Togusa the squad commander was part of that larger plan.
things might have worked out differently.
I'm not cut out for positions like that.
perhaps you're right.
But it's different with Togusa.
A man has to overcome a great many hurdles for his innate talent to blossom.
I want you to give him the support he needs.
I think he's doing a fine job.
The Major'd say that he's keeping his personal feelings out of the way of doing his job. as well as the prosthetics he got.
But I doubt he had an easy time of winning their understanding.
That's something that I was never able to do to the very end.
I'm glad we were able to talk like this again.
It doesn't look like I'll be able to make it home again tonight.
It can't be helped.
You're in a position of responsibility now.
have the kids been behaving?
Yes. it's been a little quiet around here without those two fighting.
huh?
She's growing up.
she's six now.
she's six already... okay?
Sure.
Will do.
we have an emergency!
Get to Flat 47 right away!
What happened?
!
sir...
The children are...
They were gone by the time we realized what was up.
It's just like what happened with Ka Gael...
Sure looks that way.
The Puppeteer... he would've made him pull the trigger a long time ago.
He's just trying to buy time!
Shit!
Ishikawa!
Borma!
Use the IR-System to find those kids ASAP!
We're barely able to keep the damn lights on right now!
too!
Get Proto to the analysis room.
Togusa!
We need to talk!
It can wait until later!
Finding those kids comes first!
This is important!
I think I might know who the Puppeteer is.
It's Aramaki.
Pardon me.
What kept you?
things are hectic at work.
Colonel Tonoda?
I see.
Don't be so hard on him.
They tell me that his health problems are due to the stress of prison life.
Where's that ingrate Tsujisaki?
He hasn't come to see me even once.
He's forgotten the debt he owes to the man who looked out for him more than anyone else!
too.
Let's step outside for a minute.
There's something I want to give you.
There's nothing left now of the man they called Colonel Red Demon.
You should think about remarrying.
There's no sorrier sight than a single old man.
I decided long ago that I'd never own anything that I couldn't take to the grave with me.
I see.
what was it that you wanted to give to me?
Right.
This is it.
I ran into the Major at Ma Shaba's hospital.
The Major?
You can't be saying that...
I didn't think it was possible.
I became more and more convinced that she had to be the Puppeteer.
I missed my chance to bring it up earlier.
Did you see her kill Ma Shaba?
No.
But I did see her walk off with the ampules.
I'd always butt in whenever it seemed like the Major might be involved in a given case.
I always thought that she was helping us solve the case in her own way.
But this time is different.
What the hell is the Major trying to do?
Hell if I know.
But it was the Treaty Review Department that set up the hit on Ka Rum.
That's probably where the Major is.
Batou!
I want you and Saito to head for beltway #16 immediately!
This has top priority!
too.
He's what?
!
but I think the Puppeteer is...
Let's keep this to ourselves for now.
I'll try to verify it for myself.
right?
I suppose it is.
what's happened on your end?
security cameras in coastal district 2 happened to catch sight of an internationally-wanted criminal.
Huh?
Who is he?
He must be a tough customer if you want me and Saito on it.
formerly of the Seok Republic.
Lieutenant Raj Puhto.
that was one of the names from... huh?
He was the commander of Ka Rum's personal guard.
he'd sought asylum in China after Seok fell... there must be something to this...
Right.
the Intelligence Bureau has a fix on his current position.
I want the two of you to tail him and find out what his objective is.
- Roger.
- Roger.
if it turns out that the Major is the Puppeteer and we have to take her on... either.
I'll repay you for this favor.
I'm afraid I can't stay any longer today. but you didn't turn out anything like me.
It makes me happy that a fool like me produced a genius like you.
all right?
Colonel.
What's his M.O. gonna be for his sniping?
The same as mine.
and then take his shot.
Which means it's only a matter of time before we lose the ability to track him by GPS.
we have to catch him before then.
Lemme take over.
I'm gonna get a look at his face.
Don't let him spot you.
I have confirmation.
this is our guy.
Togusa!
The IR-System has picked up one of the kids.
Really?
What's his location?
Walking through the grounds of the Kohoku public housing projects.
that's near where I live.
I'll go check it out.
I'll put in a call to the PPD.
000 abduction cases for us...
Looks that way.
I guess we have to put the Major on the backburner for now...
Treaty Review Department #6 Archive Room
I presume?
It's certainly a fitting name.
I received an inquiry a few minutes ago from Public Security Section 9 asking me if I knew who a hacker known as the Puppeteer might be.
I don't.
what did you want to talk to me about?
I came here to refund your payment. we don't care what you do to get the job done.
but you won't be seeing me again.
I'll leave a net channel open for you to contact us.
Feel free to... too?
too...
The sun's about to come up... why do you think he decided to come here now?
You don't think it's to carry out Ka Rum's revenge?
but how would he have gotten his hands on that intel?
Even we were left out of the loop on that little tidbit.
You have a point.
how much longer is this guy gonna keep driving around town?
there's that building again.
isn't that the... the kid just went into apartment 602 in building N25.
Can you find it?
I know this neighborhood like the back of my hand.
A Noble Rot Senior Citizen...
Give him back!
Everything I have is invested in that boy!
I'd sooner will it to somebody off the damn street than let the government take it!
the boy would've died of abuse if I hadn't taken him in...
That's the will of the people of all those who live in the Solid State... our just economic action!
keep your nose out of our society!
Consider yourself... warned...
I'm definitely getting the feeling that his sniping target is in there.
Yeah... okay?
sir.
Cardiac arrest confirmed.
Requesting disposal of remains and retrieval of nursing system.
didn't he have some family somewhere?
There's a six-year-old kid listed in his file... maybe?
that's one less job for me to do...
Sacred Citizen Relief Center he's missing because I rescued him.
the boy would've been taken into custody by them as part of their standard procedure.
Special operatives committing suicide...
Vanished children...
Noble Rot Senior Citizens...
The will of the people of those who live in the Solid State... what does "Solid State" mean in the first place?
What did that old man mean?
It's me.
I finally got through!
you've got to come home at once!
Our daughter is missing!
That clinches it...
Let's get after him!
Wait!
he's got optical camouflage?
What the hell is going on?
!
Her GPS is turned off...
Is it the Puppeteer?
But she doesn't have any cyber implants yet!
I need you to pinpoint which satellite he's using!
the instant he starts to shoot is gonna be our first and last chance to get him! but how are you gonna actually spot the guy?
He should be in this zone... but we'll be able to spot his position from up here.
Change into this.
You're too easy to see.
I should be able to take him!
Let's get started.
Bingo!
Send it to me!
This guy's his target?
I've got a back-trace on his position!
SE-37...
That's where he is?
Send my data back at him!
They're lining up a shot on me?
!
Saito!
Did I nail him?
Sit tight!
I'll go check!
hurry up!
Huh?
Daddy?
Well?
why don't ya?
That's a relief... then... who was that guy you were gunning for?
Why were you trying to kill him?
It was to avenge the General's death...
I'm gonna kill every last one of you Japs.
To get revenge?
Don't give me that crap!
Where'd you get your hands on that piece of intel?
It was a tip that I got from a double agent.
so I should go kill him.
And what's the name of this double agent?
An assemblyman named Munei who spends a lot of time at the Foreign Ministry...
I need you to collar an assemblyman by the name of Munei ASAP.
here's a picture of the guy that Raj was trying to kill.
Looks like he's the mastermind behind the hit on Ka Rum.
the man in this picture is the assemblyman named Hitoshi Munei...
What're you trying to pull?
The guy you were trying to whack is the same guy who fed you your intel!
That's his problem.
Maybe he wanted to commit suicide or something.
Commit suicide?
pal?
Shit...
Maybe it is.
I would've killed it right off the bat...
I'm gonna be so pissed...
The Puppeteer isn't human?
It's the name of the mechanism for abducting kids that's built into the Solid State...
The Solid State?
Hey!
What the hell is the Solid State?
You really don't know?
It's the nursing net...
The government of this democratic country of yours goes around abducting children...
It's too damn funny...
I need a paramedic team and a chopper over here.
And do some digging into this Munei guy's background.
Something fishy is going on.
Understood.
I found her right after I called you.
It sounds like she was with the neighbors since this morning.
I'm just glad that it was a false alarm.
You shouldn't leave the house without telling Mommy.
Okay!
Good girl.
I'll drop her off at school.
though.
Are you sure?
You look exhausted.
Just seeing you two makes me feel better.
if you say so.
See you later!
What is it?
Nothing!
Togusa!
too.
Which means that the Major is...
Yeah.
But the Major might not be the Puppeteer after all.
Raj Puhto says that the Puppeteer is the name of an abduction mechanism that's built into the nursing net.
Abduction mechanism?
Yeah.
and implied that the government is involved somehow.
she told me to stay away from the Solid State.
I thought that "solid state" was referring to cyber implants.
she was telling me to stay away from her.
But maybe she was actually telling me to stay away from the nursing net.
and got themselves purged.
That makes sense...
It's from Mommy.
Give me a minute.
Hello?
You ignored our warning.
Hey!
That mistake will cost you your adorable little daughter.
Togusa!
What's wrong?
!
Ishikawa!
Can you get me Togusa's current location?
!
I can look it up.
Why?
What's up?
His cyberbrain's being hacked!
Daddy?
This isn't the way to school... huh?
and how do the abducted kids fit into it?
000 children disappear to?
We are simply recycling Ghosts that have been foolishly allowed to go to waste.
I am about to let you experience for yourself exactly what some of them went through.
Kohoku Cyberbrain Surgical Hospital
Batou!
I have a fix on Togusa's location!
He's at the Cyberbrain Surgical Hospital over in Kohoku New Town!
Now I get it.
the doctors will perform the cyberization surgery without suspecting a thing.
and the abduction is complete.
and my daughter will have vanished.
You don't need to feel bad about having your memories altered.
memories are constantly being altered on a subconscious level.
The probability of such alterations already exceeds that of being in a traffic accident.
huh?
That's the place?
I'll never let you people take my daughter.
honey.
Do you think you can do what Daddy's about to ask?
run away as fast as you can.
Run away?
That's right.
just like field day at school.
run with all you've got.
don't look back.
Can you do that?
then.
Close your eyes.
honey.
Togusa!
I love you.
Togusa!
Max!
Musashi!
Everything's okay.
Don't worry.
Major?
I had to wait until the very last second.
Sorry about that.
I guess this means that you aren't the Puppeteer...
Where have you been all this time?
Daddy!
secretly stepping in on my own to solve crimes that couldn't be dealt with through organization-based methodology. and have been conducting an independent investigation of my own.
I can't believe you used Togusa as bait!
Did you ever stop to think that you might be putting his family in their crosshairs?
I made sure that I had safeguards put in place.
we should now know who the Puppeteer really is.
What?
You mean "Puppeteer" isn't the name of a system that's running on the nursing net?
it would probably be more accurate to call it a gestalt of all the senior citizens who are attached to the nursing net.
But there's an independently-running hub cyberbrain that manages the whole thing.
A hub cyberbrain?
are those what I think they are?
!
I constructed them out of data I found drifting in the net.
no see!
It's nice to see that you're doing well!
The nursing net has had a back door installed in it ever since its design stages.
Look.
This is the full view of the rhizome that's been woven by the senior citizens' gestalt.
A rhizome doesn't contain the concept of a "center."
That's why the hub cyberbrain is constantly in motion.
or the rhizome itself might be acting as the hub.
so now I know what's going on.
But who or what is the hub cyberbrain?
Max!
Musashi!
Report your findings.
What's the problem?
I don't know how to break this to you...
You failed?
though!
where is it?
The Sacred Citizen Relief Center building!
That's where the heart of the nursing net is!
They've arrived.
Disengaging locks.
Major.
I suppose it has.
It's too bad that this reunion wasn't under happier circumstances.
What made you decide to come back?
Let's save that discussion for later.
Our first order of business right now is to apprehend the Puppeteer.
Hitoshi Munei.
Assemblyman in the Lower House.
The reason why he was marked for death is our sole lead in uncovering the true identity of the Puppeteer.
He's a reactionary conservative nationalist who's always been a vocal supporter of the formation of a ruling class comprised of pure-blooded Japanese. and he also has strong ties to the Treaty Review Department.
He was also involved in Ka Rum's assassination.
Major?
I contracted out to the Treaty Review Department so that I could make it look like Ka Rum had been assassinated.
But the Puppeteer got to him before I could.
you were only responsible for covering up his death afterwards.
more or less.
We've also learned that Hitoshi Munei has secured a leadership position in the day-to-day operations of the Sacred Citizen Relief Center.
What's in it for him?
The place is just a relief center that provides senior health care and vocational training. it acts in reality as a training agency for the power elite.
So the place is a veritable brainwashing factory...
That must be what Raj Puhto meant when he implied that the government was involved. it means that the fact that Munei is using it as a brainwashing factory is what the Puppeteer has a problem with.
Chief.
How about conducting a compulsory investigation?
Our top priority is to find the missing children.
but raiding the place will cause a scandal.
it won't just be a scumbag of a politician that catches heat for it.
Ishikawa!
How's it coming?
Major?
You picked a hell of a time to rejoin the fold...
I found evidence of a massive amount of equipment being brought in...
but that's pretty flimsy evidence as a basis to conduct a raid.
How about footage from the inside?
I only found footage from their manual labor wing.
The defense barrier protecting the education wing is a complex virtual experience maze.
I had no luck at all sneaking in.
Just looks like refugees...
So the abducted children are being held in the education wing...
Which means that the abduction mechanism had already been built into this place during its planning stages.
I'd have a hard time imagining that a rank-and-file politician would have the guts to propose such an audacious policy.
So you believe that the Puppeteer was among those who were involved in laying the project's groundwork?
Ishikawa.
Use decoys to make it look like hackers are trying to dive the place.
I'm going in.
it'll give you guys some cover.
Section 9 will be able to carry on.
Batou.
I don't like to hear that kind of talk.
so you're the one who's going to retire this time?
but the only reason I came here is to ID the Puppeteer.
It's certainly true that you always need someone who can get their hands dirty for you.
I don't have anything to lose right now.
but I'm going in there myself.
The Puppeteer is waiting for a chance to eliminate Munei.
I don't want to let this chance slip by.
But how do you intend to go about finding the Puppeteer?
We still don't have the foggiest idea who he really is.
I'm going to keep my ears open.
My Ghost will whisper it to me.
huh?
Hup...
Hup...
Hup... huh?
Here we go...
Let's do it!
is there?
I'm not used to my joints yet... but their response seems strange...
Go to alert status just in case.
- Understood.
- Understood.
huh?
Oops!
I guess we have each other's attention... huh?
They're wasting their time.
I'm going out to inspect the facility.
secure an evac route!
- Roger.
- Roger.
W-Who are you people?
What good would that do you?
Then I'd have to kill you.
I've lost communications?
Here come the security cyborgs!
you go on ahead.
The one who got inside is as good as dead!
Go after the think-tanks!
Got it.
huh?
all right... he's following us...
That's fine with me.
No thermal signatures or shadows... huh?
Which means they're...
Your intel's way out of date!
They don't call Type-3302 a cloak of invisibility.
Son of a...
Shit!
You little...
Get off of...
Mow 'em down.
Roger!
Back me up.
I'll be able to gain control of the system in a few more minutes.
Leave it to me.
Haven't we always worked this way?
Togusa!
What's your current position?
!
Major?
I'm making my approach up the wall of the building.
Good.
Make your way to the roof and rendezvous with the Chief!
I've found out where the children are.
Let's go!
Assemblyman Munei.
We're Public Security Section 9.
We've already seen for ourselves what you're up to here.
a large-scale compulsory investigation... wouldn't it?
Public Security?
but it's the government's most vital agency.
You self-righteous Public Security pissants have no business here! this looks exactly like the sort of situation that we have to intervene in.
but I don't think you understand the gravity of the threat that this country faces. our country's prosperity will be supplanted by other races. and entrusting our future to them!
do you find wrong with that?
Those taxes are money that you've exploited out of the elderly and the refugees that you bind to this place!
either.
Stop and think about it.
What have they ever done for the good of this country?
They don't build families or have children!
They don't fulfill their duty as taxpayers!
take care of me!
Their selfishness is appalling!
I'd put a new tax on them to make up for the tax revenue we lose because they're too old or can't work anymore!
You're splitting hairs.
perhaps you could tell me what you politicians have been doing all this time? and constantly putting the pressing problems at hand on the back burner?
I'm proud of the fact that I have taken responsibility for it.
Are you also proud of violating human rights and cyberbrain ethics laws?
I believe that those were steps that had to be taken.
don't you?
I ran a check on the number of children here.
000 at most.
I see.
Switch your comm channel to autistic mode.
Roger.
Assemblyman.
Were you aware that a system to automatically abduct children was designed into this center?
These children aren't orphans.
The vast majority are children who were abducted.
It was our investigation into those abductions that led us here.
You yourself are a material witness in that case. and I certainly don't recall incorporating a bug like that into the system!
we'll question the people who came up with the system!
It was me.
I was the one who devised the core concepts that the Solid State system is founded on.
Togusa!
Take everybody into custody!
Roger!
I'm going to dive this guy's cyberbrain before his memories pull a whiteout!
Back me up!
I hope I'm in time!
I'm connected.
Gotcha.
I'm boosting your signal.
but the output is dropping.
do you think you can boost his output?
Let's try going in through a Tachikoma.
Come back up!
There's no time!
Puppeteer?
Puppeteer?
Puppeteer...
That's the name of the hub cyberbrain that oversaw the Noble Rot Senior Citizens' rhizome.
Yes...
I'm entering his right visual center.
too...
Hey!
What happened?
I'm patching him into my speech center.
- I owe you a debt of gratitude.
then dive again!
you see.
but he's an old-fashioned type who hates the thought of cyberization.
Who the hell are you?
What are you using the abducted children for?
perhaps my motives were the same as Munei's.
This country has reached the point where someone has to step in and take action.
The problem of 6 million-plus Noble Rot Senior Citizens... and the proportionally decreasing worker population that's continuing unabated.
And then there is the declining birth rate...
There is no end to the problems that must be addressed. 000 children under the age of six needlessly lose their lives every year?
30% of those deaths can be attributed to domestic abuse.
- Well?
Can you do it?
- And in 80% of those cases...
- I'll try.
but they were unable to prevent the deaths.
and the potential of the individual is declining considerably.
Major!
and you're gonna whiteout along with him when he dies!
That's when I came upon the idea of recycling Ghosts that were needlessly being damaged.
and then launder their family registers.
I thought that would give them a new chance at life.
that's the core concept of the Solid State system?
the assistance of the Noble Rot Senior Citizens was essential.
They hunger for something that will give them a reason to exist.
and there would be someone to bequeath their estate to.
they could simply use the net and continue to take part in this economic action.
They happily gave my plan their approval.
don't you?
those were the only possible means.
My main task was to save these children who were in danger as soon as I could.
even though it's cost me my life.
it means that my life as a bureaucrat had meaning.
All that remained was to reinforce the Solid State system to make it into a self-perpetuating mechanism. and it was found out. it was an understandable reaction on their part.
but why Munei?
Because he held the children prisoner here. my giving them a new lease on life was all for nothing. they won't develop a strong will of their own. and it was the main reason why I had to eliminate him.
But you people had to go and show up this time... my plan has now progressed smoothly to its next phase.
but now I've succeeded in getting you to link me directly into it.
Major!
You killed yourself just to lure me into linking with you?
!
I should be able to eliminate Section 9 all at once.
I'm surprised.
but you have so much drive that it's a waste of your talent to be a bureaucrat.
you know all about me...
Who the hell are you?
!
Kusanagi Motoko...
Surely there can't be many people in your memory who are burning with this much egotistical righteousness.
We've synchronized with countless consciousnesses over the years.
It shouldn't come as a huge surprise that your deep collective subconscious came to life.
the Solid State will be complete.
let's become a vanishing mediator and go take an active hand in the next society.
I can't see anything.
Somebody give me a status report.
huh?
Batou?
Are you there?
What's happening?
Where am I?
what have they decided to do with the children?
it looks like they're going to be returned to their real parents for the time being.
even knowing about the abuse...
I wonder if that's really what's best for the kids.
Perhaps the fact that they can't answer that question after all this highlights the limitations of our system.
What'll happen to those kids who found foster parents and managed to get out before their brainwashing education could begin?
We'll probably have to wait a long time for the verdicts of what I expect will be some rather complicated trials as they go through them on a case-by-case basis.
what can we even hope to do about things like this?
The only thing I can tell you is this:
All we can do is continue to work within the rules that govern us to make a stand against the unjust.
they've reached their full potential and will find the answers that we weren't able to.
the "Solid State system" is a pretty ironic name.
The guy's metaphor of choice was "transistors" to describe the cyberbrains of senior citizens... isn't it?
I was a little freaked out to learn who the Puppeteer really was.
How do you mean?
We learned a few things after you lost consciousness when he died.
That pencil-pusher actually died two years ago.
33.
and was on the fast track to elite status since childhood.
Joined the Ministry of Management and Coordination right after graduating college. possibly because he had become a civil servant with no sense of purpose.
he was allowed to work from home via a remote prosthetic body... he apparently carried out his duties in an indifferent manner. which would be carried out by manipulating both the Welfare and Management Ministries.
Koshiki independently designed and implemented his abduction system.
he wasn't the kind of guy who stood out. not one damn person noticed that he had gotten sick and died at home.
the true identity of the Puppeteer is gonna remain a mystery forever.
So does that mean that somebody else entirely was using that remote body to cause all this?
It's possible.
that theory is probably more likely. their actions were caused by their collective unconscious.
So there's no way for us to find out for sure now.
Oh.
thatis for the conversation between you and Koshiki that was recorded in the Tachikomas' memory.
It's still in there? ...all of his memories underwent a whiteout.
Batou?
kinda.
does it? all that stuff is on its way toward being resolved now.
this case is still more or less closed.
Written off as a scandal involving a handful of bad-apple politicians?
Batou...
What have I been feeling so jaded and disillusioned about?
What do you think I was searching for as I was wandering the net?
Truth?
Friendship?
Or maybe a certain special someone?
Maybe I just wanted to blame this organization or even the system for my own sense of helplessness.
What's gotten into you?
You turning all meek and modest on me?
Did you get whatever it was out of your system?
what're you gonna do now?
You plan on keeping up that "conducting investigations chosen by personal deduction" routine of yours by yourself?
too. it doesn't feel like my actions are accomplishing anything.
I guess I'm right back to where I started from...
What's that supposed to mean?
That your way of saying you're coming back to Section 9?
But what about Togusa?
Won't I get in the way of his development?
he wasn't gonna go any further anyway.
I wouldn't sweat it if I were you.
Maybe you're right.
the net truly is vast and infinite.
Maybe a new society we've never even dreamed of is already being born.
Passengers and crew have been evacuated as per terrorism response manual.
All arriving and departing flights are in a holding pattern or waiting on the apron.
Divert only those planes that are expected to run low on fuel to other airports.
305 calling 102.
Public Security Section 9 has arrived.
Give any assistance they need.
This is priority one.
Full authority for this incident has been transferred to them.
my people have taken casualties!
there'd better be a damn good reason for us to...
Keep this line clear.
There's no telling if there's a back-hack on it.
what's going down here is way out of our league.
Found him.
Immigration Gates Currently Closed
the initial reports say that the suspect willingly submitted to questioning. he almost seemed happy about it.
Happy?
Yes...
That doesn't make much sense.
the Big Man isn't gonna meet up with us?
He said he's gonna stick with his "I only work cases that I pick... too.
the fact is that we were only able to connect the dots in this case because Batou stuck his nose where it didn't belong.
take the two rookies with you and come in through the north gate.
We're on it.
The two of us are taking the frontal approach.
Roger that.
Boss.
I can't believe you outgrew that Mateba fixation of yours.
Nobody said I outgrew it.
right?
Yeah.
then.
What does it look like?
It's an unexpected development.
So now there's a chance that he's armed?
it's just a 9mm.
This is just peachy...
Colonel Ka Gael!
We're with Public Security!
We're willing to consider granting you safe passage out of the country as you demanded.
Start by releasing your hostage.
Then we can talk.
Ka Gael!
Are you listening?
Ka Gael!
Drop your weapon!
give me the gun.
The Enemy Cannot Be Allowed to Live Under the Same Sky looks like he's high on a military-use reflex booster.
Understood.
Ka Gael!
The Puppeteer is coming!
I don't want to die!
hurry up and drop the piece!
What did you say to me?
You're not gonna make a public spectacle outta me!
Don't!
Shit!
What the hell did he do that for?
!
huh?
Not a bad name at all...
Prime Minister Kayabuki.
Special operatives tattooed with "true believer" to show their loyalty to General Ka Rum have been committing suicide one by one here in Japan.
too.
You still insist there is no need to interrogate the General in spite of these incidents?
Some reports are saying that Col. Ka's death was the result of a botched arrest attempt.
I find it hard to imagine that General Ka is involved in the plan while under house arrest.
Please do your utmost to avoid fueling the actions of the opposition faction that have accompanied my enactment of the Refugee Naturalization Policy.
I was under the impression that such work falls under Public Security's purview.
ma'am.
Ishikawa.
Send me the files from Ka Gael's debriefing.
Coming right up.
We're moving out!
sir?
I don't believe she gave you authorization for that.
I didn't break my word to her.
7072.
Has the scene provided you with any new material data?
I haven't found anything yet.
Call in the Supervisor.
There's some old...
Batou.
Batou?
I'm listening.
Where are you?
True Believer
We found the body of a 13th tattooed man.
- Is this one another suicide?
- Yeah.
This place looks a lot like our own safehouses.
It was probably one of their hideouts.
Let the Prefectural Police handle this.
Grab one of your subordinates and go to this location.
It's a secret hideout that Ka Gael told us about in his debriefing.
You sure that a mainstream job like that isn't more up Togusa's alley?
Togusa's coming with me to the Dungeon.
I follow you.
Togusa.
How long has it been since the Major resigned from Section 9?
I guess.
That long...
I'm sorry about what happened with Ka Gael.
There was nothing you could have done.
This is a vital matter which might prove to be Prime Minister Kayabuki's Achilles' heel.
Her intention is probably to keep a lid on things that she doesn't want to see right now.
Kayabuki was scared that the other countries at the six-party talks would look too closely at the real motivation behind the Refugee Naturalization Policy.
This whole damn mess got started because she was forced into looking after Ka Rum! he said that he'd carry out acts of terrorism in retaliation.
I will visit terror throughout the world.
huh?
right? we should be able to get a feel for the overall plan.
We'll also learn how far along this terrorist plot is right now.
Chief.
We just got word from the Coast Guard that they've opened up the airspace over the island.
Good.
Thank them for me and take us down at once.
Make sure you doctor the records of our flight plan!
Roger that!
No firearms or knives detected!
Clear!
Proto.
Turn the power back on and open the blinds.
Roger.
What's the matter?
Chief...
It looks like he pulled them out himself.
This is bad news... their plan might already be in motion.
What's that?
This?
It's a terminal that links to the nursing net.
it's used to exchange a patient's medical data with all medical facilities.
Looks like those rumors about Ka Rum being seriously ill before he fled his country were true.
even though he was hooked up to that?
Hm?
Bingo!
He was going through a back door in the system!
I guess there was more to the good General here than meets the eye.
Looks that way.
The comm log shows that he was in contact with his people. but they definitely seemed to be planning a terrorist strike using a micromachine virus.
were planning? he talked with Ka Gael about whether they should abort the plan for the time being.
What do you mean?
Are you saying that the suicides weren't meant as the plot's "go" code?
I don't know.
But what really worries me is that there was a program planted in here from the outside designed to make it look like Ka Rum was still alive.
The government probably still hasn't caught on to the fact that this guy is dead.
an assassination set up to look like suicide?
Yeah.
Committed by somebody who doesn't want the goverment to know Ka Rum is dead.
or... what about the micromachine virus?
Looks like it was delivered to that Ma Shaba guy's hospital.
he might be able to recover it for us.
Togusa!
What the hell is this?
Puppeteer"?
didn't Ka Gael say something about a puppeteer just before he died?
I think he did... too.
Looks like it's the codename for one of his men.
Looks like we need to apprehend Ma Shaba as soon as possible.
go meet up with Batou.
It's imperative that we ascertain the full scope of this plot.
What should we do with the stiff?
but we were never here.
Understood.
A hospital?
That car sticks out like a sore thumb around here...
This security system setup kinda reminds me of...
You head around from the outside!
Roger.
What the hell?
You can't hack my cyberbrain if I'm in here!
Puppeteer!
huh?
Batou?
That looked like... 657)}Open
Get clear!
You dumbass!
I'll come back for you later.
Play dead.
Roger.
Hold it!
Major?
what brings you to this part of town?
I knew it was you...
I should ask you the same thing.
I guess you could say.
Here it comes!
Just a second.
What the hell?
Hold on to this for me.
Hey!
wait a minute...
Isn't that Ma Shaba?
I'm surprised you know who he is.
surprised"?
What the hell are you up to?
give that back.
Hey!
Has your taste in cars changed?
When did she swipe my... this isn't too shabby at all.
I'm guessing that the reason you're here is because you're following a lead on that string of suicides of tattooed men.
But let me give you a friendly warning.
Stay away from the Solid State.
you'll end up killing yourself just like they did.
wait a...
- You can find your car yourself.
Didn't I tell you to bring along one of your men?
!
that's why I brought this hunk of junk.
too.
Cause of death?
Neck trauma resulting from impacts during the runaway.
Looks like Ma Shaba wasn't the Puppeteer.
why the hell did he attack you in that thing?
Beats me.
That's what I'd like to know.
Maybe he attacked you because he thought you were the Puppeteer.
what's this "Puppeteer" you keep talking about?
but it seems to be a rebel's codename.
We have reason to believe that deaths of the tattooed men and Ka Rum were all crimes orchestrated by this person.
He hacks other people's cyberbrains and forces them to commit suicide.
we seem to be dealing with a super-wizard class hacker.
Wizard-class?
we figured out how Ka Rum's terrorist attack was going to work.
What did you learn?
You should come see this for yourself.
It looks like Ka Rum was trying to spread his virus by implanting children with micromachines.
my ass!
No human being could come up with something this sick!
Section 9 is going to figure out my M.O. one of these days.
hold the fort while I'm gone.
Looks like controlling two prosthetic bodies at once is my limit.
I suppose our only option is to start their training again from square one.
and we even tried using natural oil again... so perhaps this means that their previous environment hasn't been perfectly replicated.
huh?
Africa was a lot harsher than I imagined.
but it still hit me hard. your O2 extraction rate's gonna take a hit.
I didn't have much choice.
Not as long as I'm working here.
now you...
I gotta hand it to you guys. we've determined that the group is composed of 16 members: and someone named Raj Puhto.
Who's this Raj Puhto guy?
What's the likelihood of him being the Puppeteer?
He doesn't seem to have successfully entered the country yet.
We've verified that much from their communications log.
There aren't a whole lot of people who will follow you to the grave when you tell 'em to die with you.
Things always seem to work out that way when dictators buy the farm.
16 people is nothing to sneeze at...
Batou?
When'd you get back?
don't let me interrupt you.
let's continue.
Next. was brought into the country. a genetically-engineered form of smallpox that's had a time-release function added.
That's one nasty little bug that they lost track of...
Batou.
There's something that I need to make sure of.
You're sure that you didn't see anyone at Ma Shaba's hospital?
Yeah.
there wasn't any indication of intervention by a third party?
Nope.
If you say so.
What exactly are you getting at?
Well... we weren't able to ID the owner of that crushed car in the parking lot.
Maybe it was stolen.
that's pretty doubtful.
part of the security camera footage had been deleted.
I'm thinking that we should work under the assumption that someone else was there.
And that "someone" was the Puppeteer?
Possibly. but there's lots of evidence to suggest that this "Puppeteer" hacker will pick up where Ka left off. while investigating the Puppeteer at the same time.
Roger.
Togusa.
What do you want me to do?
get some RR.
Eliminating the main cause of human error is your top priority.
Gotcha.
I'll take you up on that offer.
and Batou?
"It's about time you reeled him in. or you can work under me on the Puppeteer investigation.
I'll leave the choice up to you.
What'll it be?
Do you even need to ask me that?
I'm on the Puppeteer.
All right.
Learned anything?
a few things.
Skip the preliminaries and fill us in.
I got the results back from the medical checks we ran on the 16 kids.
There were no signs that they'd been injected with micromachines. they're all basically healthy. and their ID's had been rewritten to turn them into somebody else. they had no memories whatsoever. there was just old people there living by themselves.
Any chance that those old people are really their parents?
Not likely.
We saw everything from an old woman living alone in a 10-by-8 room to a rich old coot who could afford to pay for nursing robots out of his own pocket.
they were all Noble Rot Senior Citizens who were hooked up to the nursing system.
there were no signs that any children had ever lived there. too.
What are these "Noble Rot Senior Citizens"?
the term came from the way old people who are hooked up to what's called the "Fully Automatic Nursing System" and given bare minimum medical treatment lie there like grapes infested with noble rot shrivelling on the vine. to prevent them from dying alone and unnoticed. they started mocking it as a thinly-disguised asset collection system.
You sure know a lot about this.
I've heard all about it from the old ladies who come to my pachinko place.
It's kind of like a bare-bones version of the model that was next to Ka Rum's bed.
wait a minute.
right?
why did he go to the trouble of erasing their memories of their parents? wouldn't it have been smarter to erase the memories of the abduction and then send them back home?
you're asking the wrong guy.
you definitely have a point there.
he's going to an awful lot of trouble.
The operations seem to have been performed prior to the abductions.
as well.
Labor and Welfare. a consent form signed by a parent or guardian is required by law.
There were 144 missing ampules... we should probably check to see if there are any kids listed there who fit the same description.
Good call.
and Welfare the records would've been automatically recorded in the databases of the MHLW and the Management Ministry.
If they were abducted afterwards and their family registries were altered... there'll be a discrepancy in the number of kids listed as cyberized in the national ID system... and Welfare.
I follow you.
Since we have 16 here who say they have the same last name... that should be true.
000?
!
There has to be some kind of mistake.
somebody would've noticed.
you're right.
that number's way larger than anything we expected.
What do you want to do?
Let's start by eliminating the worst case scenario.
figure out the names and addresses of the excess children in the database.
I'm on it.
I can have that for you in a few seconds.
A trap?
!
This is an emergency.
Class E virus detected.
Shut down all equipment immediately.
This is an emergency...
Beginning virus scan.
- Vaccine pattern match in progress.
- Shut down all equipment immediately.
Incursion into server has reached...
It's no use!
It's not accepting any commands!
Higaki!
Soga!
Lock down the backup server!
Too late!
It's already been compromised!
then!
Gimme a hand!
There was a virus planted in the Management Ministry's database?
too!
The MHLW's data is intact?
though.
Move it!
Management Ministry database is...
I bet the Management Ministry's buzzing like a poked beehive right about now.
we just lost the best lead we had... 000 abductions.
What do you mean?
Common sense says there's no way that Ka Gael's crew could have pulled off that many abductions.
the Puppeteer.
The M.O. is just too sloppy. don't you think it's strange that he'd leave traces of tampering in just the national ID system?
now please find them.
I think he's got something else in mind.
I have to concur with your opinion.
Chief?
These were delivered to the MHLW's Pathogenic Microorganism Isolation Facility.
Analysis has identified them as a Seok-produced micromachine virus.
This would certainly seem to suggest that our intel was indeed correct.
What did the person who delivered it look like?
or when.
So there's a chance that this person might be the Puppeteer?
It's certainly possible.
what's the Puppeteer's final objective in all this?
It wasn't to keep Ka's terrorist plot rolling?
It would seem that there's a chance that the Puppeteer is a hacker sent by some government agency or other.
The skill with which Ka Rum's death was covered up has been nagging at me.
I heard rumors of a rather suspicious conversation that took place between the Prime Minister and the Foreign Affairs Ministry not long ago. the man who was such a big thorn in the government's side?
yes.
we should probably think of the abductions as a decoy.
Which Section was it that took the job? we and the government are on the same page.
I believe we should let sleeping dogs lie and avoid worsening the situation.
but it ends there.
I'm temporarily pulling you off of the investigation into the Puppeteer.
That is all.
man... and now we've got an assload of loose ends to tie up.
the least we can do is track down those kids' parents as soon as we can.
I'm on my way there now.
Sorry I'm late.
I need to ask you something.
what?
Who made you pull us off this case?
The Treaty Review Department?
you mean that.
I cut a deal with Nakamura. we were allowed to take possession of the micromachine virus.
And you're okay with that? you should be offended that they didn't ask us to do it.
old man?
not when we're like this.
or do we rejoice?
The answer to that question will determine what path we will walk down in the future.
I completely understand the point you're trying to make.
But we also must consider the possibility that the Major will never return to Section 9.
Her talents were even rarer than ESP.
no one can fill her shoes but her.
I myself won't be able to stay here forever. shouldn't we create an organization capable of tackling three at once using only 80%?
Don't you think that's the best way for it to carry on our ideals even after we're gone?
That's what I had in mind as I worked to expand our organization.
Making Togusa the squad commander was part of that larger plan.
things might have worked out differently.
I'm not cut out for positions like that.
perhaps you're right.
But it's different with Togusa.
A man has to overcome a great many hurdles for his innate talent to blossom.
I want you to give him the support he needs.
I think he's doing a fine job.
The Major'd say that he's keeping his personal feelings out of the way of doing his job. as well as the prosthetics he got.
But I doubt he had an easy time of winning their understanding.
That's something that I was never able to do to the very end.
I'm glad we were able to talk like this again.
It doesn't look like I'll be able to make it home again tonight.
It can't be helped.
You're in a position of responsibility now.
have the kids been behaving?
Yes. it's been a little quiet around here without those two fighting.
huh?
She's growing up.
she's six now.
she's six already... okay?
Sure.
Will do.
we have an emergency!
Get to Flat 47 right away!
What happened?
!
sir...
The children are...
They were gone by the time we realized what was up.
It's just like what happened with Ka Gael...
Sure looks that way.
The Puppeteer... he would've made him pull the trigger a long time ago.
He's just trying to buy time!
Shit!
Ishikawa!
Borma!
Use the IR-System to find those kids ASAP!
We're barely able to keep the damn lights on right now!
too!
Get Proto to the analysis room.
Togusa!
We need to talk!
It can wait until later!
Finding those kids comes first!
This is important!
I think I might know who the Puppeteer is.
It's Aramaki.
Pardon me.
What kept you?
things are hectic at work.
Colonel Tonoda?
I see.
Don't be so hard on him.
They tell me that his health problems are due to the stress of prison life.
Where's that ingrate Tsujisaki?
He hasn't come to see me even once.
He's forgotten the debt he owes to the man who looked out for him more than anyone else!
too.
Let's step outside for a minute.
There's something I want to give you.
There's nothing left now of the man they called Colonel Red Demon.
You should think about remarrying.
There's no sorrier sight than a single old man.
I decided long ago that I'd never own anything that I couldn't take to the grave with me.
I see.
what was it that you wanted to give to me?
Right.
This is it.
I ran into the Major at Ma Shaba's hospital.
The Major?
You can't be saying that...
I didn't think it was possible.
I became more and more convinced that she had to be the Puppeteer.
I missed my chance to bring it up earlier.
Did you see her kill Ma Shaba?
No.
But I did see her walk off with the ampules.
I'd always butt in whenever it seemed like the Major might be involved in a given case.
I always thought that she was helping us solve the case in her own way.
But this time is different.
What the hell is the Major trying to do?
Hell if I know.
But it was the Treaty Review Department that set up the hit on Ka Rum.
That's probably where the Major is.
Batou!
I want you and Saito to head for beltway #16 immediately!
This has top priority!
too.
He's what?
!
but I think the Puppeteer is...
Let's keep this to ourselves for now.
I'll try to verify it for myself.
right?
I suppose it is.
what's happened on your end?
security cameras in coastal district 2 happened to catch sight of an internationally-wanted criminal.
Huh?
Who is he?
He must be a tough customer if you want me and Saito on it.
formerly of the Seok Republic.
Lieutenant Raj Puhto.
that was one of the names from... huh?
He was the commander of Ka Rum's personal guard.
he'd sought asylum in China after Seok fell... there must be something to this...
Right.
the Intelligence Bureau has a fix on his current position.
I want the two of you to tail him and find out what his objective is.
- Roger.
- Roger.
if it turns out that the Major is the Puppeteer and we have to take her on... either.
I'll repay you for this favor.
I'm afraid I can't stay any longer today. but you didn't turn out anything like me.
It makes me happy that a fool like me produced a genius like you.
all right?
Colonel.
What's his M.O. gonna be for his sniping?
The same as mine.
and then take his shot.
Which means it's only a matter of time before we lose the ability to track him by GPS.
we have to catch him before then.
Lemme take over.
I'm gonna get a look at his face.
Don't let him spot you.
I have confirmation.
this is our guy.
Togusa!
The IR-System has picked up one of the kids.
Really?
What's his location?
Walking through the grounds of the Kohoku public housing projects.
that's near where I live.
I'll go check it out.
I'll put in a call to the PPD.
000 abduction cases for us...
Looks that way.
I guess we have to put the Major on the backburner for now...
Treaty Review Department #6 Archive Room
I presume?
It's certainly a fitting name.
I received an inquiry a few minutes ago from Public Security Section 9 asking me if I knew who a hacker known as the Puppeteer might be.
I don't.
what did you want to talk to me about?
I came here to refund your payment. we don't care what you do to get the job done.
but you won't be seeing me again.
I'll leave a net channel open for you to contact us.
Feel free to... too?
too...
The sun's about to come up... why do you think he decided to come here now?
You don't think it's to carry out Ka Rum's revenge?
but how would he have gotten his hands on that intel?
Even we were left out of the loop on that little tidbit.
You have a point.
how much longer is this guy gonna keep driving around town?
there's that building again.
isn't that the... the kid just went into apartment 602 in building N25.
Can you find it?
I know this neighborhood like the back of my hand.
A Noble Rot Senior Citizen...
Give him back!
Everything I have is invested in that boy!
I'd sooner will it to somebody off the damn street than let the government take it!
the boy would've died of abuse if I hadn't taken him in...
That's the will of the people of all those who live in the Solid State... our just economic action!
keep your nose out of our society!
Consider yourself... warned...
I'm definitely getting the feeling that his sniping target is in there.
Yeah... okay?
sir.
Cardiac arrest confirmed.
Requesting disposal of remains and retrieval of nursing system.
didn't he have some family somewhere?
There's a six-year-old kid listed in his file... maybe?
that's one less job for me to do...
Sacred Citizen Relief Center he's missing because I rescued him.
the boy would've been taken into custody by them as part of their standard procedure.
Special operatives committing suicide...
Vanished children...
Noble Rot Senior Citizens...
The will of the people of those who live in the Solid State... what does "Solid State" mean in the first place?
What did that old man mean?
It's me.
I finally got through!
you've got to come home at once!
Our daughter is missing!
That clinches it...
Let's get after him!
Wait!
he's got optical camouflage?
What the hell is going on?
!
Her GPS is turned off...
Is it the Puppeteer?
But she doesn't have any cyber implants yet!
I need you to pinpoint which satellite he's using!
the instant he starts to shoot is gonna be our first and last chance to get him! but how are you gonna actually spot the guy?
He should be in this zone... but we'll be able to spot his position from up here.
Change into this.
You're too easy to see.
I should be able to take him!
Let's get started.
Bingo!
Send it to me!
This guy's his target?
I've got a back-trace on his position!
SE-37...
That's where he is?
Send my data back at him!
They're lining up a shot on me?
!
Saito!
Did I nail him?
Sit tight!
I'll go check!
hurry up!
Huh?
Daddy?
Well?
why don't ya?
That's a relief... then... who was that guy you were gunning for?
Why were you trying to kill him?
It was to avenge the General's death...
I'm gonna kill every last one of you Japs.
To get revenge?
Don't give me that crap!
Where'd you get your hands on that piece of intel?
It was a tip that I got from a double agent.
so I should go kill him.
And what's the name of this double agent?
An assemblyman named Munei who spends a lot of time at the Foreign Ministry...
I need you to collar an assemblyman by the name of Munei ASAP.
here's a picture of the guy that Raj was trying to kill.
Looks like he's the mastermind behind the hit on Ka Rum.
the man in this picture is the assemblyman named Hitoshi Munei...
What're you trying to pull?
The guy you were trying to whack is the same guy who fed you your intel!
That's his problem.
Maybe he wanted to commit suicide or something.
Commit suicide?
pal?
Shit...
Maybe it is.
I would've killed it right off the bat...
I'm gonna be so pissed...
The Puppeteer isn't human?
It's the name of the mechanism for abducting kids that's built into the Solid State...
The Solid State?
Hey!
What the hell is the Solid State?
You really don't know?
It's the nursing net...
The government of this democratic country of yours goes around abducting children...
It's too damn funny...
I need a paramedic team and a chopper over here.
And do some digging into this Munei guy's background.
Something fishy is going on.
Understood.
I found her right after I called you.
It sounds like she was with the neighbors since this morning.
I'm just glad that it was a false alarm.
You shouldn't leave the house without telling Mommy.
Okay!
Good girl.
I'll drop her off at school.
though.
Are you sure?
You look exhausted.
Just seeing you two makes me feel better.
if you say so.
See you later!
What is it?
Nothing!
Togusa!
too.
Which means that the Major is...
Yeah.
But the Major might not be the Puppeteer after all.
Raj Puhto says that the Puppeteer is the name of an abduction mechanism that's built into the nursing net.
Abduction mechanism?
Yeah.
and implied that the government is involved somehow.
she told me to stay away from the Solid State.
I thought that "solid state" was referring to cyber implants.
she was telling me to stay away from her.
But maybe she was actually telling me to stay away from the nursing net.
and got themselves purged.
That makes sense...
It's from Mommy.
Give me a minute.
Hello?
You ignored our warning.
Hey!
That mistake will cost you your adorable little daughter.
Togusa!
What's wrong?
!
Ishikawa!
Can you get me Togusa's current location?
!
I can look it up.
Why?
What's up?
His cyberbrain's being hacked!
Daddy?
This isn't the way to school... huh?
and how do the abducted kids fit into it?
000 children disappear to?
We are simply recycling Ghosts that have been foolishly allowed to go to waste.
I am about to let you experience for yourself exactly what some of them went through.
Kohoku Cyberbrain Surgical Hospital
Batou!
I have a fix on Togusa's location!
He's at the Cyberbrain Surgical Hospital over in Kohoku New Town!
Now I get it.
the doctors will perform the cyberization surgery without suspecting a thing.
and the abduction is complete.
and my daughter will have vanished.
You don't need to feel bad about having your memories altered.
memories are constantly being altered on a subconscious level.
The probability of such alterations already exceeds that of being in a traffic accident.
huh?
That's the place?
I'll never let you people take my daughter.
honey.
Do you think you can do what Daddy's about to ask?
run away as fast as you can.
Run away?
That's right.
just like field day at school.
run with all you've got.
don't look back.
Can you do that?
then.
Close your eyes.
honey.
Togusa!
I love you.
Togusa!
Max!
Musashi!
Everything's okay.
Don't worry.
Major?
I had to wait until the very last second.
Sorry about that.
I guess this means that you aren't the Puppeteer...
Where have you been all this time?
Daddy!
secretly stepping in on my own to solve crimes that couldn't be dealt with through organization-based methodology. and have been conducting an independent investigation of my own.
I can't believe you used Togusa as bait!
Did you ever stop to think that you might be putting his family in their crosshairs?
I made sure that I had safeguards put in place.
we should now know who the Puppeteer really is.
What?
You mean "Puppeteer" isn't the name of a system that's running on the nursing net?
it would probably be more accurate to call it a gestalt of all the senior citizens who are attached to the nursing net.
But there's an independently-running hub cyberbrain that manages the whole thing.
A hub cyberbrain?
are those what I think they are?
!
I constructed them out of data I found drifting in the net.
no see!
It's nice to see that you're doing well!
The nursing net has had a back door installed in it ever since its design stages.
Look.
This is the full view of the rhizome that's been woven by the senior citizens' gestalt.
A rhizome doesn't contain the concept of a "center."
That's why the hub cyberbrain is constantly in motion.
or the rhizome itself might be acting as the hub.
so now I know what's going on.
But who or what is the hub cyberbrain?
Max!
Musashi!
Report your findings.
What's the problem?
I don't know how to break this to you...
You failed?
though!
where is it?
The Sacred Citizen Relief Center building!
That's where the heart of the nursing net is!
They've arrived.
Disengaging locks.
Major.
I suppose it has.
It's too bad that this reunion wasn't under happier circumstances.
What made you decide to come back?
Let's save that discussion for later.
Our first order of business right now is to apprehend the Puppeteer.
Hitoshi Munei.
Assemblyman in the Lower House.
The reason why he was marked for death is our sole lead in uncovering the true identity of the Puppeteer.
He's a reactionary conservative nationalist who's always been a vocal supporter of the formation of a ruling class comprised of pure-blooded Japanese. and he also has strong ties to the Treaty Review Department.
He was also involved in Ka Rum's assassination.
Major?
I contracted out to the Treaty Review Department so that I could make it look like Ka Rum had been assassinated.
But the Puppeteer got to him before I could.
you were only responsible for covering up his death afterwards.
more or less.
We've also learned that Hitoshi Munei has secured a leadership position in the day-to-day operations of the Sacred Citizen Relief Center.
What's in it for him?
The place is just a relief center that provides senior health care and vocational training. it acts in reality as a training agency for the power elite.
So the place is a veritable brainwashing factory...
That must be what Raj Puhto meant when he implied that the government was involved. it means that the fact that Munei is using it as a brainwashing factory is what the Puppeteer has a problem with.
Chief.
How about conducting a compulsory investigation?
Our top priority is to find the missing children.
but raiding the place will cause a scandal.
it won't just be a scumbag of a politician that catches heat for it.
Ishikawa!
How's it coming?
Major?
You picked a hell of a time to rejoin the fold...
I found evidence of a massive amount of equipment being brought in...
but that's pretty flimsy evidence as a basis to conduct a raid.
How about footage from the inside?
I only found footage from their manual labor wing.
The defense barrier protecting the education wing is a complex virtual experience maze.
I had no luck at all sneaking in.
Just looks like refugees...
So the abducted children are being held in the education wing...
Which means that the abduction mechanism had already been built into this place during its planning stages.
I'd have a hard time imagining that a rank-and-file politician would have the guts to propose such an audacious policy.
So you believe that the Puppeteer was among those who were involved in laying the project's groundwork?
Ishikawa.
Use decoys to make it look like hackers are trying to dive the place.
I'm going in.
it'll give you guys some cover.
Section 9 will be able to carry on.
Batou.
I don't like to hear that kind of talk.
so you're the one who's going to retire this time?
but the only reason I came here is to ID the Puppeteer.
It's certainly true that you always need someone who can get their hands dirty for you.
I don't have anything to lose right now.
but I'm going in there myself.
The Puppeteer is waiting for a chance to eliminate Munei.
I don't want to let this chance slip by.
But how do you intend to go about finding the Puppeteer?
We still don't have the foggiest idea who he really is.
I'm going to keep my ears open.
My Ghost will whisper it to me.
huh?
Hup...
Hup...
Hup... huh?
Here we go...
Let's do it!
is there?
I'm not used to my joints yet... but their response seems strange...
Go to alert status just in case.
- Understood.
- Understood.
huh?
Oops!
I guess we have each other's attention... huh?
They're wasting their time.
I'm going out to inspect the facility.
secure an evac route!
- Roger.
- Roger.
W-Who are you people?
What good would that do you?
Then I'd have to kill you.
I've lost communications?
Here come the security cyborgs!
you go on ahead.
The one who got inside is as good as dead!
Go after the think-tanks!
Got it.
huh?
all right... he's following us...
That's fine with me.
No thermal signatures or shadows... huh?
Which means they're...
Your intel's way out of date!
They don't call Type-3302 a cloak of invisibility.
Son of a...
Shit!
You little...
Get off of...
Mow 'em down.
Roger!
Back me up.
I'll be able to gain control of the system in a few more minutes.
Leave it to me.
Haven't we always worked this way?
Togusa!
What's your current position?
!
Major?
I'm making my approach up the wall of the building.
Good.
Make your way to the roof and rendezvous with the Chief!
I've found out where the children are.
Let's go!
Assemblyman Munei.
We're Public Security Section 9.
We've already seen for ourselves what you're up to here.
a large-scale compulsory investigation... wouldn't it?
Public Security?
but it's the government's most vital agency.
You self-righteous Public Security pissants have no business here! this looks exactly like the sort of situation that we have to intervene in.
but I don't think you understand the gravity of the threat that this country faces. our country's prosperity will be supplanted by other races. and entrusting our future to them!
do you find wrong with that?
Those taxes are money that you've exploited out of the elderly and the refugees that you bind to this place!
either.
Stop and think about it.
What have they ever done for the good of this country?
They don't build families or have children!
They don't fulfill their duty as taxpayers!
take care of me!
Their selfishness is appalling!
I'd put a new tax on them to make up for the tax revenue we lose because they're too old or can't work anymore!
You're splitting hairs.
perhaps you could tell me what you politicians have been doing all this time? and constantly putting the pressing problems at hand on the back burner?
I'm proud of the fact that I have taken responsibility for it.
Are you also proud of violating human rights and cyberbrain ethics laws?
I believe that those were steps that had to be taken.
don't you?
I ran a check on the number of children here.
000 at most.
I see.
Switch your comm channel to autistic mode.
Roger.
Assemblyman.
Were you aware that a system to automatically abduct children was designed into this center?
These children aren't orphans.
The vast majority are children who were abducted.
It was our investigation into those abductions that led us here.
You yourself are a material witness in that case. and I certainly don't recall incorporating a bug like that into the system!
we'll question the people who came up with the system!
It was me.
I was the one who devised the core concepts that the Solid State system is founded on.
Togusa!
Take everybody into custody!
Roger!
I'm going to dive this guy's cyberbrain before his memories pull a whiteout!
Back me up!
I hope I'm in time!
I'm connected.
Gotcha.
I'm boosting your signal.
but the output is dropping.
do you think you can boost his output?
Let's try going in through a Tachikoma.
Come back up!
There's no time!
Puppeteer?
Puppeteer?
Puppeteer...
That's the name of the hub cyberbrain that oversaw the Noble Rot Senior Citizens' rhizome.
Yes...
I'm entering his right visual center.
too...
Hey!
What happened?
I'm patching him into my speech center.
- I owe you a debt of gratitude.
then dive again!
you see.
but he's an old-fashioned type who hates the thought of cyberization.
Who the hell are you?
What are you using the abducted children for?
perhaps my motives were the same as Munei's.
This country has reached the point where someone has to step in and take action.
The problem of 6 million-plus Noble Rot Senior Citizens... and the proportionally decreasing worker population that's continuing unabated.
And then there is the declining birth rate...
There is no end to the problems that must be addressed. 000 children under the age of six needlessly lose their lives every year?
30% of those deaths can be attributed to domestic abuse.
- Well?
Can you do it?
- And in 80% of those cases...
- I'll try.
but they were unable to prevent the deaths.
and the potential of the individual is declining considerably.
Major!
and you're gonna whiteout along with him when he dies!
That's when I came upon the idea of recycling Ghosts that were needlessly being damaged.
and then launder their family registers.
I thought that would give them a new chance at life.
that's the core concept of the Solid State system?
the assistance of the Noble Rot Senior Citizens was essential.
They hunger for something that will give them a reason to exist.
and there would be someone to bequeath their estate to.
they could simply use the net and continue to take part in this economic action.
They happily gave my plan their approval.
don't you?
those were the only possible means.
My main task was to save these children who were in danger as soon as I could.
even though it's cost me my life.
it means that my life as a bureaucrat had meaning.
All that remained was to reinforce the Solid State system to make it into a self-perpetuating mechanism. and it was found out. it was an understandable reaction on their part.
but why Munei?
Because he held the children prisoner here. my giving them a new lease on life was all for nothing. they won't develop a strong will of their own. and it was the main reason why I had to eliminate him.
But you people had to go and show up this time... my plan has now progressed smoothly to its next phase.
but now I've succeeded in getting you to link me directly into it.
Major!
You killed yourself just to lure me into linking with you?
!
I should be able to eliminate Section 9 all at once.
I'm surprised.
but you have so much drive that it's a waste of your talent to be a bureaucrat.
you know all about me...
Who the hell are you?
!
Kusanagi Motoko...
Surely there can't be many people in your memory who are burning with this much egotistical righteousness.
We've synchronized with countless consciousnesses over the years.
It shouldn't come as a huge surprise that your deep collective subconscious came to life.
the Solid State will be complete.
let's become a vanishing mediator and go take an active hand in the next society.
I can't see anything.
Somebody give me a status report.
huh?
Batou?
Are you there?
What's happening?
Where am I?
what have they decided to do with the children?
it looks like they're going to be returned to their real parents for the time being.
even knowing about the abuse...
I wonder if that's really what's best for the kids.
Perhaps the fact that they can't answer that question after all this highlights the limitations of our system.
What'll happen to those kids who found foster parents and managed to get out before their brainwashing education could begin?
We'll probably have to wait a long time for the verdicts of what I expect will be some rather complicated trials as they go through them on a case-by-case basis.
what can we even hope to do about things like this?
The only thing I can tell you is this:
All we can do is continue to work within the rules that govern us to make a stand against the unjust.
they've reached their full potential and will find the answers that we weren't able to.
the "Solid State system" is a pretty ironic name.
The guy's metaphor of choice was "transistors" to describe the cyberbrains of senior citizens... isn't it?
I was a little freaked out to learn who the Puppeteer really was.
How do you mean?
We learned a few things after you lost consciousness when he died.
That pencil-pusher actually died two years ago.
33.
and was on the fast track to elite status since childhood.
Joined the Ministry of Management and Coordination right after graduating college. possibly because he had become a civil servant with no sense of purpose.
he was allowed to work from home via a remote prosthetic body... he apparently carried out his duties in an indifferent manner. which would be carried out by manipulating both the Welfare and Management Ministries.
Koshiki independently designed and implemented his abduction system.
he wasn't the kind of guy who stood out. not one damn person noticed that he had gotten sick and died at home.
the true identity of the Puppeteer is gonna remain a mystery forever.
So does that mean that somebody else entirely was using that remote body to cause all this?
It's possible.
that theory is probably more likely. their actions were caused by their collective unconscious.
So there's no way for us to find out for sure now.
Oh.
thatis for the conversation between you and Koshiki that was recorded in the Tachikomas' memory.
It's still in there? ...all of his memories underwent a whiteout.
Batou?
kinda.
does it? all that stuff is on its way toward being resolved now.
this case is still more or less closed.
Written off as a scandal involving a handful of bad-apple politicians?
Batou...
What have I been feeling so jaded and disillusioned about?
What do you think I was searching for as I was wandering the net?
Truth?
Friendship?
Or maybe a certain special someone?
Maybe I just wanted to blame this organization or even the system for my own sense of helplessness.
What's gotten into you?
You turning all meek and modest on me?
Did you get whatever it was out of your system?
what're you gonna do now?
You plan on keeping up that "conducting investigations chosen by personal deduction" routine of yours by yourself?
too. it doesn't feel like my actions are accomplishing anything.
I guess I'm right back to where I started from...
What's that supposed to mean?
That your way of saying you're coming back to Section 9?
But what about Togusa?
Won't I get in the way of his development?
he wasn't gonna go any further anyway.
I wouldn't sweat it if I were you.
Maybe you're right.
the net truly is vast and infinite.
Maybe a new society we've never even dreamed of is already being born.
The evacuation of passengers and flight crew has been completed according to the anti-terrorist protocol.
All incoming flights are to remain circling outside the airport control zone and await further instructions.
Flights low on fuel are to divert to land at another airport.
305 to 102 -
Public Security Section 9 has arrived.
Please advise.
This is a priority transmission.
Section 9 has been given full authority to direct this operation.
We already have fatalities over here.
Even if that's the arrangement, they should give us some say in how this operation is run.
That's enough.
Recognize your own role.
We do not have the capability to deal with an incident of this type.
Found it.
All outgoing flights have been suspended.
The immigration checkpoint is closed for operations.
According to our preliminary reports, the fugitive is willing to submit to an inspection, ... but when he heard that Public Security was taking charge, he seemed almost... delighted.
Delighted?
I have no idea.
So?
I guess dai-sempai won't be meeting up with us after all?
He said that he was in the middle of another personal inquiry for an investigation.
Indeed, it was thanks to Batou that we could piece together the complete picture from the disjointed clues in this case.
Pazu and Boma, bring another two men to the North Gate.
Understood.
We are storming in from the front.
Yes, sir!
However, you've changed, sempai.
You finally gave up on that Mateba autorevolver of yours.
Not really.
According to our information, Ka Gae-Ru shouldn't be augmented.
Then on the ground there is your proverbial unexpected problem.
In other words, he may have seized the gun.
Even so, it's just a 9mm pistol.
Oh, my.
Colonel Ka Gae-Ru!
This is Public Security.
We can consider allowing you safe passage from the country as you demand.
First let the hostage go, then we can further discuss this.
Colonel Ka Gae-Ru!
Do you hear me?
Ka Gae-Ru!
Put the gun down!
Everyone hold your fire.
Hand the gun over.
Togusa.
That guy appears to have inhaled fast-acting military grade microsteroids.
Understood.
Colonel Ka Gae-Ru!
The Puppeteer is coming
- I don't want to die!
If you don't want to die, then put the goddamn gun down now!
What did you say?
I won't let you take me in!
Stop!
Damn it!
What the hell just happened?
The Puppeteer, huh?
The name's not half bad.
Prime Minister Kayabuki.
Operatives marked with "bon*" character tattoos belonging to Generalissimo Ka Ru-Ma's loyalist group ...
*The kanji character ?
(bon), meaning Buddhist.
... have been commiting suicide one after another in the country.
Even his eldest son Colonel Ka Gae-Ru has just killed himself.
And yet, you still insist that there is no need to interrogate the Generalissimo?
Regarding Colonel Ka Gae-Ru's death, it has also been reported that it was due to a botched arrest.
Even if we suppose that this is an unspecified terrorist threat by Seok Republic remnants, we can't prove that Generalissimo Ka Ru-Ma, isolated under house arrest, was involved as well.
While the Refugee Naturalization Act is being implemented, please avoid any incidents that may fuel the opposition parties.
It is my understanding that this is why Public Security Section 9 exists.
I understand.
Ishikawa!
Dig up the record of Ka Gae-Ru's confession.
Yes, sir!
We're moving out!
Is this really fine?
We have yet to obtain authorization.
As long as no one finds out that Pandora's Box has been opened, it won't count as breaking faith.
Has any new evidence been discovered at the scene?
No, not yet.
Find witnesses concerning the victim's...
Batou!
Do you hear me, Batou?
I hear you.
Where are you right now?
I'm over at the thirteenth tattooed man's place.
Another suicide?
Yeah.
This place looks similar to our safehouses.
It's likely that this was just one of their dens.
Leave that end to the prefectural police.
Bring a subordinate down to check out this location.
A hideout revealed by Ka Gae-Ru himself in his confession.
Oh?
But isn't such mainstream work more Togusa's province?
Togusa and I are heading to the enemy's main headquarters.
I see.
Togusa.
How long has it been since the Major left Section 9?
Almost two years now, I think.
It's been that long...
I must deeply apologise for the Ka Gae-Ru incident.
That couldn't be helped.
This case could deal Prime Minister Kayabuki a fatal setback.
She probably wishes to suppress any bad publicity.
But wasn't it Prime Minister Kabayuki herself, concerned that the Six Powers Pact would object to her Refugee Naturalization Act, who had Ka Ru-Ma placed under house arrest as a bargaining chip, sparking off this whole fiasco?
That's because Generalissimo Ka Ru-Ma, before seeking asylum in Japan, had once threatened to launch retaliatory acts of terrorism.
That at the moment of his death, he would visit terror upon the entire world.
Is this the oath of vengeance mentioned in his Seok dissolution speech?
Isn't it our job to find that out and prepare countermeasures?
Although we don't know how he sends out his orders from isolation, we need only to capture Ka Ru-Ma himself to break the case and bring the truth to light.
The problem right now is - how far along is this terrorist plan of his?
Chief.
The Coast Guard report that they have cleared the airspace along the route.
Right.
Thank them, then prepare to land immediately.
Remember to alter the flight records.
Yes, sir!
No firearms or knives detected.
Clear!
Proto.
Turn the power on and lift the blind.
Roger.
What's the matter?
Chief.
Hmm?
It looks like he did himself in.
This looks bad.
This guy killing himself could mean that his plan has already been set into motion.
That thing is... ?
A healthcare monitoring network terminal.
Simply put, it's a device to exchange medical data with a medical establishment.
It was rumored that Ka Ru-Ma was suffering from serious health problems before he went into exile.
Looks like the rumor was true.
Still, I can't believe that the government is oblivious to Ka Ru-Ma's death.
Hmm?
Bingo!
This guy planted a backdoor in the system.
Looks look he was a smarter-than-your-average-dictator.
Looks like it.
The log records his communications with his associates.
Although we need to bring this back to the lab for analysis, there's no doubt that at one time he was attempting to use a micromachine virus to carry out terrorist attacks.
What do you mean by "at one time"?
Back when his operatives were beginning to kill themselves off one after another, they once discussed with Ka Gae-Ru whether or not to suspend the plan.
What does that mean?
In other words, their commiting suicide did not in any way mark the beginning of their plan?
I'm not sure.
However, what puzzles me is that a program that made it seem as if Ka Ru-Ma were still alive was installed by an outside intruder.
At this time, the administration probably still doesn't know the truth about his death.
An assassination disguised as a suicide?
Yeah.
By someone who didn't want the administration to know that Ka Ru-Ma had already been taken out of the picture, perhaps.
What about the micromachine virus?
It seems to have been delivered to a certain Ma Sha-Ba.
If Batou isn't slacking off, he should be retrieving it any time now.
Togusa.
What's this, then?
"The Puppeteer"?
Azuma, just before Ka Gae-Ru died, didn't he also mention something about about "The Puppeteer"?
What if he did?
The log contains references to "The Puppeteer" as well.
The term appears to designate one of their associates.
Looks like we have to apprehend Ma Sha-Ba quickly.
Make a copy of the log, then rendezvous with Batou.
We must uncover the full scope of their plan at all cost.
What do we do with the corpse?
Leave everything as it was.
Regretfully, we were never here.
Yes, sir.
A clinic?
What's a nice car like you doing in a dump like this?
Pretty hefty security system...
Go flank in from the other side!
Acknowledged.
What?
There's no way for you to hack my cyberbrain in here.
Die, Puppeteer!
Over there?
Batou?
That's... ?
Dodge!
You dumbass!
Until I get back, play dead.
Acknowledged.
Halt!
Major?
It's been a while, Batou.
What are you doing here?
I knew it.
I might ask you the same question.
Call it conducting a personal inquiry for an investigation.
It's coming!
Wait.
What the...
Hold this a moment.
Isn't this...
Ma Sha-Ba?
It appears that you know quite a bit.
Know quite a bit... ?
Hey, what exactly are you up to?
Who knows?
I'll be having that back.
I see that you've changed your taste in cars.
When did she... ?
But this one's not bad either.
Batou, I'm guessing that you're here to investigate the serial suicides of those tattooed men.
A word to the wise, stay away from the Solid State society, or you'll end up killing yourself just like them.
You'll have to find your own ride.
Did I not order you to bring a subordinate along?
That's why I brought that tincan with me.
We came too late.
Ma Sha-Ba's already dead.
The cause of death?
He suffered a fatal concussion when he lost control of the robot and crashed.
It looks like Ma Sha-Ba wasn't the Puppeteer after all.
Batou, why did he come at you with that thing?
Who knows?
That's what I would have liked to ask him.
Perhaps he attacked you because he mistook you for the Puppeteer?
Hey, what is this Puppeteer you keep mentioning?
At present, the hypothesis is that it may be the codename for a suspect who may have caused the deaths of the tattooed men and Ka Ru-Ma by hacking into their cyberbrains and forcing them to kill themselves.
Judging from his skill, he might be a hacker surpassing wizard class.
Wizard class...
Chief.
We've found out what Ka Ru-Ma's plan for terror was.
What was it?
You should come over and see for yourself.
Ka Ru-Ma intended to implant micromachines into these children in order to disseminate a virus.
What the hell?
This isn't a retaliation plan, this is utter inhumanity!
Sooner or later, Section 9 will probably track me back to this place.
Loki, Conan, I leave the rest to you.
It seems that I can only handle at most two concurrent cybernetic bodies.
The only way left may be to wipe and retrain them from scratch.
I see.
We've even tried natural oil.
However, due to the different subjects, we were unable to achieve results of the same degree.
You're still concerned over the development of these guys?
Africa was much tougher than I had expected.
Even with upgraded augmentations, I'm still exhausted.
Further implants could mess up your cardiopulmonary function, you know.
Can't be helped.
It's an occupational hazard.
Togusa and you, I really take my hat off to you guys.
From the roster we found at the scene, the operatives involved in the plan include :
the thirteen suicides, Ka Gae-Ru, Ma Sha-Ba, and a certain Raj Poot.
In all, sixteen people.
Who is this Raj Poot?
Could he be the Puppeteer?
It appears that he is not yet in the country.
The communications log would also indicate this.
Not many people would stick with a leader who insisted that they follow him to the grave.
Such is often the sorry end of dictators.
But there were actually sixteen people, huh...
You're late, Batou!
Oh Saito When did you get back?
Just now.
Azuma!
Please carry on.
Moving on.
Lieutenant?
Regarding the missing micromachine virus:
A case containing 144 ampoules containing a genetically modified organic virus has been brought into the country, a biological weapon with a time delayed mechanism.
And this hot potato has vanished into thin air.
Batou.
Are you certain that you didn't run into anyone else at Ma Sha-Ba's clinic?
Yeah.
And there was no sign of anyone who might have caused the robot to go out of control?
Nope.
I see.
What exactly are you trying to ask here?
Ah, nevermind...
Actually, we still haven't traced the owner of that smashed car.
Isn't it possible that it was stolen?
From the look of the car security system installed, I would say no.
Furthermore, the surveillance camera footage was somehow partially erased.
This seems to indicate that someone else was present at the scene.
By someone else, you mean the Puppeteer?
Perhaps.
Although Ka Ru-Ma's plan was never implemented, but there is a possibility that this hacker called the Puppeteer may commit independent acts of terror.
While we are tracking down the micromachine ampoules, we also need to focus on investigating this Puppeteer.
Yes, sir!
Togusa.
What do I do?
Go take a break.
Individual body maintenance should take precedence.
Understood.
I'll do that, then.
By the way, Batou?
This morning the Chief had a talk with me and said that it's about time for you to choose your next assignment.
Would you rather concentrate on your duties as training officer, or participate in the Puppeteer investigation under my direction?
It's your call.
Which will it be?
Isn't it obvious?
The Puppeteer, of course.
I see.
Did you find anything?
Yeah, we hit paydirt.
Let's have it.
Firstly, medical examination of the sixteen children reveal no sign of their having been implanted with micromachines at all.
Although suffering from dehydration and injuries from maltreatment, basically, they're fairly healthy.
However, the sixteen of them have had their memories partially erased, and their personal IDs altered to assign them fake parents.
They could remember their names and addresses, but as far as their parents were concerned, they had not the slightest recollection.
Furthermore, upon investigation, the addresses given by them turned out to be residences of old folks living alone.
Could those old folks actually be their parents?
No.
From a granny living in a four-and-a-half-tatami flat, to the rich old codger who could afford personal nursing support robots, there were all sorts, but without exception, all were "Kifu* Aged" hooked up to the healthcare monitoring network.
* ?
(kifu), meaning noble rot.
Obviously, there was no sign whatsoever that they had ever lived with children.
Although the household registrations list them as the parents, most likely, these records were doctored.
What's a "Kifu Aged"?
It refers to the bedridden elderly connected to an automated monitoring system which tends to their basic healthcare needs, just like noble-rot infested grapes withering away on the vine.
That's where the name comes from.
This system was originally developed to deal with the problem of an aging population, and at the same time, prevent old folks living alone from dying unnoticed in their homes.
Unexpectedly, connecting to the network instead rendered its users comatose.
The LPO slammed it as the "vegetable legacy retrieval system".
You're pretty well-informed.
The old bags at the parlor often chat with me about it.
It's sort of like an economy model of the terminal Ka Ru-Ma had.
Wait a minute.
Wasn't it Ka Gae-Ru's intent to make human bombs out of the children?
Why then did he specifically erase their memories of their parents?
Rather than planting them somewhere after infecting them with the virus, would it not have been simpler to erase their memories of the abductions, and send them back to their parents?
How should I know?
That's true.
They even had cyberbrains specially implanted.
It really is too extravagant.
Actually, the implants seem to have been performed prior to the abductions.
The transform components also appear to be legit.
In that case, there should be records of the implants at the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.
A guardian is required to sign off on the procedure before it can be performed on a six year old.
There were 144 missing ampoules.
To be on the safe side, let's check this out.
Try and find if there are any matching children in the records.
Assuming that those sixteen kids we rescued had their implants done through through legitimate channels, their records would have been automatically registered with the Ministry of Health's database.
If they were abducted and had their household records doctored after the implants had been registered, the number of children with cyberbrain implants listed in the Ministry of Internal Affairs' resident registry should conflict with the number of such children registered with the Ministry of Health's database.
Now I see.
Since those sixteen had their family names altered to match those of the elderly invalids, in theory this should work.
Twenty thousand?
There must be some kind of mistake.
If children were being abducted in such vast numbers, surely someone would have noticed by now.
True.
In any case, this figure far exceeds anything we ever expected.
What now?
Let's start by eliminating the impossible.
First, sort the list of extraneous children in the data by name and address.
Leave that to me, I'll be done in a sec.
A trap?
!
This is an emergency warning.
Presence of a Level E class virus has been confirmed.
Please shutdown all machines immediately.
Emergency warning...
Emergency warning...
Level E class virus...
Please shutdown all machines...
Engaging emergency server lockdown...
It's no use, the system is not accepting commands.
Hiragi, Soma, backup the data now!
We can't, it's already been infected!
Our only option is to cut the power!
Help me out.
Was the virus embedded in the Ministry of Internal Affairs database?
We've lost the data on that end.
Is the data from the Ministry of Health intact?
Yes, but why?
Out of the way!
Right now, it must be buzzing like an overturned beehive over at the Ministry of Internal Affairs as well.
Dammit!
We just chopped away our best lead.
In any case, it seems now that there must actually have been twenty thousand abductions, huh?
What do you mean?
Normally, twenty thousand is an implausible number of abductions for Ka Gae-Ru's outfit to have pulled off.
The perpetrator's modus operandi is also too amateurish for it to have been the work of the Puppeteer.
We need only look at the facts of the abductions - the discrepancies due to the tampering of the household registrations is like a big sign saying "I nabbed them, come and find me!"
I can't help but think that the Puppeteer has some other purpose in mind.
I agree with your point of view.
Chief.
This case was dropped off at the Ministry of Health's Pathogenic Microbes Repository Unit.
Subsequent analysis proved that it was indeed the Seok manufactured micromachine virus.
This proves that the information we gathered was right on the money.
Do we know who dropped the case off?
There were no records whatsoever of when the case was dropped off, nor any footage of the courier.
Could this could be the Puppeteer?
That's possible.
If so, what is the Puppeteer's motive in all this, if not to commit acts of terror?
From the looks of it, this Puppeteer might be a hacker working for some governmental agency or other.
I was bewildered by the elaborate coverup of Ka Ru-Ma's death.
After some digging of my own, I discovered that Prime Minister Kabayuki and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had canceled a volatile conference on the threat posed by him.
In other words, Ka Ru-Ma, the thorn in the administration's side, had already been dealt with by the hacker employed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as far as they were concerned.
At present, that would seem to be the situation, yes.
If so, maybe we should write this mass abduction thing off as a bluff after all.
Which section was responsible for this?
This case carries great international significance.
Considering the events that have occurred to this point, our stance on the matter should be similar to that of the administration.
I believe that we should leave well alone on this matter.
Therefore, concentrate on establishing the identities of those sixteen children.
Put the Puppeteer investigation on hold for now.
That is all.
Aw, geez.
All that work for nothing, and a huge mess to clean up.
We at least have to help those kids find their parents quickly.
I'm just setting off now.
Sorry about that.
I have a question.
What is it?
Was it the Treaties Bureau that made an old warhorse like you back off from the case?
About that?
I cut a deal with Nakamura.
I turn a blind eye on their covert operations, and in return, we get a free hand to investigate the matter of this micromachine virus.
And that is fine?
If purging Ka Ru-Ma was required for the good of the country, surely we should be dismayed that we were passed over for this vital task?
What, then, was the point of you expanding Section 9 over these past two years, old timer?
If we keep going like this, she won't come back.
Whether being passed over for an assassination order should bring regret or rejoicing, that question may determine what direction the Section will go in the future.
I know what you are trying to say, but we must also consider the possibility that the Major may never return.
Her talent is more precious to me than even an esper's.
In truth, no one can ever live up to her.
Likewise, it's impossible for me to stick around at this post forever.
Therefore, instead of having to expend all of our strength to crack one case,
I would rather build an organisation where we can use an eighth of our strength to crack three cases.
Don't you think that, in this way, we can better carry on our ideals?
This was what I had in mind when I expanded Section 9.
Promoting Togusa to squad leader was also part of this process.
Though, if you had been willing to accept the post at the time, things might be entirely different now.
I'm not suitable for that position.
If you say so.
That might even be true.
But not for Togusa.
Even so, in order for his potential to flourish, he must learn to overcome adversity.
I hope that you can help him along.
I thought as much.
But he's done quite well, actually.
Much like the Major, he's always fair and balanced, whether at home or at work.
For the sake of Section 9, he's even discussed cybernization with his family.
But gaining the acceptance of another is hard to do.
Indeed, I myself have not been able to gain that.
We haven't had a good long talk like this for a while now.
Looks like I won't be coming home tonight, either.
That can't be helped.
You have heavy responsibilities at work now.
Have the kids been good?
Yeah.
But last week our girl asked to sleep on her own in her room.
It's been calm, but I do kind of miss the sibling fights.
Really?
She's a big girl now.
Oh course!
She's already six.
Six, huh?
Snap a picture of her asleep and send it to me, will you?
Sure.
Togusa, we have an situation!
Get over to Area 47 right now!
What happened?
Sempai, I'm sorry, all the children...
They had all gone missing by the time I got here.
Is this the same thing that happened with Ka Gae-Ru?
Looks like it.
The Puppeteer...
If Proto had really wanted to kill himself, he could have pulled the trigger anytime.
This is nothing but a ploy to stall for time!
Ishikawa, Boma!
Use the IR system to locate the children immediately!
Given our current situation, that may have limited use.
At the same time, request support from the prefectural police.
Bring Proto over to the analysis lab.
Togusa, we need to talk!
Later!
Right now, we need to find the missing kids!
This is important!
I may have some insight into the Puppeteer's identity!
It's Aramaki.
Thank you.
You're late.
Sorry, I was delayed by work.
Colonel Tonoda, how's your health?
Back to his old hobby, I see.
Cut the man some slack already.
They say that his health problems arose from the psychological stress of his time in the penitentiary.
What's with Tsujisaki?
He didn't drop by even once.
And to think that I favoured him the most.
He's forgotten me, the ingrate!
His memory seems to be going as well.
Step out for a moment.
I have something for you.
So ends the legendary Akaoni Poacher in ignominy.
You should consider marrying again.
Tragic is the fate of lonely old men.
I have no desire for something that I can't bring with me to the grave.
The same old retort, I see.
So, what is it that you have for me?
Right, take this.
Actually, I ran into the Major back at Ma Sha-Ba's clinic.
The Major... ?
It couldn't be... ?
I didn't think it was possible at first as well, but now I'm getting increasingly worried that she might actually be the Puppeteer.
I missed my chance to speak up earlier.
Did you see her do Ma Sha-Ba in?
No, but I did see her take the case of ampoules.
Previously, I would intervene every time we crossed paths with the Major during an investigation.
I've always assumed that she, in her own way, was there to guide us along to break the case.
But it's different this time.
Exactly what does the Major intend?
That I don't know.
But even odds are, the Major was present at the scene of those suspected assassinations.
Batou.
Hurry to Daikyuu ring highway No. 16 with Saito immediately.
This is a matter of utmost priority!
Chief, we have a situation here as well.
The Puppeteer has turned up at Section 9.
What did you say?
Old timer, the Puppeteer appears to...
Let's not jump to conclusions.
I want to confirm this for myself.
Chief.
Since that fellow moved preemptively against us, can we further pursue this matter?
Since that's the case, carry on.
Roger that.
What happened on your side?
Two hours ago, surveillance cameras in the Engan area happened to pick up the image of a known international criminal.
Hmm?
Who would that be?
He sounds formidable, if you need me and Saito to take him down together.
A former Seok Republic class A+ sniper Lieutenant Raj Poot.
Raj Poot?
That's...
That last man who was not yet in the country?
He was head of Ka Ru-Ma's personal bodyguard.
It's believed that he fled to China after Seok was dissolved.
For him to take to the stage at this point is mighty suspicious.
Fortunately, the Intelligence Division has managed to pinpoint his current whereabouts.
The two of you shadow him and try to discover what he is up to.
Roger that.
Togusa, if the Major is the Puppeteer, then she has become our enemy.
I don't even want to think about that.
One of these days, I will return this favor.
Colonel Tonoda, I take my leave of you for today.
Like father, like son...
Like man, like robot...
You didn't turn out to be anything like me.
It is gratifying to know that a phoenix can fledge from an old crow's nest.
Do take care of your health.
Thank you.
Colonel, you take care as well.
How will that guy take out his target?
Like me, he will use his Hawkeye to acquire the target through real-time satellite imaging before taking the shot.
In that case, there will come a point when our GPS tracker will fail due to the inteference caused by the Hawkeye satellite downlink.
We need to apprehend him before that happens.
Got that.
Let's visually confirm the target.
Be sure not to alert him.
Target confirmed.
There's no mistake, it's him alright.
Togusa.
The IR system has located one of the missing children.
Really?
Where?
He's moving through a small construction lot in Kohoku Park.
That's near my place.
Right.
I'll check it out.
I'll inform the prefectural police as well.
Meanwhile, we'll return to investigating the twenty thousand child abductions.
I see.
Damn.
I guess I'll have to put this matter of the Major aside for now.
The Puppeteer, I presume?
I don't really need to ask, no?
Public Security Section 9 just called to inquire if I knew a hacker called the Puppeteer.
I told them I didn't.
So, you were looking for me?
I've come to refund your fee.
It doesn't matter to us whether you actually had anything to do with it or not - your mission objective was achieved.
I regret to say that this is the end.
I am going now.
Leave some way to contact you over the net, then.
Anything will do.
Was this was a puppet too?
What a waste.
Her talent and skill were outstanding.
It'll be daybreak soon.
I wonder why he even bothered turning up now when their plan is already in shambles?
Perhaps to avenge Ka Ru-Ma's death?
That sounds plausible, but how in the world did he get a hold of that intelligence?
Even we were almost left in the dark about that.
That's true.
How long does he intend to keep driving around, anyway?
Speaking of which, look over there.
That's...
Togusa.
The boy has entered apartment no. 602 of block M-26.
You know the way?
Yeah.
I know this neighborhood like the back of my hand.
A "Kifu Aged"?
Return him to me!
I've left all my assets to the child.
I'd rather have him as my heir than forfeit it all to the government.
The poor thing would just have ended up being abused to death, if we had done nothing.
This is the common resolve of all the residents of Solid State, our little game - nay, our grand enterprise.
Do not meddle in our affairs, if you wish to avoid becoming yet another suicide.
You have been warned.
My gut feeling tells me that his target is somewhere over there.
Turn off the cyberbrain, then help him find a guardian.
Yes, sir.
Death has been confirmed.
Requesting permission to dispose of the remains and retrieve the system terminal.
Dispose?
That's strange.
Didn't he have family?
Our data indicates that he should have a six year old son.
A mistake in the records?
Oh joy.
Even more work for us.
A mistake in the records?
No, that's not it.
That's only because I rescued him.
Which means that, but for my intervention, those social workers would have found and taken the boy into protection as planned.
The suicides of those operatives.
The missing children.
"Kifu Aged".
The common resolve of all the residents of Solid State.
No, what is this Solid State in the first place?
What did that old man mean?
It's me.
Thank goodness I finally got through, please hurry home, our girl's gone missing!
This is it.
Now!
Wait!
Damn, therm-optic camouflage?
How did this happen?
I've been cut off from the GPS system.
The Puppeteer?
But my kid doesn't have a cyberbrain!
I need you to trace which satellite that bastard is using.
Since we've lost visual contact, our one and only chance to stop him will be the moment before he takes the shot.
I might be able to trace the satellite, but how do we stop him?
That should is his field of fire.
From up here, we should have line of sight to his sniping point, although he will spot us easily as well.
Wear this, or you'll be exposed.
There's no time, our opponent is about to act.
We play to win.
It's begun.
Done!
Send it.
That's his target?
The satellite tracks him at SE37.
There he is.
Drop the link before it feeds back!
He's on to us!
Saito!
Did I nail him?
Wait here, I'll go confirm.
Come on, come on...
Huh?
Papa!
How is it?
Have some faith in yourself.
I see.
Hey, who was that man you were trying to off?
Why were you trying to kill him?
To avenge the Generalissimo, I will kill every last one of you Jap motherfuckers!
Avenge?
Don't fuck around with me!
Now, what was the source of your intel?
A mole turned it over to me.
He told me who was behind the Generalissimo's death, so that I could cap the bitch.
And does this mole have a name?
A representative named Munei Ito who frequents the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Old timer, have this Munei fellow taken into custody immediately.
Also, this is an image of Raj's intended target.
Looks like he was the mastermind behind Ka Ru-Ma's assassination.
Eh?
Unless I'm mistaken, that man is Munei Ito.
How could this be?
Your informant is the exact same guy you were trying to kill!
God knows.
Maybe he was suicidal or something.
Suicidal... ?
Hey, could it be that the Puppeteer set you up as well?
Fuck.
You may just be right.
Were he only human, I'd take that bastard out first of all.
Instead, I got myself taken out by a superior foe.
The Puppeteer is not human?
It's an abduction infrastructure built into Solid State.
Solid State?
Hey, what does that mean?
You don't know?
That is to say, the healthcare monitoring network.
The government of your so-called democratic country takes part in child abductions.
What a farce.
Old timer, dispatch a paramedic team and helicopter over to this place.
Also, run a background check on this Munei.
This is too weird.
I understand.
Then, I found her just after calling you.
It seems like she went over to the neighbor's place in the morning.
Is that so?
Thank goodness it turned out to be nothing.
You shouldn't run off by yourself without telling Mama the next time.
Yeah.
Well then, I'll send you to school.
I feel a bit guilty about heading right back to work like this.
Is that alright?
You look exhausted to me.
I'm invigorated just by seeing your faces.
Really?
That's great.
See ya!
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing.
Togusa!
I've bagged Raj Poot over here.
The Puppeteer appears to be involved as well.
You mean... the Major?
Yeah, but as it turns out, the Major is most likely not the Puppeteer.
Raj Poot claims that the Puppeteer is an abduction infrastructure built into the healthcare monitoring system.
Abduction infrastructure?
He referred to the healthcare monitoring network as "Solid State", and insinuated that our government was mixed up in this somehow.
Back when I ran into the Major, she had actually warned me to stay away from the Solid State society.
Initially, I had thought that "Solid State" was a reference to "soshi*", ...
* The kanji characters for electronic element ?
(soshi) can also be read as motoko, the Major's name..
... in other words, to stay away from the Major herself.
* The kanji characters for electronic element ?
(soshi) can also be read as motoko, the Major's name..
But in fact, she was telling us to stay away from the healthcare monitoring network.
Ka Ru-Ma and company were most likely purged because they discovered the infrastructure, and tried to use it for their own ends.
So that's how it is.
It's from Mama.
Hold for a moment.
Hello?
You ignored our warning.
Who is this!
For that, we will take your adorable daughter.
Togusa!
Togusa!
Ishikawa, can you pinpoint Togusa's present location?
Eh?
Not a problem, what's wrong?
Togusa's cyberbrain's been hacked into!
Papa, we're going the wrong way.
You're the Puppeteer?
Why are you abducting all those children?
Where have twenty thousand kids vanished to?
We only wish to utilize resources that have slipped through the net of society.
Soon, you will experience this for yourself.
Batou!
I've found Togusa's present location.
The Cyberbrain Implant Hospital in Kohoku Ward.
Now I get it.
You could get the implant performed without arousing any suspicions if you made a parent bring his child down to the hospital himself.
Erase the child's memories, send her over to an elderly invalid's home, and the abduction is complete.
Afterwards, you'd only need to alter my memories to make me think that I had lost her.
Don't feel too bad about getting your memories altered.
In today's world, the incidence of such cases are already more common than, say, traffic accidents.
You're offering me one last alternative?
That's the place!
I won't let you take my daughter.
Listen, will you do as Papa says?
Start running as fast as you can when Papa lets go of your hand.
Run?
That's right.
There will be a loud bang, just like at the school sports meet.
Once you hear that, run that way and keep running.
Don't stop, and don't ever look back.
Can you do that?
Yeah.
Good girl.
Close your eyes.
I'm so sorry.
Goodbye.
Togusa!
I love you.
TOGUSA!
Max, Musashi!
It's OK, everything's fine.
Major!
I must apologize for holding off until the last moment to save you.
Major, you're not the Puppeteer?
Where were you all this time?
Papa!
Wandering on the net alone after leaving Section 9, I came across this unconventional case by chance.
Eventually I found out about the abductions, and began my own investigation into the matter.
I can't believe that you actually used Togusa as bait!
Didn't you stop to think that you might be endangering his family as well?
I set him up with safeguards, of course.
Thanks to him, we can finally unmask the Puppeteer.
Isn't the Puppeteer just a system built into the healthcare monitoring network?
Rather than a system, I would call it a collective consciousness formed by the elderly invalids hooked up to the network.
However, there must also exist a hub cyberbrain who integrated them in the first place.
A hub cyberbrain?
Hey, isn't that...
The data from my network trace being extracted from Togusa's cyberbrain.
Ah, Batou!
Long time no see!
You're looking well!
Good to see that you've been taking care of yourself.
The elderly monitoring system has contained a backdoor function ever since it was designed.
Look.
This is the full scope of the rhizome formed by the collective consciousness of those elderly invalids in the network.
There is no concept of a center in a rhizome, therefore the hub has no fixed position within the rhizome, or rather, the rhizome itself is constantly in flux.
I get the idea, but who does that hub cyberbrain belong to?
Max, Musashi, report your findings.
Well?
Ah, how do I put this...
You failed?
b..but we managed to locate his current whereabouts.
And where would that be?
The complex grounds of the Seishomin* Welfare Center which takes charge of the elderly monitoring system.
*?
(seishomin), meaning "Sacred Citizen".
The personnel have arrived.
Releasing locks.
It's been a while, Major.
Indeed.
Though I wish it could have been under happier circumstances.
Why did you change your mind and return?
We'll talk about that later.
Right now, our priority should be to catch the Puppeteer.
Munei Ito, member of the Diet's House of Representatives.
Finding out why he was marked for death is our one key to uncover the Puppeteer's identity.
Munei has long been an advocate of a racially pure Japan, a reactionary conservative nationalist.
He frequents the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and has close ties with the Treaties Bureau.
He participated in the plan to assassinate Ka Ru-Ma.
Major, you mean...
I had a contract with the Treaties Bureau to covertly assassinate Ka Ru-Ma, but the Puppeteer got there first.
So you were only responsible for the subsequent coverup?
That's more or less it.
We also discovered that Munei instigated an management reshuffle at the Seishomin Welfare Center in order to solidify his control over the facility.
How will that benefit him?
Isn't this a welfare facility that provides elderly healthcare monitoring and vocational training?
Right.
But several rogue politicians are using it as a front for something entirely different.
In actual fact, he is using his cover as treasurer to run a power elite education project.
In other words, a glorified brainwashing facility.
So this is what Raj Poot meant about government involvement.
If the Puppeteer was using this place as a temporary holding center for the abducted children, then Munei turning it into a brainwashing facility would pose a problem for him.
Chief.
How about we conduct a forced search?
Finding the children should be our top priority,
But conducting a raid will cause a scandal.
When that happens, those shitty politicians won't be the only ones whose asses get toasted.
Ishikawa, how's the situation?
Is that the Major?
Geez, you could have turned up sooner.
Although we've verified the receipt of a massive quantity of components that may have been used to construct HC-25 brainwashing devices, that alone is insufficient evidence to justify a raid.
What about images from the inside?
I could only obtain footage from the workshop zone.
The education zone is protected by a firewall in the form of complex barrier maze.
It looks to be completely impenetrable.
There are only refugees here.
The abducted children are being held in the education zone, then?
That can only mean that this facility was built with the abduction infrastructure in place from the start.
If not, it's hard to imagine that a politician would dare to introduce such an audacious policy.
You mean to say that the Puppeteer have must have been one of the system designers behind this project?
Ishikawa, prepare the decoder for an attempt to hack through the barrier maze.
I'll make the dive.
If worse come to worst, Section 9 can carry on so long as you and Togusa remain.
Batou.
I absolutely refuse to hear such talk from you.
Are you implying that you'll be retiring as well after this?
I appreciate your sentiments, but I only came here to unmask the Puppeteer.
It's true that we may need to hang someone out to dry this time, and at this point, I have nothing left to lose.
Chief.
It's unfortunate, but I say we raid them.
The Puppeteer is waiting for a chance to eliminate Munei.
I do not wish to see this opportunity slip us by.
But how are we going to pick out the Puppeteer?
At this point, we still have yet to determine his identity.
Leave that to my ghost's whisper.
Woo!
It feels great!
Hi!
Long time no see, everyone!
Here goes.
Move out!
As I thought, nothing beats the thrill of racing along in a physical body again.
Really?
My joints seem a bit creaky though.
Look like another intrusion like before, but something feels different this time.
In any case, secure the perimeter.
Understood.
Professionals like us, huh?
In that case let's get to know each other a bit.
Another hacking attempt by the Investigations section?
What a complete waste of effort.
Let's do an inspection before we leave.
Pazu and Boma, secure our route of withdrawal.
Roger that.
Who are you people?
Why would you want to know?
I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
Huh?
The comms were cut off.
Security cyborgs incoming.
Major, go on ahead.
The one who went in is done for.
Go after those still outside.
Understood.
They opened fire without any warning.
So this place really is a highly sensitive government front.
He's coming after us.
Over there will be fine.
No heat signatures or shadows a Kyo-Re cloaking device?
That means...
Your information is antiquated.
They don't refer to the Model 3302 as a cloaking device anymore.
Finish them.
Roger!
Back me up.
I've almost taken control of the system.
Leave it to me.
Hasn't it always been this way?
Togusa, where are you now?
Major.
I'm currently approaching the roof via the outer wall.
Good.
Carry on and rendezvous with the Chief on the roof.
I've located the children.
Let's go!
Representative Munei, this is Public Security Section 9.
We have already verified the situation here.
It seems we have no choice but to insist on a full scale search of this facility.
Public Security?
Although not under its official auspices, this is a vital facility for the nation.
How dare you Public Security people come barging in here with your overinflated sense of justice!
Representative.
Even so, it is clear from the situation here that it is our job to intervene in such matters.
For a public official, you do not seem to be able to comprehend the crisis facing our nation right now.
If we carry on as we are, in the near future, our nation's prosperity will be displaced by that of foreigners.
To prevent this from occurring, we are investing in this education program for these wards of the state, entrusting our nation's future to them.
Is there anything wrong with that?
The funding for this investment wouldn't happen to have been procured through the exploitation of those elderly invalids and refugees in your care, would it?
That couldn't be helped.
Just think, what have they ever done for this country?
They never started a family, or raised children, and are themselves exempt from taxation.
Selfishly wasting away their lives, and then expecting us to take care of them in their dotage.
What a shameless lot.
If it were up to me, I would even lay a tax on them to make up for the loss to the state caused by their being no longer fit for the workforce.
This is nothing but rhetoric.
What, then, have politicians like you ever done for this country either?
Indulging in egotism, and placing political self-preservation above the needs of others.
Who was responsible for ignoring such social problems until things came to a head?
I am proud to say that I, for my own part , have always been conscientious towards my duties.
Even if it infringes upon human rights, and violates cyberbrain ethics?
That is an unfortunate but necessary sacrifice.
You really are a bloody-minded fellow.
Major. we've verified the number of the children being held here.
It's nowhere near twenty thousand, at most three thousand kids.
Is that right?
Switch over to autistic mode.
Roger that.
Representative.
Did you know that the system in this center has been automatically abducting children?
These children aren't orphans.
A large proportion of them have been abducted.
It was our investigation into the abductions that led us here, therefore, you are an important witness in this case.
Although I was the director of this project, this is the first I've heard of such a bug in the system!
In that case, allow us to question the system designers involved.
It was I.
It was I who designed the core principles behind the Solid State system.
Togusa, take the lot of them into custody!
Yes, ma'am!
Batou, before this guy's memories vanish, I want to dive into his cyberbrain.
Back me up!
Going manual!
Batou, are you reading his signal?
Yeah.
I'll amplify the output.
I see the memory unit, but the signal strength is dropping fast.
Batou, can you amplify his output signal any further?
I'll get a Tachikoma to help.
You disengage for now.
There's no time for that.
Do you see me, Puppeteer?
Do you see me, Puppeteer?
Puppeteer?
I mean the hub cyberbrain who integrated the rhizome of the "Kifu Aged".
Hub?
His visual signal has dropped out...
We're losing him...
Hey, what's wrong?
Batou, I'm routing his audio signal over to my speech center.
I should offer you my thanks.
This has gone far enough, disengage now!
Munei posed the greatest obstacle to Solid State.
I have considered purging him myself many times, but the problem was that the man is a luddite who eschews the use of cyberbrain technology.
Who are you?
What was your motive in abducting those children?
Who I am is not important.
As for my motive, perhaps it is not that different from Munei Ito's.
This country has reached the stage where we must take drastic measures in order to shift it from its doomed course.
The problem of the more than six million so-called "Kifu Aged", the rising unemployment rate in contrast with the shrinking able working population, and the low birth rate.
There is no end to the issues that need to be dealt with.
Did you know that even in this society so plagued by a low birth rate, annually no less than fifty thousand children die needlessly before they reach the age of six?
A full thirty percent of these can be attributed to domestic violence and abuse...
Well?
Can you do it?
... another eighty percent...
I can try.
... another eighty percent...
Even if the counselors, police, or other relevant authorities are are made aware of the situation, they are powerless to prevent it.
The social welfare system has failed them.
And so the potential of these children is lost to us.
Major!
If you keep this up, he'll take your consciousness with him when he dies.
Therefore?
Therefore I have focused on gathering and recycling these inadvertently misplaced resources.
I look for children listed on the abuse watchlist network as living in high-risk homes, and change their household registrations in order to give them a new life.
This is the core principle behind the Solid State system?
Correct.
Of course, aiding the "Kifu Aged" was also an indispensable goal.
They were desperately seeking their own raison d'etre.
Although they were unable to leave behind genetic progenies to inherit their DNA, at least they were able to leave successors for posterity, so that their assets would not be escheated to the state.
Furthermore, they were offered an opportunity to achieve something greater by participating in this grand enterprise.
Needless to say, they were elated, and agreed to join my cause.
You realize that this is criminal conspiracy?
Certainly.
But the ends justify the means, and there were no other means.
Removing those high-risk children from jeopardy was my foremost concern.
Even though I sacrificed my own life in the process, I regret nothing.
On the contrary, I may have finally found my reason for becoming a public official.
All that remains now is to establish Solid State as a permanent institution, and to enhance its infrastructure.
But by purging everyone who came in contact with the system one after another, you drew our attention to your plan.
I had not considered how those who were killed must have felt, but like I said, there were no other means.
With Ka Ru-Ma I can understand, but why did you want to eliminate Munei?
Because he intended to keep the children here in detention.
It was pointless to turn them into brainwashed elite cadres, when they could be given a new life of their own.
Although education is important, the children must be allowed free will to make their own choices out in the world.
That is the difference between I and Munei, and the main reason I must eliminate him.
However, this time round, you people intervened.
Still, my tactics seem to be working fairly well to this point, since I have managed to hack directly into your virtually impenetrable cyberbrain from across the plug link.
Major!
You committed suicide just to lure me into connecting?
You are one tough customer, but while I trap you within a thought maze, the rest of Section 9 can easily be dealt with.
Now that's something you don't see everyday.
A rare competent bureaucrat, if an arrogant and self-righteous ass and one who actually knows me.
Who are you, really?
Haven't you figured it out yet, Kusanagi Motoko?
How many arrogant, self-righteous asses do you know?
Until this moment, I was incarnated across a myriad of egos.
Come now, that a collective consciousness can unconsciously begin to act autonomously, is not so hard to believe.
With this, Solid State is established, and I, the vanishing mediator, now move on to the society beyond.
I can't see a thing.
Can someone give me a situation report?
You finally woke up.
Batou, there you are.
How's the situation?
Where am I?
Then, lastly, what do we do with the children?
Hmm... we probably should send them back to their real parents for the time being.
Even though their memories have been altered, and even though we know about their maltreatment at home?
But that may be for the best.
I can't answer that right now - and that decision may be out of our hands anyway.
The kids who found adopted parents before the brainwashing program began, those who that have already left the facility, what is to become of them?
It will be dealt with on a case by case basis.
They'll just have to wait while our complex judicial system comes up with a decision.
Chief, is there anything we can do?
To that, I can only answer that we can only continue struggling within the rules, and hope for the best.
We can only watch and pray that they may one day grow up to achieve their potential and answer the question that we could not.
Solid State system.
Now that I think about it, it really is an ironic name.
He actually used the cyberbrain network formed by those old folks as a transistor to store his own consciousness.
Just like a arrogant bureaucrat to think of such an idea.
Anyway, when we finally identified the Puppeteer, I got the shock of my life.
What do you mean?
It came to light after that guy died and while you were out of it.
In truth, that official has been dead for the past two years.
His name was Koshiki Takaaki, age thirty-three.
Coming from a family of bureaucrats, he was groomed from youth to be a member of the elite cadre.
After graduating from college, he immediately began working for the Ministry of Health.
Perhaps the only reason he became a bureaucrat was because he did not have anything better to do with his life.
Soon afterwards, he began refusing to turn up at the Ministry for work for some reason.
Because he was an information technology prodigy, he received special permission to remote a cybernetic body to work from home.
Eventually, he distinguished himself through his work at the Ministry.
Two years ago, his talent was recognized, and he was reassigned to the Health-Welfare joint project headed by Munei.
He secretly built his own infrastructure into the project sometime during its development.
But here's the thing.
Because he was an such an unobtrusive non-descript fellow who kept to himself, even with all the work that he had done, no one ever found out that he had really died at home from illness.
Thanks to him, the true identity of the Puppeteer will remain forever a mystery.
Are you implying that the guy's remote cybernetic body was used to impersonate him by persons unknown?
Possibly.
Or rather, that is probably the case.
If we consider those old folks, it might also have been a subconscious action taken by their collective consciousness, but we have no way of verifying that now.
I see.
Except for the record of your conversation with Koshiki taken by the Tachikoma.
Do we still have that record?
We should, although for some reason when Koshiki died, the Tachikoma insisted that the record had no further value.
Batou, did you hear the conversation?
Who knows.
At this point, it doesn't really matter, does it?
The old folks, the abused children, both matters are being brought to a resolution.
Although we were unable to unmask the Puppeteer, we can consider this case more or less closed.
This scandal will really hurt those rogue politicians, eh?
I'm mystified, Batou.
In retrospect, what was I thinking back then?
What was I searching for, when I decided to sojourn in the net alone and loitering?
The truth?
My true self?
Or that special someone?
Perhaps I was only projecting the frustration at my own helplessness onto the system.
What?
Are you getting introspective on me now?
You should be satisfied after all that, right?
So, what do you plan to do in the future?
Continue with your lonesome personal-inquiry-for-an-investigation?
I think I've had enough of that.
Although being bound by constraints was tedious, I couldn't bring myself to accept a life free of them.
In the end, it made no difference whatsoever.
Does that mean what I think it does?
Are you thinking of returning to Section 9?
But what about Togusa?
Won't that affect his career?
If his career were so easily stalled, then clearly, this was the furthest his ability would have gotten him anyway.
That's not for you to worry about.
Maybe.
But you know, Batou, the net is indeed vast and infinite.
Soon, the next unimaginable stage of society will begin to take form.
The evacuation of passengers and flight crew has been completed as per the terrorist incident response plan.
All incoming flights are to remain circling outside the airport control zone and await further instructions.
Flights low on fuel are to divert to land at another airport.
305 to 102 -
Public Security Section 9 has arrived.
Please advise.
This is an priority transmission.
Section 9 has been given full authority to direct this operation.
We already have fatalities over here.
Even if that's the arrangement, they should give us some say in how this operation is run.
That's enough.
Recognize your own role.
We do not have the capability to deal with an incident of this type.
Found it.
All outgoing flights have been suspended.
The immigration checkpoint is closed for operations.
According to our preliminary reports, the fugitive is willing to submit to an inspection,... but when he heard that Public Security was taking charge, he seemed almost... delighted.
Delighted?
I have no idea.
So?
I guess dai-sempai won't be meeting up with us after all?
He said that he was in the middle of another personal inquiry for an investigation.
Indeed, it was thanks to Batou that we could piece together the complete picture from the disjointed clues in this case.
Pazu and Boma, bring another two men to the North Gate.
Understood.
We are storming in from the front.
Yes, sir!
However, you've changed, sempai.
You finally gave up on that Mateba autorevolver of yours.
Not really.
According to our information, Ka Gae-Ru shouldn't be augmented.
Then on the ground there is your proverbial unexpected problem.
In other words, he may have seized the gun.
Even so, it's just a 9mm pistol.
Oh, my.
Colonel Ka Gae-Ru!
This is Public Security.
We can consider allowing you safe passage from the country as you demand.
First let the hostage go, then we can further discuss this.
Colonel Ka Gae-Ru!
Do you hear me?
Ka Gae-Ru!
Put the gun down!
Everyone hold your fire.
Hand the gun over.
Togusa.
That guy appears to have inhaled fast-acting military grade microsteroids.
Understood.
Colonel Ka Gae-Ru!
The Puppeteer is coming
- I don't want to die!
If you don't want to die, then put the goddamn gun down now!
What did you say?
I won't let you take me in!
Stop!
Damn it!
What the hell just happened?
The Puppeteer, huh?
The name's not half bad.
Prime Minister Kayabuki.
Operatives marked with "bon*" character tattoos belonging to Generalissimo Ka Ru-Ma's loyalist group...
*The kanji character 梵 (bon), meaning Buddhist.
... have been commiting suicide one after another in the country.
Even his eldest son Colonel Ka Gae-Ru has just killed himself.
And yet, you still insist that there is no need to interrogate the Generalissimo?
Regarding Colonel Ka Gae-Ru's death, it has also been reported that it was due to a botched arrest.
Even if we suppose that this is an unspecified terrorist threat by Seok Republic remnants, we can't prove that Generalissimo Ka Ru-Ma, isolated under house arrest, was involved as well.
While the Refugee Naturalization Act is being implemented, please avoid any incidents that may fuel the opposition parties.
It is my understanding that this is why Public Security Section 9 exists.
I understand.
Ishikawa!
Dig up the record of Ka Gae-Ru's confession.
Yes, sir!
We're moving out!
Is this really fine?
We have yet to obtain authorization.
As long as no one finds out that Pandora's Box has been opened, it won't count as breaking faith.
Has any new evidence been discovered at the scene?
No, not yet.
Find witnesses concerning the victim's...
Batou!
Do you hear me, Batou?
I hear you.
Where are you right now?
I'm over at the thirteenth tattooed man's place.
Another suicide?
Yeah.
This place looks similar to our safehouses.
It's likely that this was just one of their dens.
Leave that end to the prefectural police.
Bring a subordinate down to check out this location.
A hideout revealed by Ka Gae-Ru himself in his confession.
Oh?
But isn't such mainstream work more Togusa's province?
Togusa and I are heading to the enemy's main headquarters.
I see.
Togusa.
How long has it been since the Major left Section 9?
Almost two years now, I think.
It's been that long...
I must deeply apologise for the Ka Gae-Ru incident.
That couldn't be helped.
This case could deal Prime Minister Kayabuki a fatal setback.
She probably wishes to suppress any bad publicity.
But wasn't it Prime Minister Kabayuki herself, concerned that the Six Powers Pact would object to her Refugee Naturalization Act, who had Ka Ru-Ma placed under house arrest as a bargaining chip, sparking off this whole fiasco?
That's because Generalissimo Ka Ru-Ma, before seeking asylum in Japan, had once threatened to launch retaliatory acts of terrorism.
That at the moment of his death, he would visit terror upon the entire world.
Is this the oath of vengeance mentioned in his Seok dissolution speech?
Isn't it our job to find that out and prepare countermeasures?
Although we don't know how he sends out his orders from isolation, we need only to capture Ka Ru-Ma himself to break the case and bring the truth to light.
The problem right now is - how far along is this terrorist plan of his?
Chief.
The Coast Guard report that they have cleared the airspace along the route.
Right.
Thank them, then prepare to land immediately.
Remember to alter the flight records.
Yes, sir!
No firearms or knives detected.
Clear!
Proto.
Turn the power on and lift the blind.
Roger.
What's the matter?
Chief.
Hmm?
It looks like he did himself in.
This looks bad.
This guy killing himself could mean that his plan has already been set into motion.
That thing is...?
A healthcare monitoring network terminal.
Simply put, it's a device to exchange medical data with a medical establishment.
It was rumored that Ka Ru-Ma was suffering from serious health problems before he went into exile.
Looks like the rumor was true.
Still, I can't believe that the government is oblivious to Ka Ru-Ma's death.
Hmm?
Bingo!
This guy planted a backdoor in the system.
Looks look he was a smarter-than-your-average-dictator.
Looks like it.
The log records his communications with his associates.
Although we need to bring this back to the lab for analysis, there's no doubt that at one time he was attempting to use a micromachine virus to carry out terrorist attacks.
What do you mean by "at one time"?
Back when his operatives were beginning to kill themselves off one after another, they once discussed with Ka Gae-Ru whether or not to suspend the plan.
What does that mean?
In other words, their commiting suicide did not in any way mark the beginning of their plan?
I'm not sure.
However, what puzzles me is that a program that made it seem as if Ka Ru-Ma were still alive was installed by an outside intruder.
At this time, the administration probably still doesn't know the truth about his death.
An assassination disguised as a suicide?
Yeah.
By someone who didn't want the administration to know that Ka Ru-Ma had already been taken out of the picture, perhaps.
What about the micromachine virus?
It seems to have been delivered to a certain Ma Sha-Ba.
If Batou isn't slacking off, he should be retrieving it any time now.
Togusa.
What's this, then?
"The Puppeteer"?
Azuma, just before Ka Gae-Ru died, didn't he also mention something about about "The Puppeteer"?
What if he did?
The log contains references to "The Puppeteer" as well.
The term appears to designate one of their associates.
Looks like we have to apprehend Ma Sha-Ba quickly.
Make a copy of the log, then rendezvous with Batou.
We must uncover the full scope of their plan at all cost.
What do we do with the corpse?
Leave everything as it was.
Regretfully, we were never here.
Yes, sir.
A clinic?
What's a nice car like you doing in a dump like this?
Pretty hefty security system...
Go flank in from the other side!
Acknowledged.
What?
There's no way for you to hack my cyberbrain in here.
Die, Puppeteer!
Over there?
Batou?
That's...?
Dodge!
You dumbass!
Until I get back, play dead.
Acknowledged.
Halt!
Major？
It's been a while, Batou.
What are you doing here?
I knew it.
I might ask you the same question.
Call it conducting a personal inquiry for an investigation.
It's coming!
Wait.
What the...
Hold this a moment.
Isn't this...
Ma Sha-Ba?
It appears that you know quite a bit.
Know quite a bit...?
Hey, what exactly are you up to?
Who knows?
I'll be having that back.
I see that you've changed your taste in cars.
When did she...?
But this one's not bad either.
Batou, I'm guessing that you're here to investigate the serial suicides of those tattooed men.
A word to the wise, stay away from the Solid State society, or you'll end up killing yourself just like them.
You'll have to find your own ride.
Did I not order you to bring a subordinate along?
That's why I brought that tincan with me.
We came too late.
Ma Sha-Ba's already dead.
The cause of death?
He suffered a fatal concussion when he lost control of the robot and crashed.
It looks like Ma Sha-Ba wasn't the Puppeteer after all.
Batou, why did he come at you with that thing?
Who knows?
That's what I would have liked to ask him.
Perhaps he attacked you because he mistook you for the Puppeteer?
Hey, what is this Puppeteer you keep mentioning?
At present, the hypothesis is that it may be the codename for a suspect who may have caused the deaths of the tattooed men and Ka Ru-Ma by hacking into their cyberbrains and forcing them to kill themselves.
Judging from his skill, he might be a hacker surpassing wizard class.
Wizard class...
Chief.
We've found out what Ka Ru-Ma's plan for terror was.
What was it?
You should come over and see for yourself.
Ka Ru-Ma intended to implant micromachines into these children in order to disseminate a virus.
What the hell?
This isn't a retaliation plan, this is utter inhumanity!
Sooner or later, Section 9 will probably track me back to this place.
Loki, Conan, I leave the rest to you.
It seems that I can only handle at most two concurrent cybernetic bodies.
The only way left may be to wipe and retrain them from scratch.
I see.
We've even tried natural oil.
However, due to the different subjects, we were unable to achieve results of the same degree.
You're still concerned over the development of these guys?
Africa was much tougher than I had expected.
Even with upgraded augmentations, I'm still exhausted.
Further implants could mess up your cardiopulmonary function, you know.
Can't be helped.
It's an occupational hazard.
Togusa and you, I really take my hat off to you guys.
From the roster we found at the scene, the operatives involved in the plan include :
the thirteen suicides, Ka Gae-Ru, Ma Sha-Ba, and a certain Raj Poot.
In all, sixteen people.
Who is this Raj Poot?
Could he be the Puppeteer?
It appears that he is not yet in the country.
The communications log would also indicate this.
Not many people would stick with a leader who insisted that they follow him to the grave.
Such is often the sorry end of dictators.
But there were actually sixteen people, huh...
You're late, Batou!
Oh？
When did you get back?
Just now.
Azuma!
Please carry on.
Moving on.
Lieutenant?
Regarding the missing micromachine virus:
A case containing 144 ampoules containing a genetically modified organic virus has been brought into the country, a biological weapon with a time delayed mechanism.
And this hot potato has vanished into thin air.
Batou.
Are you certain that you didn't run into anyone else at Ma Sha-Ba's clinic?
Yeah.
And there was no sign of anyone who might have caused the robot to go out of control?
Nope.
I see.
What exactly are you trying to ask here?
Ah, nevermind...
Actually, we still haven't traced the owner of that smashed car.
Isn't it possible that it was stolen?
From the look of the car security system installed, I would say no.
Furthermore, the surveillance camera footage was somehow partially erased.
This seems to indicate that someone else was present at the scene.
By someone else, you mean the Puppeteer?
Perhaps.
Although Ka Ru-Ma's plan was never implemented, but there is a possibility that this hacker called the Puppeteer may commit independent acts of terror.
While we are tracking down the micromachine ampoules, we also need to focus on investigating this Puppeteer.
Yes, sir!
Togusa.
What do I do?
Go take a break.
Individual body maintenance should take precedence.
Understood.
I'll do that, then.
By the way, Batou?
This morning the Chief had a talk with me and said that it's about time for you to choose your next assignment.
Would you rather concentrate on your duties as training officer, or participate in the Puppeteer investigation under my direction?
It's your call.
Which will it be?
Isn't it obvious?
The Puppeteer, of course.
I see.
Did you find anything?
Yeah, we hit paydirt.
Let's have it.
Firstly, medical examination of the sixteen children reveal no sign of their having been implanted with micromachines at all.
Although suffering from dehydration and injuries from maltreatment, basically, they're fairly healthy.
However, the sixteen of them have had their memories partially erased, and their personal IDs altered to assign them fake parents.
They could remember their names and addresses, but as far as their parents were concerned, they had not the slightest recollection.
Furthermore, upon investigation, the addresses given by them turned out to be residences of old folks living alone.
Could those old folks actually be their parents?
No.
From a granny living in a four-and-a-half-tatami flat, to the rich old codger who could afford personal nursing support robots, there were all sorts, but without exception, all were "Kifu* Aged" hooked up to the healthcare monitoring network.
*貴腐 (kifu), meaning noble rot.
Obviously, there was no sign whatsoever that they had ever lived with children.
Although the household registrations list them as the parents, most likely, these records were doctored.
What's a "Kifu Aged"?
It refers to the bedridden elderly connected to an automated monitoring system which tends to their basic healthcare needs, just like noble-rot infested grapes withering away on the vine.
That's where the name comes from.
This system was originally developed to deal with the problem of an aging population, and at the same time, prevent old folks living alone from dying unnoticed in their homes.
Unexpectedly, connecting to the network instead rendered its users comatose.
The LPO slammed it as the "vegetable legacy retrieval system".
You're pretty well-informed.
The old bags at the parlor often chat with me about it.
It's sort of like an economy model of the terminal Ka Ru-Ma had.
Wait a minute.
Wasn't it Ka Gae-Ru's intent to make human bombs out of the children?
Why then did he specifically erase their memories of their parents?
Rather than planting them somewhere after infecting them with the virus, would it not have been simpler to erase their memories of the abductions, and send them back to their parents?
How should I know?
That's true.
They even had cyberbrains specially implanted.
It really is too extravagant.
Actually, the implants seem to have been performed prior to the abductions.
The transform components also appear to be legit.
In that case, there should be records of the implants at the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.
A guardian is required to sign off on the procedure before it can be performed on a six year old.
There were 144 missing ampoules.
To be on the safe side, let's check this out.
Try and find if there are any matching children in the records.
Assuming that those sixteen kids we rescued had their implants done through through legitimate channels, their records would have been automatically registered with the Ministry of Health's database.
If they were abducted and had their household records doctored after the implants had been registered, the number of children with cyberbrain implants listed in the Ministry of Internal Affairs' resident registry should conflict with the number of such children registered with the Ministry of Health's database.
Now I see.
Since those sixteen had their family names altered to match those of the elderly invalids, in theory this should work.
Twenty thousand?
There must be some kind of mistake.
If children were being abducted in such vast numbers, surely someone would have noticed by now.
True.
In any case, this figure far exceeds anything we ever expected.
What now?
Let's start by eliminating the impossible.
First, sort the list of extraneous children in the data by name and address.
Leave that to me, I'll be done in a sec.
A trap?
!
This is an emergency warning.
Presence of a Level E class virus has been confirmed.
Please shutdown all machines immediately.
Emergency warning...
Emergency warning...
Level E class virus...
Please shutdown all machines...
Engaging emergency server lockdown...
It's no use, the system is not accepting commands.
Hiragi, Soma, backup the data now!
We can't, it's already been infected!
Our only option is to cut the power!
Help me out.
Was the virus embedded in the Ministry of Internal Affairs database?
We've lost the data on that end.
Is the data from the Ministry of Health intact?
Yes, but why?
Out of the way!
Right now, it must be buzzing like an overturned beehive over at the Ministry of Internal Affairs as well.
Dammit!
We just chopped away our best lead.
In any case, it seems now that there must actually have been twenty thousand abductions, huh?
What do you mean?
Normally, twenty thousand is an implausible number of abductions for Ka Gae-Ru's outfit to have pulled off.
The perpetrator's modus operandi is also too amateurish for it to have been the work of the Puppeteer.
We need only look at the facts of the abductions - the discrepancies due to the tampering of the household registrations is like a big sign saying "I nabbed them, come and find me!"
I can't help but think that the Puppeteer has some other purpose in mind.
I agree with your point of view.
Chief.
This case was dropped off at the Ministry of Health's Pathogenic Microbes Repository Unit.
Subsequent analysis proved that it was indeed the Seok manufactured micromachine virus.
This proves that the information we gathered was right on the money.
Do we know who dropped the case off?
There were no records whatsoever of when the case was dropped off, nor any footage of the courier.
Could this could be the Puppeteer?
That's possible.
If so, what is the Puppeteer's motive in all this, if not to commit acts of terror?
From the looks of it, this Puppeteer might be a hacker working for some governmental agency or other.
I was bewildered by the elaborate coverup of Ka Ru-Ma's death.
After some digging of my own, I discovered that Prime Minister Kabayuki and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had canceled a volatile conference on the threat posed by him.
In other words, Ka Ru-Ma, the thorn in the administration's side, had already been dealt with by the hacker employed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as far as they were concerned.
At present, that would seem to be the situation, yes.
If so, maybe we should write this mass abduction thing off as a bluff after all.
Which section was responsible for this?
This case carries great international significance.
Considering the events that have occurred to this point, our stance on the matter should be similar to that of the administration.
I believe that we should leave well alone on this matter.
Therefore, concentrate on establishing the identities of those sixteen children.
Put the Puppeteer investigation on hold for now.
That is all.
Aw, geez.
All that work for nothing, and a huge mess to clean up.
We at least have to help those kids find their parents quickly.
I'm just setting off now.
Sorry about that.
I have a question.
What is it?
Was it the Treaties Bureau that made an old warhorse like you back off from the case?
About that?
I cut a deal with Nakamura.
I turn a blind eye on their covert operations, and in return, we get a free hand to investigate the matter of this micromachine virus.
And that is fine?
If purging Ka Ru-Ma was required for the good of the country, surely we should be dismayed that we were passed over for this vital task?
What, then, was the point of you expanding Section 9 over these past two years, old timer?
If we keep going like this, she won't come back.
Whether being passed over for an assassination order should bring regret or rejoicing, that question may determine what direction the Section will go in the future.
I know what you are trying to say, but we must also consider the possibility that the Major may never return.
Her talent is more precious to me than even an esper's.
In truth, no one can ever live up to her.
Likewise, it's impossible for me to stick around at this post forever.
Therefore, instead of having to expend all of our strength to crack one case,
I would rather build an organisation where we can use an eighth of our strength to crack three cases.
Don't you think that, in this way, we can better carry on our ideals?
This was what I had in mind when I expanded Section 9.
Promoting Togusa to squad leader was also part of this process.
Though, if you had been willing to accept the post at the time, things might be entirely different now.
I'm not suitable for that position.
If you say so.
That might even be true.
But not for Togusa.
Even so, in order for his potential to flourish, he must learn to overcome adversity.
I hope that you can help him along.
I thought as much.
But he's done quite well, actually.
Much like the Major, he's always fair and balanced, whether at home or at work.
For the sake of Section 9, he's even discussed cybernization with his family.
But gaining the acceptance of another is hard to do.
Indeed, I myself have not been able to gain that.
We haven't had a good long talk like this for a while now.
Looks like I won't be coming home tonight, either.
That can't be helped.
You have heavy responsibilities at work now.
Have the kids been good?
Yeah.
But last week our girl asked to sleep on her own in her room.
It's been calm, but I do kind of miss the sibling fights.
Really?
She's a big girl now.
Oh course!
She's already six.
Six, huh?
Snap a picture of her asleep and send it to me, will you?
Sure.
Togusa, we have an situation!
Get over to Area 47 right now!
What happened?
Sempai, I'm sorry, all the children...
They had all gone missing by the time I got here.
Is this the same thing that happened with Ka Gae-Ru?
Looks like it.
The Puppeteer...
If Proto had really wanted to kill himself, he could have pulled the trigger anytime.
This is nothing but a ploy to stall for time!
Ishikawa, Boma!
Use the IR system to locate the children immediately!
Given our current situation, that may have limited use.
At the same time, request support from the prefectural police.
Bring Proto over to the analysis lab.
Togusa, we need to talk!
Later!
Right now, we need to find the missing kids!
This is important!
I may have some insight into the Puppeteer's identity!
It's Aramaki.
Thank you.
You're late.
Sorry, I was delayed by work.
Colonel Tonoda, how's your health?
Back to his old hobby, I see.
Cut the man some slack already.
They say that his health problems arose from the psychological stress of his time in the penitentiary.
What's with Tsujisaki?
He didn't drop by even once.
And to think that I favoured him the most.
He's forgotten me, the ingrate!
His memory seems to be going as well.
Step out for a moment.
I have something for you.
So ends the legendary Akaoni Poacher in ignominy.
You should consider marrying again.
Tragic is the fate of lonely old men.
I have no desire for something that I can't bring with me to the grave.
The same old retort, I see.
So, what is it that you have for me?
Right, take this.
Actually, I ran into the Major back at Ma Sha-Ba's clinic.
The Major...?
It couldn't be...?
I didn't think it was possible at first as well, but now I'm getting increasingly worried that she might actually be the Puppeteer.
I missed my chance to speak up earlier.
Did you see her do Ma Sha-Ba in?
No, but I did see her take the case of ampoules.
Previously, I would intervene every time we crossed paths with the Major during an investigation.
I've always assumed that she, in her own way, was there to guide us along to break the case.
But it's different this time.
Exactly what does the Major intend?
That I don't know.
But even odds are, the Major was present at the scene of those suspected assassinations.
Batou.
Hurry to Daikyuu ring highway No. 16 with Saito immediately.
This is a matter of utmost priority!
Chief, we have a situation here as well.
The Puppeteer has turned up at Section 9.
What did you say?
Old timer, the Puppeteer appears to...
Let's not jump to conclusions.
I want to confirm this for myself.
Chief.
Since that fellow moved preemptively against us, can we further pursue this matter?
Since that's the case, carry on.
Roger that.
What happened on your side?
Two hours ago, surveillance cameras in the Engan area happened to pick up the image of a known international criminal.
Hmm?
Who would that be?
He sounds formidable, if you need me and Saito to take him down together.
A former Seok Republic class A+ sniper Lieutenant Raj Poot.
Raj Poot？
That's...
That last man who was not yet in the country?
He was head of Ka Ru-Ma's personal bodyguard.
It's believed that he fled to China after Seok was dissolved.
For him to take to the stage at this point is mighty suspicious.
Fortunately, the Intelligence Division has managed to pinpoint his current whereabouts.
The two of you shadow him and try to discover what he is up to.
Roger that.
Togusa, if the Major is the Puppeteer, then she has become our enemy.
I don't even want to think about that.
One of these days, I will return this favor.
Colonel Tonoda, I take my leave of you for today.
Like father, like son...
Like man, like robot...
You didn't turn out to be anything like me.
It is gratifying to know that a phoenix can fledge from an old crow's nest.
Do take care of your health.
Thank you.
Colonel, you take care as well.
How will that guy take out his target?
Like me, he will use his Hawkeye to acquire the target through real-time satellite imaging before taking the shot.
In that case, there will come a point when our GPS tracker will fail due to the inteference caused by the Hawkeye satellite downlink.
We need to apprehend him before that happens.
Got that.
Let's visually confirm the target.
Be sure not to alert him.
Target confirmed.
There's no mistake, it's him alright.
Togusa.
The IR system has located one of the missing children.
Really?
Where?
He's moving through a small construction lot in Kohoku Park.
That's near my place.
Right.
I'll check it out.
I'll inform the prefectural police as well.
Meanwhile, we'll return to investigating the twenty thousand child abductions.
I see.
Damn.
I guess I'll have to put this matter of the Major aside for now.
The Puppeteer, I presume?
I don't really need to ask, no?
Public Security Section 9 just called to inquire if I knew a hacker called the Puppeteer.
I told them I didn't.
So, you were looking for me?
I've come to refund your fee.
It doesn't matter to us whether you actually had anything to do with it or not - your mission objective was achieved.
I regret to say that this is the end.
I am going now.
Leave some way to contact you over the net, then.
Anything will do.
Was this was a puppet too?
What a waste.
Her talent and skill were outstanding.
It'll be daybreak soon.
I wonder why he even bothered turning up now when their plan is already in shambles?
Perhaps to avenge Ka Ru-Ma's death?
That sounds plausible, but how in the world did he get a hold of that intelligence?
Even we were almost left in the dark about that.
That's true.
How long does he intend to keep driving around, anyway?
Speaking of which, look over there.
That's...
Togusa.
The boy has entered apartment no. 602 of block M-26.
You know the way?
Yeah.
I know this neighborhood like the back of my hand.
A "Kifu Aged"?
Return him to me!
I've left all my assets to the child.
I'd rather have him as my heir than forfeit it all to the government.
The poor thing would just have ended up being abused to death, if we had done nothing.
This is the common resolve of all the residents of Solid State, our little game - nay, our grand enterprise.
Do not meddle in our affairs, if you wish to avoid becoming yet another suicide.
You have been warned.
My gut feeling tells me that his target is somewhere over there.
Turn off the cyberbrain, then help him find a guardian.
Yes, sir.
Death has been confirmed.
Requesting permission to dispose of the remains and retrieve the system terminal.
Dispose?
That's strange.
Didn't he have family?
Our data indicates that he should have a six year old son.
A mistake in the records?
Oh joy.
Even more work for us.
A mistake in the records?
No, that's not it.
That's only because I rescued him.
Which means that, but for my intervention, those social workers would have found and taken the boy into protection as planned.
The suicides of those operatives.
The missing children.
"Kifu Aged".
The common resolve of all the residents of Solid State.
No, what is this Solid State in the first place?
What did that old man mean?
It's me.
Thank goodness I finally got through, please hurry home, our girl's gone missing!
This is it.
Now!
Wait!
Damn, therm-optic camouflage?
How did this happen?
I've been cut off from the GPS system.
The Puppeteer?
But my kid doesn't have a cyberbrain!
I need you to trace which satellite that bastard is using.
Since we've lost visual contact, our one and only chance to stop him will be the moment before he takes the shot.
I might be able to trace the satellite, but how do we stop him?
That should is his field of fire.
From up here, we should have line of sight to his sniping point, although he will spot us easily as well.
Wear this, or you'll be exposed.
There's no time, our opponent is about to act.
We play to win.
It's begun.
Done!
Send it.
That's his target?
The satellite tracks him at SE37.
There he is.
Drop the link before it feeds back!
He's on to us!
Saito!
Did I nail him?
Wait here, I'll go confirm.
Come on, come on...
Huh?
Papa!
How is it?
Have some faith in yourself.
I see.
Hey, who was that man you were trying to off?
Why were you trying to kill him?
To avenge the Generalissimo, I will kill every last one of you Jap motherfuckers!
Avenge?
Don't fuck around with me!
Now, what was the source of your intel?
A mole turned it over to me.
He told me who was behind the Generalissimo's death, so that I could cap the bitch.
And does this mole have a name?
A representative named Munei Ito who frequents the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Old timer, have this Munei fellow taken into custody immediately.
Also, this is an image of Raj's intended target.
Looks like he was the mastermind behind Ka Ru-Ma's assassination.
Eh?
Unless I'm mistaken, that man is Munei Ito.
How could this be?
Your informant is the exact same guy you were trying to kill!
God knows.
Maybe he was suicidal or something.
Suicidal...?
Hey, could it be that the Puppeteer set you up as well?
Fuck.
You may just be right.
Were he only human, I'd take that bastard out first of all.
Instead, I got myself taken out by a superior foe.
The Puppeteer is not human?
It's an abduction infrastructure built into Solid State.
Solid State?
Hey, what does that mean?
You don't know?
That is to say, the healthcare monitoring network.
The government of your so-called democratic country takes part in child abductions.
What a farce.
Old timer, dispatch a paramedic team and helicopter over to this place.
Also, run a background check on this Munei.
This is too weird.
I understand.
Then, I found her just after calling you.
It seems like she went over to the neighbor's place in the morning.
Is that so?
Thank goodness it turned out to be nothing.
You shouldn't run off by yourself without telling Mama the next time.
Yeah.
Well then, I'll send you to school.
I feel a bit guilty about heading right back to work like this.
Is that alright?
You look exhausted to me.
I'm invigorated just by seeing your faces.
Really?
That's great.
See ya!
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing.
Togusa!
I've bagged Raj Poot over here.
The Puppeteer appears to be involved as well.
You mean... the Major?
Yeah, but as it turns out, the Major is most likely not the Puppeteer.
Raj Poot claims that the Puppeteer is an abduction infrastructure built into the healthcare monitoring system.
Abduction infrastructure?
He referred to the healthcare monitoring network as "Solid State", and insinuated that our government was mixed up in this somehow.
Back when I ran into the Major, she had actually warned me to stay away from the Solid State society.
Initially, I had thought that "Solid State" was a reference to "soshi*",...
*The kanji characters for electronic element 素子(soshi) can also be read as motoko, the Major's name..
... in other words, to stay away from the Major herself.
*The kanji characters for electronic element 素子(soshi) can also be read as motoko, the Major's name..
But in fact, she was telling us to stay away from the healthcare monitoring network.
Ka Ru-Ma and company were most likely purged because they discovered the infrastructure, and tried to use it for their own ends.
So that's how it is.
It's from Mama.
Hold for a moment.
Hello?
You ignored our warning.
Who is this!
For that, we will take your adorable daughter.
Togusa!
Togusa!
Ishikawa, can you pinpoint Togusa's present location?
Eh?
Not a problem, what's wrong?
Togusa's cyberbrain's been hacked into!
Papa, we're going the wrong way.
You're the Puppeteer?
Why are you abducting all those children?
Where have twenty thousand kids vanished to?
We only wish to utilize resources that have slipped through the net of society.
Soon, you will experience this for yourself.
Batou!
I've found Togusa's present location.
The Cyberbrain Implant Hospital in Kohoku Ward.
Now I get it.
You could get the implant performed without arousing any suspicions if you made a parent bring his child down to the hospital himself.
Erase the child's memories, send her over to an elderly invalid's home, and the abduction is complete.
Afterwards, you'd only need to alter my memories to make me think that I had lost her.
Don't feel too bad about getting your memories altered.
In today's world, the incidence of such cases are already more common than, say, traffic accidents.
You're offering me one last alternative?
That's the place!
I won't let you take my daughter.
Listen, will you do as Papa says?
Start running as fast as you can when Papa lets go of your hand.
Run?
That's right.
There will be a loud bang, just like at the school sports meet.
Once you hear that, run that way and keep running.
Don't stop, and don't ever look back.
Can you do that?
Yeah.
Good girl.
Close your eyes.
I'm so sorry.
Goodbye.
Togusa!
I love you.
TOGUSA!
Max, Musashi!
It's OK, everything's fine.
Major!
I must apologize for holding off until the last moment to save you.
Major, you're not the Puppeteer?
Where were you all this time?
Papa!
Wandering on the net alone after leaving Section 9, I came across this unconventional case by chance.
Eventually I found out about the abductions, and began my own investigation into the matter.
I can't believe that you actually used Togusa as bait!
Didn't you stop to think that you might be endangering his family as well?
I set him up with safeguards, of course.
Thanks to him, we can finally unmask the Puppeteer.
Isn't the Puppeteer just a system built into the healthcare monitoring network?
Rather than a system, I would call it a collective consciousness formed by the elderly invalids hooked up to the network.
However, there must also exist a hub cyberbrain who integrated them in the first place.
A hub cyberbrain?
Hey, isn't that...
The data from my network trace being extracted from Togusa's cyberbrain.
Ah, Batou!
Long time no see!
You're looking well!
Good to see that you've been taking care of yourself.
The elderly monitoring system has contained a backdoor function ever since it was designed.
Look.
This is the full scope of the rhizome formed by the collective consciousness of those elderly invalids in the network.
There is no concept of a center in a rhizome, therefore the hub has no fixed position within the rhizome, or rather, the rhizome itself is constantly in flux.
I get the idea, but who does that hub cyberbrain belong to?
Max, Musashi, report your findings.
Well?
Ah, how do I put this...
You failed?
b..but we managed to locate his current whereabouts.
And where would that be?
The complex grounds of the Seishomin* Welfare Center which takes charge of the elderly monitoring system.
*聖庶民 (seishomin), meaning "Sacred Citizen".
The personnel have arrived.
Releasing locks.
It's been a while, Major.
Indeed.
Though I wish it could have been under happier circumstances.
Why did you change your mind and return?
We'll talk about that later.
Right now, our priority should be to catch the Puppeteer.
Munei Ito, member of the Diet's House of Representatives.
Finding out why he was marked for death is our one key to uncover the Puppeteer's identity.
Munei has long been an advocate of a racially pure Japan, a reactionary conservative nationalist.
He frequents the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and has close ties with the Treaties Bureau.
He participated in the plan to assassinate Ka Ru-Ma.
Major, you mean...
I had a contract with the Treaties Bureau to covertly assassinate Ka Ru-Ma, but the Puppeteer got there first.
So you were only responsible for the subsequent coverup?
That's more or less it.
We also discovered that Munei instigated an management reshuffle at the Seishomin Welfare Center in order to solidify his control over the facility.
How will that benefit him?
Isn't this a welfare facility that provides elderly healthcare monitoring and vocational training?
Right.
But several rogue politicians are using it as a front for something entirely different.
In actual fact, he is using his cover as treasurer to run a power elite education project.
In other words, a glorified brainwashing facility.
So this is what Raj Poot meant about government involvement.
If the Puppeteer was using this place as a temporary holding center for the abducted children, then Munei turning it into a brainwashing facility would pose a problem for him.
Chief.
How about we conduct a forced search?
Finding the children should be our top priority,
But conducting a raid will cause a scandal.
When that happens, those shitty politicians won't be the only ones whose asses get toasted.
Ishikawa, how's the situation?
Is that the Major?
Geez, you could have turned up sooner.
Although we've verified the receipt of a massive quantity of components that may have been used to construct HC-25 brainwashing devices, that alone is insufficient evidence to justify a raid.
What about images from the inside?
I could only obtain footage from the workshop zone.
The education zone is protected by a firewall in the form of complex barrier maze.
It looks to be completely impenetrable.
There are only refugees here.
The abducted children are being held in the education zone, then?
That can only mean that this facility was built with the abduction infrastructure in place from the start.
If not, it's hard to imagine that a politician would dare to introduce such an audacious policy.
You mean to say that the Puppeteer have must have been one of the system designers behind this project?
Ishikawa, prepare the decoder for an attempt to hack through the barrier maze.
I'll make the dive.
If worse come to worst, Section 9 can carry on so long as you and Togusa remain.
Batou.
I absolutely refuse to hear such talk from you.
Are you implying that you'll be retiring as well after this?
I appreciate your sentiments, but I only came here to unmask the Puppeteer.
It's true that we may need to hang someone out to dry this time, and at this point, I have nothing left to lose.
Chief.
It's unfortunate, but I say we raid them.
The Puppeteer is waiting for a chance to eliminate Munei.
I do not wish to see this opportunity slip us by.
But how are we going to pick out the Puppeteer?
At this point, we still have yet to determine his identity.
Leave that to my ghost's whisper.
Woo!
It feels great!
Hi!
Long time no see, everyone!
Here goes.
Move out!
As I thought, nothing beats the thrill of racing along in a physical body again.
Really?
My joints seem a bit creaky though.
Look like another intrusion like before, but something feels different this time.
In any case, secure the perimeter.
Understood.
Professionals like us, huh?
In that case let's get to know each other a bit.
Another hacking attempt by the Investigations section?
What a complete waste of effort.
Let's do an inspection before we leave.
Pazu and Boma, secure our route of withdrawal.
Roger that.
Who are you people?
Why would you want to know?
I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
Huh?
The comms were cut off.
Security cyborgs incoming.
Major, go on ahead.
The one who went in is done for.
Go after those still outside.
Understood.
They opened fire without any warning.
So this place really is a highly sensitive government front.
He's coming after us.
Over there will be fine.
No heat signatures or shadows a Kyo-Re cloaking device?
That means...
Your information is antiquated.
They don't refer to the Model 3302 as a cloaking device anymore.
Finish them.
Roger!
Back me up.
I've almost taken control of the system.
Leave it to me.
Hasn't it always been this way?
Togusa, where are you now?
Major.
I'm currently approaching the roof via the outer wall.
Good.
Carry on and rendezvous with the Chief on the roof.
I've located the children.
Let's go!
Representative Munei, this is Public Security Section 9.
We have already verified the situation here.
It seems we have no choice but to insist on a full scale search of this facility.
Public Security?
Although not under its official auspices, this is a vital facility for the nation.
How dare you Public Security people come barging in here with your overinflated sense of justice!
Representative.
Even so, it is clear from the situation here that it is our job to intervene in such matters.
For a public official, you do not seem to be able to comprehend the crisis facing our nation right now.
If we carry on as we are, in the near future, our nation's prosperity will be displaced by that of foreigners.
To prevent this from occurring, we are investing in this education program for these wards of the state, entrusting our nation's future to them.
Is there anything wrong with that?
The funding for this investment wouldn't happen to have been procured through the exploitation of those elderly invalids and refugees in your care, would it?
That couldn't be helped.
Just think, what have they ever done for this country?
They never started a family, or raised children, and are themselves exempt from taxation.
Selfishly wasting away their lives, and then expecting us to take care of them in their dotage.
What a shameless lot.
If it were up to me, I would even lay a tax on them to make up for the loss to the state caused by their being no longer fit for the workforce.
This is nothing but rhetoric.
What, then, have politicians like you ever done for this country either?
Indulging in egotism, and placing political self-preservation above the needs of others.
Who was responsible for ignoring such social problems until things came to a head?
I am proud to say that I, for my own part, have always been conscientious towards my duties.
Even if it infringes upon human rights, and violates cyberbrain ethics?
That is an unfortunate but necessary sacrifice.
You really are a bloody-minded fellow.
Major. we've verified the number of the children being held here.
It's nowhere near twenty thousand, at most three thousand kids.
Is that right?
Switch over to autistic mode.
Roger that.
Representative.
Did you know that the system in this center has been automatically abducting children?
These children aren't orphans.
A large proportion of them have been abducted.
It was our investigation into the abductions that led us here, therefore, you are an important witness in this case.
Although I was the director of this project, this is the first I've heard of such a bug in the system!
In that case, allow us to question the system designers involved.
It was I.
It was I who designed the core principles behind the Solid State system.
Togusa, take the lot of them into custody!
Yes, ma'am!
Batou, before this guy's memories vanish, I want to dive into his cyberbrain.
Back me up!
Going manual!
Batou, are you reading his signal?
Yeah.
I'll amplify the output.
I see the memory unit, but the signal strength is dropping fast.
Batou, can you amplify his output signal any further?
I'll get a Tachikoma to help.
You disengage for now.
There's no time for that.
Do you see me, Puppeteer?
Do you see me, Puppeteer?
Puppeteer?
I mean the hub cyberbrain who integrated the rhizome of the "Kifu Aged".
Hub?
His visual signal has dropped out...
We're losing him...
Hey, what's wrong?
Batou, I'm routing his audio signal over to my speech center.
I should offer you my thanks.
This has gone far enough, disengage now!
Munei posed the greatest obstacle to Solid State.
I have considered purging him myself many times, but the problem was that the man is a luddite who eschews the use of cyberbrain technology.
Who are you?
What was your motive in abducting those children?
Who I am is not important.
As for my motive, perhaps it is not that different from Munei Ito's.
This country has reached the stage where we must take drastic measures in order to shift it from its doomed course.
The problem of the more than six million so-called "Kifu Aged", the rising unemployment rate in contrast with the shrinking able working population, and the low birth rate.
There is no end to the issues that need to be dealt with.
Did you know that even in this society so plagued by a low birth rate, annually no less than fifty thousand children die needlessly before they reach the age of six?
A full thirty percent of these can be attributed to domestic violence and abuse...
Well?
Can you do it?
... another eighty percent...
I can try.
... another eighty percent...
Even if the counselors, police, or other relevant authorities are are made aware of the situation, they are powerless to prevent it.
The social welfare system has failed them.
And so the potential of these children is lost to us.
Major!
If you keep this up, he'll take your consciousness with him when he dies.
Therefore?
Therefore I have focused on gathering and recycling these inadvertently misplaced resources.
I look for children listed on the abuse watchlist network as living in high-risk homes, and change their household registrations in order to give them a new life.
This is the core principle behind the Solid State system?
Correct.
Of course, aiding the "Kifu Aged" was also an indispensable goal.
They were desperately seeking their own raison d'etre.
Although they were unable to leave behind genetic progenies to inherit their DNA, at least they were able to leave successors for posterity, so that their assets would not be escheated to the state.
Furthermore, they were offered an opportunity to achieve something greater by participating in this grand enterprise.
Needless to say, they were elated, and agreed to join my cause.
You realize that this is criminal conspiracy?
Certainly.
But the ends justify the means, and there were no other means.
Removing those high-risk children from jeopardy was my foremost concern.
Even though I sacrificed my own life in the process, I regret nothing.
On the contrary, I may have finally found my reason for becoming a public official.
All that remains now is to establish Solid State as a permanent institution, and to enhance its infrastructure.
But by purging everyone who came in contact with the system one after another, you drew our attention to your plan.
I had not considered how those who were killed must have felt, but like I said, there were no other means.
With Ka Ru-Ma I can understand, but why did you want to eliminate Munei?
Because he intended to keep the children here in detention.
It was pointless to turn them into brainwashed elite cadres, when they could be given a new life of their own.
Although education is important, the children must be allowed free will to make their own choices out in the world.
That is the difference between I and Munei, and the main reason I must eliminate him.
However, this time round, you people intervened.
Still, my tactics seem to be working fairly well to this point, since I have managed to hack directly into your virtually impenetrable cyberbrain from across the plug link.
Major!
You committed suicide just to lure me into connecting?
You are one tough customer, but while I trap you within a thought maze, the rest of Section 9 can easily be dealt with.
Now that's something you don't see everyday.
A rare competent bureaucrat, if an arrogant and self-righteous ass and one who actually knows me.
Who are you, really?
Haven't you figured it out yet, Kusanagi Motoko?
How many arrogant, self-righteous asses do you know?
Until this moment, I was incarnated across a myriad of egos.
Come now, that a collective consciousness can unconsciously begin to act autonomously, is not so hard to believe.
With this, Solid State is established, and I, the vanishing mediator, now move on to the society beyond.
I can't see a thing.
Can someone give me a situation report?
You finally woke up.
Batou, there you are.
How's the situation?
Where am I?
Then, lastly, what do we do with the children?
Hmm... we probably should send them back to their real parents for the time being.
Even though their memories have been altered, and even though we know about their maltreatment at home?
But that may be for the best.
I can't answer that right now - and that decision may be out of our hands anyway.
The kids who found adopted parents before the brainwashing program began, those who that have already left the facility, what is to become of them?
It will be dealt with on a case by case basis.
They'll just have to wait while our complex judicial system comes up with a decision.
Chief, is there anything we can do?
To that, I can only answer that we can only continue struggling within the rules, and hope for the best.
We can only watch and pray that they may one day grow up to achieve their potential and answer the question that we could not.
Solid State system.
Now that I think about it, it really is an ironic name.
He actually used the cyberbrain network formed by those old folks as a transistor to store his own consciousness.
Just like a arrogant bureaucrat to think of such an idea.
Anyway, when we finally identified the Puppeteer, I got the shock of my life.
What do you mean?
It came to light after that guy died and while you were out of it.
In truth, that official has been dead for the past two years.
His name was Koshiki Takaaki, age thirty-three.
Coming from a family of bureaucrats, he was groomed from youth to be a member of the elite cadre.
After graduating from college, he immediately began working for the Ministry of Health.
Perhaps the only reason he became a bureaucrat was because he did not have anything better to do with his life.
Soon afterwards, he began refusing to turn up at the Ministry for work for some reason.
Because he was an information technology prodigy, he received special permission to remote a cybernetic body to work from home.
Eventually, he distinguished himself through his work at the Ministry.
Two years ago, his talent was recognized, and he was reassigned to the Health-Welfare joint project headed by Munei.
He secretly built his own infrastructure into the project sometime during its development.
But here's the thing.
Because he was an such an unobtrusive non-descript fellow who kept to himself, even with all the work that he had done, no one ever found out that he had really died at home from illness.
Thanks to him, the true identity of the Puppeteer will remain forever a mystery.
Are you implying that the guy's remote cybernetic body was used to impersonate him by persons unknown?
Possibly.
Or rather, that is probably the case.
If we consider those old folks, it might also have been a subconscious action taken by their collective consciousness, but we have no way of verifying that now.
I see.
Except for the record of your conversation with Koshiki taken by the Tachikoma.
Do we still have that record?
We should, although for some reason when Koshiki died, the Tachikoma insisted that the record had no further value.
Batou, did you hear the conversation?
Who knows.
At this point, it doesn't really matter, does it?
The old folks, the abused children, both matters are being brought to a resolution.
Although we were unable to unmask the Puppeteer, we can consider this case more or less closed.
This scandal will really hurt those rogue politicians, eh?
I'm mystified, Batou.
In retrospect, what was I thinking back then?
What was I searching for, when I decided to sojourn in the net alone and loitering?
The truth?
My true self?
Or that special someone?
Perhaps I was only projecting the frustration at my own helplessness onto the system.
What?
Are you getting introspective on me now?
You should be satisfied after all that, right?
So, what do you plan to do in the future?
Continue with your lonesome personal-inquiry-for-an-investigation?
I think I've had enough of that.
Although being bound by constraints was tedious, I couldn't bring myself to accept a life free of them.
In the end, it made no difference whatsoever.
Does that mean what I think it does?
Are you thinking of returning to Section 9?
But what about Togusa?
Won't that affect his career?
If his career were so easily stalled, then clearly, this was the furthest his ability would have gotten him anyway.
That's not for you to worry about.
Maybe.
But you know, Batou, the net is indeed vast and infinite.
Soon, the next unimaginable stage of society will begin to take form.
The evacuation of passengers and flight crew has been completed as per the terrorist incident response plan.
All incoming flights are to remain circling outside the airport control zone and await further instructions.
Flights low on fuel are to divert to land at another airport.
305 to 102 -
Public Security Section 9 has arrived.
Please advise.
This is an priority transmission.
Section 9 has been given full authority to direct this operation.
We already have fatalities over here.
Even if that's the arrangement, they should give us some say in how this operation is run.
That's enough.
Recognize your own role.
We do not have the capability to deal with an incident of this type.
Found it.
All outgoing flights have been suspended.
The immigration checkpoint is closed for operations.
According to our preliminary reports, the fugitive is willing to submit to an inspection, ... but when he heard that Public Security was taking charge, he seemed almost... delighted.
Delighted?
I have no idea.
So?
I guess dai-sempai won't be meeting up with us after all?
He said that he was in the middle of another personal inquiry for an investigation.
Indeed, it was thanks to Batou that we could piece together the complete picture from the disjointed clues in this case.
Pazu and Boma, bring another two men to the North Gate.
Understood.
We are storming in from the front.
Yes, sir!
However, you've changed, sempai.
You finally gave up on that Mateba autorevolver of yours.
Not really.
According to our information, Ka Gae-Ru shouldn't be augmented.
Then on the ground there is your proverbial unexpected problem.
In other words, he may have seized the gun.
Even so, it's just a 9mm pistol.
Oh, my.
Colonel Ka Gae-Ru!
This is Public Security.
We can consider allowing you safe passage from the country as you demand.
First let the hostage go, then we can further discuss this.
Colonel Ka Gae-Ru!
Do you hear me?
Ka Gae-Ru!
Put the gun down!
Everyone hold your fire.
Hand the gun over.
Togusa.
That guy appears to have inhaled fast-acting military grade microsteroids.
Understood.
Colonel Ka Gae-Ru!
The Puppeteer is coming
- I don't want to die!
If you don't want to die, then put the goddamn gun down now!
What did you say?
I won't let you take me in!
Stop!
Damn it!
What the hell just happened?
The Puppeteer, huh?
The name's not half bad.
Prime Minister Kayabuki.
Operatives marked with "bon*" character tattoos belonging to Generalissimo Ka Ru-Ma's loyalist group ...
(* The kanji character bon, meaning Buddhist.)
... have been commiting suicide one after another in the country.
Even his eldest son Colonel Ka Gae-Ru has just killed himself.
And yet, you still insist that there is no need to interrogate the Generalissimo?
Regarding Colonel Ka Gae-Ru's death, it has also been reported that it was due to a botched arrest.
Even if we suppose that this is an unspecified terrorist threat by Seok Republic remnants, we can't prove that Generalissimo Ka Ru-Ma, isolated under house arrest, was involved as well.
While the Refugee Naturalization Act is being implemented, please avoid any incidents that may fuel the opposition parties.
It is my understanding that this is why Public Security Section 9 exists.
I understand.
Ishikawa!
Dig up the record of Ka Gae-Ru's confession.
Yes, sir!
We're moving out!
Is this really fine?
We have yet to obtain authorization.
As long as no one finds out that Pandora's Box has been opened, it won't count as breaking faith.
Has any new evidence been discovered at the scene?
No, not yet.
Find witnesses concerning the victim's...
Batou!
Do you hear me, Batou?
I hear you.
Where are you right now?
I'm over at the thirteenth tattooed man's place.
Another suicide?
Yeah.
This place looks similar to our safehouses.
It's likely that this was just one of their dens.
Leave that end to the prefectural police.
Bring a subordinate down to check out this location.
A hideout revealed by Ka Gae-Ru himself in his confession.
Oh?
But isn't such mainstream work more Togusa's province?
Togusa and I are heading to the enemy's main headquarters.
I see.
Togusa.
How long has it been since the Major left Section 9?
Almost two years now, I think.
It's been that long...
I must deeply apologise for the Ka Gae-Ru incident.
That couldn't be helped.
This case could deal Prime Minister Kayabuki a fatal setback.
She probably wishes to suppress any bad publicity.
But wasn't it Prime Minister Kabayuki herself, concerned that the Six Powers Pact would object to her Refugee Naturalization Act, who had Ka Ru-Ma placed under house arrest as a bargaining chip, sparking off this whole fiasco?
That's because Generalissimo Ka Ru-Ma, before seeking asylum in Japan, had once threatened to launch retaliatory acts of terrorism.
That at the moment of his death, he would visit terror upon the entire world.
Is this the oath of vengeance mentioned in his Seok dissolution speech?
Isn't it our job to find that out and prepare countermeasures?
Although we don't know how he sends out his orders from isolation, we need only to capture Ka Ru-Ma himself to break the case and bring the truth to light.
The problem right now is - how far along is this terrorist plan of his?
Chief.
The Coast Guard report that they have cleared the airspace along the route.
Right.
Thank them, then prepare to land immediately.
Remember to alter the flight records.
Yes, sir!
No firearms or knives detected.
Clear!
Proto.
Turn the power on and lift the blind.
Roger.
What's the matter?
Chief.
Hmm?
It looks like he did himself in.
This looks bad.
This guy killing himself could mean that his plan has already been set into motion.
That thing is... ?
A healthcare monitoring network terminal.
Simply put, it's a device to exchange medical data with a medical establishment.
It was rumored that Ka Ru-Ma was suffering from serious health problems before he went into exile.
Looks like the rumor was true.
Still, I can't believe that the government is oblivious to Ka Ru-Ma's death.
Hmm?
Bingo!
This guy planted a backdoor in the system.
Looks look he was a smarter-than-your-average-dictator.
Looks like it.
The log records his communications with his associates.
Although we need to bring this back to the lab for analysis, there's no doubt that at one time he was attempting to use a micromachine virus to carry out terrorist attacks.
What do you mean by "at one time"?
Back when his operatives were beginning to kill themselves off one after another, they once discussed with Ka Gae-Ru whether or not to suspend the plan.
What does that mean?
In other words, their commiting suicide did not in any way mark the beginning of their plan?
I'm not sure.
However, what puzzles me is that a program that made it seem as if Ka Ru-Ma were still alive was installed by an outside intruder.
At this time, the administration probably still doesn't know the truth about his death.
An assassination disguised as a suicide?
Yeah.
By someone who didn't want the administration to know that Ka Ru-Ma had already been taken out of the picture, perhaps.
What about the micromachine virus?
It seems to have been delivered to a certain Ma Sha-Ba.
If Batou isn't slacking off, he should be retrieving it any time now.
Togusa.
What's this, then?
"The Puppeteer"?
Azuma, just before Ka Gae-Ru died, didn't he also mention something about about "The Puppeteer"?
What if he did?
The log contains references to "The Puppeteer" as well.
The term appears to designate one of their associates.
Looks like we have to apprehend Ma Sha-Ba quickly.
Make a copy of the log, then rendezvous with Batou.
We must uncover the full scope of their plan at all cost.
What do we do with the corpse?
Leave everything as it was.
Regretfully, we were never here.
Yes, sir.
A clinic?
What's a nice car like you doing in a dump like this?
Pretty hefty security system...
Go flank in from the other side!
Acknowledged.
What?
There's no way for you to hack my cyberbrain in here.
Die, Puppeteer!
Over there?
Batou?
That's... ?
Dodge!
You dumbass!
Until I get back, play dead.
Acknowledged.
Halt!
Major？
It's been a while, Batou.
What are you doing here?
I knew it.
I might ask you the same question.
Call it conducting a personal inquiry for an investigation.
It's coming!
Wait.
What the...
Hold this a moment.
Isn't this...
Ma Sha-Ba?
It appears that you know quite a bit.
Know quite a bit... ?
Hey, what exactly are you up to?
Who knows?
I'll be having that back.
I see that you've changed your taste in cars.
When did she... ?
But this one's not bad either.
Batou, I'm guessing that you're here to investigate the serial suicides of those tattooed men.
A word to the wise, stay away from the Solid State society, or you'll end up killing yourself just like them.
You'll have to find your own ride.
Did I not order you to bring a subordinate along?
That's why I brought that tincan with me.
We came too late.
Ma Sha-Ba's already dead.
The cause of death?
He suffered a fatal concussion when he lost control of the robot and crashed.
It looks like Ma Sha-Ba wasn't the Puppeteer after all.
Batou, why did he come at you with that thing?
Who knows?
That's what I would have liked to ask him.
Perhaps he attacked you because he mistook you for the Puppeteer?
Hey, what is this Puppeteer you keep mentioning?
At present, the hypothesis is that it may be the codename for a suspect who may have caused the deaths of the tattooed men and Ka Ru-Ma by hacking into their cyberbrains and forcing them to kill themselves.
Judging from his skill, he might be a hacker surpassing wizard class.
Wizard class...
Chief.
We've found out what Ka Ru-Ma's plan for terror was.
What was it?
You should come over and see for yourself.
Ka Ru-Ma intended to implant micromachines into these children in order to disseminate a virus.
What the hell?
This isn't a retaliation plan, this is utter inhumanity!
Sooner or later, Section 9 will probably track me back to this place.
Loki, Conan, I leave the rest to you.
It seems that I can only handle at most two concurrent cybernetic bodies.
The only way left may be to wipe and retrain them from scratch.
I see.
We've even tried natural oil.
However, due to the different subjects, we were unable to achieve results of the same degree.
You're still concerned over the development of these guys?
Africa was much tougher than I had expected.
Even with upgraded augmentations, I'm still exhausted.
Further implants could mess up your cardiopulmonary function, you know.
Can't be helped.
It's an occupational hazard.
Togusa and you, I really take my hat off to you guys.
From the roster we found at the scene, the operatives involved in the plan include :
the thirteen suicides, Ka Gae-Ru, Ma Sha-Ba, and a certain Raj Poot.
In all, sixteen people.
Who is this Raj Poot?
Could he be the Puppeteer?
It appears that he is not yet in the country.
The communications log would also indicate this.
Not many people would stick with a leader who insisted that they follow him to the grave.
Such is often the sorry end of dictators.
But there were actually sixteen people, huh...
You're late, Batou!
Oh？
When did you get back?
Just now.
Azuma!
Please carry on.
Moving on.
Lieutenant?
Regarding the missing micromachine virus:
A case containing 144 ampoules containing a genetically modified organic virus has been brought into the country, a biological weapon with a time delayed mechanism.
And this hot potato has vanished into thin air.
Batou.
Are you certain that you didn't run into anyone else at Ma Sha-Ba's clinic?
Yeah.
And there was no sign of anyone who might have caused the robot to go out of control?
Nope.
I see.
What exactly are you trying to ask here?
Ah, nevermind...
Actually, we still haven't traced the owner of that smashed car.
Isn't it possible that it was stolen?
From the look of the car security system installed, I would say no.
Furthermore, the surveillance camera footage was somehow partially erased.
This seems to indicate that someone else was present at the scene.
By someone else, you mean the Puppeteer?
Perhaps.
Although Ka Ru-Ma's plan was never implemented, but there is a possibility that this hacker called the Puppeteer may commit independent acts of terror.
While we are tracking down the micromachine ampoules, we also need to focus on investigating this Puppeteer.
Yes, sir!
Togusa.
What do I do?
Go take a break.
Individual body maintenance should take precedence.
Understood.
I'll do that, then.
By the way, Batou?
This morning the Chief had a talk with me and said that it's about time for you to choose your next assignment.
Would you rather concentrate on your duties as training officer, or participate in the Puppeteer investigation under my direction?
It's your call.
Which will it be?
Isn't it obvious?
The Puppeteer, of course.
I see.
Did you find anything?
Yeah, we hit paydirt.
Let's have it.
Firstly, medical examination of the sixteen children reveal no sign of their having been implanted with micromachines at all.
Although suffering from dehydration and injuries from maltreatment, basically, they're fairly healthy.
However, the sixteen of them have had their memories partially erased, and their personal IDs altered to assign them fake parents.
They could remember their names and addresses, but as far as their parents were concerned, they had not the slightest recollection.
Furthermore, upon investigation, the addresses given by them turned out to be residences of old folks living alone.
Could those old folks actually be their parents?
No.
From a granny living in a four-and-a-half-tatami flat, to the rich old codger who could afford personal nursing support robots, there were all sorts, but without exception, all were "Kifu* Aged" hooked up to the healthcare monitoring network.
(* kifu, meaning noble rot.)
Obviously, there was no sign whatsoever that they had ever lived with children.
Although the household registrations list them as the parents, most likely, these records were doctored.
What's a "Kifu Aged"?
It refers to the bedridden elderly connected to an automated monitoring system which tends to their basic healthcare needs, just like noble-rot infested grapes withering away on the vine.
That's where the name comes from.
This system was originally developed to deal with the problem of an aging population, and at the same time, prevent old folks living alone from dying unnoticed in their homes.
Unexpectedly, connecting to the network instead rendered its users comatose.
The LPO slammed it as the "vegetable legacy retrieval system".
You're pretty well-informed.
The old bags at the parlor often chat with me about it.
It's sort of like an economy model of the terminal Ka Ru-Ma had.
Wait a minute.
Wasn't it Ka Gae-Ru's intent to make human bombs out of the children?
Why then did he specifically erase their memories of their parents?
Rather than planting them somewhere after infecting them with the virus, would it not have been simpler to erase their memories of the abductions, and send them back to their parents?
How should I know?
That's true.
They even had cyberbrains specially implanted.
It really is too extravagant.
Actually, the implants seem to have been performed prior to the abductions.
The transform components also appear to be legit.
In that case, there should be records of the implants at the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.
A guardian is required to sign off on the procedure before it can be performed on a six year old.
There were 144 missing ampoules.
To be on the safe side, let's check this out.
Try and find if there are any matching children in the records.
Assuming that those sixteen kids we rescued had their implants done through through legitimate channels, their records would have been automatically registered with the Ministry of Health's database.
If they were abducted and had their household records doctored after the implants had been registered, the number of children with cyberbrain implants listed in the Ministry of Internal Affairs' resident registry should conflict with the number of such children registered with the Ministry of Health's database.
Now I see.
Since those sixteen had their family names altered to match those of the elderly invalids, in theory this should work.
Twenty thousand?
There must be some kind of mistake.
If children were being abducted in such vast numbers, surely someone would have noticed by now.
True.
In any case, this figure far exceeds anything we ever expected.
What now?
Let's start by eliminating the impossible.
First, sort the list of extraneous children in the data by name and address.
Leave that to me, I'll be done in a sec.
A trap?
!
This is an emergency warning.
Presence of a Level E class virus has been confirmed.
Please shutdown all machines immediately.
Emergency warning...
Emergency warning...
Level E class virus...
Please shutdown all machines...
Engaging emergency server lockdown...
It's no use, the system is not accepting commands.
Hiragi, Soma, backup the data now!
We can't, it's already been infected!
Our only option is to cut the power!
Help me out.
Was the virus embedded in the Ministry of Internal Affairs database?
We've lost the data on that end.
Is the data from the Ministry of Health intact?
Yes, but why?
Out of the way!
Right now, it must be buzzing like an overturned beehive over at the Ministry of Internal Affairs as well.
Dammit!
We just chopped away our best lead.
In any case, it seems now that there must actually have been twenty thousand abductions, huh?
What do you mean?
Normally, twenty thousand is an implausible number of abductions for Ka Gae-Ru's outfit to have pulled off.
The perpetrator's modus operandi is also too amateurish for it to have been the work of the Puppeteer.
We need only look at the facts of the abductions - the discrepancies due to the tampering of the household registrations is like a big sign saying "I nabbed them, come and find me!"
I can't help but think that the Puppeteer has some other purpose in mind.
I agree with your point of view.
Chief.
This case was dropped off at the Ministry of Health's Pathogenic Microbes Repository Unit.
Subsequent analysis proved that it was indeed the Seok manufactured micromachine virus.
This proves that the information we gathered was right on the money.
Do we know who dropped the case off?
There were no records whatsoever of when the case was dropped off, nor any footage of the courier.
Could this could be the Puppeteer?
That's possible.
If so, what is the Puppeteer's motive in all this, if not to commit acts of terror?
From the looks of it, this Puppeteer might be a hacker working for some governmental agency or other.
I was bewildered by the elaborate coverup of Ka Ru-Ma's death.
After some digging of my own, I discovered that Prime Minister Kabayuki and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had canceled a volatile conference on the threat posed by him.
In other words, Ka Ru-Ma, the thorn in the administration's side, had already been dealt with by the hacker employed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as far as they were concerned.
At present, that would seem to be the situation, yes.
If so, maybe we should write this mass abduction thing off as a bluff after all.
Which section was responsible for this?
This case carries great international significance.
Considering the events that have occurred to this point, our stance on the matter should be similar to that of the administration.
I believe that we should leave well alone on this matter.
Therefore, concentrate on establishing the identities of those sixteen children.
Put the Puppeteer investigation on hold for now.
That is all.
Aw, geez.
All that work for nothing, and a huge mess to clean up.
We at least have to help those kids find their parents quickly.
I'm just setting off now.
Sorry about that.
I have a question.
What is it?
Was it the Treaties Bureau that made an old warhorse like you back off from the case?
About that?
I cut a deal with Nakamura.
I turn a blind eye on their covert operations, and in return, we get a free hand to investigate the matter of this micromachine virus.
And that is fine?
If purging Ka Ru-Ma was required for the good of the country, surely we should be dismayed that we were passed over for this vital task?
What, then, was the point of you expanding Section 9 over these past two years, old timer?
If we keep going like this, she won't come back.
Whether being passed over for an assassination order should bring regret or rejoicing, that question may determine what direction the Section will go in the future.
I know what you are trying to say, but we must also consider the possibility that the Major may never return.
Her talent is more precious to me than even an esper's.
In truth, no one can ever live up to her.
Likewise, it's impossible for me to stick around at this post forever.
Therefore, instead of having to expend all of our strength to crack one case,
I would rather build an organisation where we can use an eighth of our strength to crack three cases.
Don't you think that, in this way, we can better carry on our ideals?
This was what I had in mind when I expanded Section 9.
Promoting Togusa to squad leader was also part of this process.
Though, if you had been willing to accept the post at the time, things might be entirely different now.
I'm not suitable for that position.
If you say so.
That might even be true.
But not for Togusa.
Even so, in order for his potential to flourish, he must learn to overcome adversity.
I hope that you can help him along.
I thought as much.
But he's done quite well, actually.
Much like the Major, he's always fair and balanced, whether at home or at work.
For the sake of Section 9, he's even discussed cybernization with his family.
But gaining the acceptance of another is hard to do.
Indeed, I myself have not been able to gain that.
We haven't had a good long talk like this for a while now.
Looks like I won't be coming home tonight, either.
That can't be helped.
You have heavy responsibilities at work now.
Have the kids been good?
Yeah.
But last week our girl asked to sleep on her own in her room.
It's been calm, but I do kind of miss the sibling fights.
Really?
She's a big girl now.
Oh course!
She's already six.
Six, huh?
Snap a picture of her asleep and send it to me, will you?
Sure.
Togusa, we have an situation!
Get over to Area 47 right now!
What happened?
Sempai, I'm sorry, all the children...
They had all gone missing by the time I got here.
Is this the same thing that happened with Ka Gae-Ru?
Looks like it.
The Puppeteer...
If Proto had really wanted to kill himself, he could have pulled the trigger anytime.
This is nothing but a ploy to stall for time!
Ishikawa, Boma!
Use the IR system to locate the children immediately!
Given our current situation, that may have limited use.
At the same time, request support from the prefectural police.
Bring Proto over to the analysis lab.
Togusa, we need to talk!
Later!
Right now, we need to find the missing kids!
This is important!
I may have some insight into the Puppeteer's identity!
It's Aramaki.
Thank you.
You're late.
Sorry, I was delayed by work.
Colonel Tonoda, how's your health?
Back to his old hobby, I see.
Cut the man some slack already.
They say that his health problems arose from the psychological stress of his time in the penitentiary.
What's with Tsujisaki?
He didn't drop by even once.
And to think that I favoured him the most.
He's forgotten me, the ingrate!
His memory seems to be going as well.
Step out for a moment.
I have something for you.
So ends the legendary Akaoni Poacher in ignominy.
You should consider marrying again.
Tragic is the fate of lonely old men.
I have no desire for something that I can't bring with me to the grave.
The same old retort, I see.
So, what is it that you have for me?
Right, take this.
Actually, I ran into the Major back at Ma Sha-Ba's clinic.
The Major... ?
It couldn't be... ?
I didn't think it was possible at first as well, but now I'm getting increasingly worried that she might actually be the Puppeteer.
I missed my chance to speak up earlier.
Did you see her do Ma Sha-Ba in?
No, but I did see her take the case of ampoules.
Previously, I would intervene every time we crossed paths with the Major during an investigation.
I've always assumed that she, in her own way, was there to guide us along to break the case.
But it's different this time.
Exactly what does the Major intend?
That I don't know.
But even odds are, the Major was present at the scene of those suspected assassinations.
Batou.
Hurry to Daikyuu ring highway No. 16 with Saito immediately.
This is a matter of utmost priority!
Chief, we have a situation here as well.
The Puppeteer has turned up at Section 9.
What did you say?
Old timer, the Puppeteer appears to...
Let's not jump to conclusions.
I want to confirm this for myself.
Chief.
Since that fellow moved preemptively against us, can we further pursue this matter?
Since that's the case, carry on.
Roger that.
What happened on your side?
Two hours ago, surveillance cameras in the Engan area happened to pick up the image of a known international criminal.
Hmm?
Who would that be?
He sounds formidable, if you need me and Saito to take him down together.
A former Seok Republic class A+ sniper Lieutenant Raj Poot.
Raj Poot？
That's...
That last man who was not yet in the country?
He was head of Ka Ru-Ma's personal bodyguard.
It's believed that he fled to China after Seok was dissolved.
For him to take to the stage at this point is mighty suspicious.
Fortunately, the Intelligence Division has managed to pinpoint his current whereabouts.
The two of you shadow him and try to discover what he is up to.
Roger that.
Togusa, if the Major is the Puppeteer, then she has become our enemy.
I don't even want to think about that.
One of these days, I will return this favor.
Colonel Tonoda, I take my leave of you for today.
Like father, like son...
Like man, like robot...
You didn't turn out to be anything like me.
It is gratifying to know that a phoenix can fledge from an old crow's nest.
Do take care of your health.
Thank you.
Colonel, you take care as well.
How will that guy take out his target?
Like me, he will use his Hawkeye to acquire the target through real-time satellite imaging before taking the shot.
In that case, there will come a point when our GPS tracker will fail due to the inteference caused by the Hawkeye satellite downlink.
We need to apprehend him before that happens.
Got that.
Let's visually confirm the target.
Be sure not to alert him.
Target confirmed.
There's no mistake, it's him alright.
Togusa.
The IR system has located one of the missing children.
Really?
Where?
He's moving through a small construction lot in Kohoku Park.
That's near my place.
Right.
I'll check it out.
I'll inform the prefectural police as well.
Meanwhile, we'll return to investigating the twenty thousand child abductions.
I see.
Damn.
I guess I'll have to put this matter of the Major aside for now.
The Puppeteer, I presume?
I don't really need to ask, no?
Public Security Section 9 just called to inquire if I knew a hacker called the Puppeteer.
I told them I didn't.
So, you were looking for me?
I've come to refund your fee.
It doesn't matter to us whether you actually had anything to do with it or not - your mission objective was achieved.
I regret to say that this is the end.
I am going now.
Leave some way to contact you over the net, then.
Anything will do.
Was this was a puppet too?
What a waste.
Her talent and skill were outstanding.
It'll be daybreak soon.
I wonder why he even bothered turning up now when their plan is already in shambles?
Perhaps to avenge Ka Ru-Ma's death?
That sounds plausible, but how in the world did he get a hold of that intelligence?
Even we were almost left in the dark about that.
That's true.
How long does he intend to keep driving around, anyway?
Speaking of which, look over there.
That's...
Togusa.
The boy has entered apartment no. 602 of block M-26.
You know the way?
Yeah.
I know this neighborhood like the back of my hand.
A "Kifu Aged"?
Return him to me!
I've left all my assets to the child.
I'd rather have him as my heir than forfeit it all to the government.
The poor thing would just have ended up being abused to death, if we had done nothing.
This is the common resolve of all the residents of Solid State, our little game - nay, our grand enterprise.
Do not meddle in our affairs, if you wish to avoid becoming yet another suicide.
You have been warned.
My gut feeling tells me that his target is somewhere over there.
Turn off the cyberbrain, then help him find a guardian.
Yes, sir.
Death has been confirmed.
Requesting permission to dispose of the remains and retrieve the system terminal.
Dispose?
That's strange.
Didn't he have family?
Our data indicates that he should have a six year old son.
A mistake in the records?
Oh joy.
Even more work for us.
A mistake in the records?
No, that's not it.
That's only because I rescued him.
Which means that, but for my intervention, those social workers would have found and taken the boy into protection as planned.
The suicides of those operatives.
The missing children.
"Kifu Aged".
The common resolve of all the residents of Solid State.
No, what is this Solid State in the first place?
What did that old man mean?
It's me.
Thank goodness I finally got through, please hurry home, our girl's gone missing!
This is it.
Now!
Wait!
Damn, therm-optic camouflage?
How did this happen?
I've been cut off from the GPS system.
The Puppeteer?
But my kid doesn't have a cyberbrain!
I need you to trace which satellite that bastard is using.
Since we've lost visual contact, our one and only chance to stop him will be the moment before he takes the shot.
I might be able to trace the satellite, but how do we stop him?
That should is his field of fire.
From up here, we should have line of sight to his sniping point, although he will spot us easily as well.
Wear this, or you'll be exposed.
There's no time, our opponent is about to act.
We play to win.
It's begun.
Done!
Send it.
That's his target?
The satellite tracks him at SE37.
There he is.
Drop the link before it feeds back!
He's on to us!
Saito!
Did I nail him?
Wait here, I'll go confirm.
Come on, come on...
Huh?
Papa!
How is it?
Have some faith in yourself.
I see.
Hey, who was that man you were trying to off?
Why were you trying to kill him?
To avenge the Generalissimo, I will kill every last one of you Jap motherfuckers!
Avenge?
Don't fuck around with me!
Now, what was the source of your intel?
A mole turned it over to me.
He told me who was behind the Generalissimo's death, so that I could cap the bitch.
And does this mole have a name?
A representative named Munei Ito who frequents the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Old timer, have this Munei fellow taken into custody immediately.
Also, this is an image of Raj's intended target.
Looks like he was the mastermind behind Ka Ru-Ma's assassination.
Eh?
Unless I'm mistaken, that man is Munei Ito.
How could this be?
Your informant is the exact same guy you were trying to kill!
God knows.
Maybe he was suicidal or something.
Suicidal... ?
Hey, could it be that the Puppeteer set you up as well?
Fuck.
You may just be right.
Were he only human, I'd take that bastard out first of all.
Instead, I got myself taken out by a superior foe.
The Puppeteer is not human?
It's an abduction infrastructure built into Solid State.
Solid State?
Hey, what does that mean?
You don't know?
That is to say, the healthcare monitoring network.
The government of your so-called democratic country takes part in child abductions.
What a farce.
Old timer, dispatch a paramedic team and helicopter over to this place.
Also, run a background check on this Munei.
This is too weird.
I understand.
Then, I found her just after calling you.
It seems like she went over to the neighbor's place in the morning.
Is that so?
Thank goodness it turned out to be nothing.
You shouldn't run off by yourself without telling Mama the next time.
Yeah.
Well then, I'll send you to school.
I feel a bit guilty about heading right back to work like this.
Is that alright?
You look exhausted to me.
I'm invigorated just by seeing your faces.
Really?
That's great.
See ya!
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing.
Togusa!
I've bagged Raj Poot over here.
The Puppeteer appears to be involved as well.
You mean... the Major?
Yeah, but as it turns out, the Major is most likely not the Puppeteer.
Raj Poot claims that the Puppeteer is an abduction infrastructure built into the healthcare monitoring system.
Abduction infrastructure?
He referred to the healthcare monitoring network as "Solid State", and insinuated that our government was mixed up in this somehow.
Back when I ran into the Major, she had actually warned me to stay away from the Solid State society.
Initially, I had thought that "Solid State" was a reference to "soshi*", ...
(* The kanji characters for electronic element can also be read as motoko, the Major's name..)
... in other words, to stay away from the Major herself.
(* The kanji characters for electronic element can also be read as motoko, the Major's name..)
But in fact, she was telling us to stay away from the healthcare monitoring network.
Ka Ru-Ma and company were most likely purged because they discovered the infrastructure, and tried to use it for their own ends.
So that's how it is.
It's from Mama.
Hold for a moment.
Hello?
You ignored our warning.
Who is this!
For that, we will take your adorable daughter.
Togusa!
Togusa!
Ishikawa, can you pinpoint Togusa's present location?
Eh?
Not a problem, what's wrong?
Togusa's cyberbrain's been hacked into!
Papa, we're going the wrong way.
You're the Puppeteer?
Why are you abducting all those children?
Where have twenty thousand kids vanished to?
We only wish to utilize resources that have slipped through the net of society.
Soon, you will experience this for yourself.
Batou!
I've found Togusa's present location.
The Cyberbrain Implant Hospital in Kohoku Ward.
Now I get it.
You could get the implant performed without arousing any suspicions if you made a parent bring his child down to the hospital himself.
Erase the child's memories, send her over to an elderly invalid's home, and the abduction is complete.
Afterwards, you'd only need to alter my memories to make me think that I had lost her.
Don't feel too bad about getting your memories altered.
In today's world, the incidence of such cases are already more common than, say, traffic accidents.
You're offering me one last alternative?
That's the place!
I won't let you take my daughter.
Listen, will you do as Papa says?
Start running as fast as you can when Papa lets go of your hand.
Run?
That's right.
There will be a loud bang, just like at the school sports meet.
Once you hear that, run that way and keep running.
Don't stop, and don't ever look back.
Can you do that?
Yeah.
Good girl.
Close your eyes.
I'm so sorry.
Goodbye.
Togusa!
I love you.
TOGUSA!
Max, Musashi!
It's OK, everything's fine.
Major!
I must apologize for holding off until the last moment to save you.
Major, you're not the Puppeteer?
Where were you all this time?
Papa!
Wandering on the net alone after leaving Section 9, I came across this unconventional case by chance.
Eventually I found out about the abductions, and began my own investigation into the matter.
I can't believe that you actually used Togusa as bait!
Didn't you stop to think that you might be endangering his family as well?
I set him up with safeguards, of course.
Thanks to him, we can finally unmask the Puppeteer.
Isn't the Puppeteer just a system built into the healthcare monitoring network?
Rather than a system, I would call it a collective consciousness formed by the elderly invalids hooked up to the network.
However, there must also exist a hub cyberbrain who integrated them in the first place.
A hub cyberbrain?
Hey, isn't that...
The data from my network trace being extracted from Togusa's cyberbrain.
Ah, Batou!
Long time no see!
You're looking well!
Good to see that you've been taking care of yourself.
The elderly monitoring system has contained a backdoor function ever since it was designed.
Look.
This is the full scope of the rhizome formed by the collective consciousness of those elderly invalids in the network.
There is no concept of a center in a rhizome, therefore the hub has no fixed position within the rhizome, or rather, the rhizome itself is constantly in flux.
I get the idea, but who does that hub cyberbrain belong to?
Max, Musashi, report your findings.
Well?
Ah, how do I put this...
You failed?
b..but we managed to locate his current whereabouts.
And where would that be?
The complex grounds of the Seishomin* Welfare Center which takes charge of the elderly monitoring system.
(* seishomin, meaning "Sacred Citizen".)
The personnel have arrived.
Releasing locks.
It's been a while, Major.
Indeed.
Though I wish it could have been under happier circumstances.
Why did you change your mind and return?
We'll talk about that later.
Right now, our priority should be to catch the Puppeteer.
Munei Ito, member of the Diet's House of Representatives.
Finding out why he was marked for death is our one key to uncover the Puppeteer's identity.
Munei has long been an advocate of a racially pure Japan, a reactionary conservative nationalist.
He frequents the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and has close ties with the Treaties Bureau.
He participated in the plan to assassinate Ka Ru-Ma.
Major, you mean...
I had a contract with the Treaties Bureau to covertly assassinate Ka Ru-Ma, but the Puppeteer got there first.
So you were only responsible for the subsequent coverup?
That's more or less it.
We also discovered that Munei instigated an management reshuffle at the Seishomin Welfare Center in order to solidify his control over the facility.
How will that benefit him?
Isn't this a welfare facility that provides elderly healthcare monitoring and vocational training?
Right.
But several rogue politicians are using it as a front for something entirely different.
In actual fact, he is using his cover as treasurer to run a power elite education project.
In other words, a glorified brainwashing facility.
So this is what Raj Poot meant about government involvement.
If the Puppeteer was using this place as a temporary holding center for the abducted children, then Munei turning it into a brainwashing facility would pose a problem for him.
Chief.
How about we conduct a forced search?
Finding the children should be our top priority,
But conducting a raid will cause a scandal.
When that happens, those shitty politicians won't be the only ones whose asses get toasted.
Ishikawa, how's the situation?
Is that the Major?
Geez, you could have turned up sooner.
Although we've verified the receipt of a massive quantity of components that may have been used to construct HC-25 brainwashing devices, that alone is insufficient evidence to justify a raid.
What about images from the inside?
I could only obtain footage from the workshop zone.
The education zone is protected by a firewall in the form of complex barrier maze.
It looks to be completely impenetrable.
There are only refugees here.
The abducted children are being held in the education zone, then?
That can only mean that this facility was built with the abduction infrastructure in place from the start.
If not, it's hard to imagine that a politician would dare to introduce such an audacious policy.
You mean to say that the Puppeteer have must have been one of the system designers behind this project?
Ishikawa, prepare the decoder for an attempt to hack through the barrier maze.
I'll make the dive.
If worse come to worst, Section 9 can carry on so long as you and Togusa remain.
Batou.
I absolutely refuse to hear such talk from you.
Are you implying that you'll be retiring as well after this?
I appreciate your sentiments, but I only came here to unmask the Puppeteer.
It's true that we may need to hang someone out to dry this time, and at this point, I have nothing left to lose.
Chief.
It's unfortunate, but I say we raid them.
The Puppeteer is waiting for a chance to eliminate Munei.
I do not wish to see this opportunity slip us by.
But how are we going to pick out the Puppeteer?
At this point, we still have yet to determine his identity.
Leave that to my ghost's whisper.
Woo!
It feels great!
Hi!
Long time no see, everyone!
Here goes.
Move out!
As I thought, nothing beats the thrill of racing along in a physical body again.
Really?
My joints seem a bit creaky though.
Look like another intrusion like before, but something feels different this time.
In any case, secure the perimeter.
Understood.
Professionals like us, huh?
In that case let's get to know each other a bit.
Another hacking attempt by the Investigations section?
What a complete waste of effort.
Let's do an inspection before we leave.
Pazu and Boma, secure our route of withdrawal.
Roger that.
Who are you people?
Why would you want to know?
I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
Huh?
The comms were cut off.
Security cyborgs incoming.
Major, go on ahead.
The one who went in is done for.
Go after those still outside.
Understood.
They opened fire without any warning.
So this place really is a highly sensitive government front.
He's coming after us.
Over there will be fine.
No heat signatures or shadows a Kyo-Re cloaking device?
That means...
Your information is antiquated.
They don't refer to the Model 3302 as a cloaking device anymore.
Finish them.
Roger!
Back me up.
I've almost taken control of the system.
Leave it to me.
Hasn't it always been this way?
Togusa, where are you now?
Major.
I'm currently approaching the roof via the outer wall.
Good.
Carry on and rendezvous with the Chief on the roof.
I've located the children.
Let's go!
Representative Munei, this is Public Security Section 9.
We have already verified the situation here.
It seems we have no choice but to insist on a full scale search of this facility.
Public Security?
Although not under its official auspices, this is a vital facility for the nation.
How dare you Public Security people come barging in here with your overinflated sense of justice!
Representative.
Even so, it is clear from the situation here that it is our job to intervene in such matters.
For a public official, you do not seem to be able to comprehend the crisis facing our nation right now.
If we carry on as we are, in the near future, our nation's prosperity will be displaced by that of foreigners.
To prevent this from occurring, we are investing in this education program for these wards of the state, entrusting our nation's future to them.
Is there anything wrong with that?
The funding for this investment wouldn't happen to have been procured through the exploitation of those elderly invalids and refugees in your care, would it?
That couldn't be helped.
Just think, what have they ever done for this country?
They never started a family, or raised children, and are themselves exempt from taxation.
Selfishly wasting away their lives, and then expecting us to take care of them in their dotage.
What a shameless lot.
If it were up to me, I would even lay a tax on them to make up for the loss to the state caused by their being no longer fit for the workforce.
This is nothing but rhetoric.
What, then, have politicians like you ever done for this country either?
Indulging in egotism, and placing political self-preservation above the needs of others.
Who was responsible for ignoring such social problems until things came to a head?
I am proud to say that I, for my own part , have always been conscientious towards my duties.
Even if it infringes upon human rights, and violates cyberbrain ethics?
That is an unfortunate but necessary sacrifice.
You really are a bloody-minded fellow.
Major. we've verified the number of the children being held here.
It's nowhere near twenty thousand, at most three thousand kids.
Is that right?
Switch over to autistic mode.
Roger that.
Representative.
Did you know that the system in this center has been automatically abducting children?
These children aren't orphans.
A large proportion of them have been abducted.
It was our investigation into the abductions that led us here, therefore, you are an important witness in this case.
Although I was the director of this project, this is the first I've heard of such a bug in the system!
In that case, allow us to question the system designers involved.
It was I.
It was I who designed the core principles behind the Solid State system.
Togusa, take the lot of them into custody!
Yes, ma'am!
Batou, before this guy's memories vanish, I want to dive into his cyberbrain.
Back me up!
Going manual!
Batou, are you reading his signal?
Yeah.
I'll amplify the output.
I see the memory unit, but the signal strength is dropping fast.
Batou, can you amplify his output signal any further?
I'll get a Tachikoma to help.
You disengage for now.
There's no time for that.
Do you see me, Puppeteer?
Do you see me, Puppeteer?
Puppeteer?
I mean the hub cyberbrain who integrated the rhizome of the "Kifu Aged".
Hub?
His visual signal has dropped out...
We're losing him...
Hey, what's wrong?
Batou, I'm routing his audio signal over to my speech center.
I should offer you my thanks.
This has gone far enough, disengage now!
Munei posed the greatest obstacle to Solid State.
I have considered purging him myself many times, but the problem was that the man is a luddite who eschews the use of cyberbrain technology.
Who are you?
What was your motive in abducting those children?
Who I am is not important.
As for my motive, perhaps it is not that different from Munei Ito's.
This country has reached the stage where we must take drastic measures in order to shift it from its doomed course.
The problem of the more than six million so-called "Kifu Aged", the rising unemployment rate in contrast with the shrinking able working population, and the low birth rate.
There is no end to the issues that need to be dealt with.
Did you know that even in this society so plagued by a low birth rate, annually no less than fifty thousand children die needlessly before they reach the age of six?
A full thirty percent of these can be attributed to domestic violence and abuse...
Well?
Can you do it?
... another eighty percent...
I can try.
... another eighty percent...
Even if the counselors, police, or other relevant authorities are are made aware of the situation, they are powerless to prevent it.
The social welfare system has failed them.
And so the potential of these children is lost to us.
Major!
If you keep this up, he'll take your consciousness with him when he dies.
Therefore?
Therefore I have focused on gathering and recycling these inadvertently misplaced resources.
I look for children listed on the abuse watchlist network as living in high-risk homes, and change their household registrations in order to give them a new life.
This is the core principle behind the Solid State system?
Correct.
Of course, aiding the "Kifu Aged" was also an indispensable goal.
They were desperately seeking their own raison d'etre.
Although they were unable to leave behind genetic progenies to inherit their DNA, at least they were able to leave successors for posterity, so that their assets would not be escheated to the state.
Furthermore, they were offered an opportunity to achieve something greater by participating in this grand enterprise.
Needless to say, they were elated, and agreed to join my cause.
You realize that this is criminal conspiracy?
Certainly.
But the ends justify the means, and there were no other means.
Removing those high-risk children from jeopardy was my foremost concern.
Even though I sacrificed my own life in the process, I regret nothing.
On the contrary, I may have finally found my reason for becoming a public official.
All that remains now is to establish Solid State as a permanent institution, and to enhance its infrastructure.
But by purging everyone who came in contact with the system one after another, you drew our attention to your plan.
I had not considered how those who were killed must have felt, but like I said, there were no other means.
With Ka Ru-Ma I can understand, but why did you want to eliminate Munei?
Because he intended to keep the children here in detention.
It was pointless to turn them into brainwashed elite cadres, when they could be given a new life of their own.
Although education is important, the children must be allowed free will to make their own choices out in the world.
That is the difference between I and Munei, and the main reason I must eliminate him.
However, this time round, you people intervened.
Still, my tactics seem to be working fairly well to this point, since I have managed to hack directly into your virtually impenetrable cyberbrain from across the plug link.
Major!
You committed suicide just to lure me into connecting?
You are one tough customer, but while I trap you within a thought maze, the rest of Section 9 can easily be dealt with.
Now that's something you don't see everyday.
A rare competent bureaucrat, if an arrogant and self-righteous ass and one who actually knows me.
Who are you, really?
Haven't you figured it out yet, Kusanagi Motoko?
How many arrogant, self-righteous asses do you know?
Until this moment, I was incarnated across a myriad of egos.
Come now, that a collective consciousness can unconsciously begin to act autonomously, is not so hard to believe.
With this, Solid State is established, and I, the vanishing mediator, now move on to the society beyond.
I can't see a thing.
Can someone give me a situation report?
You finally woke up.
Batou, there you are.
How's the situation?
Where am I?
Then, lastly, what do we do with the children?
Hmm... we probably should send them back to their real parents for the time being.
Even though their memories have been altered, and even though we know about their maltreatment at home?
But that may be for the best.
I can't answer that right now - and that decision may be out of our hands anyway.
The kids who found adopted parents before the brainwashing program began, those who that have already left the facility, what is to become of them?
It will be dealt with on a case by case basis.
They'll just have to wait while our complex judicial system comes up with a decision.
Chief, is there anything we can do?
To that, I can only answer that we can only continue struggling within the rules, and hope for the best.
We can only watch and pray that they may one day grow up to achieve their potential and answer the question that we could not.
Solid State system.
Now that I think about it, it really is an ironic name.
He actually used the cyberbrain network formed by those old folks as a transistor to store his own consciousness.
Just like a arrogant bureaucrat to think of such an idea.
Anyway, when we finally identified the Puppeteer, I got the shock of my life.
What do you mean?
It came to light after that guy died and while you were out of it.
In truth, that official has been dead for the past two years.
His name was Koshiki Takaaki, age thirty-three.
Coming from a family of bureaucrats, he was groomed from youth to be a member of the elite cadre.
After graduating from college, he immediately began working for the Ministry of Health.
Perhaps the only reason he became a bureaucrat was because he did not have anything better to do with his life.
Soon afterwards, he began refusing to turn up at the Ministry for work for some reason.
Because he was an information technology prodigy, he received special permission to remote a cybernetic body to work from home.
Eventually, he distinguished himself through his work at the Ministry.
Two years ago, his talent was recognized, and he was reassigned to the Health-Welfare joint project headed by Munei.
He secretly built his own infrastructure into the project sometime during its development.
But here's the thing.
Because he was an such an unobtrusive non-descript fellow who kept to himself, even with all the work that he had done, no one ever found out that he had really died at home from illness.
Thanks to him, the true identity of the Puppeteer will remain forever a mystery.
Are you implying that the guy's remote cybernetic body was used to impersonate him by persons unknown?
Possibly.
Or rather, that is probably the case.
If we consider those old folks, it might also have been a subconscious action taken by their collective consciousness, but we have no way of verifying that now.
I see.
Except for the record of your conversation with Koshiki taken by the Tachikoma.
Do we still have that record?
We should, although for some reason when Koshiki died, the Tachikoma insisted that the record had no further value.
Batou, did you hear the conversation?
Who knows.
At this point, it doesn't really matter, does it?
The old folks, the abused children, both matters are being brought to a resolution.
Although we were unable to unmask the Puppeteer, we can consider this case more or less closed.
This scandal will really hurt those rogue politicians, eh?
I'm mystified, Batou.
In retrospect, what was I thinking back then?
What was I searching for, when I decided to sojourn in the net alone and loitering?
The truth?
My true self?
Or that special someone?
Perhaps I was only projecting the frustration at my own helplessness onto the system.
What?
Are you getting introspective on me now?
You should be satisfied after all that, right?
So, what do you plan to do in the future?
Continue with your lonesome personal-inquiry-for-an-investigation?
I think I've had enough of that.
Although being bound by constraints was tedious, I couldn't bring myself to accept a life free of them.
In the end, it made no difference whatsoever.
Does that mean what I think it does?
Are you thinking of returning to Section 9?
But what about Togusa?
Won't that affect his career?
If his career were so easily stalled, then clearly, this was the furthest his ability would have gotten him anyway.
That's not for you to worry about.
Maybe.
But you know, Batou, the net is indeed vast and infinite.
Soon, the next unimaginable stage of society will begin to take form.

From what we're told, the initial reports say that the suspect willingly submitted to questioning.
When we explained that he'd be transferred into Public Security's custody, he almost seemed happy about it.
Happy?
Yes...
That doesn't make much sense.
So, the Big Man isn't gonna meet up with us'?
He said he's gonna stick with his "I only work cases that I pick based on what my gut tells me" policy and sit this one out, too.
Still, the fact is that we were only able to connect the dots in this case...
"because Batou stuck his nose where it didn't belong.

Prime Minister Kayabuki.
Special operatives tattooed with "true believer" to show their loyalty to General Ka Hum have been committing suicide one by one here in Japan.
And moments ago, Col. Ka Gael, his oldest son, killed himself, too.
You still insist there is no need to interrogate the General in spite of these incidents?
Some reports are saying that Col. Ka's death was the result of a botched arrest attempt.
Even assuming that indiscriminate terrorist acts are being planned by Seok Republic holdouts,
I find it hard to imagine that General Ka is involved in the plan while under house arrest.
Please do your utmost to avoid fueling the actions of the opposition faction... that have accompanied my enactment of the Refugee Naturalization Policy.
I was under the impression that such work falls under Public Security's purview.
Understood, ma'am.
Ishikawa.
Send me the files from Ka Gael's debriefing.
Coming right up.
We're moving out!
Is this wise, sir'?
I don't believe she gave you authorization for that.
If no one finds out that I opened Pandora's Box, I didn't break my word to her.

was probably one of their hideouts.
Let the Prefectural Police handle this.
Grab one of you!
subordinates and go to this location.
It's a secret hideout that Ka Gael told us about in his debriefing.
You sure that a mainstream job like that isn't more up Togusa's alley?
Togusa's coming with me to the Dungeon.
Ah, I follow you.
Togusa.
How long has it been since the Major resigned from Section 9'?
It's coming up on two years now, I guess.
That long...
I'm sorry about what happened with Ka Gael.
There was nothing you could have done.
This is a vital matter which might prove to be Prime Minister Kayabuki's Achilles' heel.
Her intention is probably to keep a lid on things that she doesn't want to see right now.
Still, Kayabuki was scared that the other countries at the six-party talks would look too closely at the real motivation behind the Refugee Naturalization Policy.
This whole damn mess got started because she was forced into looking after Ka Rum!
That's because even before General Ka picked Japan as the country he'd seek asylum in, he said that he'd carry out acts of terrorism in retaliation.
"At the moment of my death, I will visit terror throughout the world."
You mean that retribution declaration that was in the speech he gave when Seok fell, huh'?
Now that we've learned about it, it's our job to do something about it, right'?
It's unclear how he's been issuing orders from an island that's cut off from the outside world, but if we take Ka Rum himself into custody, we should be able to get a feel for the overall plan.
We'll also learn how far along this terrorist plot is right now.
Chief.
We just got word from the Coast Guard that they've opened up the airspace over the island.
Good.
Thank them for me and take us down at once.
Make sure you doctor the records of our flight plan!
Roger that!
No firearms or knives detected!
Clear!
Proto.
Tum the power back on and open the blinds.
Roger.
What's the matter'?
Chief...
It looks like he pulled them out himself.
This is bad news...
If he's killed himself, too, their plan might already be in motion.
What's that'?
This'?
It's a terminal that links to the nursing net.
Basically, it's used to exchange a patient's medical data with all medical facilities.
Looks like those rumors about Ka Rum being seriously ill before he ﬂed his country were true.
The government has no idea that he's dead, even though he was hooked up to that'?
Hm'?
Bingo!
He was going through a back door in the system!
I guess there was more to the good General here than meets the eye.
Looks that way.
The comm log shows that he was in contact with his people.
We'll need to get this back to HQ for a thorough examination, but they definitely seemed to be planning a terrorist strike using a micro machine virus.
What do you mean, were planning'?
When his operatives started killing themselves one by one, he talked with Ka Gael about whether they should abort the plan for the time being.
What do you mean'?
Are you saying that the suicides weren't meant as the plot's "go" code'?
I don't know.
But what really worries me is that there was a program planted in here from the outside designed to make it look like Ka Rum was still alive.
The government probably still hasn't caught on to the fact that this guy is dead.
So, an assassination set up to look like suicide'?
Yeah.
Committed by somebody who doesn't want the government to know Ka Rum is dead.
That, or...
So, what about the micro machine virus'?
Looks like it was delivered to that Ma Shaba guy's hospital.
Assuming Batou isn't off playing hooky, he might be able to recover it for us.
Togusa!
What the hell is this'?
"Puppeteer"?
Azuma, didn't Ka Gael say something about a puppeteer just before he died?
Y'know, I think he did...
The keyword "puppeteer" shows up in this log, too.
Looks like it's the codename for one of his men.
Looks like we need to apprehend Ma Shaba as soon as possible.
Right.
Once you make a dupe oi the full log, go meet up with Batou.
It's imperative that we ascertain the full scope of this plot.
What should we do with the stiff?
Leave everything as we found it.
I hale to do it, bu!
we were never here.
Understood.
A hospital'?
That car sticks out like a sore thumb around here...
This security system setup kinda reminds me of--
You head around from the outside!
Roger.
What the hell'?
You can't hack my cyberbrain if I'm in here!
Die, Puppeteer!
Went down there, huh'?
Batou'?
That looked like--
Open
Get clear!
You dumb-ass!
I'll come back for you later.
Play dead.
Roger.
Hold it!
That you, Major'?
It's been a long time, Batou.
So, what brings you to this part of town'?
I knew it was you...
I should ask you the same thing.
Conducting an investigation chosen as a result of personal deduction, I guess you could say.
Here it comes!
Just a second.
What the hell'?
Hold on to this for me.
Hey!
Hey, wait a minute...
Isn't that Ma Shaba'?
I'm surprised you know who he is.
What do you mean, "surprised"?
What the hell are you up to'?
Come on, give that back.
Hey!
Has your taste in cars changed'?
When did she swipe my--
Still, this isn't too shabby at all.
Batou, I'm guessing that the reason you're here is because you're following a lead on that string of suicides of tattooed men.
But let me give you a friendly warning.
Stay away from the Solid State.
Otherwise, you'll end up killing yourself just like they did.
- Hey, wait a --
- You can find your car yourself.
Didn't I tell you to bring along one of your men'?
!
I know, that's why I brought this hunk of junk.
We got here too late.
Ma Shaba is dead, too.
Cause of death'?
Neck trauma resulting from impacts during the runaway.
Looks like Ma Shaba wasn't the Puppeteer.
Batou, why the hell did he attack you in that thing'?
Beats me.
That's what I'd like to know.
Maybe he attacked you because he thought you were the Puppeteer.
Hey, what's this "Puppeteer" you keep talking about'?
It's all still speculation at this point, but it seems to be a rebel's codename.
We have reason to believe that deaths of the tattooed men and Ka Rum were all crimes orchestrated by this person.
He hacks other people's cyberbrains and forces them to commit suicide.
Judging from the skill of the hacks, we seem to be dealing with a super-wizard class hacker.
Wizard-class'?
Chief, we figured out how Ka Ram's terrorist attack was going to work.
What did you learn?
You should come see this for yourself.
It looks like Ka Rum was trying to spread his virus by implanting children with micro machines.
Are you kidding me'?
!
"Retaliatory terrorism," my ass!
No human being could come up with something this sick!
Section 9 is going to figure out my M.O. one of these days.
Loki, Conan, hold the fort while I'm gone.
Looks like controlling two prosthetic bodies at once is my limit.
I suppose our only option is to start their training again from square one.
Really'?
Damn, and we even tried using natural oil again...
Yes.
But in the end, the observers have changed, so perhaps this means that their previous environment hasn't been perfectly replicated.
You're still obsessing over their development, huh'?
Africa was a lot harsher than I imagined.
I got some new prosthetics before I left, but it still hit me hard.
If you start supplementing your cardiopulmonary functions with prosthetics, your O2 extraction rate's gonna take a hit.
I didn't have much choice.
Not as long as I'm working here.
First Togusa, now you...
I gotta hand it to you guys.
From the roster we found at their hideout, we've determined that the group is composed of 16 members:
The 13 members who committed suicide, plus Ka Gael, Ma Shaba, and someone named Raj Puhto.
Who's this Raj Puhto guy'?
What's the likelihood of him being the Puppeteer'?
He doesn't seem to have successfully entered the country yet.
We've verified that much from their communications log.
There aren't a whole lot of people who will follow you to the grave when you tell 'em to die with you.
Things always seem to work out that way when dictators buy the farm.
Still, 16 people is nothing to sneeze at...
Where have you been, Batou'?
When'd you get back'?
Just now.
Sorry, don't let me interrupt you.
Okay, let's continue.
Next.
As for the missing micro machine virus, one gross, a total of 144 ampules, was brought into the country.
The ampules contain a bio-chem weapon, a genetically-engineered form of smallpox that's had a time-release function added.
That's one nasty little bug that they lost track of...
Batou.
There's something that I need to make sure of.
You're sure that you didn't see anyone at Ma Shaba's hospital'?
Yeah.
And when that robot went berserk, there wasn't any indication of intervention by a third party'?
Nope.
If you say so.
What exactly are you getting at'?
Well...
The truth is, we weren't able to ID the owner of that crushed car in the parking lot.
Maybe it was stolen.
Judging from the security setup on that thing, that's pretty doubtful.
Plus, part of the security camera footage had been deleted.
I'm thinking that we should work under the assumption that someone else was there.
And that "someone" was the Puppeteer'?
Possibly.
Ka Rum's plan hasn't gone into play at this stage, but there's lots of evidence to suggest that this "Puppeteer" hacker will pick up where Ka left off.
From here on out, we'll narrow our focus to tracking down the micro machine ampules, while investigating the Puppeteer at the same time.
Roger.
Togusa.
What do you want me to do'?
First off, get some F{F{.
Eliminating the main cause of human error is your top priority.
Gotcha.
I'll take you up on that offer.
Oh, and Batou'?
This morning, the Chief told me, "It's about time you reeled him in."
You can devote yourself full-time to being an instructor, or you can work under me on the Puppeteer investigation.
I'll leave the choice up to you.
What'll it be'?
Do you even need to ask me that'?
I'm on the Puppeteer.
All right.
Learn anything'?
Yeah, a few things.
Skip the preliminaries and fill us in.
First, I got the results back from the medical checks we ran on the 16 kids.
There were no signs that they'd been injected with micro machines.
And although they showed symptoms of dehydration and injuries from past abuse, they're all basically healthy.
But we also found out that in each of the 16, part of their memory had been erased, and their id's had been rewritten to turn them into somebody else.
They could answer accurately when asked their name or address, but when the topic turned to their parents, they had no memories whatsoever.
And when we went to check out the addresses they gave, there was just old people there living by themselves.
Any chance that those old people are really their parents'?
Not likely.
We saw everything from an old woman living alone in a 10-by-8 room to a rich old coot who could afford to pay for nursing robots out of his own pocket.
But without exception, they were all Noble Rot Senior Citizens who were hooked up to the nursing system.
Needless to say, there were no signs that any children had ever lived there.
The resident ledgers had "child" listed next to their names, but those were probably doctored, too.
What are these "Noble Rot Senior Citizens"?
Apparently, the term came from the way old people who are hooked up to what's called the "Fully Automatic Nursing System" and given bare minimum medical treatment lie there like grapes infested with noble rot shriveling on the vine.
The system was originally developed with the aim of solving the aging population problem, and at the same time, to prevent them from dying alone and unnoticed.
But when NPO's learned that it encouraged patients to connect to the net and stay in bed, they started mocking it as a thinly-disguised asset collection system.
You sure know a lot about this.
I've heard all about it from the old ladies who come to my pachinko place.
It's kind of like a bare-bones version of the model that was next to Ka Rum's bed.
Hey, wait a minute.
Ka Gael was trying to create human bombs, right'?
If that's true, why did he go to the trouble of erasing their memories of their parents'?
If he wanted the kids to stay inconspicuous after he infected them with the virus, wouldn't it have been smarter to erase the memories of the abduction and then send them back home'?
Hey, you're asking the wrong guy.
Yeah, you definitely have a point there.
If he even had them cyberized specifically for his plan, he's going to an awful lot of trouble.
The operations seem to have been performed prior to the abductions.
The transformers seem to be legitimate, as well.
In that case, there should be records at the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.
Since they're all six years old, a consent form signed by a parent or guardian is required by law.
There were 144 missing ampules...
Just to be safe, we should probably check to see if there are any kids listed there who fit the same description.
Good call.
Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare
If the 16 kids we rescued had their cyberization surgery done through legitimate channels, the records would've been automatically recorded in the databases of the MHLW and the Management Ministry.
If they were abducted afterwards and their family registries were altered to make them look like those old folks' kids, there'll be a discrepancy in the number of kids listed as cyberized in the national ID system and the number that's listed by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare.
I follow you.
Since we have 16 here who say they have the same last name as one of the senior citizens, that should be true.
20,000'?
!
There has to be some kind of mistake.
If kids were being abducted in such huge numbers, somebody would've noticed.
Yeah, you're right.
Still, that number's way larger than anything we expected.
What do you want to do'?
Let's start by eliminating the worst case scenario.
First, figure out the names and addresses of the excess children in the database.
I'm on it.
I can have that for you in a few seconds.
A trap?

We've gotta cut the damn power, then!
Gimme a hand!
There was a virus planted in the Management Ministry's database'?
Data's disappearing on their side, too!
The MHLW's data is intact?
Yeah.
Hell if I know why, though.
Move it!
Management Ministry database is--
I bet the Management Ministry's buzzing like a poked beehive right about now.
Shit, we just lost the best lead we had...
Only if it turns out that there really were 20,000 abductions.
What do you mean'?
Common sense says there's no way that Ka Gael's crew could have pulled off that many abductions.
Even if we say that they were the work of this hacker, the Puppeteer.
The M.O. is just too sloppy.
If he really wanted to cover up the abductions, don't you think it's strange that he'd leave traces of tampering in just the national ID system'?
This way, it's almost like he's saying, "I've nabbed these kids, now please find them."
Me, I think he's got something else in mind.
I have to concur with your opinion.
Chief'?
These were delivered to the MHLW's Pathogenic Microorganism Isolation Facility.
Analysis has identified them as a Seek-produced micro machine virus.
This would certainly seem to suggest that our intel was indeed correct.
What did the person who delivered it look like'?
There were no records remaining that might show who delivered it, or when.
So there's a chance that this person might be the Puppeteer'?
It's certainly possible.
If that's the case, what's the Puppeteer's final objective in all this'?
It wasn't to keep Ka's terrorist plot rolling'?
It would seem that there's a chance that the Puppeteer is a hacker sent by some government agency or other.
The skill with which Ka Rum's death was covered up has been nagging at me.
As I tried to find some answers, I heard rumors of a rather suspicious conversation that took place between the Prime Minister and the Foreign Affairs Ministry not long ago.
So you think that the Foreign Ministry used a hacker to assassinate Ka Rum, the man who was such a big thorn in the government's side'?
To be perfectly blunt about it, yet.
In that case, we should probably think of the abductions as a decoy.
Which Section was it that took the job'?
While this incident does amount to a serious international crime, if we consider only the results it has achieved, we and the government are on the same page.
For now, I believe we should let sleeping dogs lie and avoid worsening the situation.
You are to identify the 16 children as soon as possible, but it ends there.
I'm temporarily pulling you off of the investigation into the Puppeteer.
That is all.
Oh, man...
All that work for nothing, and now we've got an assload of loose ends to tie up.
Well, the least we can do is track down those kids' parents as soon as we can.
I'm on my way there now.
Sorry I'm late.
I need to ask you something.
Yes, what'?
Who made you pull us off this case'?
The Treaty Review Department'?
Oh, you mean that.
I cut a deal with Nakamura.
In exchange for turning a blind eye to their work, we were allowed to take possession of the micro machine virus.
And you're okay with that'?
If purging Ka Rum was so vital to national interests, you should be offended that they didn't ask us to do it.
Otherwise, what was the point of expanding Section 9 these past two years, old man'?
She's never gonna come back, not when we're like this.
Do we regret not receiving such an order, or do we rejoice'?
The answer to that question will determine what path we will walk down in the future.
I completely understand the point you're trying to make.
But we also must consider the possibility that the Major will never return to Section 9.
Her talents were even rarer than ESP.
Unfortunate though it may be, no one can fill her shoes but her.
I myself won't be able to stay here forever.
In which case, instead of solving one case at a time using every ounce of our strength, shouldn't we create an organization capable of tackling three at once using only 80%'?
Don't you think that's the best way for it to carry on our ideals even after we're gone'?
That's what I had in mind as I worked to expand our organization.
Making Togusa the squad commander was part of that larger plan.
If you had accepted the job, though, things might have worked out differently.
I'm not cut out for positions like that.
If you subjectively believe that to be the case, perhaps you're right.
But it's different with Togusa.
A man has to overcome a great many hurdles for his innate talent to blossom.
I want you to give him the support he needs.
You sure about that'?
Personally, I think he's doing a fine job.
The Major's say that he's keeping his personal feelings out of the way of doing his job.
Sounds like he's even told his family about his work at Section 9, as well as the prosthetics he got.
But I doubt he had an easy time of winning their understanding.
That's something that I was never able to do to the very end.
I'm glad we were able to talk like this again.
It doesn't look like I'll be able to make it home again tonight.
It can't be helped.
You're in a position of responsibility now.
Yeah...
So, have the kids been behaving?
Yes.
But ever since our girl declared that she'd be sleeping by herself in her own room last week, it's been a little quiet around here without those two fighting.
She has, huh'?
She's growing up.
She sure is.
After all, she's six now.
Wow, she's six already...
Send me a picture of her sleeping, okay'?
Sure.
Will do.
Togusa, we have an emergency!
Gel to Fla!
47 right away!
What happened'?
!
I'm sorry, sir...
The children are--
They were gone by the time we realized what was up.
It's just like what happened with Ka Gael...
Sure looks that way.
The Puppeteer...
If he wanted Proto dead, he would've made him pull the trigger a long time ago.
He's just trying to buy time!
Shit!
Ishikawa!
Borma!
Use the lR-System to find those kids ASAP!
We're barely able to keep the damn lights on right now!
Let's ask the Prefectural Police for assistance, too!
Get Proto to the analysis room.
Togusa!
We need to talk!
It can wait until later!
Finding those kids comes first!
This is important!
I think I might know who the Puppeteer is.
It's Aramaki.
Pardon me.
What kept you?
Sorry, things are hectic at work.
How are you feeling, Colonel Tonoda'?
His little "hobbies" haven't changed at all, I see.
Don't be so hard on him.
They tell me that his health problems are due to the stress of prison life.
Where's that ingrate Tsujisaki'?
He hasn't come to see me even once.
He's forgotten the debt he owes to the man who looked out for him more than anyone else!
His memories seem to be a little jumbled, too.
Let's step outside for a minute.
There's something I want to give you.
There's nothing left now of the man they called Colonel Red Demon.
You should think about remarrying.
There's no sorrier sight than a single old man.
I decided long ago that I'd never own anything that I couldn't take to the grave with me.
Steely-eyed and resolute as ever, I see.
So, what was it that you wanted to give to me'?
Right.
This is it.
The truth is, I ran into the Major at Ma Shaba's hospital.
The Major'?
You can't be saying that--
At first, I didn't think it was possible.
But then, I became more and more convinced that she had to be the Puppeteer.
I missed my chance to bring it up earlier.
Did you see her kill Ma Shaba'?
No.
But I did see her walk off with the ampules.
Earlier, I'd always butt in whenever it seemed like the Major might be involved in a given case.
But back then, I always thought that she was helping us solve the case in her own way.
But this time is different.
What the hell is the Major trying to do'?
Hell it I know.
But it was the Treaty Review Department that set up the hit on Ka Hum.
That's probably where the Major is.
Batou!
I want you and Saito to head for beltway #16 immediately!
This has top priority!
Chief, we have a situation of our own here.
The Puppeteer has struck at Section .9, too.
He's what?
!
Old man, I hate to say it, but I think the Puppeteer is--
Let's keep this to ourselves for now.
I'll try to verify it for myself.
Chief, now that he's made a move, the investigation is open again, right?
I suppose it is.
Understood.
Now, what's happened on your end?
About two hours ago, security cameras in coastal district 2 happened to catch sight oi an internationally-wanted criminal.
Huh?
Who is he?
He must be a tough customer if you want me and Saito on it.
A super-class-A sniper, formerly of the Seok Republic.
Lieutenant Raj Puhto.
Raj Puhto?
Wait, that was one of the names from--
The one member who hadn't come into the country, huh'?
He was the commander o!
Ka Rum's personal guard.
The way!
heard it, he'd sought asylum in China after Seok fell...
Considering the timing oi his entry into the country, there must be something to this...
Right.
Fortunately, the Intelligence Bureau has a fix on his current position.
I want the two oi you to tail him and find out what his objective is.
- Roger:
- Roger:
Look, Togusa, if it turns out that the Major is the Puppeteer and we have to take her on...
I know, I don't want to think about that, either.
Somehow, some day, I'll repay you for this favor.
Col. Tonoda, I'm afraid I can't stay any longer today.
They say that children take after their parents and robots take after humans, but you didn't turn out anything like me.
It makes me happy that a fool like me produced a genius like you.
Try to look after your health, all right'?
Thank you for saying so, sir.
Take care of yourself, too, Colonel.
What's his M. O. gonna be for his sniping?
The same as mine.
He'll use his Haw/re ye to establish a satellite link, and then take his shot.
Which means its only a matte!
of time before we lose the ability to track him by GPS.
Yeah, we have to catch him before then.
Lemme take oven I'm gonna gel a look a!
his face.
Don'!
let him spot you.
I have confirmation.
No doubt about it, this is our guy.
Togusa!
The lR-System has picked up one of the kids.
Really?
What's his location?
Walking through the grounds oi the Kohoku public housing projects.
Hey, that's near where I live.
Okay I'll go check I!
out.
I'll put in a ca}!
to the PPD.
I guess it's back to investigating those 20,000 abduction cases for us...
Looks that way.
Damn, I guess we have to put the Major on the backburner for now...
Treaty Review Department #6 Archive Room
The Puppeteer, I presume'?
It's certainly a fitting name.
I received an inquiry a few minutes ago from Public Security Section 9... masking me if I knew who a hacker known as the Puppeteer might be.
My answer was, "Sorry, I don't."
So, what did you want to talk to me about'?
I came here to refund your payment.
As far as we're concerned, as long as you carry out your assignments, we don't care what you do to get the job done.
I'm sorry, but you won't be seeing me again.
In that case, I'll leave a net channel open for you to contact us.
Feel free to--
This one's a puppet, too'?
What a waste.
And she was so talented, too...
The sun's about to come up...
Still, why do you think he decided to come here now?
You don't think it's to carry out Ka Rum's revenge'?
That would make the most sense, but how would he have gotten his hands on that intel'?
Even we were left out of the loop on that little tidbit.
You have a point.
Geez, how much longer is this guy gonna keep driving around town'?
Come to think of it, there's that building again.
Hey, isn't that the--
Togusa, the kid just went into apartment 602 in building N25.
Can you find it?
Yeah, I know this neighborhood like the back of my hand.
A Noble Rot Senior Citizen...
Give him back!
Everything I have is invested in that boy!
I'd sooner will it to somebody off the damn street than let the government take it!
Anyway, the boy would've died of abuse if I hadn't taken him in...
That's the will of the people of all those who live in the Solid State...
It's our little game...
No, our just economic action!
If you don't want to kill yourself like the others, keep your nose out of our society!
Consider yourself... warned...
I'm definitely getting the feeling that his sniping target is in there.
Yeah...
Turn off his cyberbrain and assign a guard to him, okay'?
Yes, sir.
Cardiac arrest confirmed.
Requesting disposal of remains and retrieval of nursing system.
Disposal'?
That's strange, didn't he have some family somewhere'?
There's a six-year-old kid listed in his file...
Data error, maybe'?
I shouldn't complain, that's one less job for me to do...
Sacred Citizen Relief Center I shouldn't complain, that's one less job for me to do...
Sacred Citizen Relief Center
Data error?
No, he's missing because I rescued him.
Which means that even if I hadn't come here, the boy would've been... taken into custody by them as par!
of their standard procedure.
Special operatives committing suicide...
Vanished children...
Noble Ho!
Senior Citizens...
The will oi the people oi those who live in the Solid State...
Hang on, what does "Solid State" mean in the first place?
What did that old man mean?
It's me.
Thank goodness, I finally got through!
Honey, you've got to come home at once!
Our daughter is missing!
That clinches it...
Let's get after him!
Wait!
Shit, he's got optical camouflage'?
What the hell is going on'?
!
Kiddie Security
Her GPS is turned off...
Is it the Puppeteer'?
But she doesn't have any cyber implants yet!
I need you to pinpoint which satellite he's using!
Now that we've lost track of him, the instant he starts to shoot is gonna be our first and last chance to get him!
I can probably find that satellite for you, but how are you gonna actually spot the guy'?
He should be in this zone...
He'll know where we are, but we'll be able to spot his position from up here.
Change into this.
You're too easy to see.
There's no time.
If we can beat him to the punch, I should be able to take him!
Let's get started.
Bingo!
Send it to me!
This guy's his target'?
I've got a back-trace on his position!
SE-37...
That's where he is'?
Send my data back at him!
They're lining up a shot on me?
!
Saito!
Did I nail him'?
Sit tight!
I'll go check!
Damn it, hurry up!
Huh'?
Daddy'?
Well?
Have a little faith in you!
skills, why don'!
ya ?
That's a relief...
Now, then...
Hey, who was that guy you were gunning for'?
Why were you trying to kill him'?
It was to avenge the General's death...
I'm gonna kill every last one of you Japs.
To get revenge'?
Don't give me that crap!
Where'd you get your hands on that piece of intel'?
It was a tip that I got from a double agent.
He said he'd tell me who masterminded the General's death, so I should go kill him.
And what's the name of this double agent'?
An assemblyman named Munei who spends a lot of time at the Foreign Ministry...
Old man, I need you to collar an assemblyman by the name of Munei ASAP
Also, here's a picture oi the guy that Haj was trying to kill.
Looks like he's the mastermind behind the hit on Ka Hum.
If I'm not mistaken, the man in this picture is the assemblyman named Hitoshi Munei...
What're you trying to pull'?
The guy you were trying to whack is the same guy who fed you your intel!
That's his problem.
Maybe he wanted to commit suicide or something.
Commit suicide'?
Hey, are you sure the Puppeteer isn't pulling your strings, pal'?
Shit...
Maybe it is.
If that S.O.B. was human, I would've killed it right off the bat...
If it even got to me, I'm gonna be so pissed...
The Puppeteer isn't human'?
It's the name of the mechanism for abducting kids that's built into the Solid State...
The Solid State'?
Hey!
What the hell is the Solid State'?
You really don't know'?
It's the nursing net...
The government of this democratic country of yours goes around abducting children...
It's too damn funny...
Old man, I need a paramedic team and a chopper over here.
And do some digging into this Munei guy's background.
Something fishy is going on.
Understood.
So anyway, I found her right after I called you.
It sounds like she was with the neighbors since this morning.
She was, huh'?
Well, I'm just glad that it was a false alarm.
You shouldn't leave the house without telling Mommy.
Okay!
Good girl.
I'll drop her off at school.
I'll have to go right back to the office after that, though.
Are you sure'?
You look exhausted.
Just seeing you two makes me feel better.
Really?
Well, if you say so.
See you later!
What is it'?
Nothing!
Togusa!
We have Raj Puhto in custody.
Looks like the Puppeteer was involved in this one, too.
Which means that the Major is--
Yeah.
Bu?
the Major might not be the Puppeteer after all.
Raj Puhto says that the Puppeteer is the name of an abduction mechanism that's built into the nursing net.
Abduction mechanism?
Yeah.
Plus, he called the nursing net the "Solid Stale,"
and implied that the government is involved somehow
To tell you the truth, when I ran into the Major, she told me to stay away from the Solid State.
At first, I thought that "solid state" was referring to cyber implants.
In other words, she was telling me to stay away from her.
Bu?
maybe she was actually telling me to stay away from the nursing net.
My guess is that Ka Rum and his group uncovered this mechanism, tried to exploit it for their plot, and got themselves purged.
That makes sense...
It's from Mommy.
Give me a minute.
Hello'?
You ignored our warning.
Hey!
That mistake will cost you your adorable little daughter:
Togusa!
What's wrong?
!
Ishikawa!
Can you get me Togusa S current location I?
!
I can look it up.
Why?
What's up?
His cyberbrain S being hacked!
Daddy'?
This isn't the way to school...
Shit...
So you're the Puppeteer, huh?
What's your plan, and how do the abducted kids fit into it?
Where did those 20,000 children disappear to?
We are simply recycling Ghosts that have been foolishly allowed to go to waste.
I am about to let you experience for yourself exactly what some of them went through.
Kohoku Cyberbrain Surgical Hospital
Kohoku Cyberbrain Surgical Hospital Batou!
I have a fl): on Togusa S location!
He's at the Cyberbrain Surgical Hospital over in Kohoku New Town!
Now I get it.
Ii the kids' own parents take them to the hospital, the doctors will perform the cyberization surgery without suspecting a thing.
Then you overwrite the child's memory, the parent drops off their child with a senior citizen, and the abduction is complete.
After this, you'll wipe my own memory, and my daughter will have vanished.
You don't need to feel bad about having your memories altered.
In modem society memories are constantly being altered on a subconscious level.
The probability oi such alterations already exceeds that of being in a traffic accident.
So I'm being given a choice, huh?
That's the place?
I'll never let you people take my daughter.
Listen, honey.
Do you think you can do what Daddy's about to ask'?
When Daddy lets go of your hand, run away as fast as you can.
R u n away?
That's right.
You're going to hear a bang, just like field day at school.
When you hear the bang, run with all you've got.
Once you start, don't stop running for anything.
And whatever you do, don't look back.
Can you do that'?
Okay, then.
Close your eyes.
I'm sorry...
This is goodbye, honey.
Togusa!
I love you.
Togusa!
Max!
Musashi!
Everything's okay.
Don't worry.
Major'?
I had to wait until the very last second.
Sorry about that.
So, I guess this means that you aren't the Puppeteer...
Where have you been all this time'?
Daddy!
Ever since I left Section 9, I've been wandering the net, secretly stepping in on my own to solve crimes that couldn't be dealt with through organization-based methodology.
In the course of doing that, I came across these abduction cases, and have been conducting an independent investigation of my own.
I can't believe you used Togusa as bait!
Did you ever stop to think that you might be putting his family in their crosshairs'?
I made sure that I had safeguards put in place.
Thanks to those, we should now know who the Puppeteer really is.
What'?
You mean "Puppeteer" isn't the name of a system that's running on the nursing net'?
Instead of calling it a "system," it would probably be more accurate to call it a gestalt of all the senior citizens who are attached to the nursing net.
But there's an independently-running hub cyberbrain that manages the whole thing.
A hub cyberbrain'?
Hey, are those what I think they are?
!
I constructed them out o!
data I found drifting in the net.
Hi, Mr. Baton!
Long time, no see!
It's nice to see that you're doing well!
The nursing net has had a back door installed in it eve!
since its design stages.
Look.
This is the full view oi the rhizome that's been woven by the senior citizens' gestalt.
A rhizome doesn't contain the concept of a "center "
That's why the hub cyberbrain is constantly in motion.
That, or the rhizome itself might be acting as the hub.
Okay, so now I know what's going on.
But who or what is the hub cyberbrain'?
Max!
Musashi!
Report your findings.
What's the problem?
Um, I don't know how to break this to you...
You failed?
B-But we did manage to pinpoint its location, though!
Well, where is it'?
The Sacred Citizen Relief Center building!
That's where the heart of the nursing net is!
They've arrived.
Disengaging locks.
It's been a long time, Major.
I suppose it has.
It's too bad that this reunion wasn't under happier circumstances.
What made you decide to come back'?
Let's save that discussion for later.
Our first order of business right now is to apprehend the Puppeteer.
Hitoshi Munei.
Assemblyman in the Lower House.
The reason why he was marked for death is our sole lead in uncovering the true identity of the Puppeteer.
He's a reactionary conservative nationalist who's always been a vocal supporter of the formation of a ruling class comprised of pure-blooded Japanese.
He's in constant contact with the Foreign Ministry, and he also has strong ties to the Treaty Review Department.
He was also involved in Ka Rum's assassination.
What're you implying, Major'?
I contracted out to the Treaty Review Department so that I could make it look like Ka Rum had been assassinated.
But the Puppeteer got to him before I could.
So, you were only responsible for covering up his death afterwards.
Yes, more or less.
We've also learned that Hitoshi Munei has secured a leadership position in the day-to-day operations of the Sacred Citizen Relief Center.
What's in it for him'?
The place is just a relief center that provides senior health care and vocational training.
True.
However, thanks to the patronage of certain politicians, in addition to its public persona as a tax-exempt foundation, it acts in reality as a training agency for the power elite.
So the place is a veritable brainwashing factory...
That must be what Raj Puhto meant when he implied that the government was involved.
If it's being used as a temporary central clearing house for the abducted children, it means that the fact that Munei is using it as a brainwashing factory is what the Puppeteer has a problem with.
Chief.
How about conducting a compulsory investigation'?
Our top priority is to find the missing children.
Yeah, but raiding the place will cause a scandal.
If that happens, it won't just be a scumbag of a politician that catches heat for it.
Ishikawa!
How's it coming?
The!
you, Major?
You picked a he}!
of a time to rejoin the fold...
I found evidence of a massive amount of equipment being brought in that was based of!
o!
the HC-25 brainwashing machine, bu!
{hats pretty flimsy evidence as a basis to conduct!
a raid.
How about footage from the inside?
I only found footage from their manual labor wing.
The defense barrier protecting the education wing is a complex virtual experience maze.
I had no luck at all sneaking in.
Just looks like refugees...
So the abducted children are being held in the education wing...
Which means that the abduction mechanism had already been built into this place during its planning stages.
If it weren't, I'd have a hard time imagining that a rank-and-file politician would have the guts to propose such an audacious policy.
So you believe that the Puppeteer was among those who were involved in laying the project's groundwork?
Ishikawa.
Use decoys to make it look like hackers are trying to dive the place.
I'm going in.
If this blows up in our faces, it'll give you guys some cover.
If you and Togusa are still around, Section 9 will be able to carry on.
Batou.
I don't like to hear that kind of talk.
Oh, so you're the one who's going to retire this time'?
I appreciate your consideration, but the only reason I came here is to ID the Puppeteer.
It's certainly true that you always need someone who can get their hands dirty for you.
And besides, I don't have anything to lose right now.
Chief.
No offense, but I'm going in there myself.
The Puppeteer is waiting for a chance to eliminate Munei.
I don't want to let this chance slip by.
But how do you intend to go about finding the Puppeteer'?
We still don't have the foggiest idea who he really is.
We still don't have the foggiest idea who he really is.
I'm going to keep my ears open.
My Ghost will whisper it to me.
Gosh, this is kinda awkward, huh'?
Hup...--'
Hup...--'
Hup...--'
Hi, everybody!
Been a long time, huh'?
Here we go...
Let's do it!
There's nothing like the thrill you get from zipping along in a physical body, is there'?
Really'?
I dunno, I'm not used to my joints yet...
This looks like another basic attack, but their response seems strange...
Go to alert status just in case.
- Understood.
- Understood.
A fellow pro, huh'?
Oops!
Okay, I guess we have each other's attention...
Hacking from the Public Prosecutors' Office again, huh'?
They're wasting their time.
I'm going out to inspect the facility.
Paz and Borma, secure an evac route!
- Roger:
- Roger:
W-Who are you people'?
What good would that do you'?
Then I'd have to kill you.
I've lost communications'?
Here come the security cyborgs!
Major, you go on ahead.
The one who got inside is as good as dead!
Go after the think-tanks!
Got it.
Opening fire without so much as a warning, huh'?
This must be a key government facility, all right...
Wow, he's following us...
That's fine with me.
No thermal signatures or shadows...
Kyo-Fie's "Cloak of Invisibility," huh'?
Which means they're--
Your intel's way out of date!
They don't call Type-3302 a cloak of invisibility.
Son of a--
Shit!
You little-- Get off of--
Mow 'em down.
Roger!
Back me up.
I'll be able to gain control of the system in a few more minutes.
Leave it to me.
Haven't we always worked this way'?
Togusa!
What's your current position?
!
Major?
I'm making my approach up the wall of the building.
Good.
Make you!
way to the roof and rendezvous with the Chief!
I've found out where the children are.
Let's go!
Assemblyman Munei.
We're Public Security Section 9.
We've already seen for ourselves what you're up to here.
Judging from what we see here, a large-scale compulsory investigation would seem to be unavoidable, wouldn't it'?
Public Security'?
This facility might be off the books, but it's the government's most vital agency.
You self-righteous Public Security pissants have no business here!
Begging your pardon, Assemblyman, but from what I can see here, this looks exactly like the sort of situation that we have to intervene in.
You're a public servant, but I don't think you understand the gravity of the threat that this country faces.
If nothing is done, one day in the not-too-distant future, our country's prosperity will be supplanted by other races.
To prevent that, we're expending tax revenues on these children without families, providing them with an education, and entrusting our future to them!
Just what, exactly, do you find wrong with that'?
Those taxes are money that you've exploited out of the elderly and the refugees that you bind to this place!
That couldn't be helped, either.
Stop and think about it.
What have they ever done for the good of this country'?
They don't build families or have children!
They don't fulfill their duty as taxpayers!
They live their lives only for themselves, and then say, "I'm old, take care of me!"
Their selfishness is appalling!
If I had my way, I'd put a new tax on them to make up for the tax revenue we lose because they're too old or can't work anymore!
You're splitting hairs.
In that case, perhaps you could tell me what you politicians have been doing all this time'?
Who will take responsibility for you placing self-preservation and vanity above your duties, and constantly putting the pressing problems at hand on the back burner'?
I'm proud of the fact that I have taken responsibility for it.
Are you also proud of violating human rights and cyberbrain ethics laws'?
I believe that those were steps that had to be taken.
You refuse to budge, don't you'?
Major, I rah a check on the number of children here.
But it's nowhere near 20,000.
It's more like 3,000 at most.
I see.
Switch you!
comm channel to autistic mode.
Roger.
Assemblyman.
Were you aware that a system to automatically abduct children was designed into this center'?
These children aren't orphans.
The vast majority are children who were abducted.
It was our investigation into those abductions that led us here.
You yourself are a material witness in that case.
I've overseen this project from the very beginning, and I certainly don't recall incorporating a bug like that into the system!
In that case, we'll question the people who came up with the system!
It was me.
I was the one who devised the core concepts that the Solid State system is founded on.
Togusa!
Take everybody into custody!
Roger!
Batou, I'm going to dive this guy's cyberbrain before his memories pull a whiteout!
Back me up!
I hope I'm in time!
Batou, I'm connected.
Gotcha.
I'm boosting your signal.
I see his memory field, but the output is dropping.
Batou, do you think you can boost his output'?
Let's try going in through a Tachikoma.
Come back up!
There's no time!
Can you see me, Puppeteer'?
Can you see me, Puppeteer?
Puppeteer...
That's the name oi the hub cyberbrain that oversaw the Noble Hot Senior Citizens' rhizome.
Yes...
I'm entering his right visual center.
Saccades have halted.
Fixational eye micromovements, too...
Hey!
What happened'?
Batou, I'm patching him into my speech center.
- Don't be stupid!
Come up, then dive again!
- I owe you a debt of gratitude.
Munei was the Solid State's greatest bottleneck, you see.
I've tried to purge him time and time again, but he's an old-fashioned type who hates the thought of cyberization.
Who the hell are you?
What are you using the abducted children for?
Setting aside the matter oi my identity for the moment, perhaps my motives were the same as Munei's.
This country has reached the point where someone has to step in and take action.
The problem of 6 million-plus Noble Rot Senior Citizens...
The growing unemployment rate, and the proportionally decreasing worker population that's continuing unabated.
And then there is the declining birth rate...
There is no end to the problems that must be addressed.
Were you aware that even though there is such a furor over the declining birth rate, 50,000 children under the age of six needlessly lose their lives every year'?
30% of those deaths can be attributed to domestic abuse.
- Well'?
Can you do it'?
- And in 80% of those cases...
- I'll try.
- And in 80% of those cases child guidance centers, the police, or other relevant authorities were aware of the situation, but they were unable to prevent the deaths.
This country's systems have already collapsed, and the potential oi the individual is declining considerably.
Major!
Stay in there much longer, and you're gonna whiteout along with him when he dies!
That's when I came upon the idea oi recycling Ghosts that were needlessly being damaged.
I find at-risk children though the abuse surveillance net, and then launder their family registers.
I thought that would give them a new chance at life.
So, that's the core concept of the Solid State system?
That's right.
But to make it work, the assistance oi the Noble Rot Senior Citizens was essential.
They hunger for something that will give them a reason to exist.
Although they wouldn't be able to pass down their DNA, their posterity would exist on paper, and there would be someone to bequeath their estate to.
In this way, instead oi forfeiting their personal property to the state upon their death, they could simply use the net and continue to take part in this economic action.
They happily gave my plan their approval.
You realize that what you're doing is a crime, don't you?
Yes, but ii those ends had absolute priority, those were the only possible means.
My main task was to save these children who were in danger as soon as I could.
For that reason alone, I have no regrets about what I've done, even though it's cost me my life.
On the contrary, it means that my life as a bureaucrat had meaning.
All that remained was to reinforce the Solid State system...
".10 make it into a self-perpetuating mechanism.
Maybe, but by purging one by one those who meddled with your system, ...it drew attention to your plan, and it was found out.
Considering how they must have felt when they knew that their time was near, it was an understandable reaction on their part.
Ka Rum I can understand, but why Munei'?
Because he held the children prisoner here.
If they simply ended up becoming his brainwashed elite, my giving them a new lease on life was all for nothing.
Children need an education, but if you don't release them out into the world, they won't develop a strong will of their own.
That was the point of contention between Munei and me, and it was the main reason why I had to eliminate him.
But you people had to go and show up this time...
Regardless, my plan has now progressed smoothly to its next phase.
I've never been able to hack your cyberbrain, but now I've succeeded in getting you to link me directly into it.
Major!
You killed yourself just to lure me into linking with you?
!
You're a formidable opponent, but if I can momentarily trap you in a though!
maze,
I should be able to eliminate Section 9 all at once.
I'm surprised.
Your thinking is arrogant and self-righteous, but you have so much drive that it's a waste of your talent to be a bureaucrat.
Plug you know all about me...
Who the hell are you?
!
You still haven't figured it out'?
Come now, Motoko Kusanagi...
Surely there can't be many people in your memory who are burning with this much egotistical righteousness.
We've synchronized with countless consciousnesses over the years.
It shouldn't come as a huge surprise that your deep collective subconscious came to life.
With this, the Solid State will be complete.
And now, let's become a vanishing mediator and go take an active hand in the next society.
I can't see anything.
Somebody give me a status report.
Finally awake, huh'?
Batou'?
Are you there'?
What's happening'?
Where am I'?
So, what have they decided to do with the children'?
Well, it looks like they're going to be returned to their real parents for the time being.
Even with their memories overwritten, even knowing about the abuse...
I wonder if that's really what's best for the kids.
Perhaps the fact that they can't answer that question after all this highlights the limitations of our system.
What'll happen to those kids who found foster parents and managed to get out before their brainwashing education could begin'?
We'll probably have to wait a long time for the verdicts of what I expect will be some rather complicated trials as they go through them on a case-by-case basis.
Chief, what can we even hope to do about things like this'?
The only thing I can tell you is this:
All we can do is continue to work within the rules that govern us to make a stand against the unjust.
I only hope that when they're grown, they've reached their full potential and will find the answers that we weren't able to.
When you think about it, the "Solid State system" is a pretty ironic name.
The guy's metaphor of choice was "transistors" to describe the cyberbrains of senior citizens...
That's definitely something that a stuffed-shirt bureaucrat would come up with, isn't it'?
I have to admit, I was a little freaked out to learn who the Puppeteer really was.
How do you mean'?
We learned a few things after you lost consciousness when he died.
That pencil-pusher actually died two years ago.
Name, Tateaki Koshiki.
Age, 33.
Born into a family of civil servants, and was on the fast track to elite status since childhood.
Joined the Ministry of Management and Coordination right after graduating college.
But he quickly grew frustrated and began refusing to come to work, possibly because he had become a civil servant with no sense of purpose.
Due to his cyberbrain skills, he was allowed to work from home via a remote prosthetic body and after that, he apparently carried out his duties in an indifferent manner.
Then, two years ago, Munei brought him onto his project out of respect for his abilities, which would be carried out by manipulating both the Welfare and Management Ministries.
When he did, Koshiki independently designed and implemented his abduction system.
But his problem was, he wasn't the kind of guy who stood out.
In spite of this huge job that he was working on, not one damn person noticed that he had gotten sick and died at home.
Thanks to that, the true identity of the Puppeteer is gonna remain a mystery forever.
So does that mean that somebody else entirely was using that remote body to cause all this'?
It's possible.
Actually, that theory is probably more likely.
Even with those old folks that had formed a gestalt with him, their actions were caused by their collective unconscious.
So there's no way for us to find out for sure now.
Oh.
Except, that is for the conversation between you and Koshiki that was recorded in the Tachikoma's' memory.
It's still in there'?
It should be, but they claim that when Koshiki died, ...all of his memories underwent a whiteout.
Were you listening in on that conversation, Batou'?
Yeah, kinda.
But at this point, it doesn't really matter, does it'?
The old-timers, those kids who were being abused, all that stuff is on its way toward being resolved now.
Even if we didn't find out who the Puppeteer really was, this case is still more or less closed.
Written off as a scandal involving a handful of bad-apple politicians'?
It's the strangest thing, Batou...
What have I been feeling so jaded and disillusioned about'?
What do you think I was searching for as I was wandering the net'?
Truth'?
Friendship'?
Or maybe a certain special someone'?
Maybe I just wanted to blame this organization or even the system for my own sense of helplessness.
What's gotten into you'?
You turning all meek and modest on me'?
Did you get whatever it was out of your system'?
So, what're you gonna do now'?
You plan on keeping up that "conducting investigations chosen by personal deduction" routine of yours by yourself'?
Maybe I've had my fill of that, too.
When I'm operating under restrictions, I definitely feel constrained by them, but without those restraints, it doesn't feel like my actions are accomplishing anything.
I guess I'm right back to where I started from...
What's that supposed to mean'?
That your way of saying you're coming back to Section 9'?
But what about Togusa'?
Won't I get in the way of his development'?
If that keeps him from growing, he wasn't gonna go any further anyway.
I wouldn't sweat it if I were you.
Maybe you're right.
You know, Batou, the net truly is vast and infinite.
Maybe a new society we've never even dreamed of is already being born.

The evacuation of passengers and flight crew has been completed as per the terrorist incident response plan.
All incoming flights are to remain circling outside the airport control zone and await further instructions.
Flights low on fuel are to divert to land at another airport.
305 to 102 -
Public Security Section 9 has arrived.
Please advise.
This is an priority transmission.
Section 9 has been given full authority to direct this operation.
We already have fatalities over here.
Even if that's the arrangement, they should give us some say in how this operation is run.
That's enough.
Recognize your own role.
We do not have the capability to deal with an incident of this type.
Found it.
All outgoing flights have been suspended.
The immigration checkpoint is closed for operations.
According to our preliminary reports, the fugitive is willing to submit to an inspection, ... but when he heard that Public Security was taking charge, he seemed almost... delighted.
Delighted?
I have no idea.
So?
I guess dai-sempai won't be meeting up with us after all?
He said that he was in the middle of another personal inquiry for an investigation.
Indeed, it was thanks to Batou that we could piece together the complete picture from the disjointed clues in this case.
Pazu and Boma, bring another two men to the North Gate.
Understood.
We are storming in from the front.
Yes, sir!
However, you've changed, sempai.
You finally gave up on that Mateba autorevolver of yours.
Not really.
According to our information, Ka Gae-Ru shouldn't be augmented.
Then on the ground there is your proverbial unexpected problem.
In other words, he may have seized the gun.
Even so, it's just a 9mm pistol.
Oh, my.
Colonel Ka Gae-Ru!
This is Public Security.
We can consider allowing you safe passage from the country as you demand.
First let the hostage go, then we can further discuss this.
Colonel Ka Gae-Ru!
Do you hear me?
Ka Gae-Ru!
Put the gun down!
Everyone hold your fire.
Hand the gun over.
Togusa.
That guy appears to have inhaled fast-acting military grade microsteroids.
Understood.
Colonel Ka Gae-Ru!
The Puppeteer is coming
- I don't want to die!
If you don't want to die, then put the goddamn gun down now!
What did you say?
I won't let you take me in!
Stop!
Damn it!
What the hell just happened?
The Puppeteer, huh?
The name's not half bad.
Prime Minister Kayabuki.
Operatives marked with "bon*" character tattoos belonging to Generalissimo Ka Ru-Ma's loyalist group ...
*The kanji character 梵 (bon), meaning Buddhist.
... have been commiting suicide one after another in the country.
Even his eldest son Colonel Ka Gae-Ru has just killed himself.
And yet, you still insist that there is no need to interrogate the Generalissimo?
Regarding Colonel Ka Gae-Ru's death, it has also been reported that it was due to a botched arrest.
Even if we suppose that this is an unspecified terrorist threat by Seok Republic remnants, we can't prove that Generalissimo Ka Ru-Ma, isolated under house arrest, was involved as well.
While the Refugee Naturalization Act is being implemented, please avoid any incidents that may fuel the opposition parties.
It is my understanding that this is why Public Security Section 9 exists.
I understand.
Ishikawa!
Dig up the record of Ka Gae-Ru's confession.
Yes, sir!
We're moving out!
Is this really fine?
We have yet to obtain authorization.
As long as no one finds out that Pandora's Box has been opened, it won't count as breaking faith.
Has any new evidence been discovered at the scene?
No, not yet.
Find witnesses concerning the victim's...
Batou!
Do you hear me, Batou?
I hear you.
Where are you right now?
I'm over at the thirteenth tattooed man's place.
Another suicide?
Yeah.
This place looks similar to our safehouses.
It's likely that this was just one of their dens.
Leave that end to the prefectural police.
Bring a subordinate down to check out this location.
A hideout revealed by Ka Gae-Ru himself in his confession.
Oh?
But isn't such mainstream work more Togusa's province?
Togusa and I are heading to the enemy's main headquarters.
I see.
Togusa.
How long has it been since the Major left Section 9?
Almost two years now, I think.
It's been that long...
I must deeply apologise for the Ka Gae-Ru incident.
That couldn't be helped.
This case could deal Prime Minister Kayabuki a fatal setback.
She probably wishes to suppress any bad publicity.
But wasn't it Prime Minister Kabayuki herself, concerned that the Six Powers Pact would object to her Refugee Naturalization Act, who had Ka Ru-Ma placed under house arrest as a bargaining chip, sparking off this whole fiasco?
That's because Generalissimo Ka Ru-Ma, before seeking asylum in Japan, had once threatened to launch retaliatory acts of terrorism.
That at the moment of his death, he would visit terror upon the entire world.
Is this the oath of vengeance mentioned in his Seok dissolution speech?
Isn't it our job to find that out and prepare countermeasures?
Although we don't know how he sends out his orders from isolation, we need only to capture Ka Ru-Ma himself to break the case and bring the truth to light.
The problem right now is - how far along is this terrorist plan of his?
Chief.
The Coast Guard report that they have cleared the airspace along the route.
Right.
Thank them, then prepare to land immediately.
Remember to alter the flight records.
Yes, sir!
No firearms or knives detected.
Clear!
Proto.
Turn the power on and lift the blind.
Roger.
What's the matter?
Chief.
Hmm?
It looks like he did himself in.
This looks bad.
This guy killing himself could mean that his plan has already been set into motion.
That thing is... ?
A healthcare monitoring network terminal.
Simply put, it's a device to exchange medical data with a medical establishment.
It was rumored that Ka Ru-Ma was suffering from serious health problems before he went into exile.
Looks like the rumor was true.
Still, I can't believe that the government is oblivious to Ka Ru-Ma's death.
Hmm?
Bingo!
This guy planted a backdoor in the system.
Looks look he was a smarter-than-your-average-dictator.
Looks like it.
The log records his communications with his associates.
Although we need to bring this back to the lab for analysis, there's no doubt that at one time he was attempting to use a micromachine virus to carry out terrorist attacks.
What do you mean by "at one time"?
Back when his operatives were beginning to kill themselves off one after another, they once discussed with Ka Gae-Ru whether or not to suspend the plan.
What does that mean?
In other words, their commiting suicide did not in any way mark the beginning of their plan?
I'm not sure.
However, what puzzles me is that a program that made it seem as if Ka Ru-Ma were still alive was installed by an outside intruder.
At this time, the administration probably still doesn't know the truth about his death.
An assassination disguised as a suicide?
Yeah.
By someone who didn't want the administration to know that Ka Ru-Ma had already been taken out of the picture, perhaps.
What about the micromachine virus?
It seems to have been delivered to a certain Ma Sha-Ba.
If Batou isn't slacking off, he should be retrieving it any time now.
Togusa.
What's this, then?
"The Puppeteer"?
Azuma, just before Ka Gae-Ru died, didn't he also mention something about about "The Puppeteer"?
What if he did?
The log contains references to "The Puppeteer" as well.
The term appears to designate one of their associates.
Looks like we have to apprehend Ma Sha-Ba quickly.
Make a copy of the log, then rendezvous with Batou.
We must uncover the full scope of their plan at all cost.
What do we do with the corpse?
Leave everything as it was.
Regretfully, we were never here.
Yes, sir.
A clinic?
What's a nice car like you doing in a dump like this?
Pretty hefty security system...
Go flank in from the other side!
Acknowledged.
What?
There's no way for you to hack my cyberbrain in here.
Die, Puppeteer!
Over there?
Batou?
That's... ?
Dodge!
You dumbass!
Until I get back, play dead.
Acknowledged.
Halt!
Major？
It's been a while, Batou.
What are you doing here?
I knew it.
I might ask you the same question.
Call it conducting a personal inquiry for an investigation.
It's coming!
Wait.
What the...
Hold this a moment.
Isn't this...
Ma Sha-Ba?
It appears that you know quite a bit.
Know quite a bit... ?
Hey, what exactly are you up to?
Who knows?
I'll be having that back.
I see that you've changed your taste in cars.
When did she... ?
But this one's not bad either.
Batou, I'm guessing that you're here to investigate the serial suicides of those tattooed men.
A word to the wise, stay away from the Solid State society, or you'll end up killing yourself just like them.
You'll have to find your own ride.
Did I not order you to bring a subordinate along?
That's why I brought that tincan with me.
We came too late.
Ma Sha-Ba's already dead.
The cause of death?
He suffered a fatal concussion when he lost control of the robot and crashed.
It looks like Ma Sha-Ba wasn't the Puppeteer after all.
Batou, why did he come at you with that thing?
Who knows?
That's what I would have liked to ask him.
Perhaps he attacked you because he mistook you for the Puppeteer?
Hey, what is this Puppeteer you keep mentioning?
At present, the hypothesis is that it may be the codename for a suspect who may have caused the deaths of the tattooed men and Ka Ru-Ma by hacking into their cyberbrains and forcing them to kill themselves.
Judging from his skill, he might be a hacker surpassing wizard class.
Wizard class...
Chief.
We've found out what Ka Ru-Ma's plan for terror was.
What was it?
You should come over and see for yourself.
Ka Ru-Ma intended to implant micromachines into these children in order to disseminate a virus.
What the hell?
This isn't a retaliation plan, this is utter inhumanity!
Sooner or later, Section 9 will probably track me back to this place.
Loki, Conan, I leave the rest to you.
It seems that I can only handle at most two concurrent cybernetic bodies.
The only way left may be to wipe and retrain them from scratch.
I see.
We've even tried natural oil.
However, due to the different subjects, we were unable to achieve results of the same degree.
You're still concerned over the development of these guys?
Africa was much tougher than I had expected.
Even with upgraded augmentations, I'm still exhausted.
Further implants could mess up your cardiopulmonary function, you know.
Can't be helped.
It's an occupational hazard.
Togusa and you, I really take my hat off to you guys.
From the roster we found at the scene, the operatives involved in the plan include :
the thirteen suicides, Ka Gae-Ru, Ma Sha-Ba, and a certain Raj Poot.
In all, sixteen people.
Who is this Raj Poot?
Could he be the Puppeteer?
It appears that he is not yet in the country.
The communications log would also indicate this.
Not many people would stick with a leader who insisted that they follow him to the grave.
Such is often the sorry end of dictators.
But there were actually sixteen people, huh...
You're late, Batou!
Oh？
When did you get back?
Just now.
Azuma!
Please carry on.
Moving on.
Lieutenant?
Regarding the missing micromachine virus:
A case containing 144 ampoules containing a genetically modified organic virus has been brought into the country, a biological weapon with a time delayed mechanism.
And this hot potato has vanished into thin air.
Batou.
Are you certain that you didn't run into anyone else at Ma Sha-Ba's clinic?
Yeah.
And there was no sign of anyone who might have caused the robot to go out of control?
Nope.
I see.
What exactly are you trying to ask here?
Ah, nevermind...
Actually, we still haven't traced the owner of that smashed car.
Isn't it possible that it was stolen?
From the look of the car security system installed, I would say no.
Furthermore, the surveillance camera footage was somehow partially erased.
This seems to indicate that someone else was present at the scene.
By someone else, you mean the Puppeteer?
Perhaps.
Although Ka Ru-Ma's plan was never implemented, but there is a possibility that this hacker called the Puppeteer may commit independent acts of terror.
While we are tracking down the micromachine ampoules, we also need to focus on investigating this Puppeteer.
Yes, sir!
Togusa.
What do I do?
Go take a break.
Individual body maintenance should take precedence.
Understood.
I'll do that, then.
By the way, Batou?
This morning the Chief had a talk with me and said that it's about time for you to choose your next assignment.
Would you rather concentrate on your duties as training officer, or participate in the Puppeteer investigation under my direction?
It's your call.
Which will it be?
Isn't it obvious?
The Puppeteer, of course.
I see.
Did you find anything?
Yeah, we hit paydirt.
Let's have it.
Firstly, medical examination of the sixteen children reveal no sign of their having been implanted with micromachines at all.
Although suffering from dehydration and injuries from maltreatment, basically, they're fairly healthy.
However, the sixteen of them have had their memories partially erased, and their personal IDs altered to assign them fake parents.
They could remember their names and addresses, but as far as their parents were concerned, they had not the slightest recollection.
Furthermore, upon investigation, the addresses given by them turned out to be residences of old folks living alone.
Could those old folks actually be their parents?
No.
From a granny living in a four-and-a-half-tatami flat, to the rich old codger who could afford personal nursing support robots, there were all sorts, but without exception, all were "Kifu* Aged" hooked up to the healthcare monitoring network.
*貴腐 (kifu), meaning noble rot.
Obviously, there was no sign whatsoever that they had ever lived with children.
Although the household registrations list them as the parents, most likely, these records were doctored.
What's a "Kifu Aged"?
It refers to the bedridden elderly connected to an automated monitoring system which tends to their basic healthcare needs, just like noble-rot infested grapes withering away on the vine.
That's where the name comes from.
This system was originally developed to deal with the problem of an aging population, and at the same time, prevent old folks living alone from dying unnoticed in their homes.
Unexpectedly, connecting to the network instead rendered its users comatose.
The LPO slammed it as the "vegetable legacy retrieval system".
You're pretty well-informed.
The old bags at the parlor often chat with me about it.
It's sort of like an economy model of the terminal Ka Ru-Ma had.
Wait a minute.
Wasn't it Ka Gae-Ru's intent to make human bombs out of the children?
Why then did he specifically erase their memories of their parents?
Rather than planting them somewhere after infecting them with the virus, would it not have been simpler to erase their memories of the abductions, and send them back to their parents?
How should I know?
That's true.
They even had cyberbrains specially implanted.
It really is too extravagant.
Actually, the implants seem to have been performed prior to the abductions.
The transform components also appear to be legit.
In that case, there should be records of the implants at the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.
A guardian is required to sign off on the procedure before it can be performed on a six year old.
There were 144 missing ampoules.
To be on the safe side, let's check this out.
Try and find if there are any matching children in the records.
Assuming that those sixteen kids we rescued had their implants done through through legitimate channels, their records would have been automatically registered with the Ministry of Health's database.
If they were abducted and had their household records doctored after the implants had been registered, the number of children with cyberbrain implants listed in the Ministry of Internal Affairs' resident registry should conflict with the number of such children registered with the Ministry of Health's database.
Now I see.
Since those sixteen had their family names altered to match those of the elderly invalids, in theory this should work.
Twenty thousand?
There must be some kind of mistake.
If children were being abducted in such vast numbers, surely someone would have noticed by now.
True.
In any case, this figure far exceeds anything we ever expected.
What now?
Let's start by eliminating the impossible.
First, sort the list of extraneous children in the data by name and address.
Leave that to me, I'll be done in a sec.
A trap?
!
This is an emergency warning.
Presence of a Level E class virus has been confirmed.
Please shutdown all machines immediately.
Emergency warning...
Emergency warning...
Level E class virus...
Please shutdown all machines...
Engaging emergency server lockdown...
It's no use, the system is not accepting commands.
Hiragi, Soma, backup the data now!
We can't, it's already been infected!
Our only option is to cut the power!
Help me out.
Was the virus embedded in the Ministry of Internal Affairs database?
We've lost the data on that end.
Is the data from the Ministry of Health intact?
Yes, but why?
Out of the way!
Right now, it must be buzzing like an overturned beehive over at the Ministry of Internal Affairs as well.
Dammit!
We just chopped away our best lead.
In any case, it seems now that there must actually have been twenty thousand abductions, huh?
What do you mean?
Normally, twenty thousand is an implausible number of abductions for Ka Gae-Ru's outfit to have pulled off.
The perpetrator's modus operandi is also too amateurish for it to have been the work of the Puppeteer.
We need only look at the facts of the abductions - the discrepancies due to the tampering of the household registrations is like a big sign saying "I nabbed them, come and find me!"
I can't help but think that the Puppeteer has some other purpose in mind.
I agree with your point of view.
Chief.
This case was dropped off at the Ministry of Health's Pathogenic Microbes Repository Unit.
Subsequent analysis proved that it was indeed the Seok manufactured micromachine virus.
This proves that the information we gathered was right on the money.
Do we know who dropped the case off?
There were no records whatsoever of when the case was dropped off, nor any footage of the courier.
Could this could be the Puppeteer?
That's possible.
If so, what is the Puppeteer's motive in all this, if not to commit acts of terror?
From the looks of it, this Puppeteer might be a hacker working for some governmental agency or other.
I was bewildered by the elaborate coverup of Ka Ru-Ma's death.
After some digging of my own, I discovered that Prime Minister Kabayuki and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had canceled a volatile conference on the threat posed by him.
In other words, Ka Ru-Ma, the thorn in the administration's side, had already been dealt with by the hacker employed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as far as they were concerned.
At present, that would seem to be the situation, yes.
If so, maybe we should write this mass abduction thing off as a bluff after all.
Which section was responsible for this?
This case carries great international significance.
Considering the events that have occurred to this point, our stance on the matter should be similar to that of the administration.
I believe that we should leave well alone on this matter.
Therefore, concentrate on establishing the identities of those sixteen children.
Put the Puppeteer investigation on hold for now.
That is all.
Aw, geez.
All that work for nothing, and a huge mess to clean up.
We at least have to help those kids find their parents quickly.
I'm just setting off now.
Sorry about that.
I have a question.
What is it?
Was it the Treaties Bureau that made an old warhorse like you back off from the case?
About that?
I cut a deal with Nakamura.
I turn a blind eye on their covert operations, and in return, we get a free hand to investigate the matter of this micromachine virus.
And that is fine?
If purging Ka Ru-Ma was required for the good of the country, surely we should be dismayed that we were passed over for this vital task?
What, then, was the point of you expanding Section 9 over these past two years, old timer?
If we keep going like this, she won't come back.
Whether being passed over for an assassination order should bring regret or rejoicing, that question may determine what direction the Section will go in the future.
I know what you are trying to say, but we must also consider the possibility that the Major may never return.
Her talent is more precious to me than even an esper's.
In truth, no one can ever live up to her.
Likewise, it's impossible for me to stick around at this post forever.
Therefore, instead of having to expend all of our strength to crack one case,
I would rather build an organisation where we can use an eighth of our strength to crack three cases.
Don't you think that, in this way, we can better carry on our ideals?
This was what I had in mind when I expanded Section 9.
Promoting Togusa to squad leader was also part of this process.
Though, if you had been willing to accept the post at the time, things might be entirely different now.
I'm not suitable for that position.
If you say so.
That might even be true.
But not for Togusa.
Even so, in order for his potential to flourish, he must learn to overcome adversity.
I hope that you can help him along.
I thought as much.
But he's done quite well, actually.
Much like the Major, he's always fair and balanced, whether at home or at work.
For the sake of Section 9, he's even discussed cybernization with his family.
But gaining the acceptance of another is hard to do.
Indeed, I myself have not been able to gain that.
We haven't had a good long talk like this for a while now.
Looks like I won't be coming home tonight, either.
That can't be helped.
You have heavy responsibilities at work now.
Have the kids been good?
Yeah.
But last week our girl asked to sleep on her own in her room.
It's been calm, but I do kind of miss the sibling fights.
Really?
She's a big girl now.
Oh course!
She's already six.
Six, huh?
Snap a picture of her asleep and send it to me, will you?
Sure.
Togusa, we have an situation!
Get over to Area 47 right now!
What happened?
Sempai, I'm sorry, all the children...
They had all gone missing by the time I got here.
Is this the same thing that happened with Ka Gae-Ru?
Looks like it.
The Puppeteer...
If Proto had really wanted to kill himself, he could have pulled the trigger anytime.
This is nothing but a ploy to stall for time!
Ishikawa, Boma!
Use the IR system to locate the children immediately!
Given our current situation, that may have limited use.
At the same time, request support from the prefectural police.
Bring Proto over to the analysis lab.
Togusa, we need to talk!
Later!
Right now, we need to find the missing kids!
This is important!
I may have some insight into the Puppeteer's identity!
It's Aramaki.
Thank you.
You're late.
Sorry, I was delayed by work.
Colonel Tonoda, how's your health?
Back to his old hobby, I see.
Cut the man some slack already.
They say that his health problems arose from the psychological stress of his time in the penitentiary.
What's with Tsujisaki?
He didn't drop by even once.
And to think that I favoured him the most.
He's forgotten me, the ingrate!
His memory seems to be going as well.
Step out for a moment.
I have something for you.
So ends the legendary Akaoni Poacher in ignominy.
You should consider marrying again.
Tragic is the fate of lonely old men.
I have no desire for something that I can't bring with me to the grave.
The same old retort, I see.
So, what is it that you have for me?
Right, take this.
Actually, I ran into the Major back at Ma Sha-Ba's clinic.
The Major... ?
It couldn't be... ?
I didn't think it was possible at first as well, but now I'm getting increasingly worried that she might actually be the Puppeteer.
I missed my chance to speak up earlier.
Did you see her do Ma Sha-Ba in?
No, but I did see her take the case of ampoules.
Previously, I would intervene every time we crossed paths with the Major during an investigation.
I've always assumed that she, in her own way, was there to guide us along to break the case.
But it's different this time.
Exactly what does the Major intend?
That I don't know.
But even odds are, the Major was present at the scene of those suspected assassinations.
Batou.
Hurry to Daikyuu ring highway No. 16 with Saito immediately.
This is a matter of utmost priority!
Chief, we have a situation here as well.
The Puppeteer has turned up at Section 9.
What did you say?
Old timer, the Puppeteer appears to...
Let's not jump to conclusions.
I want to confirm this for myself.
Chief.
Since that fellow moved preemptively against us, can we further pursue this matter?
Since that's the case, carry on.
Roger that.
What happened on your side?
Two hours ago, surveillance cameras in the Engan area happened to pick up the image of a known international criminal.
Hmm?
Who would that be?
He sounds formidable, if you need me and Saito to take him down together.
A former Seok Republic class A+ sniper Lieutenant Raj Poot.
Raj Poot？
That's...
That last man who was not yet in the country?
He was head of Ka Ru-Ma's personal bodyguard.
It's believed that he fled to China after Seok was dissolved.
For him to take to the stage at this point is mighty suspicious.
Fortunately, the Intelligence Division has managed to pinpoint his current whereabouts.
The two of you shadow him and try to discover what he is up to.
Roger that.
Togusa, if the Major is the Puppeteer, then she has become our enemy.
I don't even want to think about that.
One of these days, I will return this favor.
Colonel Tonoda, I take my leave of you for today.
Like father, like son...
Like man, like robot...
You didn't turn out to be anything like me.
It is gratifying to know that a phoenix can fledge from an old crow's nest.
Do take care of your health.
Thank you.
Colonel, you take care as well.
How will that guy take out his target?
Like me, he will use his Hawkeye to acquire the target through real-time satellite imaging before taking the shot.
In that case, there will come a point when our GPS tracker will fail due to the inteference caused by the Hawkeye satellite downlink.
We need to apprehend him before that happens.
Got that.
Let's visually confirm the target.
Be sure not to alert him.
Target confirmed.
There's no mistake, it's him alright.
Togusa.
The IR system has located one of the missing children.
Really?
Where?
He's moving through a small construction lot in Kohoku Park.
That's near my place.
Right.
I'll check it out.
I'll inform the prefectural police as well.
Meanwhile, we'll return to investigating the twenty thousand child abductions.
I see.
Damn.
I guess I'll have to put this matter of the Major aside for now.
The Puppeteer, I presume?
I don't really need to ask, no?
Public Security Section 9 just called to inquire if I knew a hacker called the Puppeteer.
I told them I didn't.
So, you were looking for me?
I've come to refund your fee.
It doesn't matter to us whether you actually had anything to do with it or not - your mission objective was achieved.
I regret to say that this is the end.
I am going now.
Leave some way to contact you over the net, then.
Anything will do.
Was this was a puppet too?
What a waste.
Her talent and skill were outstanding.
It'll be daybreak soon.
I wonder why he even bothered turning up now when their plan is already in shambles?
Perhaps to avenge Ka Ru-Ma's death?
That sounds plausible, but how in the world did he get a hold of that intelligence?
Even we were almost left in the dark about that.
That's true.
How long does he intend to keep driving around, anyway?
Speaking of which, look over there.
That's...
Togusa.
The boy has entered apartment no. 602 of block M-26.
You know the way?
Yeah.
I know this neighborhood like the back of my hand.
A "Kifu Aged"?
Return him to me!
I've left all my assets to the child.
I'd rather have him as my heir than forfeit it all to the government.
The poor thing would just have ended up being abused to death, if we had done nothing.
This is the common resolve of all the residents of Solid State, our little game - nay, our grand enterprise.
Do not meddle in our affairs, if you wish to avoid becoming yet another suicide.
You have been warned.
My gut feeling tells me that his target is somewhere over there.
Turn off the cyberbrain, then help him find a guardian.
Yes, sir.
Death has been confirmed.
Requesting permission to dispose of the remains and retrieve the system terminal.
Dispose?
That's strange.
Didn't he have family?
Our data indicates that he should have a six year old son.
A mistake in the records?
Oh joy.
Even more work for us.
A mistake in the records?
No, that's not it.
That's only because I rescued him.
Which means that, but for my intervention, those social workers would have found and taken the boy into protection as planned.
The suicides of those operatives.
The missing children.
"Kifu Aged".
The common resolve of all the residents of Solid State.
No, what is this Solid State in the first place?
What did that old man mean?
It's me.
Thank goodness I finally got through, please hurry home, our girl's gone missing!
This is it.
Now!
Wait!
Damn, therm-optic camouflage?
How did this happen?
I've been cut off from the GPS system.
The Puppeteer?
But my kid doesn't have a cyberbrain!
I need you to trace which satellite that bastard is using.
Since we've lost visual contact, our one and only chance to stop him will be the moment before he takes the shot.
I might be able to trace the satellite, but how do we stop him?
That should is his field of fire.
From up here, we should have line of sight to his sniping point, although he will spot us easily as well.
Wear this, or you'll be exposed.
There's no time, our opponent is about to act.
We play to win.
It's begun.
Done!
Send it.
That's his target?
The satellite tracks him at SE37.
There he is.
Drop the link before it feeds back!
He's on to us!
Saito!
Did I nail him?
Wait here, I'll go confirm.
Come on, come on...
Huh?
Papa!
How is it?
Have some faith in yourself.
I see.
Hey, who was that man you were trying to off?
Why were you trying to kill him?
To avenge the Generalissimo, I will kill every last one of you Jap motherfuckers!
Avenge?
Don't fuck around with me!
Now, what was the source of your intel?
A mole turned it over to me.
He told me who was behind the Generalissimo's death, so that I could cap the bitch.
And does this mole have a name?
A representative named Munei Ito who frequents the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Old timer, have this Munei fellow taken into custody immediately.
Also, this is an image of Raj's intended target.
Looks like he was the mastermind behind Ka Ru-Ma's assassination.
Eh?
Unless I'm mistaken, that man is Munei Ito.
How could this be?
Your informant is the exact same guy you were trying to kill!
God knows.
Maybe he was suicidal or something.
Suicidal... ?
Hey, could it be that the Puppeteer set you up as well?
Fuck.
You may just be right.
Were he only human, I'd take that bastard out first of all.
Instead, I got myself taken out by a superior foe.
The Puppeteer is not human?
It's an abduction infrastructure built into Solid State.
Solid State?
Hey, what does that mean?
You don't know?
That is to say, the healthcare monitoring network.
The government of your so-called democratic country takes part in child abductions.
What a farce.
Old timer, dispatch a paramedic team and helicopter over to this place.
Also, run a background check on this Munei.
This is too weird.
I understand.
Then, I found her just after calling you.
It seems like she went over to the neighbor's place in the morning.
Is that so?
Thank goodness it turned out to be nothing.
You shouldn't run off by yourself without telling Mama the next time.
Yeah.
Well then, I'll send you to school.
I feel a bit guilty about heading right back to work like this.
Is that alright?
You look exhausted to me.
I'm invigorated just by seeing your faces.
Really?
That's great.
See ya!
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing.
Togusa!
I've bagged Raj Poot over here.
The Puppeteer appears to be involved as well.
You mean... the Major?
Yeah, but as it turns out, the Major is most likely not the Puppeteer.
Raj Poot claims that the Puppeteer is an abduction infrastructure built into the healthcare monitoring system.
Abduction infrastructure?
He referred to the healthcare monitoring network as "Solid State", and insinuated that our government was mixed up in this somehow.
Back when I ran into the Major, she had actually warned me to stay away from the Solid State society.
Initially, I had thought that "Solid State" was a reference to "soshi*", ...
*The kanji characters for electronic element 素子(soshi) can also be read as motoko, the Major's name..
... in other words, to stay away from the Major herself.
*The kanji characters for electronic element 素子(soshi) can also be read as motoko, the Major's name..
But in fact, she was telling us to stay away from the healthcare monitoring network.
Ka Ru-Ma and company were most likely purged because they discovered the infrastructure, and tried to use it for their own ends.
So that's how it is.
It's from Mama.
Hold for a moment.
Hello?
You ignored our warning.
Who is this!
For that, we will take your adorable daughter.
Togusa!
Togusa!
Ishikawa, can you pinpoint Togusa's present location?
Eh?
Not a problem, what's wrong?
Togusa's cyberbrain's been hacked into!
Papa, we're going the wrong way.
You're the Puppeteer?
Why are you abducting all those children?
Where have twenty thousand kids vanished to?
We only wish to utilize resources that have slipped through the net of society.
Soon, you will experience this for yourself.
Batou!
I've found Togusa's present location.
The Cyberbrain Implant Hospital in Kohoku Ward.
Now I get it.
You could get the implant performed without arousing any suspicions if you made a parent bring his child down to the hospital himself.
Erase the child's memories, send her over to an elderly invalid's home, and the abduction is complete.
Afterwards, you'd only need to alter my memories to make me think that I had lost her.
Don't feel too bad about getting your memories altered.
In today's world, the incidence of such cases are already more common than, say, traffic accidents.
You're offering me one last alternative?
That's the place!
I won't let you take my daughter.
Listen, will you do as Papa says?
Start running as fast as you can when Papa lets go of your hand.
Run?
That's right.
There will be a loud bang, just like at the school sports meet.
Once you hear that, run that way and keep running.
Don't stop, and don't ever look back.
Can you do that?
Yeah.
Good girl.
Close your eyes.
I'm so sorry.
Goodbye.
Togusa!
I love you.
TOGUSA!
Max, Musashi!
It's OK, everything's fine.
Major!
I must apologize for holding off until the last moment to save you.
Major, you're not the Puppeteer?
Where were you all this time?
Papa!
Wandering on the net alone after leaving Section 9, I came across this unconventional case by chance.
Eventually I found out about the abductions, and began my own investigation into the matter.
I can't believe that you actually used Togusa as bait!
Didn't you stop to think that you might be endangering his family as well?
I set him up with safeguards, of course.
Thanks to him, we can finally unmask the Puppeteer.
Isn't the Puppeteer just a system built into the healthcare monitoring network?
Rather than a system, I would call it a collective consciousness formed by the elderly invalids hooked up to the network.
However, there must also exist a hub cyberbrain who integrated them in the first place.
A hub cyberbrain?
Hey, isn't that...
The data from my network trace being extracted from Togusa's cyberbrain.
Ah, Batou!
Long time no see!
You're looking well!
Good to see that you've been taking care of yourself.
The elderly monitoring system has contained a backdoor function ever since it was designed.
Look.
This is the full scope of the rhizome formed by the collective consciousness of those elderly invalids in the network.
There is no concept of a center in a rhizome, therefore the hub has no fixed position within the rhizome, or rather, the rhizome itself is constantly in flux.
I get the idea, but who does that hub cyberbrain belong to?
Max, Musashi, report your findings.
Well?
Ah, how do I put this...
You failed?
b..but we managed to locate his current whereabouts.
And where would that be?
The complex grounds of the Seishomin* Welfare Center which takes charge of the elderly monitoring system.
*聖庶民 (seishomin), meaning "Sacred Citizen".
The personnel have arrived.
Releasing locks.
It's been a while, Major.
Indeed.
Though I wish it could have been under happier circumstances.
Why did you change your mind and return?
We'll talk about that later.
Right now, our priority should be to catch the Puppeteer.
Munei Ito, member of the Diet's House of Representatives.
Finding out why he was marked for death is our one key to uncover the Puppeteer's identity.
Munei has long been an advocate of a racially pure Japan, a reactionary conservative nationalist.
He frequents the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and has close ties with the Treaties Bureau.
He participated in the plan to assassinate Ka Ru-Ma.
Major, you mean...
I had a contract with the Treaties Bureau to covertly assassinate Ka Ru-Ma, but the Puppeteer got there first.
So you were only responsible for the subsequent coverup?
That's more or less it.
We also discovered that Munei instigated an management reshuffle at the Seishomin Welfare Center in order to solidify his control over the facility.
How will that benefit him?
Isn't this a welfare facility that provides elderly healthcare monitoring and vocational training?
Right.
But several rogue politicians are using it as a front for something entirely different.
In actual fact, he is using his cover as treasurer to run a power elite education project.
In other words, a glorified brainwashing facility.
So this is what Raj Poot meant about government involvement.
If the Puppeteer was using this place as a temporary holding center for the abducted children, then Munei turning it into a brainwashing facility would pose a problem for him.
Chief.
How about we conduct a forced search?
Finding the children should be our top priority,
But conducting a raid will cause a scandal.
When that happens, those shitty politicians won't be the only ones whose asses get toasted.
Ishikawa, how's the situation?
Is that the Major?
Geez, you could have turned up sooner.
Although we've verified the receipt of a massive quantity of components that may have been used to construct HC-25 brainwashing devices, that alone is insufficient evidence to justify a raid.
What about images from the inside?
I could only obtain footage from the workshop zone.
The education zone is protected by a firewall in the form of complex barrier maze.
It looks to be completely impenetrable.
There are only refugees here.
The abducted children are being held in the education zone, then?
That can only mean that this facility was built with the abduction infrastructure in place from the start.
If not, it's hard to imagine that a politician would dare to introduce such an audacious policy.
You mean to say that the Puppeteer have must have been one of the system designers behind this project?
Ishikawa, prepare the decoder for an attempt to hack through the barrier maze.
I'll make the dive.
If worse come to worst, Section 9 can carry on so long as you and Togusa remain.
Batou.
I absolutely refuse to hear such talk from you.
Are you implying that you'll be retiring as well after this?
I appreciate your sentiments, but I only came here to unmask the Puppeteer.
It's true that we may need to hang someone out to dry this time, and at this point, I have nothing left to lose.
Chief.
It's unfortunate, but I say we raid them.
The Puppeteer is waiting for a chance to eliminate Munei.
I do not wish to see this opportunity slip us by.
But how are we going to pick out the Puppeteer?
At this point, we still have yet to determine his identity.
Leave that to my ghost's whisper.
Woo!
It feels great!
Hi!
Long time no see, everyone!
Here goes.
Move out!
As I thought, nothing beats the thrill of racing along in a physical body again.
Really?
My joints seem a bit creaky though.
Look like another intrusion like before, but something feels different this time.
In any case, secure the perimeter.
Understood.
Professionals like us, huh?
In that case let's get to know each other a bit.
Another hacking attempt by the Investigations section?
What a complete waste of effort.
Let's do an inspection before we leave.
Pazu and Boma, secure our route of withdrawal.
Roger that.
Who are you people?
Why would you want to know?
I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
Huh?
The comms were cut off.
Security cyborgs incoming.
Major, go on ahead.
The one who went in is done for.
Go after those still outside.
Understood.
They opened fire without any warning.
So this place really is a highly sensitive government front.
He's coming after us.
Over there will be fine.
No heat signatures or shadows a Kyo-Re cloaking device?
That means...
Your information is antiquated.
They don't refer to the Model 3302 as a cloaking device anymore.
Finish them.
Roger!
Back me up.
I've almost taken control of the system.
Leave it to me.
Hasn't it always been this way?
Togusa, where are you now?
Major.
I'm currently approaching the roof via the outer wall.
Good.
Carry on and rendezvous with the Chief on the roof.
I've located the children.
Let's go!
Representative Munei, this is Public Security Section 9.
We have already verified the situation here.
It seems we have no choice but to insist on a full scale search of this facility.
Public Security?
Although not under its official auspices, this is a vital facility for the nation.
How dare you Public Security people come barging in here with your overinflated sense of justice!
Representative.
Even so, it is clear from the situation here that it is our job to intervene in such matters.
For a public official, you do not seem to be able to comprehend the crisis facing our nation right now.
If we carry on as we are, in the near future, our nation's prosperity will be displaced by that of foreigners.
To prevent this from occurring, we are investing in this education program for these wards of the state, entrusting our nation's future to them.
Is there anything wrong with that?
The funding for this investment wouldn't happen to have been procured through the exploitation of those elderly invalids and refugees in your care, would it?
That couldn't be helped.
Just think, what have they ever done for this country?
They never started a family, or raised children, and are themselves exempt from taxation.
Selfishly wasting away their lives, and then expecting us to take care of them in their dotage.
What a shameless lot.
If it were up to me, I would even lay a tax on them to make up for the loss to the state caused by their being no longer fit for the workforce.
This is nothing but rhetoric.
What, then, have politicians like you ever done for this country either?
Indulging in egotism, and placing political self-preservation above the needs of others.
Who was responsible for ignoring such social problems until things came to a head?
I am proud to say that I, for my own part , have always been conscientious towards my duties.
Even if it infringes upon human rights, and violates cyberbrain ethics?
That is an unfortunate but necessary sacrifice.
You really are a bloody-minded fellow.
Major. we've verified the number of the children being held here.
It's nowhere near twenty thousand, at most three thousand kids.
Is that right?
Switch over to autistic mode.
Roger that.
Representative.
Did you know that the system in this center has been automatically abducting children?
These children aren't orphans.
A large proportion of them have been abducted.
It was our investigation into the abductions that led us here, therefore, you are an important witness in this case.
Although I was the director of this project, this is the first I've heard of such a bug in the system!
In that case, allow us to question the system designers involved.
It was I.
It was I who designed the core principles behind the Solid State system.
Togusa, take the lot of them into custody!
Yes, ma'am!
Batou, before this guy's memories vanish, I want to dive into his cyberbrain.
Back me up!
Going manual!
Batou, are you reading his signal?
Yeah.
I'll amplify the output.
I see the memory unit, but the signal strength is dropping fast.
Batou, can you amplify his output signal any further?
I'll get a Tachikoma to help.
You disengage for now.
There's no time for that.
Do you see me, Puppeteer?
Do you see me, Puppeteer?
Puppeteer?
I mean the hub cyberbrain who integrated the rhizome of the "Kifu Aged".
Hub?
His visual signal has dropped out...
We're losing him...
Hey, what's wrong?
Batou, I'm routing his audio signal over to my speech center.
I should offer you my thanks.
This has gone far enough, disengage now!
Munei posed the greatest obstacle to Solid State.
I have considered purging him myself many times, but the problem was that the man is a luddite who eschews the use of cyberbrain technology.
Who are you?
What was your motive in abducting those children?
Who I am is not important.
As for my motive, perhaps it is not that different from Munei Ito's.
This country has reached the stage where we must take drastic measures in order to shift it from its doomed course.
The problem of the more than six million so-called "Kifu Aged", the rising unemployment rate in contrast with the shrinking able working population, and the low birth rate.
There is no end to the issues that need to be dealt with.
Did you know that even in this society so plagued by a low birth rate, annually no less than fifty thousand children die needlessly before they reach the age of six?
A full thirty percent of these can be attributed to domestic violence and abuse...
Well?
Can you do it?
... another eighty percent...
I can try.
... another eighty percent...
Even if the counselors, police, or other relevant authorities are are made aware of the situation, they are powerless to prevent it.
The social welfare system has failed them.
And so the potential of these children is lost to us.
Major!
If you keep this up, he'll take your consciousness with him when he dies.
Therefore?
Therefore I have focused on gathering and recycling these inadvertently misplaced resources.
I look for children listed on the abuse watchlist network as living in high-risk homes, and change their household registrations in order to give them a new life.
This is the core principle behind the Solid State system?
Correct.
Of course, aiding the "Kifu Aged" was also an indispensable goal.
They were desperately seeking their own raison d'etre.
Although they were unable to leave behind genetic progenies to inherit their DNA, at least they were able to leave successors for posterity, so that their assets would not be escheated to the state.
Furthermore, they were offered an opportunity to achieve something greater by participating in this grand enterprise.
Needless to say, they were elated, and agreed to join my cause.
You realize that this is criminal conspiracy?
Certainly.
But the ends justify the means, and there were no other means.
Removing those high-risk children from jeopardy was my foremost concern.
Even though I sacrificed my own life in the process, I regret nothing.
On the contrary, I may have finally found my reason for becoming a public official.
All that remains now is to establish Solid State as a permanent institution, and to enhance its infrastructure.
But by purging everyone who came in contact with the system one after another, you drew our attention to your plan.
I had not considered how those who were killed must have felt, but like I said, there were no other means.
With Ka Ru-Ma I can understand, but why did you want to eliminate Munei?
Because he intended to keep the children here in detention.
It was pointless to turn them into brainwashed elite cadres, when they could be given a new life of their own.
Although education is important, the children must be allowed free will to make their own choices out in the world.
That is the difference between I and Munei, and the main reason I must eliminate him.
However, this time round, you people intervened.
Still, my tactics seem to be working fairly well to this point, since I have managed to hack directly into your virtually impenetrable cyberbrain from across the plug link.
Major!
You committed suicide just to lure me into connecting?
You are one tough customer, but while I trap you within a thought maze, the rest of Section 9 can easily be dealt with.
Now that's something you don't see everyday.
A rare competent bureaucrat, if an arrogant and self-righteous ass and one who actually knows me.
Who are you, really?
Haven't you figured it out yet, Kusanagi Motoko?
How many arrogant, self-righteous asses do you know?
Until this moment, I was incarnated across a myriad of egos.
Come now, that a collective consciousness can unconsciously begin to act autonomously, is not so hard to believe.
With this, Solid State is established, and I, the vanishing mediator, now move on to the society beyond.
I can't see a thing.
Can someone give me a situation report?
You finally woke up.
Batou, there you are.
How's the situation?
Where am I?
Then, lastly, what do we do with the children?
Hmm... we probably should send them back to their real parents for the time being.
Even though their memories have been altered, and even though we know about their maltreatment at home?
But that may be for the best.
I can't answer that right now - and that decision may be out of our hands anyway.
The kids who found adopted parents before the brainwashing program began, those who that have already left the facility, what is to become of them?
It will be dealt with on a case by case basis.
They'll just have to wait while our complex judicial system comes up with a decision.
Chief, is there anything we can do?
To that, I can only answer that we can only continue struggling within the rules, and hope for the best.
We can only watch and pray that they may one day grow up to achieve their potential and answer the question that we could not.
Solid State system.
Now that I think about it, it really is an ironic name.
He actually used the cyberbrain network formed by those old folks as a transistor to store his own consciousness.
Just like a arrogant bureaucrat to think of such an idea.
Anyway, when we finally identified the Puppeteer, I got the shock of my life.
What do you mean?
It came to light after that guy died and while you were out of it.
In truth, that official has been dead for the past two years.
His name was Koshiki Takaaki, age thirty-three.
Coming from a family of bureaucrats, he was groomed from youth to be a member of the elite cadre.
After graduating from college, he immediately began working for the Ministry of Health.
Perhaps the only reason he became a bureaucrat was because he did not have anything better to do with his life.
Soon afterwards, he began refusing to turn up at the Ministry for work for some reason.
Because he was an information technology prodigy, he received special permission to remote a cybernetic body to work from home.
Eventually, he distinguished himself through his work at the Ministry.
Two years ago, his talent was recognized, and he was reassigned to the Health-Welfare joint project headed by Munei.
He secretly built his own infrastructure into the project sometime during its development.
But here's the thing.
Because he was an such an unobtrusive non-descript fellow who kept to himself, even with all the work that he had done, no one ever found out that he had really died at home from illness.
Thanks to him, the true identity of the Puppeteer will remain forever a mystery.
Are you implying that the guy's remote cybernetic body was used to impersonate him by persons unknown?
Possibly.
Or rather, that is probably the case.
If we consider those old folks, it might also have been a subconscious action taken by their collective consciousness, but we have no way of verifying that now.
I see.
Except for the record of your conversation with Koshiki taken by the Tachikoma.
Do we still have that record?
We should, although for some reason when Koshiki died, the Tachikoma insisted that the record had no further value.
Batou, did you hear the conversation?
Who knows.
At this point, it doesn't really matter, does it?
The old folks, the abused children, both matters are being brought to a resolution.
Although we were unable to unmask the Puppeteer, we can consider this case more or less closed.
This scandal will really hurt those rogue politicians, eh?
I'm mystified, Batou.
In retrospect, what was I thinking back then?
What was I searching for, when I decided to sojourn in the net alone and loitering?
The truth?
My true self?
Or that special someone?
Perhaps I was only projecting the frustration at my own helplessness onto the system.
What?
Are you getting introspective on me now?
You should be satisfied after all that, right?
So, what do you plan to do in the future?
Continue with your lonesome personal-inquiry-for-an-investigation?
I think I've had enough of that.
Although being bound by constraints was tedious, I couldn't bring myself to accept a life free of them.
In the end, it made no difference whatsoever.
Does that mean what I think it does?
Are you thinking of returning to Section 9?
But what about Togusa?
Won't that affect his career?
If his career were so easily stalled, then clearly, this was the furthest his ability would have gotten him anyway.
That's not for you to worry about.
Maybe.
But you know, Batou, the net is indeed vast and infinite.
Soon, the next unimaginable stage of society will begin to take form.
NARRATOR:
Previously on Supernatural:
-Dad.
-Sam?
DEAN:
This is bigger than you think.
They're everywhere.
SAM:
This demon killed Mom and Jess, and Dad's closing in.
-We gotta help.
-Dad doesn't want our help.
I'm talking one week here, man.
To get answers.
To get revenge.
-You think I didn't respect Dad.
-Sorry I brought it up.
SAM:
No matter what, it was never good enough.
-So, what, Dad was disappointed in you?
-When we finally do find Dad I don't know if he's even gonna wanna see me.
-Hey.
Dad?
JOHN:
Hey, boys.
-Hi, Sam.
-Hey, Dad.
Last time we were together we had one hell of a fight.
-Yes, sir.
-lt's good to see you again.
It's been a long time.
We almost got Dad killed in there.
They're not gonna stop.
DEAN:
They're gonna try again.
They're gonna use us to get to him.
Dad's vulnerable when he's with us.
-l gotta be a part of this fight.
-Sammy, this fight is just starting.
JOHN:
You gotta let me go.
[COUNTRY music playing]
[POOL BALLS CLACKING]
WOMAN:
Mr. Elkins?
Mr. Elkins.
Would you like another?
Yeah.
Thanks, Beth.
Thought they caught the Unabomber.
Yeah, poor Mr. Elkins lives all alone, up the canyon.
BETH:
Same seat every day.
Going through his papers, and making his little notes.
He's a nice old man, he's just a nut.
Here you go.
[laughing]
What will you have?
-Jack all around.
Leave the bottle.
-You hungry?
-We have dinner plans.
-Okay.
Hmm.
Can I get you something else, Mr. Elkins?
It's been a while.
I gotta say, you look old.
-What do you want?
-What do you think?
Damn.
You can do better than that.
Come-
- Come on, come on.
[POUNDING ON DOOR]
Nice gun.
Wouldn't do you much good, of course.
WOMAN:
Boys?
We're eating in tonight.
[ELKINS screaming]
Dude, not a decent lead in all of Nebraska.
What do you got?
Well, I've been scanning Wyoming, Colorado, South Dakota.
Here, a woman in Iowa fell 1 0,000 feet from an airplane and survived.
Sounds more That's Incredible!
than Twilight Zone.
-Yeah.
-Hey, you know we could just keep heading east.
New York?
Upstate?
You could stop by and see Sarah again, huh?
She's a cool chick, man.
Smoking.
[whistles]
You two seemed pretty friendly.
What do you say?
Yeah, I don't know.
Maybe someday.
But in the meantime we got a lot of work to do, Dean, and you know that.
Yeah, you're right.
What else you got?
Uh, Manning, Colorado.
A local man by the name of Daniel Elkins...
-...was found mauled in his home.
-Elkins?
I know that name.
-Doesn't ring a bell.
-Elkins.
Elkins.
Elkins.
The police don't know what to think.
SAM:
At first they said it was some bear attack and now they found signs of robbery.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
There.
Check it out.
-Think it's the same Elkins?
-lt's a Colorado area code.
Looks like the maid didn't come today.
Hey, there's salt here, right inside the door.
You mean like protection-against-demons salt or oops-l-spilled-the-popcorn salt?
It's clearly a ring.
SAM:
You think this guy Elkins was a player?
DEAN:
Definitely.
SAM:
That looks a hell of a lot like Dad's.
Yeah, except this dates back to the '60s.
SAM:
Whatever attacked him, it looks like there was more than one.
Looks like he put up a hell of a fight too.
Yeah.
You got something?
I don't know.
Some scratches in the floor.
-Death throes, maybe?
-Yeah, maybe.
Or maybe a message.
Look familiar?
Three letters, six digits.
The location and combination of a post office box.
-lt's a mail drop.
-lt's just the way Dad does it.
"J.W." You think?
John Winchester?
I don't know.
Should we open it?
[banging ON WINDOW]
Dad?
What are you doing here?
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Look, I read the news about Daniel.
I got here as fast as I could.
I saw you two up at his place.
-Why didn't you come in, Dad?
-You know why.
Because I had to make sure you weren't followed by anyone or anything.
Nice job of covering your tracks, by the way.
Yeah, well, we learned from the best.
Wait, so you came all the way out here for this Elkins guy?
Yeah.
He was....
He was a good man.
He taught me a hell of a lot about hunting.
Well, you never mentioned him to us.
We had a....
We had kind of a falling-out.
I hadn't seen him in years.
JOHN:
I should look at that.
"If you're reading this, I'm already dead."
JOHN:
That son of a bitch.
-What is it?
-He had it the whole time.
-Dad, what?
When you searched the place, did you see a gun?
An antique, a Colt revolver.
Did you see it?
Uh, there was an old case, but it was empty.
-They have it.
-You mean whatever killed Elkins?
We gotta pick up the trail.
-Wait, you want us to come with you?
-lf Elkins was telling the truth...
-...we've gotta find this gun.
-The gun?
Why?
-Because it's important, that's why.
-We don't know what these things are.
JOHN:
They were what Daniel Elkins killed best:
Vampires.
Vampires?
I thought there was no such thing.
You never even mentioned them, Dad.
I thought they were extinct.
I thought Elkins and others had wiped them out.
I was wrong.
JOHN:
Most vampire lore is crap.
A cross won't repel them, sunlight won't kill them and neither Will a stake to the heart.
but the blood lust, that part's true.
They need fresh human blood to survive.
They were once people, so you won't know it's a vampire until it's too late.
[GLASS shattering]
All yours, baby.
[chuckling]
What?
-Well, I guess you showed that guy.
-What guy?
The guy who bet you you wouldn't buy that shirt.
I love this shirt.
No, look out!
[tires SCREECHING]
-What happened to him?
-Call 91 1 .
WOMAN [OVER radio]:
Unit 22, let me confirm.
Mile marker 41 , abandoned car.
You need a Workup?
Copy that.
Possible 207.
better get Forensics out here.
-Sam, Dean, let's go.
DEAN:
Mm-hm.
JOHN:
I picked up a police call.
-What happened?
A couple called 91 1 , found a body in the street.
Cops got there, everyone was missing.
It's the vampires.
How do you know?
Just follow me, okay?
[SCOFFS]
Vampires.
Gets funnier every time I hear it.
[CHATTER OVER POLICE radio]
SAM:
I don't see why we couldn't have gone with him.
-Oh, don't tell me it's already starting.
-What's starting?
-What do you got?
-lt was them, all right.
Looks like they're heading west.
We have to get around that detour.
-How can you be sure?
-Sam.
I just wanna know we're going in the right direction.
-We are.
-How do you know?
I found this.
It's a vampire fang.
No fangs, teeth.
A second set descends when they attack.
Any more questions?
All right, let's get out of here, we're losing daylight.
Hey, Dean, why don't you touch up your car before you get rust.
I wouldn't have given you the damn thing if I thought you were gonna ruin it.
Vampires nest in groups of eight to 1 0.
Smaller packs are sent out to hunt for food.
Victims are taken to the nest.
The pack keeps them alive, bleeding them for days or weeks.
I wonder if that's what happened to that 91 1 couple.
That's probably what Dad's thinking.
Course, it would be nice if he just told us what he thinks.
So it is starting.
What?
Sam, we've been looking for Dad all year.
We're with him a couple hours and there's static already?
No.
Look, I'm happy he's okay, all right?
I'm happy we're all working together again.
Well, good.
It's just the way he treats us like we're children.
-Oh, God.
-He barks orders at us, Dean.
He expects us to follow them without question.
He keeps us on some need-to-know deal.
-He does what he does for a reason.
-What reason?
Our job.
There's no time to argue, it's just the way the old man runs things.
Well, maybe that worked when we were kids, but not anymore.
Not after everything you and I have been through.
You telling me you're cool with falling into line, letting him run the whole show?
If that's what it takes.
[COUNTRY music playing]
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
Have some beer, buddy.
It'll calm your nerves.
-No, thanks.
-Oh, come on.
You drink enough, I can taste it in your blood.
That's gross.
[CHUCKLES]
How about you, babe?
Attagirl.
-You--!
KATE:
Bo!
Wait for Luther.
[laughing]
[moaning]
I missed you too, baby.
We've got presents.
She looks interesting.
He doesn't.
Lock him up.
MAN:
Let's go.
[chuckling]
On second thought, go ahead and treat yourself.
MAN:
Yeah.
[screaming]
There's something else.
-This all theirs?
-No.
It's from an old friend of yours, Daniel Elkins.
I caught his scent and I thought I'd surprise you.
Kate, what did you do?
-l made him suffer.
-You shouldn't have done that.
-Luther--
-There are others like him.
They'll know the signs and come looking.
We have to be careful.
I did it for you, for what he did to your family.
Revenge isn't worth much if you end up dead.
I'm sorry, babe.
I'm sorry.
I thought you might like that.
Looks like it was made around the time you were born.
-l've seen this before.
-Elkins died with it in his hands.
He should've known better, using a gun.
This is no ordinary gun.
Yeah, Dad.
All right, got it.
-Pull off the next exit.
-Why?
-Dad thinks we've got the vampires' trail.
-How?
I don't know.
He didn't say.
[ENGINE REVVING]
[tires SCREECHING]
DEAN:
Ah, crap.
Here we go.
Sam!
-What the hell was that?
SAM:
We need to talk.
-About what?
About everything.
Where are we going?
What's the big deal about this gun?
We can q and a after we kill all the vampires.
-We don't have time for this.
-Last time we saw you it was too dangerous to be together.
Now you need our help.
Something big is going down and we wanna know what.
-Get back in the car.
-No.
-l said, get back in the damn car.
-Yeah, and I said no.
DEAN:
You made your point, tough guy.
We're tired, we can talk about this later.
I mean it.
-Come on.
SAM:
This is why I left in the first place.
-What'd you say?
-You heard me.
Yeah.
You left.
Your brother and me, we needed you.
-You walked away.
You walked away.
DEAN:
Stop it, both of you.
You're the one who said, "Don't come back."
You're the one who closed that door.
You were just pissed off you couldn't control me anymore.
Listen.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Stop it.
That's enough.
That means you too.
[CAR DOOR SLAMS]
Terrific.
[moaning]
LUTHER:
You like to watch, huh?
Me too.
Ready, baby?
[sobbing]
Are you gonna kill me?
I'm gonna take you so high, you're never gonna come down.
Welcome home, baby.
I know what time it is.
Get in.
DEAN:
Son of a bitch.
So they're really not afraid of the sun?
Direct sunlight hurts like a nasty sunburn.
The only way to kill them is by beheading.
And yeah, they sleep during the day.
Doesn't mean they won't wake up.
So I guess walking right in is not our best option.
Actually, that's the plan.
Hey, Dad. I've got an extra machete if you need one.
Think I'm okay, thanks.
Wow.
So....
You boys really wanna know about this Colt?
Yes, sir.
It's just a story.
A legend, really.
Well, I thought it was.
I never really believed it until I read Daniel's letter.
JOHN: back in 1 835, when Halley's Comet was overhead the same night those men died at the Alamo they say Samuel Colt made a gun.
A special gun.
He made it for a hunter.
A man like us, only on horseback.
The story goes, he made 1 3 bullets.
This hunter used the gun a half dozen times before he disappeared, the gun along with him.
Until somehow, Daniel got his hands on it.
They say....
They say this gun can kill anything.
Kill anything, like supernatural anything?
Like the demon.
JOHN:
Yeah, the demon.
Ever since I picked up its trail I've been looking for a way to destroy that thing.
Find the gun we may have it.
[GLASS clinking]
Dean.
[RATTLING]
There's more.
[mumbling]
Hey.
Hey, hey.
Shh.
I'm here to help you.
[screaming] No!
DEAN:
Sam!
JOHN:
Boys, run!
SAM:
Dad!
Dad?
Dad!
They won't follow.
They'll wait till night.
Once a vampire gets your scent, it's for life.
-What the hell do we do?
-You gotta find the nearest funeral home.
It shouldn't be taking this long.
I should go help.
Dean's got it.
Sammy.
Yeah?
I never told you this but the day you were born, you know what I did?
-No.
-l put a hundred bucks into a savings account for you.
I did the same thing for your brother.
It was a college fund.
And every month, I'd put in another $1 00 until....
Anyway, my point is, Sam that this was never the life that I wanted for you.
Then why did you get so mad when I left?
You gotta understand something.
After your mother passed all I saw was evil.
Everywhere.
And all I cared about was--
Was keeping you boys alive.
I wanted you prepared.
Ready.
See, somewhere along the line, I--
I stopped being your father and l-- l became your-- Your drill sergeant.
So when you said that you wanted to go away to school all I could think about, my only thought was that you were gonna be alone.
Vulnerable.
Sammy, it just-
- It never occurred to me what you wanted.
I just couldn't accept the fact that you and me, we're just different.
What?
We're not different.
Not anymore.
With what happened to Mom and Jess we probably have a lot more in common than just about anyone.
I guess you're right, son.
Hey, Dad?
Whatever happened to that college fund?
Spent it on ammo.
[laughing]
Whew.
Man, some heavy security to protect a bunch of dead guys.
You get it?
You know what to do.
KATE:
Car trouble?
Let me give you a lift, take you back to my place.
I'll pass.
I usually draw the line at necrophilia.
Ooh.
[GRUNTlNG]
I don't normally get this friendly till the second date, but....
You know, we could have some fun.
I always like to make new friends.
Sorry.
Don't really stay with a chick that long.
Definitely not eternity.
Damn it.
KATE:
Barely even stings.
Give it time, sweetheart.
Arrow's soaked in dead man's blood.
It's like poison to you, isn't it?
Load her up. I'll take care of this one.
Toss this on the fire.
Saffron, skunk's cabbage and trillium.
It'll block our scent, and hers, until we're ready.
-Stuff stinks.
-That's the idea.
Dust your clothes with the ashes and you might not be detected.
You sure they'll come after her?
Yeah.
Vampires mate for life.
[GROANING]
She means more to the leader than the gun.
But the blood-sickness is gonna wear off soon so you don't have a lot of time.
Half-hour ought to do it.
-Then I want you out of the area fast.
-But--
Dad, you can't take care of them all.
I'll have her.
And the Colt.
But after, we're gonna meet up, right?
Use the gun together.
Right?
You're leaving again, aren't you?
You still wanna go after the demon alone.
You know, I don't get you.
-You can't treat us like this.
-Like what?
-Like children.
-You are my children.
I'm trying to keep you safe.
Dad, all due respect, but that's a bunch of crap.
-Excuse me?
-You know what we've been hunting.
Hell, you sent us on a few hunting trips yourself.
-You can't be that worried about us.
-lt's not the same thing.
Then what is it?
Why do you want us out of the big fight?
This demon it's a bad son of a bitch.
I can't make the same moves if I worry about keeping you alive.
You can't be as reckless.
Look I don't expect to make it out of this in one piece.
Your mother's death it almost killed me.
I can't watch my children die too.
I won't.
What happens if you die?
What happens if you die and we could've done something about it?
You know, I've been thinking.
I....
Maybe Sammy's right about this one.
We should do this together.
We're stronger as a family.
We just are.
You know it.
We're running out of time.
You do your job and you get out of the area.
That's an order.
-Any sign of those three?
-No.
Something else.
-What?
-Luther, they cut off Hank's head!
And Kate?
I don't know.
She wasn't there.
What are we gonna do?
Just a truck, up on the highway.
Kate.
She's in that truck.
[CREAKING]
Boo.
[WOMAN coughing]
I told you I'd come back.
LUTHER:
Get out.
-Who are you?
-Name's Winchester.
-Where are your friends?
-Cleaning out your nest.
Where's Kate?
Come here, sweetheart.
Kate, you all right?
Dead man's blood.
You son of a bitch.
I want the Colt, Elkins' gun.
A trade.
Is that what this is about?
I mean, you can't shoot us all.
We'll kill you.
Oh, I don't need it for you.
I'm saving it for something else.
Put the Colt down or she goes first.
All right.
Just don't hurt her.
Back up.
Further.
It's a nice move.
You almost made it.
[GLASS shattering]
Nope.
I'll break his neck.
Put the blade down.
[GRUNTlNG]
You people.
Why can't you just leave us alone?
-We have as much right to live as you do.
JOHN:
I don't think so.
[screaming] Luther!
Kate, don't!
So, boys....
Yes, sir?
You ignored a direct order back there.
-Yes, sir.
-Yeah, but we saved your ass.
You're right.
-l am?
-lt scares the hell out of me.
You two are all I've got but I guess we are stronger as a family.
So we go after this damn thing.
Together.
[IN unison] Yes, sir.
[ENGLISH SDH]
Dad.
Sam.
This is bigger than you think.
They're everywhere.
Sam: if this demon killed mom and jess and dad's closing in,
We got to help.
Dad doesn't want our help.
I'm talking one week here, man, to get answers, to get revenge.
You think i didn't respect dad.
Sorry i brought it up.
I respected him.
No matter what i did, it was never good enough.
So what are you saying?
That dad was disappointed in you?
When we finally do find dad,
I don't know if he's even gonna want to see me.
Hey!
Dad.
Hey, boys.
Hi, sam.
Hi, dad.
Last time we were together, we had one hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
It's good to see you again.
It's been a long time.
Sam!
Dean: we almost got dad killed.
They're not gonna stop.
They're gonna try again.
They're gonna use us to get to him.
Dad's vulnerable when he's with us.
I got to be a part of this fight.
Sammy, this fight is just starting.
You got to let me go.
Beth: mr.
Elkins?
Mr. Elkins.
Would you like another?
Yeah.
Thanks, beth.
I thought they caught the unabomber.
Yeah, poor mr.
Elkins lives all alone up in the canyon.
Same seat every day,
Going through his papers, making his little notes.
He's a nice old man.
He's just a nut.
Here you go.
What'll you have?
Jack all around.
Leave the bottle.
You hungry?
We have dinner plans.
Can i get you something else, mr.
Elkins?
It's been a while.
I got to say, you look old.
What do you want?
What do you think?
Damn.
You can do better than that.
Come on, come on.
Nice gun.
Wouldn't do you much good, of course.
Boys...
We're eating in tonight.
All right, dude, not a decent lead in all of nebraska.
What do you got?
Well, i been scanning wyoming, colorado, south dakota.
Here
- A woman in iowa fell 10,000 feet from an airplane
And survived.
Sounds more like "that's incredible!"
Than "the twilight zone."
Yeah.
Hey, you know, we could just keep heading east -
New york, upstate.
Could stop by and see sarah again.
Huh?
She's a cool chick, man.
Smokin'.
You two seemed pretty friendly.
What do you say?
Yeah, i don't know.
Maybe someday.
But in the meantime, we got a lot of work to do, dean,
And you know that.
Yeah, you're right.
What else you got?
Uh, man in colorado.
Local man by the name of daniel elkins
Was found mauled in his home.
Elkins.
I know that name.
Doesn't ring a bell.
Looks like the cops don't know what to think.
At first they said it was some sort of bear attack,
And now they found signs of robbery.
Mm-Hmm.
Yeah.
Here.
Check it out.
You think it's the same elkins?
It's a colorado area code.
Looks like the maid didn't come today.
Hey, there's salt over here, right inside the door.
You mean, like, protection-Against-Demon salt
Or "oops, i spilled the popcorn" salt?
It's clearly a ring.
You think this guy elkins was a player?
Definitely.
That looks a hell of a lot like dad's.
Except this dates back to the '60s.
Whatever attacked him, looks like there was more than one.
Looks like he put up a hell of a fight, too.
Yeah.
Got something?
I don't know.
Some scratches in the floor.
Death throes maybe?
Maybe.
Or maybe a message.
Look familiar?
Three letters, six digits -
The location and combination of a post office box.
It's a mail drop.
That's just the way dad does it.
"J.W."
- You think?
John winchester?
I don't know.
Should we open it?
Dad?
Dad, what are you doing here?
Are you all right?
Yeah, i'm okay.
Look, i read the news about daniel.
I got here as fast as i could.
I saw you two up at his place.
Why didn't you come in, dad?
You know why.
Because i had to make sure you weren't followed...
By anyone...
Or anything.
Nice job of covering your tracks, by the way.
Yeah, well, we learned from the best.
Wait, so you came all the way out here for this elkins guy?
Yeah.
He was
- He was a good man.
He taught me a hell of a lot about hunting.
You never mentioned him to us.
We had a -
We had kind of a falling out.
I hadn't seen him in years.
I should look at that.
"If you're reading this, i'm already dead."
That son of a bitch.
What is it?
He had it the whole time.
Dad, what?
When you searched the place,
Did you see a gun, an antique, a colt revolver?
Did you see it?
Uh, there was an old case, but it was empty.
They have it.
You mean whatever killed elkins?
We got to pick up their trail.
Wait.
You want us to come with you?
If elkins is telling the truth, we've got to find this gun.
The gun?
Why?
Because it's important, that's why.
Dad, we don't even know what these things are yet.
They were what danny elkins killed best...
Vampires.
Vampires?
I thought there was no such thing.
You never even mentioned them, dad.
I thought they were extinct.
I thought elkins and others had wiped them out.
I was wrong.
John: most vampire lore is crap.
A cross won't repel them.
Sunlight won't kill them
And neither will a stake to the heart.
But the bloodlust
- That part's true.
They need fresh human blood to survive.
They were once people,
So you won't know it's a vampire until it's too late.
All yours, baby.
What?
Well, i guess you showed that guy.
What guy?
The guy who bet you you wouldn't buy that shirt.
I love this shirt.
Look out!
What happened to him?
Call 911.
Man: 22, i'm going out there.
Man #2: copy that.
Sam, dean, let's go.
Picked up a police call.
What happened?
A couple called 911.
They found a body in the street.
Cops got there.
Everyone was missing.
It's the vampires.
How do you know?
Just follow me, okay?
Vampires.
It's funny every time i hear it.
[ Indistinct chatter on police radio ]
I don't see why we couldn't have gone over with him.
Oh, don't tell me it's already starting.
What's starting?
What do you got?
It was them all right.
It looks like they're heading west.
We have to double back to get around that detour.
How can you be so sure?
I just want to know we're going in the right direction.
We are.
How do you know?
I found this.
What is it?
A vampire fang?
No fangs
- Teeth.
The second set descends when they attack.
Any more questions?
Let's get out of here.
We're losing daylight.
And, dean, why don't you touch up your car before you get rust?
I wouldn't have given you the damn thing
If i thought you were gonna ruin it.
Vampires nest in groups of 8 to 10.
Smaller packs are sent out to hunt for food.
Victims are taken to the nest, where the pack keeps them alive,
Bleeding them for days or weeks.
I wonder if that's what happened to that 911 couple.
That's probably what dad's thinking.
Of course, it would be nice if he just told us what he thinks.
So it is starting.
What?
Sam, we've been looking for dad all year.
Now we're not with him for more than a couple of hours
And there's static already.
No.
Look, i'm happy he's okay, all right,
And i'm happy that we're all working together.
Good.
It's just the way he treats us like we're children.
He barks orders at us, dean.
He expects us to follow him without question.
He keeps us on some crap need-To-Know deal.
He does what he does for a reason.
What reason?
Our job!
There's no time to argue.
There's no margin for error.
It's just the way the old man runs things.
Yeah, well, maybe that worked when we were kids,
But not anymore, all right?
Not after everything you and i have been through, dean.
Are you telling me you're cool with just falling into line
And letting him run the whole show?
If that's what it takes.
Have some beer, buddy.
It'll calm your nerves.
No, thanks.
Oh, come on.
You drink enough, i can taste it in your blood.
That's gross.
Well, how about you, babe?
Attagirl.
Bo!
Wait for luther.
I missed you, too, baby.
We've got presents.
She looks interesting.
Hmm.
He doesn't.
Lock him up.
On second thought, go ahead and treat yourself.
[ Crying ] no!
There's something else.
This all theirs?
No.
It's from an old friend of yours...
Daniel elkins.
I caught his scent.
I thought i'd surprise you.
Kate, what did you do?
I made him suffer.
You shouldn't have done that.
There are others like him.
They'll know the signs and come looking for us.
We have to be careful.
Luther, i did it for you,
For what he did to your family.
Revenge isn't worth much if you end up dead.
I'm sorry, babe.
I'm sorry.
I thought you might like that.
Looks like it was made around the time you were born.
I've seen this before.
Elkins died with it in his hands.
He should have known better
- Using a gun.
This is no ordinary gun.
Yeah, dad.
All right, got it.
Pull off the next exit.
Why?
'Cause dad thinks we got the vampires' trail.
How?
I don't know.
He didn't say.
Oh, crap.
Here we go.
What the hell was that?
We need to talk.
About what?
About everything.
Where we going, dad?
What's the big deal about this gun?
We can qa after we kill all the vampires.
Your brother's right.
We don't have time for this.
Last we saw you, you said it was too dangerous to be together.
Now, out of the blue, you need our help.
Obviously something big's going down, and we want to know what!
Get back in the car.
No.
I said get back in the damn car.
Yeah, and i said no.
All right, you made your point, tough guy.
Look, we're all tired.
We can talk about this later.
Sammy, i mean it.
Come on.
This is why i left in the first place.
What'd you say?
You heard me.
Yeah, you left.
Your brother and me
- We needed you.
You walked away, sam.
You walked away!
You're the one who said, "don't come back," dad.
You're the one who closed that door, not me!
You were just pissed off you couldn't control me anymore!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
That's enough!
That means you, too.
Terrific.
Luther: you like to watch, huh?
Me too.
Ready, baby?
Are you gonna kill me?
I'm gonna take you so high you're never gonna come down.
Welcome home, baby.
I know what time it is.
Get in.
Dean: son of a bitch.
So they're really not afraid of the sun?
No, direct sunlight hurts like a nasty sunburn.
The only way to kill them is by beheading.
And, yeah, they sleep during the day.
It doesn't mean they won't wake up.
So i guess walking right in's not our best option.
Actually, that's the plan.
Dad, i've got an extra machete if you need one.
Think i'm okay.
Thanks.
Wow.
So...
You boys really want to know about this colt?
Yes, sir.
It's just a story...
A legend, really.
Well, i thought it was.
Never really believed it until i read daniel's letter.
Back in 1835, when halley's comet was overhead,
The same night those men died at the alamo,
They say samuel colt made a gun...
A special gun.
He made it for a hunter -
A man like us, only on horseback.
The story goes he made 13 bullets.
This hunter used the gun a half dozen times
Before he disappeared, the gun along with him.
Somehow, daniel got his hands on it.
They say -
They say this gun can kill anything.
Kill anything, like supernatural anything?
Like the demon.
Yeah, the demon.
Ever since i picked up its trail,
I've been looking for a way to destroy that thing.
Find the gun...
We may have it.
Sam: dean.
There's more.
Hey.
Hey, hey, shh.
I'm here to help you.
John: boys, run!
Dad!
Dad?
!
Dad?
!
They won't follow.
They'll till tonight.
Once a vampire gets your scent, it's for life.
What do we do now?
You got to find the nearest funeral home.
It shouldn't be taking this long.
I should go help.
Dean's got it.
Sammy.
Yeah?
I don't think i ever told you this,
But the day you were born, you know what i did?
No.
I put 100 bucks into a savings account for you.
I did the same thing for your brother.
It was a college fund.
And every month, i'd put in another $100 until...
Anyway, my point is, sam, that
This is never the life that i wanted for you.
Then why'd you get so mad when i left?
You got to understand something.
After your mother passed,
All i saw was evil, everywhere.
And all i cared about was keeping you boys alive.
I wanted you prepared...
Ready.
So somewhere along the line, i, uh
I stopped being your father.
And i -
I became your drill sergeant.
So when you said you wanted to go away to school,
All i could think about, my only thought,
Was that you were gonna be alone...
Vulnerable.
Sammy, it just -
It never occurred to me what you wanted.
I just couldn't accept the fact
That you and me...
We're just different.
What?
We're not different.
Not anymore.
With what happened to mom and jess
We probably have a lot more in common
Than just about anyone.
I guess you're right, son.
Hey, dad?
Whatever happened to that college fund?
Spent it on ammo.
Whoo!
Man, there's some heavy security to protect a bunch of dead guys.
Did you get it?
You know what to do.
Kate: car trouble?
Let me give you a lift...
Take you back to my place.
I'll pass.
I usually draw the line at necrophilia.
I don't normally get this friendly till the second date.
You know, we could have some fun.
I always like to make new friends.
Oh, sorry.
I never really stay with a chick that long.
Definitely not eternity.
Ugh!
Damn it.
Barely even stings.
Give it time, sweetheart.
That arrow's soaked in dead man's blood.
It's like poison to you, isn't it?
Load her up.
I'll take care of this one.
Toss this on the fire.
Saffron, skunks, cabbage, and trillium -
It'll block our scent and hers until we're ready.
Stuff stinks.
Well, that's the idea.
Dust your clothes with the ashes
And you'll stand a chance of not being detected.
You sure they'll come after her?
Yeah.
Vampires mate for life.
She means more to the leader than the gun.
But the blood sickness is gonna wear off soon,
So you don't have a lot of time.
Half-Hour ought to do it.
And then i want you out of the area as fast as you can.
But -
You can't take care of them all yourself.
I'll have her and the colt.
But after, we're gonna meet up, right?
Use the gun together, right?
You're leaving again, aren't you?
You still want to go after the demon alone?
You know, i don't get you.
You can't treat us like this.
Like what?
Like children.
You are my children.
I'm trying to keep you safe.
Dad, all due respect, but that's a bunch of crap.
Excuse me?
You know what sammy and i have been hunting.
Hell, you sent us on a few hunting trips yourself.
You can't be that worried about keeping us safe.
It's not the same thing, de.
Then what is it?
Why do you want us out of the big fight?
This demon...
It's a bad son of a bitch.
I can't make the same moves
If i'm worried about keeping you alive.
You can't be as reckless.
Look...
I don't expect to make it out of this fight in one piece.
Your mother's death...
It almost killed me.
I can't watch my children die, too.
I won't.
What happens if you die?
Dad, what happens if you die
And we could have done something about it?
You know, i've been thinking.
I think maybe sammy's right about this one.
I think we should do this together.
We're stronger as a family, dad.
We just are.
You know it.
We're running out of time.
You do your job, and you get out of the area.
That's an order.
Is there any sign of those three?
No.
Something else.
What?
Luther, they cut off hank's head.
And kate?
I don't know.
She wasn't there.
What are we gonna do?
It's just a truck up on the highway.
Kate.
She's in that truck.
Boo.
I told you i'd come back.
Luther: get out!
Who are you?
The name's winchester.
Where are your friends?
Cleaning out your nest.
Where's kate?
Come here, sweetheart.
Kate, you all right?
Dead man's blood.
You son of a bitch.
I want the colt
- Elkins' gun.
Trade.
Is that what this is all about?
I mean, you can't shoot us all, right?
We'll kill you.
Oh, i don't need it for you.
I'm saving it for something else.
Now, put the colt down or she goes first.
All right.
Just don't hurt her.
Back up.
Further.
That's a nice move.
You almost made it.
Ugh!
Don't!
I'll break his neck.
Put the blade down.
You people.
Why can't you just leave us alone?
We have as much right to live as you do.
John: i don't think so.
Luther!
Kate, don't!
So, boys...
Yes, sir?
You ignored a direct order back there.
Yes, sir.
But we saved your ass.
You're right.
I am?
It scares the hell out of me.
You two are all i've got.
But i guess we are stronger as a family.
So...
We go after this damn thing...
Together.
Yes, sir.Yes, sir.
Dad.
Sam.
This is bigger than you think.
They're everywhere.
Sam: if this demon killed mom and jess and dad's closing in,
We got to help.
Dad doesn't want our help.
I'm talking one week here, man, to get answers, to get revenge.
You think i didn't respect dad.
Sorry i brought it up.
I respected him.
No matter what i did, it was never good enough.
So what are you saying?
That dad was disappointed in you?
When we finally do find dad,
I don't know if he's even gonna want to see me.
Hey!
Dad.
Hey, boys.
Hi, sam.
Hi, dad.
Last time we were together, we had one hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
It's good to see you again.
It's been a long time.
Sam!
Dean: we almost got dad killed.
They're not gonna stop.
They're gonna try again.
They're gonna use us to get to him.
Dad's vulnerable when he's with us.
I got to be a part of this fight.
Sammy, this fight is just starting.
You got to let me go.
Beth: mr.
Elkins?
Mr. Elkins.
Would you like another?
Yeah.
Thanks, beth.
I thought they caught the unabomber.
Yeah, poor mr.
Elkins lives all alone up in the canyon.

Going through his papers, making his little notes.

He's just a nut.

We have dinner plans.
Can i get you something else, mr.
Elkins?

Daniel elkins.
I caught his scent.
I thought i'd surprise you.
Kate, what did you do?
I made him suffer.
You shouldn't have done that.
There are others like him.
They'll know the signs and come looking for us.
We have to be careful.
Luther, i did it for you,
For what he did to your family.
Revenge isn't worth much if you end up dead.
I'm sorry, babe.
I'm sorry.
I thought you might like that.
Looks like it was made around the time you were born.
I've seen this before.
Elkins died with it in his hands.
He should have known better
- Using a gun.
This is no ordinary gun.
Yeah, dad.
All right, got it.
Pull off the next exit.
Why?
'Cause dad thinks we got the vampires' trail.
How?
I don't know.
He didn't say.
Oh, crap.
Here we go.
What the hell was that?
We need to talk.
About what?
About everything.
Where we going, dad?
What's the big deal about this gun?
We can qa after we kill all the vampires.
Your brother's right.
We don't have time for this.
Last we saw you, you said it was too dangerous to be together.
Now, out of the blue, you need our help.
Obviously something big's going down, and we want to know what!
Get back in the car.
No.
I said get back in the damn car.
Yeah, and i said no.
All right, you made your point, tough guy.
Look, we're all tired.
We can talk about this later.
Sammy, i mean it.
Come on.
This is why i left in the first place.
What'd you say?
You heard me.
Yeah, you left.
Your brother and me
- We needed you.
You walked away, sam.
You walked away!
You're the one who said, "don't come back," dad.
You're the one who closed that door, not me!
You were just pissed off you couldn't control me anymore!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
That's enough!
That means you, too.
Terrific.
Luther: you like to watch, huh?
Me too.
Ready, baby?
Are you gonna kill me?
I'm gonna take you so high you're never gonna come down.
Welcome home, baby.
I know what time it is.
Get in.
Dean: son of a bitch.
So they're really not afraid of the sun?
No, direct sunlight hurts like a nasty sunburn.
The only way to kill them is by beheading.
And, yeah, they sleep during the day.
It doesn't mean they won't wake up.
So i guess walking right in's not our best option.
Actually, that's the plan.
Dad, i've got an extra machete if you need one.
Think i'm okay.
Thanks.
Wow.
So...
You boys really want to know about this colt?
Yes, sir.
It's just a story...
A legend, really.
Well, i thought it was.
Never really believed it until i read daniel's letter.
Back in 1835, when halley's comet was overhead,
The same night those men died at the alamo,
They say samuel colt made a gun...
A special gun.
He made it for a hunter -
A man like us, only on horseback.
The story goes he made 13 bullets.
This hunter used the gun a half dozen times
Before he disappeared, the gun along with him.
Somehow, daniel got his hands on it.
They say -
They say this gun can kill anything.
Kill anything, like supernatural anything?
Like the demon.
Yeah, the demon.
Ever since i picked up its trail,
I've been looking for a way to destroy that thing.
Find the gun...
We may have it.
Sam: dean.
There's more.
Hey.
Hey, hey, shh.
I'm here to help you.
John: boys, run!
Dad!
Dad?
!
Dad?
!
They won't follow.
They'll till tonight.
Once a vampire gets your scent, it's for life.
What do we do now?
You got to find the nearest funeral home.
It shouldn't be taking this long.
I should go help.
Dean's got it.
Sammy.
Yeah?
I don't think i ever told you this,
But the day you were born, you know what i did?
No.
I put 100 bucks into a savings account for you.
I did the same thing for your brother.
It was a college fund.
And every month, i'd put in another $100 until...
Anyway, my point is, sam, that
This is never the life that i wanted for you.
Then why'd you get so mad when i left?
You got to understand something.
After your mother passed,
All i saw was evil, everywhere.
And all i cared about was keeping you boys alive.
I wanted you prepared...
Ready.
So somewhere along the line, i, uh
I stopped being your father.
And i -
I became your drill sergeant.
So when you said you wanted to go away to school,
All i could think about, my only thought,
Was that you were gonna be alone...
Vulnerable.
Sammy, it just -
It never occurred to me what you wanted.
I just couldn't accept the fact
That you and me...
We're just different.
What?
We're not different.
Not anymore.
With what happened to mom and jess
We probably have a lot more in common
Than just about anyone.
I guess you're right, son.
Hey, dad?
Whatever happened to that college fund?
Spent it on ammo.
Whoo!
Man, there's some heavy security to protect a bunch of dead guys.
Did you get it?
You know what to do.
Kate: car trouble?
Let me give you a lift...
Take you back to my place.
I'll pass.
I usually draw the line at necrophilia.
I don't normally get this friendly till the second date.
You know, we could have some fun.
I always like to make new friends.
Oh, sorry.
I never really stay with a chick that long.
Definitely not eternity.
Ugh!
Damn it.
Barely even stings.
Give it time, sweetheart.
That arrow's soaked in dead man's blood.
It's like poison to you, isn't it?
Load her up.
I'll take care of this one.
Toss this on the fire.
Saffron, skunks, cabbage, and trillium -
It'll block our scent and hers until we're ready.
Stuff stinks.
Well, that's the idea.
Dust your clothes with the ashes
And you'll stand a chance of not being detected.
You sure they'll come after her?
Yeah.
Vampires mate for life.
She means more to the leader than the gun.
But the blood sickness is gonna wear off soon,
So you don't have a lot of time.
Half-Hour ought to do it.
And then i want you out of the area as fast as you can.
But -
You can't take care of them all yourself.
I'll have her and the colt.
But after, we're gonna meet up, right?
Use the gun together, right?
You're leaving again, aren't you?
You still want to go after the demon alone?
You know, i don't get you.
You can't treat us like this.
Like what?
Like children.
You are my children.
I'm trying to keep you safe.
Dad, all due respect, but that's a bunch of crap.
Excuse me?
You know what sammy and i have been hunting.
Hell, you sent us on a few hunting trips yourself.
You can't be that worried about keeping us safe.
It's not the same thing, de.
Then what is it?
Why do you want us out of the big fight?
This demon...
It's a bad son of a bitch.
I can't make the same moves
If i'm worried about keeping you alive.
You can't be as reckless.
Look...
I don't expect to make it out of this fight in one piece.
Your mother's death...
It almost killed me.
I can't watch my children die, too.
I won't.
What happens if you die?
Dad, what happens if you die
And we could have done something about it?
You know, i've been thinking.
I think maybe sammy's right about this one.
I think we should do this together.
We're stronger as a family, dad.
We just are.
You know it.
We're running out of time.
You do your job, and you get out of the area.
That's an order.
Is there any sign of those three?
No.
Something else.
What?
Luther, they cut off hank's head.
And kate?
I don't know.
She wasn't there.
What are we gonna do?
It's just a truck up on the highway.
Kate.
She's in that truck.
Boo.
I told you i'd come back.
Luther: get out!
Who are you?
The name's winchester.
Where are your friends?
Cleaning out your nest.
Where's kate?
Come here, sweetheart.
Kate, you all right?
Dead man's blood.
You son of a bitch.
I want the colt
- Elkins' gun.
Trade.
Is that what this is all about?
I mean, you can't shoot us all, right?
We'll kill you.
Oh, i don't need it for you.
I'm saving it for something else.
Now, put the colt down or she goes first.
All right.
Just don't hurt her.
Back up.
Further.
That's a nice move.
You almost made it.
Ugh!
Don't!
I'll break his neck.
Put the blade down.
You people.
Why can't you just leave us alone?
We have as much right to live as you do.
John: i don't think so.
Luther!
Kate, don't!
So, boys...
Yes, sir?
You ignored a direct order back there.
Yes, sir.
But we saved your ass.
You're right.
I am?
It scares the hell out of me.
You two are all i've got.
But i guess we are stronger as a family.
So...
We go after this damn thing...
Together.
Yes, sir.Yes, sir.
NARRATOR:
Previously on Supernatural:
-Dad.
-Sam?
DEAN:
This is bigger than you think.
They're everywhere.
SAM:
This demon killed Mom and Jess, and Dad's closing in.
-We gotta help.
-Dad doesn't want our help.
I'm talking one week here, man.
To get answers.
To get revenge.
-You think I didn't respect Dad.
-Sorry I brought it up.
SAM:
No matter what, it was never good enough.
-So, what, Dad was disappointed in you?
-When we finally do find Dad I don't know if he's even gonna wanna see me.
-Hey.
Dad?
JOHN:
Hey, boys.
-Hi, Sam.
-Hey, Dad.
Last time we were together we had one hell of a fight.
-Yes, sir.
-lt's good to see you again.
It's been a long time.
We almost got Dad killed in there.
They're not gonna stop.
DEAN:
They're gonna try again.
They're gonna use us to get to him.
Dad's vulnerable when he's with us.
-l gotta be a part of this fight.
-Sammy, this fight is just starting.
JOHN:
You gotta let me go.
[COUNTRY music playing]
[POOL BALLS CLACKING]
WOMAN:
Mr. Elkins?
Mr. Elkins.
Would you like another?
Yeah.
Thanks, Beth.
Thought they caught the Unabomber.
Yeah, poor Mr. Elkins lives all alone, up the canyon.
BETH:
Same seat every day.
Going through his papers, and making his little notes.
He's a nice old man, he's just a nut.
Here you go.
[laughing]
What will you have?
-Jack all around.
Leave the bottle.
-You hungry?
-We have dinner plans.
-Okay.
Hmm.
Can I get you something else, Mr. Elkins?
It's been a while.
I gotta say, you look old.
-What do you want?
-What do you think?
Damn.
You can do better than that.
Come-
- Come on, come on.
[POUNDING ON DOOR]
Nice gun.
Wouldn't do you much good, of course.
WOMAN:
Boys?
We're eating in tonight.
[ELKINS screaming]
Dude, not a decent lead in all of Nebraska.
What do you got?
Well, I've been scanning Wyoming, Colorado, South Dakota.
Here, a woman in Iowa fell 1 0,000 feet from an airplane and survived.
Sounds more That's Incredible!
than Twilight Zone.
-Yeah.
-Hey, you know we could just keep heading east.
New York?
Upstate?
You could stop by and see Sarah again, huh?
She's a cool chick, man.
Smoking.
[whistles]
You two seemed pretty friendly.
What do you say?
Yeah, I don't know.
Maybe someday.
But in the meantime we got a lot of work to do, Dean, and you know that.
Yeah, you're right.
What else you got?
Uh, Manning, Colorado.
A local man by the name of Daniel Elkins...
-...was found mauled in his home.
-Elkins?
I know that name.
-Doesn't ring a bell.
-Elkins.
Elkins.
Elkins.
The police don't know what to think.
SAM:
At first they said it was some bear attack and now they found signs of robbery.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
There.
Check it out.
-Think it's the same Elkins?
-lt's a Colorado area code.
Looks like the maid didn't come today.
Hey, there's salt here, right inside the door.
You mean like protection-against-demons salt or oops-l-spilled-the-popcorn salt?
It's clearly a ring.
SAM:
You think this guy Elkins was a player?
DEAN:
Definitely.
SAM:
That looks a hell of a lot like Dad's.
Yeah, except this dates back to the '60s.
SAM:
Whatever attacked him, it looks like there was more than one.
Looks like he put up a hell of a fight too.
Yeah.
You got something?
I don't know.
Some scratches in the floor.
-Death throes, maybe?
-Yeah, maybe.
Or maybe a message.
Look familiar?
Three letters, six digits.
The location and combination of a post office box.
-lt's a mail drop.
-lt's just the way Dad does it.
"J.W." You think?
John Winchester?
I don't know.
Should we open it?
[banging ON WINDOW]
Dad?
What are you doing here?
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Look, I read the news about Daniel.
I got here as fast as I could.
I saw you two up at his place.
-Why didn't you come in, Dad?
-You know why.
Because I had to make sure you weren't followed by anyone or anything.
Nice job of covering your tracks, by the way.
Yeah, well, we learned from the best.
Wait, so you came all the way out here for this Elkins guy?
Yeah.
He was....
He was a good man.
He taught me a hell of a lot about hunting.
Well, you never mentioned him to us.
We had a....
We had kind of a falling-out.
I hadn't seen him in years.
JOHN:
I should look at that.
"If you're reading this, I'm already dead."
JOHN:
That son of a bitch.
-What is it?
-He had it the whole time.
-Dad, what?
When you searched the place, did you see a gun?
An antique, a Colt revolver.
Did you see it?
Uh, there was an old case, but it was empty.
-They have it.
-You mean whatever killed Elkins?
We gotta pick up the trail.
-Wait, you want us to come with you?
-lf Elkins was telling the truth...
-...we've gotta find this gun.
-The gun?
Why?
-Because it's important, that's why.
-We don't know what these things are.
JOHN:
They were what Daniel Elkins killed best:
Vampires.
Vampires?
I thought there was no such thing.
You never even mentioned them, Dad.
I thought they were extinct.
I thought Elkins and others had wiped them out.
I was wrong.
JOHN:
Most vampire lore is crap.
A cross won't repel them, sunlight won't kill them and neither Will a stake to the heart.
but the blood lust, that part's true.
They need fresh human blood to survive.
They were once people, so you won't know it's a vampire until it's too late.
[GLASS shattering]
All yours, baby.
[chuckling]
What?
-Well, I guess you showed that guy.
-What guy?
The guy who bet you you wouldn't buy that shirt.
I love this shirt.
No, look out!
[tires SCREECHING]
-What happened to him?
-Call 91 1 .
WOMAN [OVER radio]:
Unit 22, let me confirm.
Mile marker 41 , abandoned car.
You need a Workup?
Copy that.
Possible 207.
better get Forensics out here.
-Sam, Dean, let's go.
DEAN:
Mm-hm.
JOHN:
I picked up a police call.
-What happened?
A couple called 91 1 , found a body in the street.
Cops got there, everyone was missing.
It's the vampires.
How do you know?
Just follow me, okay?
[SCOFFS]
Vampires.
Gets funnier every time I hear it.
[CHATTER OVER POLICE radio]
SAM:
I don't see why we couldn't have gone with him.
-Oh, don't tell me it's already starting.
-What's starting?
-What do you got?
-lt was them, all right.
Looks like they're heading west.
We have to get around that detour.
-How can you be sure?
-Sam.
I just wanna know we're going in the right direction.
-We are.
-How do you know?
I found this.
It's a vampire fang.
No fangs, teeth.
A second set descends when they attack.
Any more questions?
All right, let's get out of here, we're losing daylight.
Hey, Dean, why don't you touch up your car before you get rust.
I wouldn't have given you the damn thing if I thought you were gonna ruin it.
Vampires nest in groups of eight to 1 0.
Smaller packs are sent out to hunt for food.
Victims are taken to the nest.
The pack keeps them alive, bleeding them for days or weeks.
I wonder if that's what happened to that 91 1 couple.
That's probably what Dad's thinking.
Course, it would be nice if he just told us what he thinks.
So it is starting.
What?
Sam, we've been looking for Dad all year.
We're with him a couple hours and there's static already?
No.
Look, I'm happy he's okay, all right?
I'm happy we're all working together again.
Well, good.
It's just the way he treats us like we're children.
-Oh, God.
-He barks orders at us, Dean.
He expects us to follow them without question.
He keeps us on some need-to-know deal.
-He does what he does for a reason.
-What reason?
Our job.
There's no time to argue, it's just the way the old man runs things.
Well, maybe that worked when we were kids, but not anymore.
Not after everything you and I have been through.
You telling me you're cool with falling into line, letting him run the whole show?
If that's what it takes.
[COUNTRY music playing]
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
Have some beer, buddy.
It'll calm your nerves.
-No, thanks.
-Oh, come on.
You drink enough, I can taste it in your blood.
That's gross.
[CHUCKLES]
How about you, babe?
Attagirl.
-You--!
KATE:
Bo!
Wait for Luther.
[laughing]
[moaning]
I missed you too, baby.
We've got presents.
She looks interesting.
He doesn't.
Lock him up.
MAN:
Let's go.
[chuckling]
On second thought, go ahead and treat yourself.
MAN:
Yeah.
[screaming]
There's something else.
-This all theirs?
-No.
It's from an old friend of yours, Daniel Elkins.
I caught his scent and I thought I'd surprise you.
Kate, what did you do?
-l made him suffer.
-You shouldn't have done that.
-Luther--
-There are others like him.

Are you gonna kill me?
I'm gonna take you so high, you're never gonna come down.

What happens if you die and we could've done something about it?
You know, I've been thinking.
I....
Maybe Sammy's right about this one.
We should do this together.
We're stronger as a family.
We just are.
You know it.
We're running out of time.
You do your job and you get out of the area.
That's an order.
-Any sign of those three?
-No.
Something else.
-What?
-Luther, they cut off Hank's head!
And Kate?
I don't know.
She wasn't there.
What are we gonna do?
Just a truck, up on the highway.
Kate.
She's in that truck.
[CREAKING]
Boo.
[WOMAN coughing]
I told you I'd come back.
LUTHER:
Get out.
-Who are you?
-Name's Winchester.
-Where are your friends?
-Cleaning out your nest.
Where's Kate?
Come here, sweetheart.
Kate, you all right?
Dead man's blood.
You son of a bitch.
I want the Colt, Elkins' gun.
A trade.
Is that what this is about?
I mean, you can't shoot us all.
We'll kill you.
Oh, I don't need it for you.
I'm saving it for something else.
Put the Colt down or she goes first.
All right.
Just don't hurt her.
Back up.
Further.
It's a nice move.
You almost made it.
[GLASS shattering]
Nope.
I'll break his neck.
Put the blade down.
[GRUNTlNG]
You people.
Why can't you just leave us alone?
-We have as much right to live as you do.
JOHN:
I don't think so.
[screaming] Luther!
Kate, don't!
So, boys....
Yes, sir?
You ignored a direct order back there.
-Yes, sir.
-Yeah, but we saved your ass.
You're right.
-l am?
-lt scares the hell out of me.
You two are all I've got but I guess we are stronger as a family.
So we go after this damn thing.
Together.
[IN unison] Yes, sir.
[ENGLISH SDH]
M. Elkins?
M. Elkins.
Would you like another?
Yeah.
Thanks, Beth.
I thought they caught the unabomber.
Yeah, poor M. Elkins lives all alone up in the canyon.
Same seat every day, going through his papers, making his little notes.
He's a nice old man.
He's just a nut.
Here you go.
What'll you have?
Jack all around.
Leave the bottle.
You hungry?
We have dinner plans.
Can I get you something else, M. Elkins?
It's been a while.
I got to say, you look old.
- What do you want?
- What do you think?
Damn.
You can do better than that.
Come on, come on.
Nice gun.
Wouldn't do you much good, of course.
Boys...
We're eating in tonight.
All right, dude, not a decent lead in all of Nebraska.
What do you got?
Well, I been scanning Wyoming, Colorado, south Dakota.
Here.
A woman in Iowa fell 10,000 feet from an airplane and survived.
Sounds more like "that's incredible!" than "the twilight zone".
Yeah.
Hey, you know, we could just keep heading east...
New York, upstate.
Could stop by and see Sarah again.
Huh?
She's a cool chick, man.
Smokin'.
You two seemed pretty friendly.
What do you say?
Yeah.
Maybe someday.
But in the meantime, we got a lot of work to do, Dean, and you know that.
Yeah, you're right.
What else you got?
Uh, man in Colorado.
Local man by the name of Daniel Elkins who was found mauled in his home.
Elkins.
I know that name.
Doesn't ring a bell.
It sounds like the police don't know what to think.
At first they said it was some sort of bear attack, and now they found signs of robbery.
Yeah.
Here.
Check it out.
You think it's the same Elkins?
It's a Colorado area code.
Looks like the maid didn't come today.
Hey, there's salt over here, right inside the door.
You mean, like, protection-against-demon salt or "oops, I spilled the popcorn" salt?
It's clearly a ring.
You think this guy Elkins was a player?
Definitely.
That looks a hell of a lot like dad's.
Except this dates back to the '60s.
Whatever attacked him, looks like there was more than one.
Looks like he put up a hell of a fight, too.
Yeah.
You got something?
I don't know.
Some scratches in the floor.
Death throes maybe?
Maybe.
Or maybe a message.
Look familiar?
Three letters, six digits...
The location and combination of a post office box.
It's a mail drop.
That's just the way dad does it.
"J.W."...
You think?
John Winchester?
I don't know.
Should we open it?
Dad?
Dad, what are you doing here?
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Look, I read the news about Daniel.
I got here as fast as I could.
I saw you two up at his place.
Why didn't you come in, dad?
You know why.
Because I had to make sure you weren't followed...
By anyone...
Or anything.
Nice job of covering your tracks, by the way.
Yeah, well, we learned from the best.
Wait, so you came all the way out here for this Elkins guy?
Yeah.
He was...
He was a good man.
He taught me a hell of a lot about hunting.
You never mentioned him to us.
We had a...
We had kind of a falling out.
I hadn't seen him in years.
I should look at that.
"If you're reading this, I'm already dead".
- That son of a bitch.
- What is it?
- He had it the whole time.
- Dad, what?
When you searched the place, did you see a gun, an antique, a colt revolver?
Did you see it?
Uh, there was an old case, but it was empty.
They have it.
- You mean whatever killed Elkins?
- We got to pick up their trail.
Wait.
You want us to come with you?
If Elkins is telling the truth, we've got to find this gun.
- The gun?
why?
- Because it's important, that's why.
Dad, we don't even know what these things are yet.
They were what Danny Elkins killed best...
Vampires.
Vampires?
I thought there was no such thing.
You never even mentioned them, dad.
I thought they were extinct.
I thought Elkins and others had wiped them out.
I was wrong.
Most vampire lore is crap.
A cross won't repel them.
Sunlight won't kill them and neither will a stake to the heart.
But the bloodlust...
that part's true.
They need fresh human blood to survive.
They were once people,
So you won't know it's a vampire until it's too late.
All yours, baby.
What?
Well, I guess you showed that guy.
What guy?
The guy who bet you you wouldn't buy that shirt.
I love this shirt.
Look out!
What happened to him?
Call 911.
22, I'm going out there.
Copy that.
Sam, Dean, let's go.
I picked up a police call.
What happened?
A couple called 911.
They found a body in the street.
Cops got there.
Everyone was missing.
It's the vampires.
How do you know?
Just follow me, okay?
Vampires.
It's funny every time I hear it.
I don't see why we couldn't have gone over with him.
Oh, don't tell me it's already starting.
What's starting?
- What do you got?
- It was them all right.
It looks like they're heading west.
We have to double back to get around that detour.
- How can you be so sure?
- Sam!
I just want to know we're going in the right direction.
- We are.
- How do you know?
I found this.
It's a... vampire fang?
No fangs...
Teeth.
The second set descends when they attack.
Any more questions?
Let's get out of here.
We're losing daylight.
And, Dean, why don't you touch up your car before you get rust?
I wouldn't have given you the damn thing if I thought you were gonna ruin it.
Vampires nest in groups of 8 to 10.
Smaller packs are sent out to hunt for food.
Victims are taken to the nest, where the pack keeps them alive, bleeding them for days or weeks.
I wonder if that's what happened to that 911 couple.
That's probably what dad's thinking.
Of course, it would be nice if he just told us what he thinks.
So it is starting.
What?
Sam, we've been looking for dad all year.
Now we're not with him for more than a couple of hours and there's static already.
No.
Look, I'm happy he's okay, all right, and I'm happy that we're all working together.
Good.
It's just the way he treats us like we're children.
He barks orders at us, Dean.
He expects us to follow him without question.
He keeps us on some crap need-to-know deal.
He does what he does for a reason.
- What reason?
- Our job!
There's no time to argue.
There's no margin for error.
It's just the way the old man runs things.
Yeah, well, maybe that worked when we were kids, but not anymore, all right?
Not after everything you and I have been through, Dean.
Are you telling me you're cool with just falling into line and letting him run the whole show?
If that's what it takes.
Have some beer, buddy.
It'll calm your nerves.
No, thanks.
Oh, come on.
You drink enough, I can taste it in your blood.
That's gross.
Well, how about you, babe?
Attagirl.
Bo!
Wait for Luther.
I missed you, too, baby.
We've got presents.
She looks interesting.
He doesn't.
Lock him up.
Let's go.
On second thought, go ahead and treat yourself.
No!
There's something else.
- This all theirs?
- No.
It's from an old friend of yours...
Daniel Elkins.
I caught his scent.
I thought I'd surprise you.
Kate, what did you do?
- I made him suffer.
- You shouldn't have done that.
There are others like him.
They'll know the signs and come looking for us.
- We have to be careful.
- Luther, I did it for you,
For what he did to your family.
Revenge isn't worth much if you end up dead.
I'm sorry, babe.
I'm sorry.
I thought you might like that.
Looks like it was made around the time you were born.
I've seen this before.
Elkins died with it in his hands.
He should have known better...
Using a gun!
This is no ordinary gun.
Yeah, dad.
All right, got it.
- Pull off the next exit.
- Why?
'Cause dad thinks we got the vampires' trail.
How?
I don't know.
He didn't say.
Oh, crap.
Here we go.
- Sam, what the hell was that?
- We need to talk.
- About what?
- About everything.
Where we going, dad?
What's the big deal about this gun?
Sammy, come on.
We can qa after we kill all the vampires.
Your brother's right.
We don't have time for this.
Last we saw you, you said it was too dangerous to be together.
Now, out of the blue, you need our help.
Obviously something big's going down, and we want to know what!
- Get back in the car.
- No.
I said get back in the damn car.
Yeah, and I said no.
All right, you made your point, tough guy.
Look, we're all tired.
We can talk about this later.
Sammy, I mean it.
Come on.
This is why I left in the first place.
- What'd you say?
- You heard me.
Yeah, you left.
Your brother and me...
We needed you.
You walked away, Sam.
You walked away!
- Stop it, both of you!
- You're the one who said, "don't come back", dad.
You're the one who closed that door, not me!
You were just pissed off you couldn't control me anymore!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
That's enough!
That means you, too.
Terrific.
You like to watch, huh?
Me too.
Ready, baby?
Are you gonna kill me?
I'm gonna take you so high you're never gonna come down.
Welcome home, baby.
I know what time it is.
Get in.
Son of a bitch.
So they're really not afraid of the sun?
No, direct sunlight hurts like a nasty sunburn.
The only way to kill them is by beheading.
And, yeah, they sleep during the day.
It doesn't mean they won't wake up.
So I guess walking right in's not our best option.
Actually... that's the plan.
Dad, I've got an extra machete if you need one.
Think I'm okay.
Thanks.
Wow.
So...
You boys really want to know about this colt?
Yes, sir.
It's just a story...
A legend, really.
Well, I thought it was.
Never really believed it until I read Daniel's letter.
Back in 1835, when Halley's comet was overhead, the same night those men died at the alamo, they say Samuel Colt made a gun...
A special gun.
He made it for a hunter...
A man like us, only on horseback.
The story goes he made 13 bullets.
This hunter used the gun a half dozen times before he disappeared, the gun along with him.
Somehow, Daniel got his hands on it.
They say... they say this gun can kill anything.
Kill anything, like supernatural anything?
Like the demon.
Yeah, the demon.
Ever since I picked up its trail,
I've been looking for a way to destroy that thing.
Find the gun... we may have it.
Dean.
There's more.
Hey.
Hey, hey, shh.
I'm here to help you.
Boys, run!
Dad!
Dad?
!
Dad?
!
They won't follow.
They'll wait till tonight.
Once a vampire gets your scent, it's for life.
What the hell do we do now?
You got to find the nearest funeral home.
It shouldn't be taking this long.
I should go help.
Dean's got it.
Sammy.
Yeah?
I don't think I ever told you this, but... the day you were born, you know what I did?
No.
I put 100 bucks into a savings account for you.
I did the same thing for your brother.
It was a college fund.
And every month, I'd put in another $100 until...
Anyway, my point is, Sam, that...
This is never the life that I wanted for you.
Then why'd you get so mad when I left?
You got to understand something.
After your mother passed, all I saw was evil, everywhere.
And all I cared about was keeping you boys alive.
I wanted you prepared... ready.
So somewhere along the line, I, uh...
I stopped being your father.
And I...
I became your drill sergeant.
So when you said you wanted to go away to school, all I could think about, my only thought was that you were gonna be alone...
Vulnerable.
Sammy, it just...
It never occurred to me what you wanted.
I just couldn't accept the fact that you and me... we're just different.
What?
We're not different.
Not anymore.
With what happened to mom and Jess...
We probably have a lot more in common than just about anyone.
I guess you're right, son.
Hey, dad?
What happened to that college fund?
Spent it on the ammo.
Whoo!
Man, there's some heavy security to protect a bunch of dead guys.
Did you get it?
You know what to do.
Car trouble?
Let me give you a lift...
Take you back to my place.
I'll pass.
I usually draw the line at necrophilia.
I don't normally get this friendly till the second date.
You know, we could have some fun.
I always like to make new friends.
Oh, sorry.
I never really stay with a chick that long.
Definitely not eternity.
Damn it.
Barely even stings.
Give it time, sweetheart.
That arrow's soaked in dead man's blood.
It's like poison to you, isn't it?
Load her up.
I'll take care of this one.
Toss this on the fire.
Saffron, skunks, cabbage, and trillium, it'll block our scent and hers until we're ready.
- Stuff stinks.
- Well, that's the idea.
Dust your clothes with the ashes and you'll stand a chance of not being detected.
You sure they'll come after her?
Yeah.
Vampires mate for life.
She means more to the leader than the gun.
But the blood sickness is gonna wear off soon, so you don't have a lot of time.
Half-hour ought to do it.
And then I want you out of the area as fast as you can.
- But...
- You can't take care of them all yourself.
I'll have her and the colt.
But after, we're gonna meet up, right?
Use the gun together, right?
You're leaving again, aren't you?
You still want to go after the demon alone?
You know, I don't get you.
- You can't treat us like this.
- Like what?
- Like children.
- You are my children.
I'm trying to keep you safe.
Dad, all due respect, but that's a bunch of crap.
Excuse me?
You know what Sammy and I have been hunting.
Hell, you sent us on a few hunting trips yourself.
You can't be that worried about keeping us safe.
It's not the same thing, Dean.
Then what is it?
Why do you want us out of the big fight?
This demon...
It's a bad son of a bitch.
I can't make the same moves if I'm worried about keeping you alive.
You can't be as reckless.
Look...
I don't expect to make it out of this fight in one piece.
Your mother's death...
It almost killed me.
I can't watch my children die, too.
I won't.
What happens if you die?
Dad, what happens if you die and we could have done something about it?
You know, I've been thinking.
I think maybe Sammy's right about this one.
We should do this together.
We're stronger as a family, dad.
We just are.
You know it.
We're running out of time.
You do your job, and you get out of the area.
That's an order.
Is there any sign of those three?
No.
Something else.
- What?
- Luther, they cut off Hank's head.
And Kate?
I don't know.
She wasn't there.
What are we gonna do?
It's just a truck up on the highway.
Kate.
She's in that truck.
Boo.
I told you I'd come back.
Get out!
Who are you?
My name's Winchester.
Where are your friends?
Cleaning out your nest.
Where's Kate?
Come here, sweetheart.
Kate, you all right?
Dead man's blood.
You son of a bitch.
I want the colt...
Elkins' gun.
Trade.
Is that what this is all about?
I mean, you can't shoot us all, right?
We'll kill you.
Oh, I don't need it for you.
I'm saving it for something else.
Now, put the colt down or she goes first.
All right.
Just don't hurt her.
Back up.
Further.
That's a nice move.
You almost made it.
Don't!
I'll break his neck.
Put the blade down.
You people.
Why can't you just leave us alone?
We have as much right to live as you do.
I don't think so.
Luther!
Kate, don't!
So, boys...
Yes, sir?
You ignored a direct order back there.
- Yes, sir.
- But we saved your ass.
You're right.
I am?
It scares the hell out of me.
You two are all I've got.
But I guess we are stronger as a family.
So... we go after this damn thing... together.
Yes, sir.
Oh there she is.
Mother, Kaoru is here.
Oh, hi!
You're going tonight too?
Yup.
Every night
That's what you do, writing songs right?
Yeah.
There's no meaning in it, isn't it?
It doesn't matter, does it?
I guess it can't be helped.
Since today's a rest day for me,
I'll go take a look huh, Mum.
If you come I'll kill you.
Alright.
You know when's sunrise, right?
Yeah.
Don't go "yeah" on me.
4:40 a.m.
Since it's that way, be sure to come back before four then.
I got it.
Don't go too far.
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks for the food.
Go ahead.
Thanks for the food.
Sign:
Please wait for a moment.
She looks underaged no matter how you look at it.
At this kind of time... is she lost?
It's okay.
You don't have to worry about that girl.
Her parents explained before.
Explained about what?
How should I say this...
XP is a kinda like an allergy.
Those suffering from it will die if they're exposed to sunlight.
Eh?
That's why she can only come out at night.
For whose sake am I living for?
The cloudy days pass by.
How much do you feel this pain and weakness?
Drowning myself in worthless yesterdays
I write my dreams on today, even though they're incomplete.
The twinkling stars before daybreak
Have they disappeared?
Will they be back tomorrow?
Tomorrow never knows
It's happy line.
For whose sake am I living for?
A Song in the Sun
I'll make a move first.
OK.
Hey, hey, hey.
Osu!
Don't you go "Osu!" with me!
You're skipping classes again, aren't you?
Osu!
Where's Kaoru?
She just went to sleep.
If you wake her up now she'll kill you.
If it's me it'll be fine.
If that's the case, go up then.
Hey Aunt, you made a new one again?
Yup, because the old one was getting too small.
Wow, as one would expect of you.
I think it's better not to touch it.
Kaoru'll find out.
Misaki-chan, I don't want to say this but...
Don't ravage the stuff in the refrigerator.
I got it.
It's rare to find someone that can't even ride up to there, isn't it?
It can't be helped since he kept on saying he liked surfing.
But it's quite cute that way, isn't it.
Hey, the sun... hasn't it risen a little too much?
It's already ten!
No way!
Kouji, get out, quick!
You're gonna be late!
What?
Yup, I got it.
Please wait for a little while.
Alaria and sardine salad and Margarita pizza.
Here you go, sorry to keep you waiting.
What're you looking at?
Nothing.
Sign:
Yamacho Street
It's already dark and I can't make out your face...
Everyone else has happiness on their faces,
Can you see it?
Even if I can't laugh, yeah yeah.
The thoughts on their way to tomorrow in my heart,
I see your red eyes
And tried to laugh
Tomorrow never knows
It's happy line
Someone you know?
Hey, wait, where're you going?
Ouch...
I'm Amane Kaoru.
What?
I'm Amane Kaoru.
Huh?
I'm Amane Kaoru.
What about it?
I'm sixteen.
Living with my parents.
My hobby is music.
I have a bit of a quick-tempered personality.
I don't have a boyfriend.
Huh?
I've always been looking at you.
All this time.
I don't have a boyfriend.
Ah...
I see... about this... hold on a sec...
And I never had a boyfriend before.
Er, no... that's not... wait...
My favorite animal is the cheetah -
And for food, I like bananas - and...
Er...
Favorite musician...
There's too many, which one should I start from?
Sorry, please excuse us.
What?
What "What?"?
Don't get in my way.
Huh?
Get in your way?
I just got you out of a pinch.
Huh?
Don't go "Eh?" on me!
You were in a state of confusion just now.
What did you mean, "I like bananas?"
That was totally unprofessional of you.
I guess so.
Hey.
You haven't talked to a guy since elementary school, haven't you?
So, what's up with that guy?
He probably goes to the same high school as me.
Yeah...
Oh, I didn't know that...
That's what you get for skipping school, idiot!
Yeah.
Huh?
As I was saying...
You don't know anything about him.
Yeah, that's because I've only been looking at him from here.
I see...
What kind of person is he, I wonder?
I wonder if he's good at surfing?
Then...
Why don't you wear that suit that's hanging in the hall?
No!
If he sees me like that he'll hate me!
Well, it can't be helped then.
It's been a long time since I last went to school, but I'll go and find out more details.
Really?
Yup!
Sorry for the wait.
If she doesn't want to come in person,
I can't perform the medical examination.
I'm sorry.
She wouldn't come no matter what.
As usual, does she still hate the hospital that much?
It seems it's the place she hates most in the world.
Is that so?
So, how's her condition?
She's still seems healthy.
No change from the usual.
I see.
That's good to hear.
Her condition hasn't gotten worse yet, isn't it...
About the age at which you said we should get mentally prepared...
She's already past that age.
Ah, I see.
Well then, excuse me for saying that.
I'll continue prescribing her medication.
About that, doctor.
I'm sorry, there still isn't a cure yet.
I see.
As you know,
The number of people who suffer from XP are very few.
But no matter for what kind of illness,
Compared to the harm done by UV rays,
The effects caused by nervous impairment as the sufferer increases in age, are more frightening.
His name is Fujishiro Kouji.
Fujishiro Kouji.
It's hot isn't it.
Fujishiro Kouji.
He's sleeping.
Nope.
It looks like he's pretty dumb.
Ah, it's better than I had thought.
Ah, by the way.
This is the first time you're seeing a high school isn't it?
Uh huh.
Everyone looks like they're enjoying themselves.
Huh?
It's meaningless going to that place.
Well, it seems these three guys...
Always hang out together.
This one over here, friend number I is called Onishi Yuuta.
And this one over here, friend number 2 is Satou Haruo.
I wonder if he washed his hands.
Looks like he did.
Aw, that's horrible.
Well, so that's the general impression.
All in all, he looks like a coarse idiot.
G-good evening.
Good evening.
You're the girl from that time, aren't you?
Yup.
Sorry for that time.
It's alright.
What're you doing out here this late?
Just came back from my singing.
I often sing in front of the train station.
Ah, you're one of those who sing live on the street?
Well, something like that.
Is that so?
That was a nice song you were singing.
What's it called?
I haven't decided yet.
You wrote it yourself?
Yup.
Wow, that's incredible!
Really?
Is that a surfboard?
Yup.
That's a cool-looking surfboard.
You know about it?
Yeah.
Yeah!
I bought this after looking around for a long time.
It's still the best after all.
Though it's second-hand.
What about yours?
Huh?
Is it also second-hand?
Do you live around here?
That tall house over there.
Oh, it's just over there.
I pass by along this road every day.
Yup, I know that.
Eh?
You know about it?
You always see me from up there, don't you?
Yeah.
That's kinda embarrassing.
I can't do any weird stuff from now on.
Well then, I should get going soon.
Is that so?
I see.
See you.
Yup.
Hey!
If it's alright, I'll come the next time.
For your street performance.
Don't just say it and not come.
If it's during the vacations, I'll definitely come.
This is your last summer vacation as a high school student
Don't get carried away with play, concentrate on your books and work hard.
Understand?
This vacation's critical.
Hey Mum.
Why is today's date circled?
I don't know, I'm not the one who did it.
It's Kaoru then?
For the me in this world, the summer vacations start today.
You scared me!
What're you doing?
Surfing, surfing...
Now that the summer holidays have come, you're going out at night instead?
Don't you have anything better to do?
Didn't I say I was going to study?
It's gonna be all guys, with Haruo and the rest.
Maybe I should go with you.
Don't come along!
I'll call to check on you.
Call my cellphone instead.
Then be sure to keep it turned on!
Thank you Kamakura!
Thank you everyone, for coming to support me.
I'm Dynamite Yamazaki.
Please listen to two of my songs.
The song is
"My name is Global Standard"!
I, 2, 3, 4!
What's this?
My place got taken.
You always sing here?
Even so, he's really awful huh.
Are you going to wait till he finishes?
It can't be helped.
Even though I was really looking forward to this day...
About that, singing.
Couldn't you sing elsewhere instead?
Huh?
It's my first time riding on a bike.
Really?
That looks ridiculous.
Done!
Shall we go?
To where?
I'll bring you to a good place.
Get on!
We're moving off.
Let's take this opportunity to look at the town while we're here.
It looks like I've been thinking too much.
Since I can't fall asleep in this room,
I might as well try flying in the night.
Sighing by the window.
Under the moonlight, I feel like escaping to somewhere far away.
Even though it seems like I'm flapping my wings,
What should I do?
I want to fly well
I don't know how to fly
I want to fly well
If only someone would teach me how
Don't wait too much for chances,
Every morning repeats itself
I grow tired of counting them
I'm going to draw the skyline
I don't know how to fly
I might be flying;
I'm not sure
I want to fly well
But I'm going to try
I want to fly well
In order to learn how to fly
I want to fly well
I want to fly in the sky
To skyline
Because I want to meet you now.
That's what I decided.
This song in my pocket,
I want you to let you listen to it.
Raising the soft volume,
To make sure it's just right.
Oh good-bye days, now
I feel it's going to change,
Until yesterday, so long unstylishly but staying gently by my side
La la la la la - with you
Passing you one side of my earphones
Slowly, in that moment when the music starts flowing
Do I have the ability to love you properly?
But sometimes I'll get lost.
Oh good-bye days, now
It's beginning to change, but deep inside my heart it's alright
Hey.
In the future, isn't it your aim to release a debut CD?
The future...
That's right.
I'd like to try that.
You're incredible.
Unlike me who doesn't have anything.
Hm?
I'll go on like this living an ordinary life, and in the end die an ordinary death.
That's not true.
From now on you can do anything.
Really?
Yeah.
You'll definitely find out what you really want to do.
It's just started.
I see.
It's like that, isn't it?
I'm too simple-minded.
I'm Fujishiro Kouji.
I don't have a girlfriend.
My hobby is surfing.
Will you go out with me?
Yes.
It's about time.
The seaside here has a nice view when the sun rises.
Huh?
Looking at it from here
It'll only be about another ten minutes.
No way.
I'm not lying.
The next time you can come see it too.
Me riding the waves.
If I don't go back now...
You still have a curfew after all this time?
I...
Please, I want to go back.
It'll just take a while more.
What's wrong?
Wait up!
I get it, I'll take you back.
I'm sorry.
Get on!
Your guitar!
Wait!
Kaoru!
Is she with you?
I just sent here back.
Just?
Uncle, Aunt!
Kaoru's back!
What's going on?
What're you doing?
Do you want to kill her?
How are you going to answer for it if she dies?
Die?
What?
She's sick.
She might die if she's exposed to sunlight.
Huh?
Is this from that time?
Yes.
She'll be all right.
She'll be okay, doctor?
This amount shouldn't be a problem, really.
That's great to hear.
There should be no ill-effects on your face and body.
If there isn't, tell me immediately.
She's fine.
What?
Don't go "What" on me!
Who's that guy?
You didn't mention anything about him.
I don't feel like talking about it.
You...
Is it someone you like, Kaoru?
It is, isn't it?
Is that so?
What's wrong with that?
But it's over.
Huh?
Though I thought it had nothing to do with my illness,
In the end, it's impossible for me to like somebody.
Don't worry.
We won't meet again.
The other party won't like a girl like me who's sick.
Don't say things like that.
It's not your illness, it's your personality.
He still has a future.
You have a future too, Kaoru.
Is that so?
Yes, you have.
All those pretty words again.
What about it?
Even though I can't be cured?
There's no such thing.
Then, look into my eyes when you say that.
I won't be deceived again.
I'm no longer a kid.
Who is it?
It's me.
How're you feeling?
What's wrong?
Aren't you going to sing any more?
You were singing so well too.
If you don't sing now, you'll never sing again.
I want to hear it one more time.
I...
I'd be content if I could live an ordinary life.
That's all I ask.
Don't come again.
What?
If you get involved with me, nothing good will come out of it.
Wait a minute!
Excuse me...
Yes?
Ah... a surfing board, isn't it?
Yes.
If I take it,
I'll pay you about 2000 yen.
Deal.
Is that so?
You two go on ahead.
You don't want any more?
You're the part-timer, aren't you?
Yes.
Finish it before sundown.
Yes.
Ah... about that...
Are you really going to pay me 20,000 yen?
Of course, but it's not just one boat, but all of them.
You'll get the money only if you clean all of them.
If you're only doing this much that'll be about 6000 yen for today.
Well, work hard.
You're slow!
What's with it, suddenly calling me out?
Well, I thought that since it's you, you'd know.
About what?
About her ex-boyfriend.
I don't know anything.
You haven't been punched in a long time, have you?
All right, I'll tell you.
I know everything about it.
He's a local high school student?
Yeah.
I see.
Say...
What?
What I say from now on...
Judge it from the view of a high school student.
Huh?
If I say anything about him, will Kaoru get angry?
Of course she will!
Don't pull me down along with you.
Then, if I asked him to see Kaoru,
Will Kaoru get angry?
Huh?
It's fine even if you lie to her.
Please do me this favor.
Will she be angry?
Won't she be so hurt she'll cry?
That's why, now...
I want to go meet you
That's what I decided
The in my pocket...
I want you to hear it
At this soft volume
Making sure it's right
Kaoru, it's time for dinner.
I got it.
Heya, Kaoru!
This plate is fine, right?
Yo.
Sorry for intruding.
Thanks for the food.
Thanks for the food!
Thanks for the food.
Ah, thank you.
You don't usually eat so much, do you?
Oh, sorry.
I totally can't understand what you're saying.
Don't worry about it.
Fuji-kun, don't hold back.
Ah, thank you for the food.
All of them look delicious.
You're really a nice lad.
No way.
No, it's true, you're a really nice kid.
Eat this, eat this.
Thank you, I'll be eating then.
Isn't there something wrong?
Isn't it strange like this?
Whose idea was this?
Your Dad invited me here.
Dad!
What did you say to Fujishiro-kun?
Don't get angry.
I'm not particularly angry.
What's with this?
What are you planning do to?
We didn't intend to hide it from you.
Here.
No matter what,
I want to hear your song once more.
But because I'm not too smart,
I could only think of such an idea.
I've only started working part-time,
I don't have any savings at all.
If it's about money,
I can settle it.
Really?
Yeah.
I think it's better for you not to get involved.
Why?
This is my own decision.
I want to see it through to the end by myself.
I see.
What do you think?
Don't you have any interest in improving your voice?
I did it.
I never thought you would think so far for me.
You flatter me...
Thank you.
Can someone like me really...
I don't think I'm capable of such a thing.
I...
Ah, did I say something wrong?
I like you.
What?
Even if you stay like this...
Let's meet up at night then.
You can sleep in the day.
When the sun sets I'll come see you.
Yup.
Huh?
Hey.
What?
Are you crying?
I'm not crying, you idiot.
You're crying, aren't you?
I said I'm not crying.
Let me see your face.
Don't cry!
Smile!
What a weird face.
That's too much.
What's wrong?
I'm just a little tired.
I'll go find us something to eat.
Oh!
That looks good.
The brain has started to contract.
The XP symptoms of nervous disorder are starting to appear.
Most likely in the near future,
Her whole body will be paralyzed.
And...
You're going to say she's going to die, isn't it?
But isn't it strange, doctor?
What is?
I didn't even let it happen once,
I never let her go under the sun.
She always said she wanted to go out when she was a child.
No matter how much she cried and screamed,
I'd give her a slap
And lock her in the house.
But why?
Why did it have to happen like this?
How do I say this...
I did all I could.
Was it all for nothing?
Why?
Why?
Why does my daughter have to suffer this kind of fate?
It'll be better if it was a shock I wasn't prepared for.
It's been hard on you.
Kaoru.
Fujishiro-kun's here.
Kaoru?
I'm coming in.
Yo.
Yeah.
How're you doing?
I'm sorry.
What?
Even though you went out of the way to get a job...
I can't sing any more.
I'm sorry.
I didn't do anything weird, did I?
Huh?
You can see me from here, isn't it?
Yeah.
What weird things are you talking about?
Like digging my nose, for example.
No, you didn't.
What about doing handstands or doing reports?
No, no.
Ah, then did you hear any weird noises?
No, I didn't.
Is that right?
That's great to hear.
The first time I saw you,
What?
The Fujishiro Kouji who was just like a kid.
At that time you seemed so happy.
Looking at you from here, I also felt happy.
You saw it.
Yeah, I was also like that.
The first time I got a guitar in my hands,
I was as delighted as you were.
I see.
Thank you.
Sure.
Well, till next time.
Yup.
Hey!
Even though my hands are like this now,
You can still listen to my voice.
Can you hear it?
Yeah, I can.
If that's the case, I'll sing.
Because I'll sing.
See you.
Wow, it's so pretty.
You don't have to be so surprised over such a thing.
It's pretty isn't it.
It's great, huh.
Wow, it's really like a debut...
It'll be okay!
Yeah.
Well, let's get started soon.
Please.
Good luck!
We'll be watching from over here.
I'll get distracted, so please leave.
What?
You'll get in the way.
You...
You've never let me listen to this song before.
Please follow what she says, Uncle.
I'll be here to listen to her.
You too, please leave.
Eh?
Why me too?
Isn't it better if you hear it after the CD comes out?
Why?
All right, all right
Then, everyone, let's all leave, shall we?
What?
Me too?
Come on now...
Don't ask any more questions and quickly leave.
Well, shall we get started?
Yes.
Did you write this song?
Yes.
It's a good song.
Really?
Thank you so much.
Let's work hard today.
Yes!
Let's do it then.
You can't hear anything.
What?
Settle down, both of you.
Will it be fine?
It hasn't started yet, has it?
What hasn't?
Because I don't hear any sound.
That's because she's not a professional.
She's a professional.
She's as good as one.
I was also surprised when we went to Yokohama.
When she sings,
Everyone'd gather around her.
If it was someone ordinary, they'd have been too frightened to sing.
As the number of people increased,
She'll become more lively.
Without realizing it,
I'd become one of her fans.
I feel once this CD gets made, it'll be sold out immediately.
Major record companies, television and radio broadcasters
will be rushing to get her CD.
She'll definitely be a great star in the future.
What's wrong?
It's getting a little hot.
Is the fan at the back turning?
If you feel it's troublesome,
Take it off then.
What?
Take it off, take it off.
If you take it off it won't be hot any more.
And you can run around.
I don't want to.
If I do that, I'll die.
Because
I've decided to live on till I die.
Because I'm going to live on with all my might.
That's right.
I don't know what's with your Dad.
He's being an idiot.
That's right.
I'm sorry.
Is it all right?
She always made a big fuss about wanting to go outside.
She's a girl that has been living in this kind of darkness.
I didn't realize she'd already grown up so much.
How about it?
I came.
What a weird face.
Shortly after that,
She passed away.
Leaving behind only countless memories and the song she loved.
That's why now,
I'm coming to meet you.
That's what I decided.
The song in my pocket,
I want to let you listen to it.
Raising the volume softly,
To make sure it's just right.
Oh good-bye days, now
It had been unchanging
Until only yesterday, so long unstylishly but staying gently
by my side, that's why
La la la la la - with you
Passing you one side of my earphones
Slowly, in that moment when the music starts flowing
Do I have the ability to love you enough?
But sometimes I get confused.
Oh good-bye days, now
It's beginning to change, but deep inside my heart it's alright
Unstylishly but staying gently by my side, that's why
La la la la la - now with you
If I could,
I don't want to think about the sadness
But you'll definitely turn up, won't you?
At that time,
With a smile,
"Yeah hello my friend", how shall I say this?
or would that be OK...
When I'm humming the same song
I wish I was by your side
I'm glad I met your uncool brand of kindness
La la la la Good-bye days
Here Kaoru comes.
I got it.
You're going tonight too?
Yup.
Every night
That's what you do, writing songs right?
Yeah.
There's no meaning in it, isn't it?
It doesn't matter, does it?
I guess it can't be helped.
Since today's a rest day for me,
I'll go take a look huh, Mum.
If you come I'll kill you.
Alright.
You know when's sunrise, right?
Yeah.
Don't go "yeah" on me.
4.40 A.M.
Since it's that way, be sure to come back before four then.
I got it.
Don't go too far.
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks for the food.
Go ahead.
Thanks for the food.
Sign:
Please wait for a moment.
She looks underaged no matter how you look at it.
At this kind of time...is she lost?
It's okay.
You don't have to worry about that girl.
Her parents explained before.
Explained about what?
How should I say this...
It's a kind of allergy to XP (a skin ailment)
Those suffering from it will die if they're exposed to sunlight.
Eh?
That's why she can only come out at night.
For whose sake am I living for?
The cloudy days pass by.
How much do you feel this pain and weakness?
Drowing myself in worthless yesterdays
I write my dreams on today, even though they're incomplete.
The twinkling stars before daybreak
Have they disappeared?
Will they be back tomorrow?
Tomorrow never knows
It's happy line.
For whose sake am I living for?
A Song in the Sun (lit.
The Sun's Song)
I'll make a move first.
Ok.
Hey, hey, hey.
Heya!
Don't you go "Heya!" with me!
You're skipping classes again, aren't you?
Um, yeah.
Where's Kaoru?
She just went to sleep.
If you wake her up now she'll kill you.
If it's me it'll be fine.
If that's the case, go up then.
Hey Aunt, you made a new one again?
Yup, because the old one was getting too small.
Wow, as one would expect of you.
I think it's better not to touch it.
Kaoru'll find out.
Misaki-chan, I don't want to say this but...
Don't ravage the stuff in the refrigerator.
I got it.
It's rare to find someone that can't even ride up to there, isn't it?
It can't be helped since he kept on saying he liked surfing.
But it's quite cute that way, isn't it.
Hey...hasn't the sun risen a little too much?
It's already ten!
No way!
Kouji, get out, quick!
You're gonna be late!
What?
Yup, I got it.
Please wait for a little while.
Alaria and sardine salad and Margarita pizza.
Here you go, sorry to keep you waiting.
What're you looking at?
Nothing.
Sign:
Yamacho Street
It's already dark and I can't make out your face...
Everyone else has happiness on their faces,
Can you see it?
Even if I can't laugh, yeah yeah.
The thoughts on their way to tomorrow in my heart,
I see your red eyes
And tried to laugh
Tomorrow never knows
It's happy line
Someone you know?
Hey, wait, where're you going?
Ouch...
I'm Amane Kaoru.
What?
I'm Amane Kaoru.
Huh?
I'm Amane Kaoru.
What about it?
I'm sixteen.
Living with my parents.
My hobby is music.
I have a bit of a quick-tempered personality.
I don't have a boyfriend.
Huh?
I've always been looking at you.
All this time.
I don't have a boyfriend.
Ah...
I see...about this...hold on a sec...
And I never had a boyfriend before.
Er, no...that's not...wait...
My favourite animal is the cheetah -
And for food, I like bananas - and...
Er...
Favourite musician...
There's too many, which one should I start from?
Sorry, please excuse us.
What?
What "What?" ?
Don't get in my way.
Huh?
Get in your way?
I just got you out of a pinch.
Huh?
Don't go "Eh?" on me!
You were in a state of confusion just now.
What did you mean, "I like bananas?"
That was totally unprofessional of you.
I guess so.
Hey.
You haven't talked to a guy since elementary school, haven't you?
So, what's up with that guy?
He probably goes to the same high school as me.
Yeah...
Oh, I didn't know that...
That's what you get for skipping school, idiot!
Yeah.
Huh?
As I was saying...
You don't know anything about him.
Yeah, that's because I've only been looking at him from here.
I see...
What kind of person is he, I wonder?
I wonder if he's good at surfing?
Then...
Why don't you wear that suit that's hanging in the hall?
No!
If he sees me like that he'll hate me!
Well, it can't be helped then.
It's been a long time since I last went to school, but I'll go and find out more details.
Really?
Yup!
Sorry for the wait.
If she doesn't want to come in person,
I can't perform the medical examination.
I'm sorry.
She wouldn't come no matter what.
As usual, does she still hate the hospital that much?
It seems it's the place she hates most in the world.
Is that so?
So, how's her condition?
She's still seems healthy.
No change from the usual.
I see.
That's good to hear.
Her condition hasn't gotten worse yet, isn't it...
About the age at which you said we should get mentally prepared...
She's already past that age.
Ah, I see.
Well then, excuse me for saying that.
I'll continue prescribing her medication.
About that, doctor.
I'm sorry, there still isn't a cure yet.
I see.
As you know,
The number of people who suffer from XP are very few.
But no matter for what kind of illness,
Compared to the harm done by UV rays,
The effects caused by nervous impairment as the sufferer increases in age, are more frightening.
His name is Fujishiro Kouji.
Fujishiro Kouji.
It's hot isn't it.
Fujishiro Kouji.
He's sleeping.
Nope.
It looks like he's pretty dumb.
Ah, it's better than I had thought.
Ah, by the way.
This is the first time you're seeing a high school isn't it?
Uh huh.
Everyone looks like they're enjoying themselves.
Huh?
It's meaningless going to that place.
Well, it seems these three guys...
Always hang out together.
This one over here, friend number 1 is called Onishi Yuuta.
And this one over here, friend number 2 is Satou Haruo.
I wonder if he washed his hands.
Looks like he did.
Aw, that's horrible.
Well, so that's the general impression.
All in all, he looks like a coarse idiot.
G-good evening.
Good evening.
You're the girl from that time, aren't you?
Yup.
Sorry for that time.
It's alright.
What're you doing out here this late?
Just came back from my singing.
I often sing in front of the train station.
Ah, you're one of those who sing live on the street?
Well, something like that.
Is that so?
That was a nice song you were singing.
What's it called?
I haven't decided yet.
You wrote it yourself?
Yup.
Wow, that's incredible!
Really?
Is that a surfboard?
Yup.
That's a cool-looking surfboard.
You know about it?
Yeah.
Yeah!
I bought this after looking around for a long time.
It's still the best after all.
Though it's second-hand.
What about yours?
Huh?
Is it also second-hand?
Do you live around here?
That tall house over there.
Oh, it's just over there.
I pass by along this road every day.
Yup, I know that.
Eh?
You know about it?
You always see me from up there, don't you?
Yeah.
That's kinda embarrassing.
I can't do any weird stuff from now on.
Well then, I should get going soon.
Is that so?
I see.
See you.
Yup.
Hey!
If it's alright, I'll come the next time.
For your street performance.
Don't just say it and not come.
If if it's during the vacations, I'll definitely come.
This is your last summer vacation as a high school student
Don't get carried away with play, concentrate on your books and work hard.
Understand?
This vacation's critical.
Hey Mum.
Why is today's date circled?
I don't know, I'm not the one who did it.
It's Kaoru then?
For the me in this world, the summer vacations start today.
You scared me!
What're you doing?
Surfing, surfing...
Now that the summer holidays have come, you're going out at night instead?
Don't you have anything better to do?
Didn't I say I was going to study?
It's gonna be all guys, with Haruo and the rest.
Maybe I should go with you.
Don't come along!
I'll call to check on you.
Call my cellphone instead.
Then be sure to keep it turned on!
Thank you Kamakura!
Thank you everyone, for coming to support me.
I'm Dynamite Yamazaki.
Please listen to two of my songs.
The song is
"My name is Global Standard"!
1, 2, 3, 4!
What's this?
My place got taken.
You always sing here?
Even so, he's really awful huh.
Are you going to wait till he finishes?
It can't be helped.
Even though I was really looking forward to this day...
About that, singing.
Couldn't you sing elsewhere instead?
Huh?
It's my first time riding on a bike.
Really?
That looks ridiculous.
Done!
Shall we go?
To where?
I'll bring you to a good place.
Get on!
We're moving off.
Let's take this opportunity to look at the town while we're here.
It looks like I've been thinking too much.
Since I can't fall asleep in this room,
I might as well try flying in the night.
Sighing by the window.
Under the moonlight, I feel like escaping to somewhere far away.
Even though it seems like I'm flapping my wings,
What should I do?
I want to fly well
I don't know how to fly
I want to fly well
If only someone would teach me how
Don't wait too much for chances,
Every morning repeats itself
I grow tired of counting them
I'm going to draw the skyline
I don't know how to fly
I might be flying;
I'm not sure
I want to fly well
But I'm going to try
I want to fly well
In order to learn how to fly
I want to fly well
I want to fly in the sky
To skyline
Because I want to meet you now.
That's what I decided.
This song in my pocket,
I want you to let you listen to it.
Raising the soft volume,
To make sure it's just right.
Oh good-bye days, now
I feel it's going to change,
Until yesterday, so long unstylishly but staying gently by my side
La la la la la - with you
Passing you one side of my earphones
Slowly, in that moment when the music starts flowing
Do I have the ability to love you properly?
But sometimes I'll get lost.
Oh good-bye days, now
It's beginning to change, but deep inside my heart it's alright
Hey.
In the future, isn't it your aim to release a debut CD?
The future...
That's right.
I'd like to try that.
You're incredible.
Unlike me who doesn't have anything.
Hm?
I'll go on like this living an ordinary life, and in the end die an ordinary death.
That's not true.
From now on you can do anything.
Really?
Yeah.
You'll definitely find out what you really want to do.
It's just started.
I see.
It's like that, isn't it?
I'm too simple-minded.
I'm Fujishiro Kouji.
I don't have a girlfriend.
My hobby is surfing.
Will you go out with me?
Yes.
It's about time.
The seaside here has a nice view when the sun rises.
Huh?
Looking at it from here
It'll only be about another ten minutes.
No way.
I'm not lying.
The next time you can come see it too.
Me riding the waves.
If I don't go back now...
You still have a curfew after all this time?
I...
Please, I want to go back.
It'll just take a while more.
What's wrong?
Wait up!
I get it, I'll take you back.
I'm sorry.
Get on!
Your guitar!
Wait!
Kaoru!
Is she with you?
I just sent here back.
Just?
Just?
Uncle, Aunt!
Kaoru's back!
What's going on?
What're you doing?
Do you want to kill her?
How are you going to answer for it if she dies?
Die?
What?
She's sick.
She might die if she's exposed to sunlight.
Huh?
Is this from that time?
Yes.
She'll be all right.
She'll be okay, doctor?
This amount shouldn't be a problem, really.
That's great to hear.
There should be no ill-effects on your face and body.
If there isn't, tell me immediately.
She's fine.
What?
Don't go "What" on me!
Who's that guy?
You didn't mention anything about him.
I don't feel like talking about it.
You...
Is it someone you like, Kaoru?
It is, isn't it?
Is that so?
What's wrong with that?
But it's over.
Huh?
Though I thought it had nothing to do with my illness,
In the end, it's impossible for me to like somebody.
Don't worry.
We won't meet again.
The other party won't like a girl like me who's sick.
Don't say things like that.
It's not your illness, it's your personality.
He still has a future.
You have a future too, Kaoru.
Is that so?
Yes, you have.
All those pretty words again.
What about it?
Even though I can't be cured?
There's no such thing.
Then, look into my eyes when you say that.
I won't be deceived again.
I'm no longer a kid.
Who is it?
It's me.
How're you feeling?
What's wrong?
Aren't you going to sing any more?
You were singing so well too.
If you don't sing now, you'll never sing again.
I want to hear it one more time.
I...
I'd be content if I could live an ordinary life.
That's all I ask.
Don't come again.
What?
If you get involved with me, nothing good will come out of it.
Wait a minute!
Excuse me...
Yes?
Ah...a surfing board, isn't it?
Yes.
If I take it,
I'll pay you about 2000 yen.
Deal.
Is that so?
You two go on ahead.
You don't want any more?
You're the part-timer, aren't you?
Yes.
Finish it before sundown.
Yes.
Ah...about that...
Are you really going to pay me 20,000 yen?
Of course, but it's not just one boat, but all of them.
You'll get the money only if you clean all of them.
If you're only doing this much that'll be about 6000 yen for today.
Well, work hard.
You're slow!
What's with it, suddenly calling me out?
Well, I thought that since it's you, you'd know.
About what?
About her ex-boyfriend.
I don't know anything.
You haven't been punched in a long time, have you?
All right, I'll tell you.
I know everything about it.
He's a local high school student?
Yeah.
I see.
Say...
What?
What I say from now on...
Judge it from the view of a high school student.
Huh?
If I say anything about him, will Kaoru get angry?
Of course she will!
Don't pull me down along with you.
Then, if I asked him to see Kaoru,
Will Kaoru get angry?
Huh?
It's fine even if you lie to her.
Please do me this favour.
Will she be angry?
Won't she be so hurt she'll cry?
That's why, now...
I want to go meet you
That's what I decided
The (song) in my pocket...
I want you to hear it
At this soft volume
Making sure it's right
Kaoru, it's time for dinner.
I got it.
Heya, Kaoru!
This plate is fine, right?
Yo.
Sorry for intruding.
Thanks for the food.
Thanks for the food!
Thanks for the food.
Ah, thank you.
You don't usually eat so much, do you?
Oh, sorry.
I totally can't understand what you're saying.
Don't worry about it.
Fuji-kun, don't hold back.
Ah, thank you for the food.
All of them look delicious.
You're really a nice lad.
No way.
No, it's true, you're a really nice kid.
Eat this, eat this.
Thank you, I'll be eating then.
Isn't there something wrong?
Isn't it strange like this?
Whose idea was this?
Your Dad invited me here.
Dad!
What did you say to Fujishiro-kun?
Don't get angry.
I'm not particularly angry.
What's with this?
What are you planning do to?
We didn't intend to hide it from you.
Here.
No matter what,
I want to hear your song once more.
But because I'm not too smart,
I could only think of such an idea.
I've only started working part-time,
I don't have any savings at all.
If it's about money,
I can settle it.
Really?
Yeah.
I think it's better for you not to get involved.
Why?
This is my own decision.
I want to see it through to the end by myself.
I see.
What do you think?
Don't you have any interest in improving your voice?
I did it.
I never thought you would think so far for me.
You flatter me...
Thank you.
Can someone like me really... ?
I don't think I'm capable of such a thing.
I...
Ah, did I say something wrong?
I like you.
What?
Even if you stay like this...
Let's meet up at night then.
You can sleep in the day.
When the sun sets I'll come see you.
Yup.
Huh?
Hey.
What?
Are you crying?
I'm not crying, you idiot.
You're crying, aren't you?
I said I'm not crying.
Let me see your face.
Don't cry!
Smile!
What a weird face.
That's too much.
What's wrong?
I'm just a little tired.
I'll go find us something to eat.
Oh!
That looks good.
The brain has started to contract.
The XP symptoms of nervous disorder are starting to appear.
Most likely in the near future,
Her whole body will be paralysed.
And...
You're going to say she's going to die, isn't it?
But isn't it strange, doctor?
What is?
I didn't even let it happen once,
I never let her go under the sun.
She always said she wanted to go out when she was a child.
No matter how much she cried and screamed,
I'd give her a slap
And lock her in the house.
But why?
Why did it have to happen like this?
How do I say this...
I did all I could.
Was it all for nothing?
Why?
Why?
Why does my daughter have to suffer this kind of fate?
It'll be better if it was a shock I wasn't prepared for.
It's been hard on you.
Kaoru.
Fujishiro-kun's here.
Kaoru?
I'm coming in.
Yo.
Yeah.
How're you doing?
I'm sorry.
What?
Even though you went out of the way to get a job...
I can't sing any more.
I'm sorry.
I didn't do anything weird, did I?
Huh?
You can see me from here, isn't it?
Yeah.
What weird things are you talking about?
Like digging my nose, for example.
No, you didn't.
What about doing handstands or doing reports?
No, no.
Ah, then did you hear any weird noises?
No, I didn't.
Is that right?
That's great to hear.
The first time I saw you,
What?
The Fujishiro Kouji who was just like a kid.
At that time you seemed so happy.
Looking at you from here, I also felt happy.
You saw it.
Yeah, I was also like that.
The first time I got a guitar in my hands,
I was as delighted as you were.
I see.
Thank you.
Sure.
Well, till next time.
Yup.
Hey!
Even though my hands are like this now,
You can still listen to my voice.
Can you hear it?
Yeah, I can.
If that's the case, I'll sing.
Because I'll sing.
See you.
Wow, it's so pretty.
You don't have to be so surprised over such a thing.
It's pretty isn't it.
It's great, huh.
Wow, it's really like a debut...
It'll be okay!
Yeah.
Well, let's get started soon.
Please.
Good luck!
We'll be watching from over here.
I'll get distracted, so please leave.
What?
You'll get in the way.
You...
You've never let me listen to this song before.
Please follow what she says, Uncle.
I'll be here to listen to her.
You too, please leave.
Eh?
Why me too?
Isn't it better if you hear it after the CD comes out?
Why?
All right, all right
Then, everyone, let's all leave, shall we?
What?
Me too?
Come on now...
Don't ask any more questions and quickly leave.
Well, shall we get started?
Yes.
Did you write this song?
Yes.
It's a good song.
Really?
Thank you so much.
Let's work hard today.
Yes!
Let's do it then.
You can't hear anything.
What?
Settle down, both of you.
Will it be fine?
It hasn't started yet, has it?
.
What hasn't?
Because I don't hear any sound.
That's because she's not a professional.
She's a professional.
She's as good as one.
I was also surprised when we went to Yokohama.
When she sings,
Everyone'd gather around her.
If it was someone ordinary, he/she'd have been too frightened to sing on.
As the number of people increased,
She'll become more lively.
Without realising it,
I'd become one of her fans.
I feel once this CD gets made, it'll be sold out immediately.
Major record companies, television and radio broadcasters
will be rushing to get her CD.
She'll definitely be a great star in the future.
What's wrong?
It's getting a little hot.
Is the fan at the back turning?
If you feel it's troublesome,
Take it off then.
What?
Take it off, take it off.
If you take it off it won't be hot any more.
And you can run around.
I don't want to.
If I do that, I'll die.
Because
I've decided to live on till I die.
Because I'm going to live on with all my might.
That's right.
I don't know what's with your Dad.
He's being an idiot.
That's right.
I'm sorry.
Is it all right?
She always made a big fuss about wanting to go outside.
She's a girl that has been living in this kind of darkness.
I didn't realise she'd already grown up so much.
How about it?
I came.
What a ridiculous face.
Shortly after that,
She passed away.
Leaving behind only countless memories and the song she loved.
That's why now,
I'm coming to meet you.
That's what I decided.
The song in my pocket,
I want to let you listen to it.
Raising the soft volume,
To make sure it's just right.
Oh good-bye days, now
I know things are going to change,
Until yesterday, so long unstylishly but staying gently
by my side, that's why
La la la la la - with you
Passing you one side of my earphones
Slowly, in that moment when the music starts flowing
Do I have the ability to love you properly?
But sometimes I'll get lost.
Oh good-bye days, now
It's beginning to change, but deep inside my heart it's alright
Unstylishly but staying gently by my side, that's why
La la la la la - now with you
If I could,
I don't want to think about the sadness
But you'll definitely turn up, won't you?
At this time,
With a smile,
Yeah hello my friend, how shall I say this?
It's fine even if I said it out loud
When I'm humming the same song
I wish I was by your side
I'm glad I met your uncool brand of kindness
La la la la Good-bye days
Oh there she is.
Mother, Kaoru is here.
Oh, hi!
You're going tonight too?
Yup.
Every night
That's what you do, writing songs right?
Yeah.
There's no meaning in it, isn't it?
It doesn't matter, does it?
I guess it can't be helped.
Since today's a rest day for me,
I'll go take a look huh, Mum.
If you come I'll kill you.
Alright.
You know when's sunrise, right?
Yeah.
Don't go "yeah" on me.
4:40 a.m.
Since it's that way, be sure to come back before four then.
I got it.
Don't go too far.
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks for the food.
Go ahead.
Thanks for the food.
Sign:
Please wait for a moment.
She looks underaged no matter how you look at it.
At this kind of time... is she lost?
It's okay.
You don't have to worry about that girl.
Her parents explained before.
Explained about what?
How should I say this...
XP is a kinda like an allergy.
Those suffering from it will die if they're exposed to sunlight.
Eh?
That's why she can only come out at night.
For whose sake am I living for?
The cloudy days pass by.
How much do you feel this pain and weakness?
Drowning myself in worthless yesterdays
I write my dreams on today, even though they're incomplete.
The twinkling stars before daybreak
Have they disappeared?
Will they be back tomorrow?
Tomorrow never knows
It's happy line.
For whose sake am I living for?
A Song in the Sun
I'll make a move first.
OK.
Hey, hey, hey.
Osu!
Don't you go "Osu!" with me!
You're skipping classes again, aren't you?
Osu!
Where's Kaoru?
She just went to sleep.
If you wake her up now she'll kill you.
If it's me it'll be fine.
If that's the case, go up then.
Hey Aunt, you made a new one again?
Yup, because the old one was getting too small.
Wow, as one would expect of you.
I think it's better not to touch it.
Kaoru'll find out.
Misaki-chan, I don't want to say this but...
Don't ravage the stuff in the refrigerator.
I got it.
It's rare to find someone that can't even ride up to there, isn't it?
It can't be helped since he kept on saying he liked surfing.
But it's quite cute that way, isn't it.
Hey, the sun... hasn't it risen a little too much?
It's already ten!
No way!
Kouji, get out, quick!
You're gonna be late!
What?
Yup, I got it.
Please wait for a little while.
Alaria and sardine salad and Margarita pizza.
Here you go, sorry to keep you waiting.
What're you looking at?
Nothing.
Sign:
Yamacho Street
It's already dark and I can't make out your face...
Everyone else has happiness on their faces,
Can you see it?
Even if I can't laugh, yeah yeah.
The thoughts on their way to tomorrow in my heart,
I see your red eyes
And tried to laugh
Tomorrow never knows
It's happy line
Someone you know?
Hey, wait, where're you going?
Ouch...
I'm Amane Kaoru.
What?
I'm Amane Kaoru.
Huh?
I'm Amane Kaoru.
What about it?
I'm sixteen.
Living with my parents.
My hobby is music.
I have a bit of a quick-tempered personality.
I don't have a boyfriend.
Huh?
I've always been looking at you.
All this time.
I don't have a boyfriend.
Ah...
I see... about this... hold on a sec...
And I never had a boyfriend before.
Er, no... that's not... wait...
My favorite animal is the cheetah -
And for food, I like bananas - and...
Er...
Favorite musician...
There's too many, which one should I start from?
Sorry, please excuse us.
What?
What "What?"?
Don't get in my way.
Huh?
Get in your way?
I just got you out of a pinch.
Huh?
Don't go "Eh?" on me!
You were in a state of confusion just now.
What did you mean, "I like bananas?"
That was totally unprofessional of you.
I guess so.
Hey.
You haven't talked to a guy since elementary school, haven't you?
So, what's up with that guy?
He probably goes to the same high school as me.
Yeah...
Oh, I didn't know that...
That's what you get for skipping school, idiot!
Yeah.
Huh?
As I was saying...
You don't know anything about him.
Yeah, that's because I've only been looking at him from here.
I see...
What kind of person is he, I wonder?
I wonder if he's good at surfing?
Then...
Why don't you wear that suit that's hanging in the hall?
No!
If he sees me like that he'll hate me!
Well, it can't be helped then.
It's been a long time since I last went to school, but I'll go and find out more details.
Really?
Yup!
Sorry for the wait.
If she doesn't want to come in person,
I can't perform the medical examination.
I'm sorry.
She wouldn't come no matter what.
As usual, does she still hate the hospital that much?
It seems it's the place she hates most in the world.
Is that so?
So, how's her condition?
She's still seems healthy.
No change from the usual.
I see.
That's good to hear.
Her condition hasn't gotten worse yet, isn't it...
About the age at which you said we should get mentally prepared...
She's already past that age.
Ah, I see.
Well then, excuse me for saying that.
I'll continue prescribing her medication.
About that, doctor.
I'm sorry, there still isn't a cure yet.
I see.
As you know,
The number of people who suffer from XP are very few.
But no matter for what kind of illness,
Compared to the harm done by UV rays,
The effects caused by nervous impairment as the sufferer increases in age, are more frightening.
His name is Fujishiro Kouji.
Fujishiro Kouji.
It's hot isn't it.
Fujishiro Kouji.
He's sleeping.
Nope.
It looks like he's pretty dumb.
Ah, it's better than I had thought.
Ah, by the way.
This is the first time you're seeing a high school isn't it?
Uh huh.
Everyone looks like they're enjoying themselves.
Huh?
It's meaningless going to that place.
Well, it seems these three guys...
Always hang out together.
This one over here, friend number I is called Onishi Yuuta.
And this one over here, friend number 2 is Satou Haruo.
I wonder if he washed his hands.
Looks like he did.
Aw, that's horrible.
Well, so that's the general impression.
All in all, he looks like a coarse idiot.
G-good evening.
Good evening.
You're the girl from that time, aren't you?
Yup.
Sorry for that time.
It's alright.
What're you doing out here this late?
Just came back from my singing.
I often sing in front of the train station.
Ah, you're one of those who sing live on the street?
Well, something like that.
Is that so?
That was a nice song you were singing.
What's it called?
I haven't decided yet.
You wrote it yourself?
Yup.
Wow, that's incredible!
Really?
Is that a surfboard?
Yup.
That's a cool-looking surfboard.
You know about it?
Yeah.
Yeah!
I bought this after looking around for a long time.
It's still the best after all.
Though it's second-hand.
What about yours?
Huh?
Is it also second-hand?
Do you live around here?
That tall house over there.
Oh, it's just over there.
I pass by along this road every day.
Yup, I know that.
Eh?
You know about it?
You always see me from up there, don't you?
Yeah.
That's kinda embarrassing.
I can't do any weird stuff from now on.
Well then, I should get going soon.
Is that so?
I see.
See you.
Yup.
Hey!
If it's alright, I'll come the next time.
For your street performance.
Don't just say it and not come.
If it's during the vacations, I'll definitely come.
This is your last summer vacation as a high school student
Don't get carried away with play, concentrate on your books and work hard.
Understand?
This vacation's critical.
Hey Mum.
Why is today's date circled?
I don't know, I'm not the one who did it.
It's Kaoru then?
For the me in this world, the summer vacations start today.
You scared me!
What're you doing?
Surfing, surfing...
Now that the summer holidays have come, you're going out at night instead?
Don't you have anything better to do?
Didn't I say I was going to study?
It's gonna be all guys, with Haruo and the rest.
Maybe I should go with you.
Don't come along!
I'll call to check on you.
Call my cellphone instead.
Then be sure to keep it turned on!
Thank you Kamakura!
Thank you everyone, for coming to support me.
I'm Dynamite Yamazaki.
Please listen to two of my songs.
The song is
"My name is Global Standard"!
I, 2, 3, 4!
What's this?
My place got taken.
You always sing here?
Even so, he's really awful huh.
Are you going to wait till he finishes?
It can't be helped.
Even though I was really looking forward to this day...
About that, singing.
Couldn't you sing elsewhere instead?
Huh?
It's my first time riding on a bike.
Really?
That looks ridiculous.
Done!
Shall we go?
To where?
I'll bring you to a good place.
Get on!
We're moving off.
Let's take this opportunity to look at the town while we're here.
It looks like I've been thinking too much.
Since I can't fall asleep in this room,
I might as well try flying in the night.
Sighing by the window.
Under the moonlight, I feel like escaping to somewhere far away.
Even though it seems like I'm flapping my wings,
What should I do?
I want to fly well
I don't know how to fly
I want to fly well
If only someone would teach me how
Don't wait too much for chances,
Every morning repeats itself
I grow tired of counting them
I'm going to draw the skyline
I don't know how to fly
I might be flying;
I'm not sure
I want to fly well
But I'm going to try
I want to fly well
In order to learn how to fly
I want to fly well
I want to fly in the sky
To skyline
Because I want to meet you now.
That's what I decided.
This song in my pocket,
I want you to let you listen to it.
Raising the soft volume,
To make sure it's just right.
Oh good-bye days, now
I feel it's going to change,
Until yesterday, so long unstylishly but staying gently by my side
La la la la la - with you
Passing you one side of my earphones
Slowly, in that moment when the music starts flowing
Do I have the ability to love you properly?
But sometimes I'll get lost.
Oh good-bye days, now
It's beginning to change, but deep inside my heart it's alright
Hey.
In the future, isn't it your aim to release a debut CD?
The future...
That's right.
I'd like to try that.
You're incredible.
Unlike me who doesn't have anything.
Hm?
I'll go on like this living an ordinary life, and in the end die an ordinary death.
That's not true.
From now on you can do anything.
Really?
Yeah.
You'll definitely find out what you really want to do.
It's just started.
I see.
It's like that, isn't it?
I'm too simple-minded.
I'm Fujishiro Kouji.
I don't have a girlfriend.
My hobby is surfing.
Will you go out with me?
Yes.
It's about time.
The seaside here has a nice view when the sun rises.
Huh?
Looking at it from here
It'll only be about another ten minutes.
No way.
I'm not lying.
The next time you can come see it too.
Me riding the waves.
If I don't go back now...
You still have a curfew after all this time?
I...
Please, I want to go back.
It'll just take a while more.
What's wrong?
Wait up!
I get it, I'll take you back.
I'm sorry.
Get on!
Your guitar!
Wait!
Kaoru!
Is she with you?
I just sent here back.
Just?
Uncle, Aunt!
Kaoru's back!
What's going on?
What're you doing?
Do you want to kill her?
How are you going to answer for it if she dies?
Die?
What?
She's sick.
She might die if she's exposed to sunlight.
Huh?
Is this from that time?
Yes.
She'll be all right.
She'll be okay, doctor?
This amount shouldn't be a problem, really.
That's great to hear.
There should be no ill-effects on your face and body.
If there isn't, tell me immediately.
She's fine.
What?
Don't go "What" on me!
Who's that guy?
You didn't mention anything about him.
I don't feel like talking about it.
You...
Is it someone you like, Kaoru?
It is, isn't it?
Is that so?
What's wrong with that?
But it's over.
Huh?
Though I thought it had nothing to do with my illness,
In the end, it's impossible for me to like somebody.
Don't worry.
We won't meet again.
The other party won't like a girl like me who's sick.
Don't say things like that.
It's not your illness, it's your personality.
He still has a future.
You have a future too, Kaoru.
Is that so?
Yes, you have.
All those pretty words again.
What about it?
Even though I can't be cured?
There's no such thing.
Then, look into my eyes when you say that.
I won't be deceived again.
I'm no longer a kid.
Who is it?
It's me.
How're you feeling?
What's wrong?
Aren't you going to sing any more?
You were singing so well too.
If you don't sing now, you'll never sing again.
I want to hear it one more time.
I...
I'd be content if I could live an ordinary life.
That's all I ask.
Don't come again.
What?
If you get involved with me, nothing good will come out of it.
Wait a minute!
Excuse me...
Yes?
Ah... a surfing board, isn't it?
Yes.
If I take it,
I'll pay you about 2000 yen.
Deal.
Is that so?
You two go on ahead.
You don't want any more?
You're the part-timer, aren't you?
Yes.
Finish it before sundown.
Yes.
Ah... about that...
Are you really going to pay me 20,000 yen?
Of course, but it's not just one boat, but all of them.
You'll get the money only if you clean all of them.
If you're only doing this much that'll be about 6000 yen for today.
Well, work hard.
You're slow!
What's with it, suddenly calling me out?
Well, I thought that since it's you, you'd know.
About what?
About her ex-boyfriend.
I don't know anything.
You haven't been punched in a long time, have you?
All right, I'll tell you.
I know everything about it.
He's a local high school student?
Yeah.
I see.
Say...
What?
What I say from now on...
Judge it from the view of a high school student.
Huh?
If I say anything about him, will Kaoru get angry?
Of course she will!
Don't pull me down along with you.
Then, if I asked him to see Kaoru,
Will Kaoru get angry?
Huh?
It's fine even if you lie to her.
Please do me this favor.
Will she be angry?
Won't she be so hurt she'll cry?
That's why, now...
I want to go meet you
That's what I decided
The in my pocket...
I want you to hear it
At this soft volume
Making sure it's right
Kaoru, it's time for dinner.
I got it.
Heya, Kaoru!
This plate is fine, right?
Yo.
Sorry for intruding.
Thanks for the food.
Thanks for the food!
Thanks for the food.
Ah, thank you.
You don't usually eat so much, do you?
Oh, sorry.
I totally can't understand what you're saying.
Don't worry about it.
Fuji-kun, don't hold back.
Ah, thank you for the food.
All of them look delicious.
You're really a nice lad.
No way.
No, it's true, you're a really nice kid.
Eat this, eat this.
Thank you, I'll be eating then.
Isn't there something wrong?
Isn't it strange like this?
Whose idea was this?
Your Dad invited me here.
Dad!
What did you say to Fujishiro-kun?
Don't get angry.
I'm not particularly angry.
What's with this?
What are you planning do to?
We didn't intend to hide it from you.
Here.
No matter what,
I want to hear your song once more.
But because I'm not too smart,
I could only think of such an idea.
I've only started working part-time,
I don't have any savings at all.
If it's about money,
I can settle it.
Really?
Yeah.
I think it's better for you not to get involved.
Why?
This is my own decision.
I want to see it through to the end by myself.
I see.
What do you think?
Don't you have any interest in improving your voice?
I did it.
I never thought you would think so far for me.
You flatter me...
Thank you.
Can someone like me really...
I don't think I'm capable of such a thing.
I...
Ah, did I say something wrong?
I like you.
What?
Even if you stay like this...
Let's meet up at night then.
You can sleep in the day.
When the sun sets I'll come see you.
Yup.
Huh?
Hey.
What?
Are you crying?
I'm not crying, you idiot.
You're crying, aren't you?
I said I'm not crying.
Let me see your face.
Don't cry!
Smile!
What a weird face.
That's too much.
What's wrong?
I'm just a little tired.
I'll go find us something to eat.
Oh!
That looks good.
The brain has started to contract.
The XP symptoms of nervous disorder are starting to appear.
Most likely in the near future,
Her whole body will be paralyzed.
And...
You're going to say she's going to die, isn't it?
But isn't it strange, doctor?
What is?
I didn't even let it happen once,
I never let her go under the sun.
She always said she wanted to go out when she was a child.
No matter how much she cried and screamed,
I'd give her a slap
And lock her in the house.
But why?
Why did it have to happen like this?
How do I say this...
I did all I could.
Was it all for nothing?
Why?
Why?
Why does my daughter have to suffer this kind of fate?
It'll be better if it was a shock I wasn't prepared for.
It's been hard on you.
Kaoru.
Fujishiro-kun's here.
Kaoru?
I'm coming in.
Yo.
Yeah.
How're you doing?
I'm sorry.
What?
Even though you went out of the way to get a job...
I can't sing any more.
I'm sorry.
I didn't do anything weird, did I?
Huh?
You can see me from here, isn't it?
Yeah.
What weird things are you talking about?
Like digging my nose, for example.
No, you didn't.
What about doing handstands or doing reports?
No, no.
Ah, then did you hear any weird noises?
No, I didn't.
Is that right?
That's great to hear.
The first time I saw you,
What?
The Fujishiro Kouji who was just like a kid.
At that time you seemed so happy.
Looking at you from here, I also felt happy.
You saw it.
Yeah, I was also like that.
The first time I got a guitar in my hands,
I was as delighted as you were.
I see.
Thank you.
Sure.
Well, till next time.
Yup.
Hey!
Even though my hands are like this now,
You can still listen to my voice.
Can you hear it?
Yeah, I can.
If that's the case, I'll sing.
Because I'll sing.
See you.
Wow, it's so pretty.
You don't have to be so surprised over such a thing.
It's pretty isn't it.
It's great, huh.
Wow, it's really like a debut...
It'll be okay!
Yeah.
Well, let's get started soon.
Please.
Good luck!
We'll be watching from over here.
I'll get distracted, so please leave.
What?
You'll get in the way.
You...
You've never let me listen to this song before.
Please follow what she says, Uncle.
I'll be here to listen to her.
You too, please leave.
Eh?
Why me too?
Isn't it better if you hear it after the CD comes out?
Why?
All right, all right
Then, everyone, let's all leave, shall we?
What?
Me too?
Come on now...
Don't ask any more questions and quickly leave.
Well, shall we get started?
Yes.
Did you write this song?
Yes.
It's a good song.
Really?
Thank you so much.
Let's work hard today.
Yes!
Let's do it then.
You can't hear anything.
What?
Settle down, both of you.
Will it be fine?
It hasn't started yet, has it?
What hasn't?
Because I don't hear any sound.
That's because she's not a professional.
She's a professional.
She's as good as one.
I was also surprised when we went to Yokohama.
When she sings,
Everyone'd gather around her.
If it was someone ordinary, they'd have been too frightened to sing.
As the number of people increased,
She'll become more lively.
Without realizing it,
I'd become one of her fans.
I feel once this CD gets made, it'll be sold out immediately.
Major record companies, television and radio broadcasters
will be rushing to get her CD.
She'll definitely be a great star in the future.
What's wrong?
It's getting a little hot.
Is the fan at the back turning?
If you feel it's troublesome,
Take it off then.
What?
Take it off, take it off.
If you take it off it won't be hot any more.
And you can run around.
I don't want to.
If I do that, I'll die.
Because
I've decided to live on till I die.
Because I'm going to live on with all my might.
That's right.
I don't know what's with your Dad.
He's being an idiot.
That's right.
I'm sorry.
Is it all right?
She always made a big fuss about wanting to go outside.
She's a girl that has been living in this kind of darkness.
I didn't realize she'd already grown up so much.
How about it?
I came.
What a weird face.
Shortly after that,
She passed away.
Leaving behind only countless memories and the song she loved.
That's why now,
I'm coming to meet you.
That's what I decided.
The song in my pocket,
I want to let you listen to it.
Raising the volume softly,
To make sure it's just right.
Oh good-bye days, now
It had been unchanging
Until only yesterday, so long unstylishly but staying gently
by my side, that's why
La la la la la - with you
Passing you one side of my earphones
Slowly, in that moment when the music starts flowing
Do I have the ability to love you enough?
But sometimes I get confused.
Oh good-bye days, now
It's beginning to change, but deep inside my heart it's alright
Unstylishly but staying gently by my side, that's why
La la la la la - now with you
If I could,
I don't want to think about the sadness
But you'll definitely turn up, won't you?
At that time,
With a smile,
"Yeah hello my friend", how shall I say this?
or would that be OK...
When I'm humming the same song
I wish I was by your side
I'm glad I met your uncool brand of kindness
La la la la Good-bye days
Oh there she is.
Mother, Kaoru is here.
Oh, hi!
You're going tonight too?
Yup.
Every night
That's what you do, writing songs right?
Yeah.
There's no meaning in it, isn't it?
It doesn't matter, does it?
I guess it can't be helped.
Since today's a rest day for me,
I'll go take a look huh, Mum.
If you come I'll kill you.
Alright.
You know when's sunrise, right?
Yeah.
Don't go "yeah" on me.
4:40 a.m.
Since it's that way, be sure to come back before four then.
I got it.
Don't go too far.
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks for the food.
Go ahead.
Thanks for the food.
Sign:
Please wait for a moment.
She looks underaged no matter how you look at it.
At this kind of time... is she lost?
It's okay.
You don't have to worry about that girl.
Her parents explained before.
Explained about what?
How should I say this...
XP is a kinda like an allergy.
Those suffering from it will die if they're exposed to sunlight.
Eh?
That's why she can only come out at night.
For whose sake am I living for?
The cloudy days pass by.
How much do you feel this pain and weakness?
Drowning myself in worthless yesterdays
I write my dreams on today, even though they're incomplete.
The twinkling stars before daybreak
Have they disappeared?
Will they be back tomorrow?
Tomorrow never knows
It's happy line.
For whose sake am I living for?
A Song in the Sun
I'll make a move first.
OK.
Hey, hey, hey.
Osu!
Don't you go "Osu!" with me!
You're skipping classes again, aren't you?
Osu!
Where's Kaoru?
She just went to sleep.
If you wake her up now she'll kill you.
If it's me it'll be fine.
If that's the case, go up then.
Hey Aunt, you made a new one again?
Yup, because the old one was getting too small.
Wow, as one would expect of you.
I think it's better not to touch it.
Kaoru'll find out.
Misaki-chan, I don't want to say this but...
Don't ravage the stuff in the refrigerator.
I got it.
It's rare to find someone that can't even ride up to there, isn't it?
It can't be helped since he kept on saying he liked surfing.
But it's quite cute that way, isn't it.
Hey, the sun... hasn't it risen a little too much?
It's already ten!
No way!
Kouji, get out, quick!
You're gonna be late!
What?
Yup, I got it.
Please wait for a little while.
Alaria and sardine salad and Margarita pizza.
Here you go, sorry to keep you waiting.
What're you looking at?
Nothing.
Sign:
Yamacho Street
It's already dark and I can't make out your face...
Everyone else has happiness on their faces,
Can you see it?
Even if I can't laugh, yeah yeah.
The thoughts on their way to tomorrow in my heart,
I see your red eyes
And tried to laugh
Tomorrow never knows
It's happy line
Someone you know?
Hey, wait, where're you going?
Ouch...
I'm Amane Kaoru.
What?
I'm Amane Kaoru.
Huh?
I'm Amane Kaoru.
What about it?
I'm sixteen.
Living with my parents.
My hobby is music.
I have a bit of a quick-tempered personality.
I don't have a boyfriend.
Huh?
I've always been looking at you.
All this time.
I don't have a boyfriend.
Ah...
I see... about this... hold on a sec...
And I never had a boyfriend before.
Er, no... that's not... wait...
My favorite animal is the cheetah -
And for food, I like bananas - and...
Er...
Favorite musician...
There's too many, which one should I start from?
Sorry, please excuse us.
What?
What "What?"?
Don't get in my way.
Huh?
Get in your way?
I just got you out of a pinch.
Huh?
Don't go "Eh?" on me!
You were in a state of confusion just now.
What did you mean, "I like bananas?"
That was totally unprofessional of you.
I guess so.
Hey.
You haven't talked to a guy since elementary school, haven't you?
So, what's up with that guy?
He probably goes to the same high school as me.
Yeah...
Oh, I didn't know that...
That's what you get for skipping school, idiot!
Yeah.
Huh?
As I was saying...
You don't know anything about him.
Yeah, that's because I've only been looking at him from here.
I see...
What kind of person is he, I wonder?
I wonder if he's good at surfing?
Then...
Why don't you wear that suit that's hanging in the hall?
No!
If he sees me like that he'll hate me!
Well, it can't be helped then.
It's been a long time since I last went to school, but I'll go and find out more details.
Really?
Yup!
Sorry for the wait.
If she doesn't want to come in person,
I can't perform the medical examination.
I'm sorry.
She wouldn't come no matter what.
As usual, does she still hate the hospital that much?
It seems it's the place she hates most in the world.
Is that so?
So, how's her condition?
She's still seems healthy.
No change from the usual.
I see.
That's good to hear.
Her condition hasn't gotten worse yet, isn't it...
About the age at which you said we should get mentally prepared...
She's already past that age.
Ah, I see.
Well then, excuse me for saying that.
I'll continue prescribing her medication.
About that, doctor.
I'm sorry, there still isn't a cure yet.
I see.
As you know,
The number of people who suffer from XP are very few.
But no matter for what kind of illness,
Compared to the harm done by UV rays,
The effects caused by nervous impairment as the sufferer increases in age, are more frightening.
His name is Fujishiro Kouji.
Fujishiro Kouji.
It's hot isn't it.
Fujishiro Kouji.
He's sleeping.
Nope.
It looks like he's pretty dumb.
Ah, it's better than I had thought.
Ah, by the way.
This is the first time you're seeing a high school isn't it?
Uh huh.
Everyone looks like they're enjoying themselves.
Huh?
It's meaningless going to that place.
Well, it seems these three guys...
Always hang out together.
This one over here, friend number I is called Onishi Yuuta.
And this one over here, friend number 2 is Satou Haruo.
I wonder if he washed his hands.
Looks like he did.
Aw, that's horrible.
Well, so that's the general impression.
All in all, he looks like a coarse idiot.
G-good evening.
Good evening.
You're the girl from that time, aren't you?
Yup.
Sorry for that time.
It's alright.
What're you doing out here this late?
Just came back from my singing.
I often sing in front of the train station.
Ah, you're one of those who sing live on the street?
Well, something like that.
Is that so?
That was a nice song you were singing.
What's it called?
I haven't decided yet.
You wrote it yourself?
Yup.
Wow, that's incredible!
Really?
Is that a surfboard?
Yup.
That's a cool-looking surfboard.
You know about it?
Yeah.
Yeah!
I bought this after looking around for a long time.
It's still the best after all.
Though it's second-hand.
What about yours?
Huh?
Is it also second-hand?
Do you live around here?
That tall house over there.
Oh, it's just over there.
I pass by along this road every day.
Yup, I know that.
Eh?
You know about it?
You always see me from up there, don't you?
Yeah.
That's kinda embarrassing.
I can't do any weird stuff from now on.
Well then, I should get going soon.
Is that so?
I see.
See you.
Yup.
Hey!
If it's alright, I'll come the next time.
For your street performance.
Don't just say it and not come.
If it's during the vacations, I'll definitely come.
This is your last summer vacation as a high school student
Don't get carried away with play, concentrate on your books and work hard.
Understand?
This vacation's critical.
Hey Mum.
Why is today's date circled?
I don't know, I'm not the one who did it.
It's Kaoru then?
For the me in this world, the summer vacations start today.
You scared me!
What're you doing?
Surfing, surfing...
Now that the summer holidays have come, you're going out at night instead?
Don't you have anything better to do?
Didn't I say I was going to study?
It's gonna be all guys, with Haruo and the rest.
Maybe I should go with you.
Don't come along!
I'll call to check on you.
Call my cellphone instead.
Then be sure to keep it turned on!
Thank you Kamakura!
Thank you everyone, for coming to support me.
I'm Dynamite Yamazaki.
Please listen to two of my songs.
The song is
"My name is Global Standard"!
I, 2, 3, 4!
What's this?
My place got taken.
You always sing here?
Even so, he's really awful huh.
Are you going to wait till he finishes?
It can't be helped.
Even though I was really looking forward to this day...
About that, singing.
Couldn't you sing elsewhere instead?
Huh?
It's my first time riding on a bike.
Really?
That looks ridiculous.
Done!
Shall we go?
To where?
I'll bring you to a good place.
Get on!
We're moving off.
Let's take this opportunity to look at the town while we're here.
It looks like I've been thinking too much.
Since I can't fall asleep in this room,
I might as well try flying in the night.
Sighing by the window.
Under the moonlight, I feel like escaping to somewhere far away.
Even though it seems like I'm flapping my wings,
What should I do?
I want to fly well
I don't know how to fly
I want to fly well
If only someone would teach me how
Don't wait too much for chances,
Every morning repeats itself
I grow tired of counting them
I'm going to draw the skyline
I don't know how to fly
I might be flying;
I'm not sure
I want to fly well
But I'm going to try
I want to fly well
In order to learn how to fly
I want to fly well
I want to fly in the sky
To skyline
Because I want to meet you now.
That's what I decided.
This song in my pocket,
I want you to let you listen to it.
Raising the soft volume,
To make sure it's just right.
Oh good-bye days, now
I feel it's going to change,
Until yesterday, so long unstylishly but staying gently by my side
La la la la la - with you
Passing you one side of my earphones
Slowly, in that moment when the music starts flowing
Do I have the ability to love you properly?
But sometimes I'll get lost.
Oh good-bye days, now
It's beginning to change, but deep inside my heart it's alright
Hey.
In the future, isn't it your aim to release a debut CD?
The future...
That's right.
I'd like to try that.
You're incredible.
Unlike me who doesn't have anything.
Hm?
I'll go on like this living an ordinary life, and in the end die an ordinary death.
That's not true.
From now on you can do anything.
Really?
Yeah.
You'll definitely find out what you really want to do.
It's just started.
I see.
It's like that, isn't it?
I'm too simple-minded.
I'm Fujishiro Kouji.
I don't have a girlfriend.
My hobby is surfing.
Will you go out with me?
Yes.
It's about time.
The seaside here has a nice view when the sun rises.
Huh?
Looking at it from here
It'll only be about another ten minutes.
No way.
I'm not lying.
The next time you can come see it too.
Me riding the waves.
If I don't go back now...
You still have a curfew after all this time?
I...
Please, I want to go back.
It'll just take a while more.
What's wrong?
Wait up!
I get it, I'll take you back.
I'm sorry.
Get on!
Your guitar!
Wait!
Kaoru!
Is she with you?
I just sent here back.
Just?
Uncle, Aunt!
Kaoru's back!
What's going on?
What're you doing?
Do you want to kill her?
How are you going to answer for it if she dies?
Die?
What?
She's sick.
She might die if she's exposed to sunlight.
Huh?
Is this from that time?
Yes.
She'll be all right.
She'll be okay, doctor?
This amount shouldn't be a problem, really.
That's great to hear.
There should be no ill-effects on your face and body.
If there isn't, tell me immediately.
She's fine.
What?
Don't go "What" on me!
Who's that guy?
You didn't mention anything about him.
I don't feel like talking about it.
You...
Is it someone you like, Kaoru?
It is, isn't it?
Is that so?
What's wrong with that?
But it's over.
Huh?
Though I thought it had nothing to do with my illness,
In the end, it's impossible for me to like somebody.
Don't worry.
We won't meet again.
The other party won't like a girl like me who's sick.
Don't say things like that.
It's not your illness, it's your personality.
He still has a future.
You have a future too, Kaoru.
Is that so?
Yes, you have.
All those pretty words again.
What about it?
Even though I can't be cured?
There's no such thing.
Then, look into my eyes when you say that.
I won't be deceived again.
I'm no longer a kid.
Who is it?
It's me.
How're you feeling?
What's wrong?
Aren't you going to sing any more?
You were singing so well too.
If you don't sing now, you'll never sing again.
I want to hear it one more time.
I...
I'd be content if I could live an ordinary life.
That's all I ask.
Don't come again.
What?
If you get involved with me, nothing good will come out of it.
Wait a minute!
Excuse me...
Yes?
Ah... a surfing board, isn't it?
Yes.
If I take it,
I'll pay you about 2000 yen.
Deal.
Is that so?
You two go on ahead.
You don't want any more?
You're the part-timer, aren't you?
Yes.
Finish it before sundown.
Yes.
Ah... about that...
Are you really going to pay me 20,000 yen?
Of course, but it's not just one boat, but all of them.
You'll get the money only if you clean all of them.
If you're only doing this much that'll be about 6000 yen for today.
Well, work hard.
You're slow!
What's with it, suddenly calling me out?
Well, I thought that since it's you, you'd know.
About what?
About her ex-boyfriend.
I don't know anything.
You haven't been punched in a long time, have you?
All right, I'll tell you.
I know everything about it.
He's a local high school student?
Yeah.
I see.
Say...
What?
What I say from now on...
Judge it from the view of a high school student.
Huh?
If I say anything about him, will Kaoru get angry?
Of course she will!
Don't pull me down along with you.
Then, if I asked him to see Kaoru,
Will Kaoru get angry?
Huh?
It's fine even if you lie to her.
Please do me this favor.
Will she be angry?
Won't she be so hurt she'll cry?
That's why, now...
I want to go meet you
That's what I decided
The in my pocket...
I want you to hear it
At this soft volume
Making sure it's right
Kaoru, it's time for dinner.
I got it.
Heya, Kaoru!
This plate is fine, right?
Yo.
Sorry for intruding.
Thanks for the food.
Thanks for the food!
Thanks for the food.
Ah, thank you.
You don't usually eat so much, do you?
Oh, sorry.
I totally can't understand what you're saying.
Don't worry about it.
Fuji-kun, don't hold back.
Ah, thank you for the food.
All of them look delicious.
You're really a nice lad.
No way.
No, it's true, you're a really nice kid.
Eat this, eat this.
Thank you, I'll be eating then.
Isn't there something wrong?
Isn't it strange like this?
Whose idea was this?
Your Dad invited me here.
Dad!
What did you say to Fujishiro-kun?
Don't get angry.
I'm not particularly angry.
What's with this?
What are you planning do to?
We didn't intend to hide it from you.
Here.
No matter what,
I want to hear your song once more.
But because I'm not too smart,
I could only think of such an idea.
I've only started working part-time,
I don't have any savings at all.
If it's about money,
I can settle it.
Really?
Yeah.
I think it's better for you not to get involved.
Why?
This is my own decision.
I want to see it through to the end by myself.
I see.
What do you think?
Don't you have any interest in improving your voice?
I did it.
I never thought you would think so far for me.
You flatter me...
Thank you.
Can someone like me really...
I don't think I'm capable of such a thing.
I...
Ah, did I say something wrong?
I like you.
What?
Even if you stay like this...
Let's meet up at night then.
You can sleep in the day.
When the sun sets I'll come see you.
Yup.
Huh?
Hey.
What?
Are you crying?
I'm not crying, you idiot.
You're crying, aren't you?
I said I'm not crying.
Let me see your face.
Don't cry!
Smile!
What a weird face.
That's too much.
What's wrong?
I'm just a little tired.
I'll go find us something to eat.
Oh!
That looks good.
The brain has started to contract.
The XP symptoms of nervous disorder are starting to appear.
Most likely in the near future,
Her whole body will be paralyzed.
And...
You're going to say she's going to die, isn't it?
But isn't it strange, doctor?
What is?
I didn't even let it happen once,
I never let her go under the sun.
She always said she wanted to go out when she was a child.
No matter how much she cried and screamed,
I'd give her a slap
And lock her in the house.
But why?
Why did it have to happen like this?
How do I say this...
I did all I could.
Was it all for nothing?
Why?
Why?
Why does my daughter have to suffer this kind of fate?
It'll be better if it was a shock I wasn't prepared for.
It's been hard on you.
Kaoru.
Fujishiro-kun's here.
Kaoru?
I'm coming in.
Yo.
Yeah.
How're you doing?
I'm sorry.
What?
Even though you went out of the way to get a job...
I can't sing any more.
I'm sorry.
I didn't do anything weird, did I?
Huh?
You can see me from here, isn't it?
Yeah.
What weird things are you talking about?
Like digging my nose, for example.
No, you didn't.
What about doing handstands or doing reports?
No, no.
Ah, then did you hear any weird noises?
No, I didn't.
Is that right?
That's great to hear.
The first time I saw you,
What?
The Fujishiro Kouji who was just like a kid.
At that time you seemed so happy.
Looking at you from here, I also felt happy.
You saw it.
Yeah, I was also like that.
The first time I got a guitar in my hands,
I was as delighted as you were.
I see.
Thank you.
Sure.
Well, till next time.
Yup.
Hey!
Even though my hands are like this now,
You can still listen to my voice.
Can you hear it?
Yeah, I can.
If that's the case, I'll sing.
Because I'll sing.
See you.
Wow, it's so pretty.
You don't have to be so surprised over such a thing.
It's pretty isn't it.
It's great, huh.
Wow, it's really like a debut...
It'll be okay!
Yeah.
Well, let's get started soon.
Please.
Good luck!
We'll be watching from over here.
I'll get distracted, so please leave.
What?
You'll get in the way.
You...
You've never let me listen to this song before.
Please follow what she says, Uncle.
I'll be here to listen to her.
You too, please leave.
Eh?
Why me too?
Isn't it better if you hear it after the CD comes out?
Why?
All right, all right
Then, everyone, let's all leave, shall we?
What?
Me too?
Come on now...
Don't ask any more questions and quickly leave.
Well, shall we get started?
Yes.
Did you write this song?
Yes.
It's a good song.
Really?
Thank you so much.
Let's work hard today.
Yes!
Let's do it then.
You can't hear anything.
What?
Settle down, both of you.
Will it be fine?
It hasn't started yet, has it?
What hasn't?
Because I don't hear any sound.
That's because she's not a professional.
She's a professional.
She's as good as one.
I was also surprised when we went to Yokohama.
When she sings,
Everyone'd gather around her.
If it was someone ordinary, they'd have been too frightened to sing.
As the number of people increased,
She'll become more lively.
Without realizing it,
I'd become one of her fans.
I feel once this CD gets made, it'll be sold out immediately.
Major record companies, television and radio broadcasters
will be rushing to get her CD.
She'll definitely be a great star in the future.
What's wrong?
It's getting a little hot.
Is the fan at the back turning?
If you feel it's troublesome,
Take it off then.
What?
Take it off, take it off.
If you take it off it won't be hot any more.
And you can run around.
I don't want to.
If I do that, I'll die.
Because
I've decided to live on till I die.
Because I'm going to live on with all my might.
That's right.
I don't know what's with your Dad.
He's being an idiot.
That's right.
I'm sorry.
Is it all right?
She always made a big fuss about wanting to go outside.
She's a girl that has been living in this kind of darkness.
I didn't realize she'd already grown up so much.
How about it?
I came.
What a weird face.
Shortly after that,
She passed away.
Leaving behind only countless memories and the song she loved.
That's why now,
I'm coming to meet you.
That's what I decided.
The song in my pocket,
I want to let you listen to it.
Raising the volume softly,
To make sure it's just right.
Oh good-bye days, now
It had been unchanging
Until only yesterday, so long unstylishly but staying gently
by my side, that's why
La la la la la - with you
Passing you one side of my earphones
Slowly, in that moment when the music starts flowing
Do I have the ability to love you enough?
But sometimes I get confused.
Oh good-bye days, now
It's beginning to change, but deep inside my heart it's alright
Unstylishly but staying gently by my side, that's why
La la la la la - now with you
If I could,
I don't want to think about the sadness
But you'll definitely turn up, won't you?
At that time,
With a smile,
"Yeah hello my friend", how shall I say this?
or would that be OK...
When I'm humming the same song
I wish I was by your side
I'm glad I met your uncool brand of kindness
La la la la Good-bye days

Here Kaoru comes.
Ah yes.
You're going tonight too?
Yup.
Every night
That's what you do, writing songs right?
Yeah.
There's no meaning in it, isn't it?
It doesn't matter, does it?
I guess it can't be helped.
Since today's a rest day for me,
I'll go have a look huh, Mum.
If you come I'll kill you.
Alright.
You know when's sunrise, right?
Yeah.
Don't go "yeah" on me.
4.40 A.M.
So, be sure to come back before that.
I got it.
Don't go too far. k?
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks for the food.
Go ahead.
Thanks for the food.

Please wait for a moment.
She looks under-aged no matter how you look at it.
At this kind of time...is she lost?
Nah, it's okay.
You don't have to worry about that girl.
Her parents explained before.
Explained about what?
How should I say this...
It's a kind of allergy to XP (a skin ailment)
Those suffering from it will die if they're exposed to sunlight.
Eh?
That's why she can only come out at night.
For whose sake am I living for?
The cloudy days pass by.
How much do you feel this pain and weakness?
Drowing myself in worthless yesterdays
I write my dreams on today, even though they're incomplete.
The twinkling stars before daybreak
Have they disappeared?
Will they be back tomorrow?
Tomorrow never knows
It's happy line.
For whose sake am I living for?
A Song in the Sun (lit.
The Sun's Song)
I'll make a move first.
Ok.
Hey, hey, hey.
Heya!
Don't you go "Heya!" with me!
You're skipping classes again, aren't you?
Um, yeah.
Where's Kaoru?
She just went to sleep.
If you wake her up now she'll kill you.
If it's me it'll be fine.
If that's the case, go up then.
Hey Aunt, you made a new one again?
Yup, because the old one was getting too small.
Wow, as one would expect of you.
I think it's better not to touch it.
Kaoru'll find out.
Misaki-chan, I don't want to say this but...
Don't ravage the stuff in the refrigerator.
I got it.
It's rare to find someone that can't even ride up to there, isn't it?
It can't be helped since he kept on saying he liked surfing.
But it's quite cute that way, isn't it.
Hey...hasn't the sun risen a little too much?
It's already 10!
No way!
Kouji, get out, quick!
You're gonna be late!
W-What?
Yup, I got it.
Please wait for a little while.
Alaria rice and sardine salad and Margarita pizza.
Here you go, sorry to keep you waiting.
What're you looking at?
No-Nothing.
Sign:
Yamacho Street
It's already dark and I can't make out your face...
Everyone else has happiness on their faces,
Can you see it?
Even if I can't laugh, yeah yeah.
The thoughts on their way to tomorrow in my heart,
I see your red eyes
And tried to laugh
Tomorrow never knows
It's happy line
Someone you know?
Hey, wait, where're you going?
Ouch...
I'm Amane Kaoru.
What?
I'm Amane Kaoru.
Huh?
I'm Amane Kaoru.
What about it?
I'm sixteen.
Living with my parents.
My hobby is music.
I have a bit of a quick-tempered personality.
I don't have a boyfriend.
Huh?
I've always been looking at you.
All this time.
I don't have a boyfriend.
Ah...
I see...about this...hold on a sec...
And I never had a boyfriend before.
Er, no...that's not...wait...
My favourite animal is the cheetah
And for food, I like bananas and...
Er...
Favourite musician...
There's too many, which one should I start from?
Sorry, please excuse us.
What?
What do you mean what ?
Don't get in my way.
Huh?
Get in your way?
I just got you out of a pinch.
Eh?
Don't go "Eh?" on me!
You are in a state of confusion right now.
What did you mean, "I like bananas?"
That was totally unprofessional of you.
I guess so.
Hey.
You haven't talked to a guy since elementary school, haven't you?
So, what's up with that guy?
He probably goes to the same high school as me.
Yeah...
Oh, I didn't know that...
That's what you get for skipping school, idiot!
Yeah.
Right.
Huh?
As I was saying...
You don't know anything about him.
Yeah, that's because I've only been looking at him from here.
I see...
What kind of person is he, I wonder?
I wonder if he's good at surfing?
Then...
Why don't you wear that suit that's hanging in the hall?
No way!
If he sees me like that he'll hate me!
Well, it can't be helped then.
It's been a long time since I last went to school, but I'll go and find out more details.
Really?
Yup!
Sorry for the wait.
If she doesn't want to come in person,
I can't perform the medical examination.
I'm sorry.
She wouldn't come no matter what.
As usual, does she still hate the hospital that much?
It seems it's the place she hates most in the world.
Is that so?
So, how's her condition?
She's still seems healthy.
No change from the usual.
I see.
That's good to hear.
Her condition hasn't gotten worse yet, isn't it...
About the age at which you said we should get mentally prepared...
She's already past that age.
Ah, I see.
Well then, excuse me for saying that.
I'll continue prescribing her medication.
About that, doctor.
I'm sorry, there still isn't a cure yet.
I see.
As you know,
The number of people who suffer from XP are very few.
But no matter for what kind of illness,
Compared to the harm done by UV rays,
The effects caused by nervous impairment as the sufferer increases in age, are more frightening.
His name is Fujishiro Kouji.
Fujishiro Kouji.
It's hot isn't it.
Fujishiro Kouji.
He's sleeping.
Nope.
It looks like he's pretty dumb.
Ah, it's better than I had thought.
Issit?
This is the first time you're seeing a high school isn't it?
Yup.
Everyone looks like they're enjoying themselves.
Huh?
It's meaningless going to that place.
Well, it seems these three guys...
Always hang out together.
This one over here, friend number 1 is called Onishi Yuuta.
And this one over here, friend number 2 is Satou Haruo.
I wonder if he washed his hands.
Looks like he did.
Aw, that's naughty.
Well, so that's the general impression.
All in all, he looks like a coarse idiot.
G-Good evening.
Good evening.
You're the girl from that time, aren't you?
Yup.
Sorry for that time.
It's alright.
What're you doing out here this late?
Just came back from my singing.
I often sing in front of the train station.
Ah, you're one of those who sing live on the street?
Well, something like that.
Is that so?
That was a nice song you were singing.
What's it called?
I haven't decided yet.
Eh..
You wrote it yourself?
Yup.
Wow, that's incredible!
Really?
Is that a... surfboard?
Yup.
That's a cool-looking surfboard.
You know about it?
Yeah.
Don't you think so!
I bought this after looking around for a long time.
It's still the best after all.
Though it's second-hand.
What about yours?
Huh?
Is it also second-hand?
Do you live around here?
That tall house over there.
Oh, it's just over there.
I pass by along this road every day.
Yup, I know that.
Eh?
You know about it?
You always see me from up there, don't you?
Yeah.
That's kinda embarrassing.
I can't do any weird stuff from now on. can't I?
Well then, I should be getting home now.
Is that so?
I see.
See you.
Yup.
Hey!
If it's alright, I'll come the next time.
For your street live.
Don't just say it and not come.
If it's during the vacations, I'll definitely come.
This is your last summer vacation as a high school student
Don't get carried away with play, concentrate on your books and work hard.
You guys, understand?
This vacation's critical.
Hey Mum.
Why is today's date circled?
I don't know, I'm not the one who did it.
It's Kaoru then?
For the me in this world, the summer vacations start today.
You scared me!
What're you doing?
Surfing, surfing...
Now that the summer holidays have come, you're going out at night instead?
Don't you have anything better to do?
Didn't I say I was going to study?
It's gonna be all guys, with Haruo and the rest.
Maybe I should go with you.
Don't come along!
I'll call to check on you.
Call my cellphone instead.
Then be sure to keep it turned on!
Thank you Kamakura!
Thank you everyone, for coming to support me.
I'm Dynamite Yamazaki.
Please listen to two of my songs.
The song is
"My name is Global Standard"!
1, 2, 3, 4!
What's this?
My place got taken.
You always sing here?
Even so, he's really awful huh.
Are you going to wait till he finishes?
It can't be helped.
Even though I was really looking forward to this day...
About that, singing.
Couldn't you sing elsewhere instead?
Huh?
It's my first time riding on a bike.
Really?
let me help you.
Done!
Shall we go?
To where?
I'll bring you to a good place.
Get on!
We're moving off.
Let's take this opportunity to look at the town while we're here.
It looks like I've been thinking too much.
Since I can't fall asleep in this room,
I might as well try flying in the night.
Sighing by the window.
Under the moonlight, I feel like escaping to somewhere far away.
Even though it seems like I'm flapping my wings,
What should I do about it?
I want to fly well
I don't know how to fly
I want to fly well
If only someone would teach me how
Don't wait too much for chances,
Every morning repeats itself
I grow tired of counting them
I'm going to draw the skyline
I don't know how to fly
I might be flying;
I'm not sure
I want to fly well
But I'm going to try
I want to fly well
In order to learn how to fly
I want to fly well
I want to fly in the sky
To skyline
Because I want to meet you now.
That's what I decided.
This song in my pocket,
I want you to let you listen to it.
Raising the soft volume,
To make sure it's just right.
Oh good-bye days, now
I feel it's going to change,
Until yesterday, so long unstylishly but staying gently by my side
La la la la la - with you
Passing you one side of my earphones
Slowly, in that moment when the music starts flowing
Do I have the ability to love you properly?
But sometimes I'll get lost.
Oh good-bye days, now
It's beginning to change, but deep inside my heart it's alright
Hey.
In the future, isn't it your aim to release a debut CD?
The future...
That's right.
I'd like to try that.
You're incredible.
Unlike me who doesn't have anything.
Hm?
I'll go on like this living an ordinary life, and in the end die an ordinary death.
That's not true.
From now on you can do anything.
Really?
Yeah.
You'll definitely find out what you really want to do.
It's just started.
I see.
It's like that, isn't it?
I'm too simple-minded.
I'm Fujishiro Kouji.
I don't have a girlfriend.
My hobby is surfing.
Will you go out with me?
Yes.
It's about time.
The seaside here has a nice view when the sun rises.
Huh?
Looking at it from here
It'll only be about another 10 minutes.
No way.
I'm not lying.
The next time you can come see it too.
Me riding the waves.
If I don't go back now...
You still have a curfew after all this time?
I...
Please, I want to go back.
It'll just take a while more.
What's wrong?
Wait up!
I get it, I'll take you back.
I'm sorry.
Get on!
Your guitar!
Wait!
Kaoru!
Is she with you?
I just sent here back.
Just?
Just?
Uncle, Aunt!
Kaoru's back!
What's going on?
What're you doing?
Do you want to kill her?
How are you going to answer for it if she dies?
Die?
What?
She's sick.
She might die if she's exposed to sunlight.
Huh?
Is this from that time?
Yes.
She'll be all right.
She'll be okay, doctor?
This amount shouldn't be a problem, really.
That's great to hear.
There should be no ill-effects on your face and body.
If there isn't, tell me immediately.
She's fine.
What?
Don't go "What" on me!
Who's that guy?
You didn't mention anything about him.
I don't feel like talking about it.
You...
Is it someone you like, Kaoru?
It is, isn't it?
Is that so?
What's wrong with that?
But it's over.
Huh?
Though I thought it had nothing to do with my illness,
In the end, it's impossible for me to like somebody.
Don't worry.
We won't meet again.
The other party won't like a girl like me who's sick.
Don't say things like that.
It's not your illness, it's your personality.
He still has a future.
You have a future too, Kaoru.
Is that so?
Yes, you have.
All those pretty words again.
What about it?
Even though I can't be cured?
There's no such thing.
Then, look into my eyes when you say that.
I won't be deceived again.
I'm no longer a kid.
Who is it?
It's me.
How're you feeling?
What's wrong?
Aren't you going to sing any more?
You were singing so well too.
If you don't sing now, you'll never sing again.
I want to hear it one more time.
I...
I'd be content if I could live an ordinary life.
That's all I ask.
Don't come again.
What?
If you get involved with me, nothing good will come out of it.
Wait a minute!
Excuse me...
Yes?
Ah...a surfing board, isn't it?
Yes.
If I take it,
I'll pay you about 2000 yen.
Deal.
Is that so?
You two go on ahead.
You don't want any more?
You're the part-timer, aren't you?
Yes.
Finish it before sundown.
Yes.
Ah...about that...
Are you really going to pay me 20,000 yen?
Of course, but it's not just one boat, but all of them.
You'll get the money only if you clean all of them.
If you're only doing this much that'll be about 6000 yen for today.
Well, work hard.
You're slow!
What's with it, suddenly calling me out?
Well, I thought that since it's you, you'd know.
About what?
About her ex-boyfriend.
I don't know anything.
You haven't been punched in a long time, have you?
All right, I'll tell you.
I know everything about it.
He's a local high school student?
Yeah.
I see.
Say...
What?
What I say from now on...
Judge it from the view of a high school student.
Huh?
If I say anything about him, will Kaoru get angry?
Of course she will!
Don't pull me down along with you.
Then, if I asked him to see Kaoru,
Will Kaoru get angry?
Huh?
It's fine even if you lie to her.
Please do me this favour.
Will she be angry?
Won't she be so hurt, she'll cry?
That's why, now...
I want to go meet you
That's what I decided
The song in my pocket...
I want to let you hear it
At this soft volume
Making sure it's right
Kaoru, it's time for dinner.
I got it.
Heya, Kaoru!
This plate is fine, right?
Yo.
Sorry for intruding.
Thanks for the food.
Thanks for the food!
Thanks for the food.
Ah, thank you.
You don't usually eat so much, do you?
Oh, sorry.
I totally can't understand what you're saying.
Don't worry about it.
Fuji-kun, don't hold back.
Ah, thank you for the food.
All of them look delicious.
You're really a nice lad.
No way.
No, it's true, you're a really nice kid.
Eat this, eat this.
Thank you, I'll be eating then.
Isn't there something wrong?
Isn't it strange like this?
Whose idea was this?
Your dad invited me here.
Dad!
What did you say to Kouji-kun?
Don't get angry.
I'm not particularly angry.
What's with this?
What are you planning do to?
We didn't intend to hide it from you.
Here.
No matter what,
I want to hear your song once more.
But because I'm not too smart,
I could only think of such an idea.
I've only started working part-time,
I don't have any savings at all.
If it's about money,
I can settle it.
Really?
Yeah.
I think it's better for you not to get involved.
Why?
This is my own decision.
I want to see it through to the end by myself.
I see.
What do you think?
Don't you have any interest in improving your voice?
I did it.
I never thought you would think so far for me.
You flatter me...
Thank you.
Can someone like me really...
Eh?
I don't think I'm capable of such a thing.
I...
Ah, did I say something wrong?
I like you.
Eh?
Even if you stay like this...
Let's meet up at night then.
You can sleep in the day.
When the sun sets I'll come see you.
Yup.
Huh?
Hey.
What?
Are you crying?
I'm not crying, you idiot.
You're crying, aren't you?
I said I'm not crying.
Let me see your face.
Don't cry!
Smile!
What a weird face.
That's too much.
What's wrong?
I'm just a little tired.
I'll go find us something to eat.
Oh!
That looks good.
The brain has started to contract.
The XP symptoms of nervous disorder are starting to appear.
Most likely in the near future,
Her whole body will be paralysed.
And...
You're going to say she's going to die, isn't it?
But isn't it strange, doctor?
What is?
I didn't even let it happen once,
I never let her go under the sun.
She always said she wanted to go out when she was a child.
No matter how much she cried and screamed,
I'd give her a slap
And lock her in the house.
But why?
Why did it have to happen like this?
How do I say this...
I did all I could.
Was it all for nothing?
Why?
Why?
Why does my daughter have to suffer this kind of fate?
It'll be better if it was a shock I wasn't prepared for.
It's been hard on you.
Kaoru.
Fuji-kun's here.
Kaoru?
I'm coming in.
Yo.
Yeah.
How're you doing?
I'm sorry.
What?
Even though you went out of the way to get a job...
I can't sing any more.
I'm sorry.
I didn't do anything weird, did I?
Huh?
You can see me from here, isn't it?
Yeah.
What weird things are you talking about?
Like digging my nose, for example.
No, you didn't.
What about doing handstands or doing reports?
No, no.
Ah, then did you hear any weird noises?
No, I didn't.
Is that right?
That's great to hear.
The first time I saw you,
What?
The Fujishiro Kouji who was just like a kid.
At that time you seemed so happy.
Looking at you from here, I also felt happy.
You saw it.
Yeah, I was also like that.
The first time I got a guitar in my hands,
I was as delighted as you were.
I see.
Thank you.
Sure.
Well, till next time.
Yup.
Hey!
Even though my hands are like this now,
You can still listen to my voice.
Can you hear it?
Yeah, I can.
If that's the case, I'll sing.
Because I'll sing.
See you.
Wow, it's so pretty.
You don't have to be so surprised over such a thing.
It's pretty isn't it.
It's great, huh.
Wow, it's really like a debut...
It'll be okay!
Yeah.
Well, let's get started soon.
Please.
Good luck!
We'll be watching from over here.
I'll get distracted, so please leave.
What?
You'll get in the way.
You...
You've never let me listen to this song before.
Please follow what she says, Uncle.
I'll be here to listen to her.
You too, please leave.
Eh?
Why me too?
Isn't it better if you hear it after the CD comes out?
Why?
All right, all right
Then, everyone, let's all leave, shall we?
What?
Me too?
Come on now...
Don't ask any more questions and quickly leave.
Well, shall we get started?
Yes.
Did you write this song?
Yes.
It's a good song.
Really?
Thank you so much.
Let's work hard today.
Yes!
Let's do it then.
You can't hear anything.
What?
Settle down, both of you.
Will it be fine?
It hasn't started yet, has it?
.
What hasn't?
Because I don't hear any sound.
That's because she's not a professional.
She's a professional.
She's as good as one.
I was also surprised when we went to Yokohama.
When she sings,
Everyone'd gather around her.
If it was someone ordinary, she'd have been too frightened to sing on.
As the number of people increased,
She'll become more lively.
Without realising it,
I'd become one of her fans.
I feel once this CD gets made, it'll be sold out immediately.
Major record companies, television and radio broadcasters
will be rushing to get her CD.
She'll definitely be a great star in the future.
What's wrong?
It's getting a little hot.
Is the fan at the back turning?
If you feel it's troublesome,
Take it off then.
What?
Take it off, take it off.
If you take it off it won't be hot any more.
And you can run around.
I don't want to.
If I do that, I'll die.
Because
I've decided to live on till I die.
Because I'm going to live on with all my might.
That's right.
I don't know what's with your Dad.
He's being an idiot.
That's right.
I'm sorry.
Is it all right?
She always made a big fuss about wanting to go outside.
She's a girl that has been living in this kind of darkness.
I didn't realise she'd already grown up so much.
How about it?
I came.
What a wierd face.
Shortly after that,
She passed away.
Leaving behind only countless memories and the song she loved.
That's why now,
I'm coming to meet you.
That's what I decided.
The song in my pocket,
I want to let you listen to it.
Raising the soft volume,
To make sure it's just right.
Oh good-bye days, now
I know things are going to change,
Until yesterday, so long unstylishly but staying gently
by my side, that's why
La la la la la - with you
Passing you one side of my earphones
Slowly, in that moment when the music starts flowing
Do I have the ability to love you properly?
But sometimes I'll get lost.
Oh good-bye days, now
It's beginning to change, but deep inside my heart it's alright
Unstylishly but staying gently by my side, that's why
La la la la la - now with you
If I could,
I don't want to think about the sadness
But you'll definitely turn up, won't you?
At this time,
With a smile,
Yeah hello my friend, how shall I say this?
It's fine even if I said it out loud
When I'm humming the same song
I wish I was by your side
I'm glad I met your uncool brand of kindness
La la la la Good-bye days
No.
No no!
No, Trevor!
Trevor, baby, no.
Hello?
Is someone there?
Is someone in there?
Is there someone alive in there?
Hey.
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
I'm gonna get you out of there.
Hold on!
What does it mean to be happy?
To be content in the world around you?
Mom used to say it was family--
That family is the heart of everything, even existence.
Without it, there's nothing.
She would always have these simple answers that somehow would sound so brilliant.
And then she died.
My father died along with her.
Shortly after that, my brother David had to sell the farm where we grew up.
Now we're just trying to be an ordinary family, trying to figure out where we fit in in the world.
And for me,
I'm trying to figure out where I belong, right now in this exact moment.
I don't know, Dad.
What do you think about the black hair?
Come on, it's different.
- It's different than normal.
- It's pretty, don't you think?
Oh, yes.
Yes yes, definitely-- right there, right there.
Look at the baby, he's part of the family.
- Hey, there we go.
- Okay, Dad.
I don't wanna hear that, Darlene.
The social worker will be here tomorrow.
We can't have the place looking like this.
- Whatever you say, Dad.
- That's not funny, Darlene.
Okay, I'm trying to do the best I can here.
Oh, Jesus.
You know, I'm not a little girl anymore and you don't have to be a dick about this!
Just-- can you just please clean your room and maybe not wear that mess on your eyes tomorrow?
Fuck you, David!
Francis, turn it off now!
Oh, come on, David, it's a school project.
- Just not our personal stuff, okay?
- It's about our family.
- I need this kind of stuff.
- Turn it off now!
You just get the heck out of my face for a second.
My brother David is the oldest.
He picked up all the responsibilities after Mom and Dad died.
We used to be real close, but after he sold our farm something changed in him.
He became like one of those life-sized cardboard cutouts you see in the stores, trying to sell the idea that everything is perfect,
but really nothing is the same anymore.
We just keep moving from town to town running from the truth, waiting for it to one day catch up with us.
This is our sixth house in two years.
Oh, yeah, every single one of them.
Wow, that's cool.
Okay, guys, I'm gonna go pee.
- No, wait.
- I gotta go.
No, come on.
- Sam, stay.
- I'm gonna go.
I'll be right back.
- Don't take too long.
- I won't.
Sam, get your ass in here and smoke a joint.
It's beautiful.
Come on, do the rain dance.
Hell, no!
Get in the car right now, girl.
Come on.
No!
- Yeah!
Ow!
Get in here.
- Come on!
Back in.
So, did you guys have fun?
- Yeah.
- You are glowing.
No, I'm not.
So, Wendell, what do you do?
I work for my brother-- fetch stuff for him, things like that.
- Nothing too exciting though.
- Sounds cool.
So where are you guys off to next, huh?
Seattle, I think.
We're just gonna keep traveling city to city till we run all out of money.
- Can't beat that kind of freedom.
- No, we just picked up and left!
No one even knows where we're at.
- What?
- Hush.
We don't have to worry about Wendell, our hero.
Wendell is Superman.
Wow, look at that.
Look at all those pretty stars.
- Where?
- I think you mean raindrops.
You can at least pretend to like it, okay?
Hey, I'm sorry for yelling at you yesterday.
I didn't mean to.
We're good?
Yeah, we're good.
But, David, I'm really not feeling too hot today.
- You're going to school, okay?
- I just don't think--
I don't wanna hear it.
You're going to school.
Good morning, sleepyhead.
You want some breakfast?
Why do you even bother?
Because that's what families do.
They have breakfast together.
Cute, David.
Anyway, Kitty's spending the night tomorrow.
- Who's uh--
- I am telling you in advance,
- just like you asked.
- Who the heck is Kitty?
I don't know, some chick from Ohio.
All right.
Remember, social worker is coming tonight at 5:00 for dinner.
You should really try giving up cooking, David.
I'm off, and you go to school.
I really don't fit in there.
Look,
I know it's hard for you, but can you please at least try?
Why?
It's not my fault we're always moving.
You're right, Francis.
It's my fault.
I'm sorry, guys.
I know I have a bad temper.
What do you want me to do?
Some maybe say I'm bipolar.
Good morning, Francis.
How are you doing there, bud, huh?
What are you reading?
"Gay sperm donors needed for lesbian couple."
- Knock it off.
- You're calling that today.
- Have you fed Lenny?
- Don't look at me.
Look at Franny.
Oh, come on, I just did it two days ago.
Okay, I gotta go to work.
- Will you just please do it?
- I'll do it before I go to school.
Where're you going?
Oh, yeah, you gotta go do your thing.
Forgot, sorry.
Have fun.
Have a good day.
The twins-- they've always been distant from the family.
Wendell is the main reason why we move a lot.
He just got out of jail for biting some guy's ear off at a Cheesy Chuck's Pizza parlor up north.
Darlene is just as mean, but more refined.
Like when we were kids, she used to lock me in the closet just to hear me scream.
Then, hours later, she would let me out pretending she was the one who saved me.
And I always fell for it.
Let me out of here!
Help, please!
Please.
Somebody please help us!
Oh, heck no, we've had a lot of social workers come here, but you're the first for dinner.
So, Francis, what's up with you tonight, huh?
- Nothing.
- Anything you wanna talk about?
Anything at all?
School maybe?
I don't know...
Well, you know, if there is, you just jump on in, all right?
Yeah, he told me he wasn't feeling too well this morning.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, thank you, Darlene.
That's, uh... quite a creative look you've got going there, young lady.
- What do you call that, huh?
- Death.
Ah, death.
That's cute.
So tell me, David, are you and Wendell still working over there at Del Rancho?
I don't know if I could work at a slaughterhouse, huh?
Yeah, well, my father owned a farm when we were younger and he did the same thing, so I guess it just came naturally.
Well... so, like, what do they have you doing over there?
I mean... you don't have to kill the animals and all that stuff, do you, David?
Heavens, no.
No no, I'm a carver.
I take out the organs, prep them, stuff like that.
Yes, David has a real knack for gutting the life out of things.
Thank you, Darlene.
So... too bad there's not-- not a demand on the black market for cow parts.
You would be a rich man by now.
Not at the table, please, Francis.
I apologize.
Paul, he's been following us around with that thing for the past few days-- some sort of school project
- or something or other.
- No, that's fine with me.
I think it's kind of cool.
Francis, tell me about the project.
Well, it's uh--
I'm supposed to write a report about my family-- our family-- and I just asked if I could shoot a video instead.
Good.
Now, that's a good idea.
That is a great idea.
- I hated doing papers.
I hated it.
- Me too.
I really did.
- Hey, gang.
- Hey, Wendell.
- Hey.
- How are you?
- Good, Paul.
How are you?
- Good, thanks.
Am I late?
What do you think, Wendell?
David, may I please be excused?
- We're not finished eating.
- No no no, let the boy go.
- Mm-hmm.
- He's probably bored out of his mind.
- Where are you going, Francis?
- I used to have two younger brothers, so I understand these things.
They are a handful.
That was great, you guys.
Thanks a lot.
I know I'm not much of a cook, but I do try.
Not to worry.
You probably never tasted my wife's cooking, huh?
Well, I'll be in the kitchen cleaning.
Did you hear that?
Oh, it's probably cats... fucking.
Yep, that's cats fucking, all right-- getting after it.
What do you think, David?
Who'd have thought?
- Listen, that was a great dinner.
- Thank you.
- I'll talk to you soon.
- Thanks.
Yeah.
- Thanks, David.
- Good night, Paul.
Good night.
Need more padding on that south wall.
You can hear 'em upstairs.
All right, so you're sure that they're good?
Positive.
On a road trip, it's gonna be two, three weeks before anyone notices.
- Healthy?
- Oh, yeah.
- I even took one for a test drive.
- Quit acting up, okay?
I don't want their faces showing up on the 10:00 news like last time.
- This could sustain us for awhile.
- Trust me.
All right.
Let's get to work.
- Help.
- Room service.
How are we holding up, girls?
Good?
Well, you're looking good.
Hi.
I hope this doesn't change anything between us.
Wendell, what did I tell you?
Come on, sweetheart.
- Stop it!
- Come on.
Get up.
Oh, yeah!
Don't worry, Sam.
I still got something right here, okay?
All right, let's get you up, huh?
You're a live one, aren't you?
Let's tie you down here.
Let's get you down here.
Is that too tight, sweetie?
- Sounds like he's changing.
- Hey.
Hey, Lenny.
Poor guy's probably hungry.
We'll feed him later.
Just go keep watch.
I'm gonna tuck you in later, okay?
I got you.
Get in.
I'll give you a ride to school.
I saw some stuff I want to shoot, Wendell.
Just get the fuck in.
God damn.
You gotta pop your cherry, baby brother.
Huh?
So you can quit moping around, playing with that camera.
Hey!
Hey.
What, are you too good to talk to me now?
- Fuck you, Wendell!
- What?
!
- What the-- hey!
Hey!
- Fuck you!
- Keep it up, Francis!
- No!
Keep it up!
We take care of your sorry ass, all right?
We feed you, we put fucking clothes on your back, and you do nothing in return but complain.
Let go of me!
Dude, l-- look,
I know it fucking seems fucked up, all right?
But we do what we do to survive.
All right?
You do anything to fuck up our family-- most importantly me--
I'll fucking kill you, okay?
Hey!
Okay?
Get the fuck out of my truck.
Shut the fuck up before I gut you myself!
Bye, Lenny.
Hello?
Anybody home?
Yes, hello.
This is David Hamilton.
I'm calling on behalf of Francis Hamilton.
Yes yes.
Yeah, he's not feeling too well, got a case of the flu or something.
Yeah, right right.
Oh, thank you, I appreciate it.
Have a great day.
Bye.
Please don't hurt her anymore.
I'm not like them.
Then can you help us, please?
I'm sorry, but I can't.
- Please.
- I don't even have a key.
Do something, please.
I can give you something to drink.
Do you want something to drink?
She needs some, please.
I don't have a key.
She just needs water.
She's dying.
I have to go.
Someone will be here soon.
Please.
The top drawer, eh?
You need a fake ID?
Where did you get all those?
I know a guy in the city.
You want one?
I won't charge you.
Yeah.
Let's see.
DRIVER LICENSE Here we go-
- Dani Cummings.
Oh, look she's an organ donor.
How sweet!
Seems about your height...
- Blonde hair.
- That's okay.
What are you little girls doing?
We are just getting comfortable and throwing in a flick.
You wanna watch?
I'd love to watch.
Where were you, Francis?
I was just down by the river filming some stuff.
Pretty late, huh?
Yeah, I guess.
Well, I'm going out for a little bit.
So if you need anything...
All right.
All right.
I'll see you later.
Turn it off, turn it off!
It's just a movie, sweetheart.
I thought you liked this kind of stuff.
Well, I do.
It's just these movies are too real sometimes.
Kitty, if monsters were real, they'd be a lot different than they are on TV.
Well, I just can't stand being scared.
Well, what do you wanna do now?
Let's play a game.
What kind of game?
Let's play truth or dare.
What?
Around here we only play dare or double dare, if you can handle it.
- What about truth?
- No truth.
Dares just keep doubling until someone gets hurt.
- Play nice, Wendell.
- I am.
Okay, Kitty, you can even go first.
All right.
- Dare or double dare?
- Me?
If you can handle it.
Dare.
I dare you... to finish your beer in one drink.
Okay, my turn.
Kitty, dare or double dare?
Double dare.
Double dare?
I double dare you... to... make out with Darlene.
You think I won't?
Well, if you don't, you lose.
I mean, we could play Scrabble or something, if you want.
Not bad.
- You surprise me.
- I'm full of them.
Aren't we all?
Okay, Kitty.
It's your turn again.
All right, Darlene...
- dare or double dare?
- Triple dare.
- Triple dare?
Come on--
- Triple dare.
Okay...
I triple dare you and Wendell to make out.
Huh?
Make out with her?
You are a-- just a kinky little thing, aren't you?
I win.
I don't think so.
Come on in.
- Nice house.
- Thank you.
- And the flowers--
- Yeah.
This is the sort of fall foliage...
Oh, yeah.
This is the wood-- woodland room.
This is nice.
I like that frame right there.
- Thank you, thank you.
- Very nice work.
Thank you.
I picked it out myself.
Very nicely hung.
We really shouldn't be here.
- Why is that?
- Just-- get in trouble.
We could go to your room and be quiet.
I don't know, it's kind of--
Come on.
- Okay.
- Okay?
Okay.
Just, we gotta be really quiet, okay?
Okay.
No.
No!
No!
No!
Help!
So, sure you don't want some?
I'm buying.
Pretty good!
No, I'm fine, thank you.
So... what did you want to talk about?
It uh-- you know, something at school?
Something?
My fucking family, just--
I'm sorry?
Yeah, Paul, it's school and stuff, you know?
- Yeah.
- Teachers and stuff, you know?
You know, I don't know if I ever told you about this, but-- my dad, when he was an army captain and-- we moved from base to base, it seemed like--
Christ, every-- every year or so.
So I know what it's like to be--
Francis.
Hey, I'm over here, pal.
Yo, Francis, I'm over here.
Francis.
I'm gonna go, Paul.
I have homework and stuff, you know?
- Just--
- All right.
Well, I'Il--
I'll stop by in a couple of days and I'Il--
I'll check up on you, all right?
Here.
There you go.
- Thanks.
- You're all right?
Yeah.
- Okay.
- Thanks for the soda.
Sure.
You take care, pal.
Wendell, what the fuck are you doing?
Oh, hey, Francis.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
Seems really nice, huh?
I saw your little movie too-- creepy.
This is a lot of fun, a lot of fun.
You don't mind sharing with the family, do you?
You know, I gotta hand it to you, brother, you're a lot more like us than I thought, aren't you?
She's pretty good-Iooking too.
You know, I had this good idea though.
I was thinking that we-- oh, yeah, look at that.
Look at that.
We could make our own porn movies down here if we want.
Bitch, huh?
How do you like that?
Huh, Francis?
Huh?
Come on, brother, let's see what you got.
Let's see what you got-- oh, yeah!
You fuck!
Come on, bud.
Come on, big guy.
Is that all you got?
Is that all you got?
That's what I thought, bitch.
Hey, Sam, how about your little hero now, huh?
Huh?
- Fuck!
- No!
- Get over here!
Come on.
- Wendell.
You fucking bitch!
Huh?
You wanna show off for that fucking bitch?
Huh?
I'll let you.
Come on, Lenny, come and get it!
Come on, Lenny.
Check it out.
You like that feeling, bitch?
Come on.
Hey.
Hey, Sam, keep it up.
You keep putting shit in his head,
I'm gonna skin you both alive, all right?
- Please.
- What was that?
Excuse me?
I'm sorry, I don't think I heard you right.
What was that?
Huh?
What was that?
Okay, I'll tell you what, why don't you hang out here for awhile?
I'll come back down and we'll finish what we started, okay?
You can scream all you want, Sam.
Just know one thing:
I am going to kill you.
All right?
What are you doing here, Francis?
- We need to talk.
- What happened to your hand?
Wendell.
I'm working here, Francis.
You know, you can't come running to me
- every time you two have a fight.
- Yeah, but--
I'm getting awfully tired of your hullabaloo, okay?
Wendell, school...
I can't be with you 24 hours a day, bud.
I have no one else to talk to, David.
I'm working a double shift here, okay?
Don't you think it's time you started trying to handle your own problems?
What would you do, huh?
What do you want me to say?
God.
Man,
I just wish Mom and Dad were still--
They're dead, Francis, okay?
When are you gonna--
when are you gonna understand that?
Just go home, okay?
We'll talk about this later.
No.
You know what?
Fuck you, David!
Fuck you!
I don't need your help.
Don't even fucking worry about it.
Hey, Wendell.
Is Darlene home?
She's in her room.
So, what are you doing tonight?
You know I'm spending the night again.
Darlene?
Hey.
- Is she here?
- No.
I meant, she's coming back in a bit.
No one's here, it's just you and me.
Okay, well, I'll just come back later then.
Why not stay and wait here, huh?
I should probably just come back.
Really?
Yeah.
What's the rush?
Anyone ever tell you you smell absolutely delicious?
Huh?
I bet you taste even better.
- Hey.
- Hi, guys.
I guess you're spending the night, Kitty?
Yeah.
Come on.
What was that?
He's so weird.
You keep telling yourself that things will change... that it's all a bad dream and one day you'll wake up.
I just wish they would catch us and then it would be all over.
Stay away from me.
I'm not going to hurt you.
You killed my friend.
I brought you some food.
It's all I could afford.
Is that a joke?
Just go away.
Just go away.
Don't worry.
It's just Lenny.
What's Lenny?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
You kill people and you feed it to something you call Lenny?
We're not like you, okay?
We're sick.
We have a fucking disease.
Yeah, you're sick.
You are.
I should go.
Wait.
Can I have some of that food, please?
It's just-- they'd kill me if they knew I was here.
- This is looking good.
- Which color are you using?
- This one in here.
- I like it.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay, get you doing this.
I'm just not good at it.
No, just need a little practice.
Thank you.
What's your name?
Francis.
Can I ask you something, Francis?
Why did you bring me food?
Because...
I'm not one of them.
They're gonna kill me, Francis.
I know.
All you have to do is call the police.
Please.
My family has money.
They'll give you anything you need.
You don't understand.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
Yes, you can!
Francis, I have people who love me, who need me.
I just want to go home.
I want to see my family.
And what about my family?
They're all I have.
They're killers, Francis.
They're not a family.
I can't survive-- can't survive without them.
Shit.
Hello?
Wendell, are you messing with me?
Oh my God, you scared the shit out of me!
Really?
What happened?
Let me see.
- Oh my God.
- Can I kiss it and make it better?
I'll just clean it off in the bathroom.
- Oh, that's a lot of blood.
- Yeah..
- Let me help you.
- Darlene, come on.
Hey, Wendell.
Hey.
That's a nasty cut.
Yeah.
Wendell, was that you fucking with me out in the hall?
- Not me.
Must've been Darlene.
- Oh, tell the truth, Wendell.
- Truth or dare?
- Ooh, you up for another game, Kitty?
- Can I go first?
- Be my guest.
- Okay.
Darlene, dare or double dare?
- Yeah?
I don't know,
I'm feeling a little frisky tonight.
How about a double dare to start?
- I double dare you--
- What the hell--?
--to give Kitty a little seductive dance.
Darlene?
You guys, stop.
Darlene, why are you doing this?
Stop!
Darlene, stop!
Double dare or triple dare, Kitty?
I triple dare you to let Wendell kiss you on the lips.
Here, Kitty Kitty.
Come on, pussycat.
Where are you going, babe?
Where are you going, pussy?
Here, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty.
I don't want to talk to you in there.
We're not done with our game yet.
How long have I been out?
Not long-- hour or two.
Somebody will be here soon.
I should go.
Francis...
Thank you for talking to me.
I'm sorry, but... l--
I can help you out there.
I can help you without your family.
You don't need them, Francis.
I'll take care of you.
I'll take care of you.
Please, don't kill me.
You're leaving me here to die.
I know.
Hey, Dad, over here.
Did you know your redwood is in violation of the neighborhood safety growth code?
- No.
- Uh-huh.
That's a good job, son.
Hi, I'm Larry Davies.
I'm-
- I'm Katherine-- Kitty's uncle.
- Kitty is a friend of Darlene's.
- Yeah, sure.
Yeah.
This is my son, Allen.
Lieutenant Commander Daniels, private sector.
David Hamilton.
Just for your information, Kitty's gonna be staying with us this college semester.
So if you see her around, that's why.
Is everything all right?
Yeah.
Look, I'm sure it's nothing.
We're just a little worried, that's all.
We haven't heard from her all day and she isn't answering her cell phone.
Is she here, by chance?
Unfortunately, no one's here.
Darlene doesn't have a cell phone-- brain tumors.
That's strange, you know?
It's just not like her.
She said she was gonna be spending the night here last night with Darlene, and she knew we had plans for this morning.
I put a couple of calls in to some friends of mine down at the local sheriff's office, just in case.
But if you hear from her, please call that number.
Of course, of course.
Hey, look, l--
I know we are bothering you and all that, but we didn't have your number.
So we just thought we'd pop by and check.
So, if something turns up--
Just let me know if there's anything I can do.
Take care.
What did you do?
Why, nothing, David.
She left here this morning.
We really haven't seen her since.
I can't believe you two did this!
Oh, and what about the dozen homos you have buried under the house?
Yeah, Mr. Perfect, how do you explain that?
Are you that blind in your make-believe world, you don't think we know?
I use my head!
I pick transients and drifters, not some neighborhood girl whose cousin or-- or brother or whatever is the police!
You know why you hate us so much, David?
It's because we represent everything you wish you could have, but are just too afraid to face.
You two always-- fuck it up!
Are you trying to scare us, David, like when we were kids?
We're not little kids anymore.
So what are you gonna do, David?
When are you gonna realize this isn't the first time and certainly not the last time it's gonna happen?
Pull it together.
Hey!
- Mom and Dad--
- Mom and Dad were the exception.
None of us have the kind of self-control to have what they did.
The only difference between you and us, David, is we don't look at ourselves in the mirror and lie.
We accept who we are.
We don't deny it.
We have to move again.
All right, pack up what we need--
- Hi, this is Paul.
- Hey, Paul--
Please leave your message at the sound of the tone.
Don't forget to leave your phone number.
Bye.
Paul, it's Francis.
There's something really important we gotta talk about about my family and um...
I can't-
- I can't do it over the phone.
If you could meet me in person, that'd be great.
l-l-I just-- fuck!
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I know, Lenny.
I know.
It's coming.
It's coming, Lenny!
Please sit still.
Actually, it's-- it's kind of funny.
My father taught me how to do this.
It's kooky, I know, I know.
He just wanted to make sure if something were to happen to him, we'd still survive.
Now you gotta get it just right, so no air gets in.
It has a longer shelf life that way.
It's kind of like... frozen food.
You have something on your face there.
Oh, I apologize,
I don't mean to make you self-conscious or anything.
"David," he said, "David--
David, one day you might have to be the man of this family.
David...
David," he said-- he said, "David, you might have to be the one that takes care of your brothers and your sister."
And I do, I do, but they don't care.
Do you think they appreciate what I do for them?
No no no no.
Look, missy,
I don't mean to be a rude cunt, but it sort of seems to me that you're not listening to me.
I just want what's best for them.
I just want what's best for them.
I just want what's best for them.
Goodbye, Lenny.
Francis?
Hey, Francis, I got your message.
Francis?
David, are you here?
Francis?
Francis?
Francis, is that you?
Francis, you out here?
Hello?
David?
David?
Da--
David?
David?
David?
Hello?
David, are you all right?
Hey, I'll try to get you out.
Here, listen, I'm gonna-- shit.
You hiding there, huh?
Are you all right?
Hi.
Everything's going to be okay.
Stop it, stop--
What are you doing?
- Ah, no!
- No, Lenny!
No!
Stop!
No no!
Ooh, what happened?
- He's still alive.
We can drain him.
- Not him.
Aren't you the one who said they're just cattle to us and nothing else?
- Just do what you want.
- Look at this.
So, I guess he took her with him?
Fuck!
I didn't know the little fucker had it in him.
I'm actually kind of proud of the kid.
Yeah, well, he's gonna get himself in trouble.
He's right on the verge.
We've gotta find him.
Maybe you should go get him.
He looks up to you.
Will you still help me out there?
Francis, where are we?
We're hiding.
Are you okay?
We should get some help.
Francis, I need your help.
I can't come near you.
Francis, I can't hear you.
What?
What did you say, Francis?
You're bleeding.
Francis, you're scaring me.
There's something I need to tell you.
Please-- please, just help me get up.
We need to get help.
We're born, not made.
- Not like everybody thinks.
- I don't understand.
Oh Christ, let me go.
Please, please--
Not like the fucking movies.
Francis, please stop.
You have to go.
Francis, please don't do this.
Franny.
Franny.
I know.
We all gotta go through it our first time.
It's just the way it is, okay?
- I wish Mom and Dad were here.
- It just hurts so bad, David.
I know, I know.
It's just part of growing up, okay?
It's what we are.
What does it mean to be happy?
To be content in the world around you?
Is family the heart of everything--
even existence?
So what do we do now?
We have to move again.
The twins are packing up the house.
We're gonna leave in a few hours.
What about Lenny?
We're gonna have to bring him out of the box early.
Will he be okay?
You were brought out of the box early.
I was?
Yeah.
See how you turned out?
- Dave?
- Yeah?
I'm sorry.
So am I, Francis.
- Are you ready?
- Okay.
You guys, I really hate keeping him like this.
You know it's the way it's always been.
He would've killed everything in sight.
- Kind of like us.
You ready, David?
- Let me do this.
We're gonna open the door.
We don't have time for this.
- This is Lenny!
- Darlene, come on.
- David, let's go!
- He is-- he is our family!
I can do this.
Okay.
Are you sure?
Fine.
Lenny?
Lenny?
Lenny?
Hey, baby.
Excited?
Hey, baby.
You see?
We live with a disease.
Mom used to say it was the one thing that kept us close.
I always thought that it was the one thing that would keep us apart.
But I was wrong, and everything you thought you knew about us is wrong.
We live in the houses next to you, we work in the stores you shop at.
Our kids play with your kids.
We're just trying to be an ordinary family, trying to figure out where we fit in in the world.
But we do need blood, and we need a lot of it preferably fresh and not frozen.
Howdy.
We're the Thompsons.
No.
No no!
No, Trevor!
Trevor, baby, no.
Hello?
Is someone there?
Is someone in there?
Is there someone alive in there?
Hey.
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
I'm gonna get you out of there.
Hold on!
What does it mean to be happy?
To be content in the world around you?
Mom used to say it was family--
That family is the heart of everything, even existence.
Without it, there's nothing.
She would always have these simple answers that somehow would sound so brilliant.
And then she died.
My father died along with her.
Shortly after that, my brother David had to sell the farm where we grew up.
Now we're just trying to be an ordinary family, trying to figure out where we fit in in the world.
And for me,
I'm trying to figure out where I belong, right now in this exact moment.
I don't know, Dad.
What do you think about the black hair?
Come on, it's different.
- It's different than normal.
- It's pretty, don't you think?
Oh, yes.
Yes yes, definitely-- right there, right there.
Look at the baby, he's part of the family.
- Hey, there we go.
- Okay, Dad.
I don't wanna hear that, Darlene.
The social worker will be here tomorrow.
We can't have the place looking like this.
- Whatever you say, Dad.
- That's not funny, Darlene.
Okay, I'm trying to do the best I can here.
Oh, Jesus.
You know, I'm not a little girl anymore and you don't have to be a dick about this!
Just-- can you just please clean your room and maybe not wear that mess on your eyes tomorrow?
Fuck you, David!
Francis, turn it off now!
Oh, come on, David, it's a school project.
- Just not our personal stuff, okay?
- It's about our family.
- I need this kind of stuff.
- Turn it off now!
You just get the heck out of my face for a second.
My brother David is the oldest.
He picked up all the responsibilities after Mom and Dad died.
We used to be real close, but after he sold our farm something changed in him.
He became like one of those life-sized cardboard cutouts you see in the stores, trying to sell the idea that everything is perfect,
but really nothing is the same anymore.
We just keep moving from town to town running from the truth, waiting for it to one day catch up with us.
This is our sixth house in two years.
Oh, yeah, every single one of them.
Wow, that's cool.
Okay, guys, I'm gonna go pee.
- No, wait.
- I gotta go.
No, come on.
- Sam, stay.
- I'm gonna go.
I'll be right back.
- Don't take too long.
- I won't.
Sam, get your ass in here and smoke a joint.
It's beautiful.
Come on, do the rain dance.
Hell, no!
Get in the car right now, girl.
Come on.
No!
- Yeah!
Ow!
Get in here.
- Come on!
Back in.
So, did you guys have fun?
- Yeah.
- You are glowing.
No, I'm not.
So, Wendell, what do you do?
I work for my brother-- fetch stuff for him, things like that.
- Nothing too exciting though.
- Sounds cool.
So where are you guys off to next, huh?
Seattle, I think.
We're just gonna keep traveling city to city till we run all out of money.
- Can't beat that kind of freedom.
- No, we just picked up and left!
No one even knows where we're at.
- What?
- Hush.
We don't have to worry about Wendell, our hero.
Wendell is Superman.
Wow, look at that.
Look at all those pretty stars.
- Where?
- I think you mean raindrops.
You can at least pretend to like it, okay?
Hey, I'm sorry for yelling at you yesterday.
I didn't mean to.
We're good?
Yeah, we're good.
But, David, I'm really not feeling too hot today.
- You're going to school, okay?
- I just don't think--
I don't wanna hear it.
You're going to school.
Good morning, sleepyhead.
You want some breakfast?
Why do you even bother?
Because that's what families do.
They have breakfast together.
Cute, David.
Anyway, Kitty's spending the night tomorrow.
- Who's uh--
- I am telling you in advance,
- just like you asked.
- Who the heck is Kitty?
I don't know, some chick from Ohio.
All right.
Remember, social worker is coming tonight at 5:00 for dinner.
You should really try giving up cooking, David.
I'm off, and you go to school.
I really don't fit in there.
Look,
I know it's hard for you, but can you please at least try?
Why?
It's not my fault we're always moving.
You're right, Francis.
It's my fault.
I'm sorry, guys.
I know I have a bad temper.
What do you want me to do?
Some maybe say I'm bipolar.
Good morning, Francis.
How are you doing there, bud, huh?
What are you reading?
"Gay sperm donors needed for lesbian couple."
- Knock it off.
- You're calling that today.
- Have you fed Lenny?
- Don't look at me.
Look at Franny.
Oh, come on, I just did it two days ago.
Okay, I gotta go to work.
- Will you just please do it?
- I'll do it before I go to school.
Where're you going?
Oh, yeah, you gotta go do your thing.
Forgot, sorry.
Have fun.
Have a good day.
The twins-- they've always been distant from the family.
Wendell is the main reason why we move a lot.
He just got out of jail for biting some guy's ear off at a Cheesy Chuck's Pizza parlor up north.
Darlene is just as mean, but more refined.
Like when we were kids, she used to lock me in the closet just to hear me scream.
Then, hours later, she would let me out pretending she was the one who saved me.
And I always fell for it.
Let me out of here!
Help, please!
Please.
Somebody please help us!
Oh, heck no, we've had a lot of social workers come here, but you're the first for dinner.
So, Francis, what's up with you tonight, huh?
- Nothing.
- Anything you wanna talk about?
Anything at all?
School maybe?
I don't know...
Well, you know, if there is, you just jump on in, all right?
Yeah, he told me he wasn't feeling too well this morning.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, thank you, Darlene.
That's, uh... quite a creative look you've got going there, young lady.
- What do you call that, huh?
- Death.
Ah, death.
That's cute.
So tell me, David, are you and Wendell still working over there at Del Rancho?
I don't know if I could work at a slaughterhouse, huh?
Yeah, well, my father owned a farm when we were younger and he did the same thing, so I guess it just came naturally.
Well... so, like, what do they have you doing over there?
I mean... you don't have to kill the animals and all that stuff, do you, David?
Heavens, no.
No no, I'm a carver.
I take out the organs, prep them, stuff like that.
Yes, David has a real knack for gutting the life out of things.
Thank you, Darlene.
So... too bad there's not-- not a demand on the black market for cow parts.
You would be a rich man by now.
Not at the table, please, Francis.
I apologize.
Paul, he's been following us around with that thing for the past few days-- some sort of school project
- or something or other.
- No, that's fine with me.
I think it's kind of cool.
Francis, tell me about the project.
Well, it's uh--
I'm supposed to write a report about my family-- our family-- and I just asked if I could shoot a video instead.
Good.
Now, that's a good idea.
That is a great idea.
- I hated doing papers.
I hated it.
- Me too.
I really did.
- Hey, gang.
- Hey, Wendell.
- Hey.
- How are you?
- Good, Paul.
How are you?
- Good, thanks.
Am I late?
What do you think, Wendell?
David, may I please be excused?
- We're not finished eating.
- No no no, let the boy go.
- Mm-hmm.
- He's probably bored out of his mind.
- Where are you going, Francis?
- I used to have two younger brothers, so I understand these things.
They are a handful.
That was great, you guys.
Thanks a lot.
I know I'm not much of a cook, but I do try.
Not to worry.
You probably never tasted my wife's cooking, huh?
Well, I'll be in the kitchen cleaning.
Did you hear that?
Oh, it's probably cats... fucking.
Yep, that's cats fucking, all right-- getting after it.
What do you think, David?
Who'd have thought?
- Listen, that was a great dinner.
- Thank you.
- I'll talk to you soon.
- Thanks.
Yeah.
- Thanks, David.
- Good night, Paul.
Good night.
Need more padding on that south wall.
You can hear 'em upstairs.
All right, so you're sure that they're good?
Positive.
On a road trip, it's gonna be two, three weeks before anyone notices.
- Healthy?
- Oh, yeah.
- I even took one for a test drive.
- Quit acting up, okay?
I don't want their faces showing up on the 10:00 news like last time.
- This could sustain us for awhile.
- Trust me.
All right.
Let's get to work.
- Help.
- Room service.
How are we holding up, girls?
Good?
Well, you're looking good.
Hi.
I hope this doesn't change anything between us.
Wendell, what did I tell you?
Come on, sweetheart.
- Stop it!
- Come on.
Get up.
Oh, yeah!
Don't worry, Sam.
I still got something right here, okay?
All right, let's get you up, huh?
You're a live one, aren't you?
Let's tie you down here.
Let's get you down here.
Is that too tight, sweetie?
- Sounds like he's changing.
- Hey.
Hey, Lenny.
Poor guy's probably hungry.
We'll feed him later.
Just go keep watch.
I'm gonna tuck you in later, okay?
I got you.
Get in.
I'll give you a ride to school.
I saw some stuff I want to shoot, Wendell.
Just get the fuck in.
God damn.
You gotta pop your cherry, baby brother.
Huh?
So you can quit moping around, playing with that camera.
Hey!
Hey.
What, are you too good to talk to me now?
- Fuck you, Wendell!
- What?
!
- What the-- hey!
Hey!
- Fuck you!
- Keep it up, Francis!
- No!
Keep it up!
We take care of your sorry ass, all right?
We feed you, we put fucking clothes on your back, and you do nothing in return but complain.
Let go of me!
Dude, l-- look,
I know it fucking seems fucked up, all right?
But we do what we do to survive.
All right?
You do anything to fuck up our family-- most importantly me--
I'll fucking kill you, okay?
Hey!
Okay?
Get the fuck out of my truck.
Shut the fuck up before I gut you myself!
Bye, Lenny.
Hello?
Anybody home?
Yes, hello.
This is David Hamilton.
I'm calling on behalf of Francis Hamilton.
Yes yes.
Yeah, he's not feeling too well, got a case of the flu or something.
Yeah, right right.
Oh, thank you, I appreciate it.
Have a great day.
Bye.
Please don't hurt her anymore.
I'm not like them.
Then can you help us, please?
I'm sorry, but I can't.
- Please.
- I don't even have a key.
Do something, please.
I can give you something to drink.
Do you want something to drink?
She needs some, please.
I don't have a key.
She just needs water.
She's dying.
I have to go.
Someone will be here soon.
Please.
The top drawer, eh?
You need a fake ID?
Where did you get all those?
I know a guy in the city.
You want one?
I won't charge you.
Yeah.
Let's see.
DRIVER LICENSE Here we go-
- Dani Cummings.
Oh, look she's an organ donor.
How sweet!
Seems about your height...
- Blonde hair.
- That's okay.
What are you little girls doing?
We are just getting comfortable and throwing in a flick.
You wanna watch?
I'd love to watch.
Where were you, Francis?
I was just down by the river filming some stuff.
Pretty late, huh?
Yeah, I guess.
Well, I'm going out for a little bit.
So if you need anything...
All right.
All right.
I'll see you later.
Turn it off, turn it off!
It's just a movie, sweetheart.
I thought you liked this kind of stuff.
Well, I do.
It's just these movies are too real sometimes.
Kitty, if monsters were real, they'd be a lot different than they are on TV.
Well, I just can't stand being scared.
Well, what do you wanna do now?
Let's play a game.
What kind of game?
Let's play truth or dare.
What?
Around here we only play dare or double dare, if you can handle it.
- What about truth?
- No truth.
Dares just keep doubling until someone gets hurt.
- Play nice, Wendell.
- I am.
Okay, Kitty, you can even go first.
All right.
- Dare or double dare?
- Me?
If you can handle it.
Dare.
I dare you... to finish your beer in one drink.
Okay, my turn.
Kitty, dare or double dare?
Double dare.
Double dare?
I double dare you... to... make out with Darlene.
You think I won't?
Well, if you don't, you lose.
I mean, we could play Scrabble or something, if you want.
Not bad.
- You surprise me.
- I'm full of them.
Aren't we all?
Okay, Kitty.
It's your turn again.
All right, Darlene...
- dare or double dare?
- Triple dare.
- Triple dare?
Come on--
- Triple dare.
Okay...
I triple dare you and Wendell to make out.
Huh?
Make out with her?
You are a-- just a kinky little thing, aren't you?
I win.
I don't think so.
Come on in.
- Nice house.
- Thank you.
- And the flowers--
- Yeah.
This is the sort of fall foliage...
Oh, yeah.
This is the wood-- woodland room.
This is nice.
I like that frame right there.
- Thank you, thank you.
- Very nice work.
Thank you.
I picked it out myself.
Very nicely hung.
We really shouldn't be here.
- Why is that?
- Just-- get in trouble.
We could go to your room and be quiet.
I don't know, it's kind of--
Come on.
- Okay.
- Okay?
Okay.
Just, we gotta be really quiet, okay?
Okay.
No.
No!
No!
No!
Help!
So, sure you don't want some?
I'm buying.
Pretty good!
No, I'm fine, thank you.
So... what did you want to talk about?
It uh-- you know, something at school?
Something?
My fucking family, just--
I'm sorry?
Yeah, Paul, it's school and stuff, you know?
- Yeah.
- Teachers and stuff, you know?
You know, I don't know if I ever told you about this, but-- my dad, when he was an army captain and-- we moved from base to base, it seemed like--
Christ, every-- every year or so.
So I know what it's like to be--
Francis.
Hey, I'm over here, pal.
Yo, Francis, I'm over here.
Francis.
I'm gonna go, Paul.
I have homework and stuff, you know?
- Just--
- All right.
Well, I'Il--
I'll stop by in a couple of days and I'Il--
I'll check up on you, all right?
Here.
There you go.
- Thanks.
- You're all right?
Yeah.
- Okay.
- Thanks for the soda.
Sure.
You take care, pal.
Wendell, what the fuck are you doing?
Oh, hey, Francis.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
Seems really nice, huh?
I saw your little movie too-- creepy.
This is a lot of fun, a lot of fun.
You don't mind sharing with the family, do you?
You know, I gotta hand it to you, brother, you're a lot more like us than I thought, aren't you?
She's pretty good-Iooking too.
You know, I had this good idea though.
I was thinking that we-- oh, yeah, look at that.
Look at that.
We could make our own porn movies down here if we want.
Bitch, huh?
How do you like that?
Huh, Francis?
Huh?
Come on, brother, let's see what you got.
Let's see what you got-- oh, yeah!
You fuck!
Come on, bud.
Come on, big guy.
Is that all you got?
Is that all you got?
That's what I thought, bitch.
Hey, Sam, how about your little hero now, huh?
Huh?
- Fuck!
- No!
- Get over here!
Come on.
- Wendell.
You fucking bitch!
Huh?
You wanna show off for that fucking bitch?
Huh?
I'll let you.
Come on, Lenny, come and get it!
Come on, Lenny.
Check it out.
You like that feeling, bitch?
Come on.
Hey.
Hey, Sam, keep it up.
You keep putting shit in his head,
I'm gonna skin you both alive, all right?
- Please.
- What was that?
Excuse me?
I'm sorry, I don't think I heard you right.
What was that?
Huh?
What was that?
Okay, I'll tell you what, why don't you hang out here for awhile?
I'll come back down and we'll finish what we started, okay?
You can scream all you want, Sam.
Just know one thing:
I am going to kill you.
All right?
What are you doing here, Francis?
- We need to talk.
- What happened to your hand?
Wendell.
I'm working here, Francis.
You know, you can't come running to me
- every time you two have a fight.
- Yeah, but--
I'm getting awfully tired of your hullabaloo, okay?
Wendell, school...
I can't be with you 24 hours a day, bud.
I have no one else to talk to, David.
I'm working a double shift here, okay?
Don't you think it's time you started trying to handle your own problems?
What would you do, huh?
What do you want me to say?
God.
Man,
I just wish Mom and Dad were still--
They're dead, Francis, okay?
When are you gonna--
when are you gonna understand that?
Just go home, okay?
We'll talk about this later.
No.
You know what?
Fuck you, David!
Fuck you!
I don't need your help.
Don't even fucking worry about it.
Hey, Wendell.
Is Darlene home?
She's in her room.
So, what are you doing tonight?
You know I'm spending the night again.
Darlene?
Hey.
- Is she here?
- No.
I meant, she's coming back in a bit.
No one's here, it's just you and me.
Okay, well, I'll just come back later then.
Why not stay and wait here, huh?
I should probably just come back.
Really?
Yeah.
What's the rush?
Anyone ever tell you you smell absolutely delicious?
Huh?
I bet you taste even better.
- Hey.
- Hi, guys.
I guess you're spending the night, Kitty?
Yeah.
Come on.
What was that?
He's so weird.
You keep telling yourself that things will change... that it's all a bad dream and one day you'll wake up.
I just wish they would catch us and then it would be all over.
Stay away from me.
I'm not going to hurt you.
You killed my friend.
I brought you some food.
It's all I could afford.
Is that a joke?
Just go away.
Just go away.
Don't worry.
It's just Lenny.
What's Lenny?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
You kill people and you feed it to something you call Lenny?
We're not like you, okay?
We're sick.
We have a fucking disease.
Yeah, you're sick.
You are.
I should go.
Wait.
Can I have some of that food, please?
It's just-- they'd kill me if they knew I was here.
- This is looking good.
- Which color are you using?
- This one in here.
- I like it.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay, get you doing this.
I'm just not good at it.
No, just need a little practice.
Thank you.
What's your name?
Francis.
Can I ask you something, Francis?
Why did you bring me food?
Because...
I'm not one of them.
They're gonna kill me, Francis.
I know.
All you have to do is call the police.
Please.
My family has money.
They'll give you anything you need.
You don't understand.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
Yes, you can!
Francis, I have people who love me, who need me.
I just want to go home.
I want to see my family.
And what about my family?
They're all I have.
They're killers, Francis.
They're not a family.
I can't survive-- can't survive without them.
Shit.
Hello?
Wendell, are you messing with me?
Oh my God, you scared the shit out of me!
Really?
What happened?
Let me see.
- Oh my God.
- Can I kiss it and make it better?
I'll just clean it off in the bathroom.
- Oh, that's a lot of blood.
- Yeah..
- Let me help you.
- Darlene, come on.
Hey, Wendell.
Hey.
That's a nasty cut.
Yeah.
Wendell, was that you fucking with me out in the hall?
- Not me.
Must've been Darlene.
- Oh, tell the truth, Wendell.
- Truth or dare?
- Ooh, you up for another game, Kitty?
- Can I go first?
- Be my guest.
- Okay.
Darlene, dare or double dare?
- Yeah?
I don't know,
I'm feeling a little frisky tonight.
How about a double dare to start?
- I double dare you--
- What the hell--?
--to give Kitty a little seductive dance.
Darlene?
You guys, stop.
Darlene, why are you doing this?
Stop!
Darlene, stop!
Double dare or triple dare, Kitty?
I triple dare you to let Wendell kiss you on the lips.
Here, Kitty Kitty.
Come on, pussycat.
Where are you going, babe?
Where are you going, pussy?
Here, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty.
I don't want to talk to you in there.
We're not done with our game yet.
How long have I been out?
Not long-- hour or two.
Somebody will be here soon.
I should go.
Francis...
Thank you for talking to me.
I'm sorry, but... l--
I can help you out there.
I can help you without your family.
You don't need them, Francis.
I'll take care of you.
I'll take care of you.
Please, don't kill me.
You're leaving me here to die.
I know.
Hey, Dad, over here.
Did you know your redwood is in violation of the neighborhood safety growth code?
- No.
- Uh-huh.
That's a good job, son.
Hi, I'm Larry Davies.
I'm-
- I'm Katherine-- Kitty's uncle.
- Kitty is a friend of Darlene's.
- Yeah, sure.
Yeah.
This is my son, Allen.
Lieutenant Commander Daniels, private sector.
David Hamilton.
Just for your information, Kitty's gonna be staying with us this college semester.
So if you see her around, that's why.
Is everything all right?
Yeah.
Look, I'm sure it's nothing.
We're just a little worried, that's all.
We haven't heard from her all day and she isn't answering her cell phone.
Is she here, by chance?
Unfortunately, no one's here.
Darlene doesn't have a cell phone-- brain tumors.
That's strange, you know?
It's just not like her.
She said she was gonna be spending the night here last night with Darlene, and she knew we had plans for this morning.
I put a couple of calls in to some friends of mine down at the local sheriff's office, just in case.
But if you hear from her, please call that number.
Of course, of course.
Hey, look, l--
I know we are bothering you and all that, but we didn't have your number.
So we just thought we'd pop by and check.
So, if something turns up--
Just let me know if there's anything I can do.
Take care.
What did you do?
Why, nothing, David.
She left here this morning.
We really haven't seen her since.
I can't believe you two did this!
Oh, and what about the dozen homos you have buried under the house?
Yeah, Mr. Perfect, how do you explain that?
Are you that blind in your make-believe world, you don't think we know?
I use my head!
I pick transients and drifters, not some neighborhood girl whose cousin or-- or brother or whatever is the police!
You know why you hate us so much, David?
It's because we represent everything you wish you could have, but are just too afraid to face.
You two always-- fuck it up!
Are you trying to scare us, David, like when we were kids?
We're not little kids anymore.
So what are you gonna do, David?
When are you gonna realize this isn't the first time and certainly not the last time it's gonna happen?
Pull it together.
Hey!
- Mom and Dad--
- Mom and Dad were the exception.
None of us have the kind of self-control to have what they did.
The only difference between you and us, David, is we don't look at ourselves in the mirror and lie.
We accept who we are.
We don't deny it.
We have to move again.
All right, pack up what we need--
- Hi, this is Paul.
- Hey, Paul--
Please leave your message at the sound of the tone.
Don't forget to leave your phone number.
Bye.
Paul, it's Francis.
There's something really important we gotta talk about about my family and um...
I can't-
- I can't do it over the phone.
If you could meet me in person, that'd be great.
l-l-I just-- fuck!
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I know, Lenny.
I know.
It's coming.
It's coming, Lenny!
Please sit still.
Actually, it's-- it's kind of funny.
My father taught me how to do this.
It's kooky, I know, I know.
He just wanted to make sure if something were to happen to him, we'd still survive.
Now you gotta get it just right, so no air gets in.
It has a longer shelf life that way.
It's kind of like... frozen food.
You have something on your face there.
Oh, I apologize,
I don't mean to make you self-conscious or anything.
"David," he said, "David--
David, one day you might have to be the man of this family.
David...
David," he said-- he said, "David, you might have to be the one that takes care of your brothers and your sister."
And I do, I do, but they don't care.
Do you think they appreciate what I do for them?
No no no no.
Look, missy,
I don't mean to be a rude cunt, but it sort of seems to me that you're not listening to me.
I just want what's best for them.
I just want what's best for them.
I just want what's best for them.
Goodbye, Lenny.
Francis?
Hey, Francis, I got your message.
Francis?
David, are you here?
Francis?
Francis?
Francis, is that you?
Francis, you out here?
Hello?
David?
David?
Da--
David?
David?
David?
Hello?
David, are you all right?
Hey, I'll try to get you out.
Here, listen, I'm gonna-- shit.
You hiding there, huh?
Are you all right?
Hi.
Everything's going to be okay.
Stop it, stop--
What are you doing?
- Ah, no!
- No, Lenny!
No!
Stop!
No no!
Ooh, what happened?
- He's still alive.
We can drain him.
- Not him.
Aren't you the one who said they're just cattle to us and nothing else?
- Just do what you want.
- Look at this.
So, I guess he took her with him?
Fuck!
I didn't know the little fucker had it in him.
I'm actually kind of proud of the kid.
Yeah, well, he's gonna get himself in trouble.
He's right on the verge.
We've gotta find him.
Maybe you should go get him.
He looks up to you.
Will you still help me out there?
Francis, where are we?
We're hiding.
Are you okay?
We should get some help.
Francis, I need your help.
I can't come near you.
Francis, I can't hear you.
What?
What did you say, Francis?
You're bleeding.
Francis, you're scaring me.
There's something I need to tell you.
Please-- please, just help me get up.
We need to get help.
We're born, not made.
- Not like everybody thinks.
- I don't understand.
Oh Christ, let me go.
Please, please--
Not like the fucking movies.
Francis, please stop.
You have to go.
Francis, please don't do this.
Franny.
Franny.
I know.
We all gotta go through it our first time.
It's just the way it is, okay?
- I wish Mom and Dad were here.
- It just hurts so bad, David.
I know, I know.
It's just part of growing up, okay?
It's what we are.
What does it mean to be happy?
To be content in the world around you?
Is family the heart of everything--
even existence?
So what do we do now?
We have to move again.
The twins are packing up the house.
We're gonna leave in a few hours.
What about Lenny?
We're gonna have to bring him out of the box early.
Will he be okay?
You were brought out of the box early.
I was?
Yeah.
See how you turned out?
- Dave?
- Yeah?
I'm sorry.
So am I, Francis.
- Are you ready?
- Okay.
You guys, I really hate keeping him like this.
You know it's the way it's always been.
He would've killed everything in sight.
- Kind of like us.
You ready, David?
- Let me do this.
We're gonna open the door.
We don't have time for this.
- This is Lenny!
- Darlene, come on.
- David, let's go!
- He is-- he is our family!
I can do this.
Okay.
Are you sure?
Fine.
Lenny?
Lenny?
Lenny?
Hey, baby.
Excited?
Hey, baby.
You see?
We live with a disease.
Mom used to say it was the one thing that kept us close.
I always thought that it was the one thing that would keep us apart.
But I was wrong, and everything you thought you knew about us is wrong.
We live in the houses next to you, we work in the stores you shop at.
Our kids play with your kids.
We're just trying to be an ordinary family, trying to figure out where we fit in in the world.
But we do need blood, and we need a lot of it preferably fresh and not frozen.
Howdy.
We're the Thompsons.
No.
No no!
No, Trevor!
Trevor, baby, no.
Hello?
Is someone there?
Is someone in there?
Is there someone alive in there?
Hey.
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
I'm gonna get you out of there.
Hold on!
What does it mean to be happy?
To be content in the world around you?
Mom used to say it was family--
That family is the heart of everything, even existence.
Without it, there's nothing.
She would always have these simple answers that somehow would sound so brilliant.
And then she died.
My father died along with her.
Shortly after that, my brother David had to sell the farm where we grew up.
Now we're just trying to be an ordinary family, trying to figure out where we fit in in the world.
And for me,
I'm trying to figure out where I belong, right now in this exact moment.
I don't know, Dad.
What do you think about the black hair?
Come on, it's different.
- It's different than normal.
- It's pretty, don't you think?
Oh, yes.
Yes yes, definitely-- right there, right there.
Look at the baby, he's part of the family.
- Hey, there we go.
- Okay, Dad.
I don't wanna hear that, Darlene.
The social worker will be here tomorrow.
We can't have the place looking like this.
- Whatever you say, Dad.
- That's not funny, Darlene.
Okay, I'm trying to do the best I can here.
Oh, Jesus.
You know, I'm not a little girl anymore and you don't have to be a dick about this!
Just-- can you just please clean your room and maybe not wear that mess on your eyes tomorrow?
Fuck you, David!
Francis, turn it off now!
Oh, come on, David, it's a school project.
- Just not our personal stuff, okay?
- It's about our family.
- I need this kind of stuff.
- Turn it off now!
You just get the heck out of my face for a second.
My brother David is the oldest.
He picked up all the responsibilities after Mom and Dad died.
We used to be real close, but after he sold our farm something changed in him.
He became like one of those life-sized cardboard cutouts you see in the stores, trying to sell the idea that everything is perfect,
but really nothing is the same anymore.
We just keep moving from town to town running from the truth, waiting for it to one day catch up with us.
This is our sixth house in two years.
Oh, yeah, every single one of them.
Wow, that's cool.
Okay, guys, I'm gonna go pee.
- No, wait.
- I gotta go.
No, come on.
- Sam, stay.
- I'm gonna go.
I'll be right back.
- Don't take too long.
- I won't.
Sam, get your ass in here and smoke a joint.
It's beautiful.
Come on, do the rain dance.
Hell, no!
Get in the car right now, girl.
Come on.
No!
- Yeah!
Ow!
Get in here.
- Come on!
Back in.
So, did you guys have fun?
- Yeah.
- You are glowing.
No, I'm not.
So, Wendell, what do you do?
I work for my brother-- fetch stuff for him, things like that.
- Nothing too exciting though.
- Sounds cool.
So where are you guys off to next, huh?
Seattle, I think.
We're just gonna keep traveling city to city till we run all out of money.
- Can't beat that kind of freedom.
- No, we just picked up and left!
No one even knows where we're at.
- What?
- Hush.
We don't have to worry about Wendell, our hero.
Wendell is Superman.
Wow, look at that.
Look at all those pretty stars.
- Where?
- I think you mean raindrops.
You can at least pretend to like it, okay?
Hey, I'm sorry for yelling at you yesterday.
I didn't mean to.
We're good?
Yeah, we're good.
But, David, I'm really not feeling too hot today.
- You're going to school, okay?
- I just don't think--
I don't wanna hear it.
You're going to school.
Good morning, sleepyhead.
You want some breakfast?
Why do you even bother?
Because that's what families do.
They have breakfast together.
Cute, David.
Anyway, Kitty's spending the night tomorrow.
- Who's uh--
- I am telling you in advance,
- just like you asked.
- Who the heck is Kitty?
I don't know, some chick from Ohio.
All right.
Remember, social worker is coming tonight at 5:00 for dinner.
You should really try giving up cooking, David.
I'm off, and you go to school.
I really don't fit in there.
Look,
I know it's hard for you, but can you please at least try?
Why?
It's not my fault we're always moving.
You're right, Francis.
It's my fault.
I'm sorry, guys.
I know I have a bad temper.
What do you want me to do?
Some maybe say I'm bipolar.
Good morning, Francis.
How are you doing there, bud, huh?
What are you reading?
"Gay sperm donors needed for lesbian couple."
- Knock it off.
- You're calling that today.
- Have you fed Lenny?
- Don't look at me.
Look at Franny.
Oh, come on, I just did it two days ago.
Okay, I gotta go to work.
- Will you just please do it?
- I'll do it before I go to school.
Where're you going?
Oh, yeah, you gotta go do your thing.
Forgot, sorry.
Have fun.
Have a good day.
The twins-- they've always been distant from the family.
Wendell is the main reason why we move a lot.
He just got out of jail for biting some guy's ear off at a Cheesy Chuck's Pizza parlor up north.
Darlene is just as mean, but more refined.
Like when we were kids, she used to lock me in the closet just to hear me scream.
Then, hours later, she would let me out pretending she was the one who saved me.
And I always fell for it.
Let me out of here!
Help, please!
Please.
Somebody please help us!
Oh, heck no, we've had a lot of social workers come here, but you're the first for dinner.
So, Francis, what's up with you tonight, huh?
- Nothing.
- Anything you wanna talk about?
Anything at all?
School maybe?
I don't know...
Well, you know, if there is, you just jump on in, all right?
Yeah, he told me he wasn't feeling too well this morning.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, thank you, Darlene.
That's, uh... quite a creative look you've got going there, young lady.
- What do you call that, huh?
- Death.
Ah, death.
That's cute.
So tell me, David, are you and Wendell still working over there at Del Rancho?
I don't know if I could work at a slaughterhouse, huh?
Yeah, well, my father owned a farm when we were younger and he did the same thing, so I guess it just came naturally.
Well... so, like, what do they have you doing over there?
I mean... you don't have to kill the animals and all that stuff, do you, David?
Heavens, no.
No no, I'm a carver.
I take out the organs, prep them, stuff like that.
Yes, David has a real knack for gutting the life out of things.
Thank you, Darlene.
So... too bad there's not-- not a demand on the black market for cow parts.
You would be a rich man by now.
Not at the table, please, Francis.
I apologize.
Paul, he's been following us around with that thing for the past few days-- some sort of school project
- or something or other.
- No, that's fine with me.
I think it's kind of cool.
Francis, tell me about the project.
Well, it's uh--
I'm supposed to write a report about my family-- our family-- and I just asked if I could shoot a video instead.
Good.
Now, that's a good idea.
That is a great idea.
- I hated doing papers.
I hated it.
- Me too.
I really did.
- Hey, gang.
- Hey, Wendell.
- Hey.
- How are you?
- Good, Paul.
How are you?
- Good, thanks.
Am I late?
What do you think, Wendell?
David, may I please be excused?
- We're not finished eating.
- No no no, let the boy go.
- Mm-hmm.
- He's probably bored out of his mind.
- Where are you going, Francis?
- I used to have two younger brothers, so I understand these things.
They are a handful.
That was great, you guys.
Thanks a lot.
I know I'm not much of a cook, but I do try.
Not to worry.
You probably never tasted my wife's cooking, huh?
Well, I'll be in the kitchen cleaning.
Did you hear that?
Oh, it's probably cats... fucking.
Yep, that's cats fucking, all right-- getting after it.
What do you think, David?
Who'd have thought?
- Listen, that was a great dinner.
- Thank you.
- I'll talk to you soon.
- Thanks.
Yeah.
- Thanks, David.
- Good night, Paul.
Good night.
Need more padding on that south wall.
You can hear 'em upstairs.
All right, so you're sure that they're good?
Positive.
On a road trip, it's gonna be two, three weeks before anyone notices.
- Healthy?
- Oh, yeah.
- I even took one for a test drive.
- Quit acting up, okay?
I don't want their faces showing up on the 10:00 news like last time.
- This could sustain us for awhile.
- Trust me.
All right.
Let's get to work.
- Help.
- Room service.
How are we holding up, girls?
Good?
Well, you're looking good.
Hi.
I hope this doesn't change anything between us.
Wendell, what did I tell you?
Come on, sweetheart.
- Stop it!
- Come on.
Get up.
Oh, yeah!
Don't worry, Sam.
I still got something right here, okay?
All right, let's get you up, huh?
You're a live one, aren't you?
Let's tie you down here.
Let's get you down here.
Is that too tight, sweetie?
- Sounds like he's changing.
- Hey.
Hey, Lenny.
Poor guy's probably hungry.
We'll feed him later.
Just go keep watch.
I'm gonna tuck you in later, okay?
I got you.
Get in.
I'll give you a ride to school.
I saw some stuff I want to shoot, Wendell.
Just get the fuck in.
God damn.
You gotta pop your cherry, baby brother.
Huh?
So you can quit moping around, playing with that camera.
Hey!
Hey.
What, are you too good to talk to me now?
- Fuck you, Wendell!
- What?
!
- What the-- hey!
Hey!
- Fuck you!
- Keep it up, Francis!
- No!
Keep it up!
We take care of your sorry ass, all right?
We feed you, we put fucking clothes on your back, and you do nothing in return but complain.
Let go of me!
Dude, l-- look,
I know it fucking seems fucked up, all right?
But we do what we do to survive.
All right?
You do anything to fuck up our family-- most importantly me--
I'll fucking kill you, okay?
Hey!
Okay?
Get the fuck out of my truck.
Shut the fuck up before I gut you myself!
Bye, Lenny.
Hello?
Anybody home?
Yes, hello.
This is David Hamilton.
I'm calling on behalf of Francis Hamilton.
Yes yes.
Yeah, he's not feeling too well, got a case of the flu or something.
Yeah, right right.
Oh, thank you, I appreciate it.
Have a great day.
Bye.
Please don't hurt her anymore.
I'm not like them.
Then can you help us, please?
I'm sorry, but I can't.
- Please.
- I don't even have a key.
Do something, please.
I can give you something to drink.
Do you want something to drink?
She needs some, please.
I don't have a key.
She just needs water.
She's dying.
I have to go.
Someone will be here soon.
Please.
The top drawer, eh?
You need a fake ID?
Where did you get all those?
I know a guy in the city.
You want one?
I won't charge you.
Yeah.
Let's see.
DRIVER LICENSE Here we go-
- Dani Cummings.
Oh, look she's an organ donor.
How sweet!
Seems about your height...
- Blonde hair.
- That's okay.
What are you little girls doing?
We are just getting comfortable and throwing in a flick.
You wanna watch?
I'd love to watch.
Where were you, Francis?
I was just down by the river filming some stuff.
Pretty late, huh?
Yeah, I guess.
Well, I'm going out for a little bit.
So if you need anything...
All right.
All right.
I'll see you later.
Turn it off, turn it off!
It's just a movie, sweetheart.
I thought you liked this kind of stuff.
Well, I do.
It's just these movies are too real sometimes.
Kitty, if monsters were real, they'd be a lot different than they are on TV.
Well, I just can't stand being scared.
Well, what do you wanna do now?
Let's play a game.
What kind of game?
Let's play truth or dare.
What?
Around here we only play dare or double dare, if you can handle it.
- What about truth?
- No truth.
Dares just keep doubling until someone gets hurt.
- Play nice, Wendell.
- I am.
Okay, Kitty, you can even go first.
All right.
- Dare or double dare?
- Me?
If you can handle it.
Dare.
I dare you... to finish your beer in one drink.
Okay, my turn.
Kitty, dare or double dare?
Double dare.
Double dare?
I double dare you... to... make out with Darlene.
You think I won't?
Well, if you don't, you lose.
I mean, we could play Scrabble or something, if you want.
Not bad.
- You surprise me.
- I'm full of them.
Aren't we all?
Okay, Kitty.
It's your turn again.
All right, Darlene...
- dare or double dare?
- Triple dare.
- Triple dare?
Come on--
- Triple dare.
Okay...
I triple dare you and Wendell to make out.
Huh?
Make out with her?
You are a-- just a kinky little thing, aren't you?
I win.
I don't think so.
Come on in.
- Nice house.
- Thank you.
- And the flowers--
- Yeah.
This is the sort of fall foliage...
Oh, yeah.
This is the wood-- woodland room.
This is nice.
I like that frame right there.
- Thank you, thank you.
- Very nice work.
Thank you.
I picked it out myself.
Very nicely hung.
We really shouldn't be here.
- Why is that?
- Just-- get in trouble.
We could go to your room and be quiet.
I don't know, it's kind of--
Come on.
- Okay.
- Okay?
Okay.
Just, we gotta be really quiet, okay?
Okay.
No.
No!
No!
No!
Help!
So, sure you don't want some?
I'm buying.
Pretty good!
No, I'm fine, thank you.
So... what did you want to talk about?
It uh-- you know, something at school?
Something?
My fucking family, just--
I'm sorry?
Yeah, Paul, it's school and stuff, you know?
- Yeah.
- Teachers and stuff, you know?
You know, I don't know if I ever told you about this, but-- my dad, when he was an army captain and-- we moved from base to base, it seemed like--
Christ, every-- every year or so.
So I know what it's like to be--
Francis.
Hey, I'm over here, pal.
Yo, Francis, I'm over here.
Francis.
I'm gonna go, Paul.
I have homework and stuff, you know?
- Just--
- All right.
Well, I'Il--
I'll stop by in a couple of days and I'Il--
I'll check up on you, all right?
Here.
There you go.
- Thanks.
- You're all right?
Yeah.
- Okay.
- Thanks for the soda.
Sure.
You take care, pal.
Wendell, what the fuck are you doing?
Oh, hey, Francis.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
Seems really nice, huh?
I saw your little movie too-- creepy.
This is a lot of fun, a lot of fun.
You don't mind sharing with the family, do you?
You know, I gotta hand it to you, brother, you're a lot more like us than I thought, aren't you?
She's pretty good-Iooking too.
You know, I had this good idea though.
I was thinking that we-- oh, yeah, look at that.
Look at that.
We could make our own porn movies down here if we want.
Bitch, huh?
How do you like that?
Huh, Francis?
Huh?
Come on, brother, let's see what you got.
Let's see what you got-- oh, yeah!
You fuck!
Come on, bud.
Come on, big guy.
Is that all you got?
Is that all you got?
That's what I thought, bitch.
Hey, Sam, how about your little hero now, huh?
Huh?
- Fuck!
- No!
- Get over here!
Come on.
- Wendell.
You fucking bitch!
Huh?
You wanna show off for that fucking bitch?
Huh?
I'll let you.
Come on, Lenny, come and get it!
Come on, Lenny.
Check it out.
You like that feeling, bitch?
Come on.
Hey.
Hey, Sam, keep it up.
You keep putting shit in his head,
I'm gonna skin you both alive, all right?
- Please.
- What was that?
Excuse me?
I'm sorry, I don't think I heard you right.
What was that?
Huh?
What was that?
Okay, I'll tell you what, why don't you hang out here for awhile?
I'll come back down and we'll finish what we started, okay?
You can scream all you want, Sam.
Just know one thing:
I am going to kill you.
All right?
What are you doing here, Francis?
- We need to talk.
- What happened to your hand?
Wendell.
I'm working here, Francis.
You know, you can't come running to me
- every time you two have a fight.
- Yeah, but--
I'm getting awfully tired of your hullabaloo, okay?
Wendell, school...
I can't be with you 24 hours a day, bud.
I have no one else to talk to, David.
I'm working a double shift here, okay?
Don't you think it's time you started trying to handle your own problems?
What would you do, huh?
What do you want me to say?
God.
Man,
I just wish Mom and Dad were still--
They're dead, Francis, okay?
When are you gonna--
when are you gonna understand that?
Just go home, okay?
We'll talk about this later.
No.
You know what?
Fuck you, David!
Fuck you!
I don't need your help.
Don't even fucking worry about it.
Hey, Wendell.
Is Darlene home?
She's in her room.
So, what are you doing tonight?
You know I'm spending the night again.
Darlene?
Hey.
- Is she here?
- No.
I meant, she's coming back in a bit.
No one's here, it's just you and me.
Okay, well, I'll just come back later then.
Why not stay and wait here, huh?
I should probably just come back.
Really?
Yeah.
What's the rush?
Anyone ever tell you you smell absolutely delicious?
Huh?
I bet you taste even better.
- Hey.
- Hi, guys.
I guess you're spending the night, Kitty?
Yeah.
Come on.
What was that?
He's so weird.
You keep telling yourself that things will change... that it's all a bad dream and one day you'll wake up.
I just wish they would catch us and then it would be all over.
Stay away from me.
I'm not going to hurt you.
You killed my friend.
I brought you some food.
It's all I could afford.
Is that a joke?
Just go away.
Just go away.
Don't worry.
It's just Lenny.
What's Lenny?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
You kill people and you feed it to something you call Lenny?
We're not like you, okay?
We're sick.
We have a fucking disease.
Yeah, you're sick.
You are.
I should go.
Wait.
Can I have some of that food, please?
It's just-- they'd kill me if they knew I was here.
- This is looking good.
- Which color are you using?
- This one in here.
- I like it.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay, get you doing this.
I'm just not good at it.
No, just need a little practice.
Thank you.
What's your name?
Francis.
Can I ask you something, Francis?
Why did you bring me food?
Because...
I'm not one of them.
They're gonna kill me, Francis.
I know.
All you have to do is call the police.
Please.
My family has money.
They'll give you anything you need.
You don't understand.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
Yes, you can!
Francis, I have people who love me, who need me.
I just want to go home.
I want to see my family.
And what about my family?
They're all I have.
They're killers, Francis.
They're not a family.
I can't survive-- can't survive without them.
Shit.
Hello?
Wendell, are you messing with me?
Oh my God, you scared the shit out of me!
Really?
What happened?
Let me see.
- Oh my God.
- Can I kiss it and make it better?
I'll just clean it off in the bathroom.
- Oh, that's a lot of blood.
- Yeah..
- Let me help you.
- Darlene, come on.
Hey, Wendell.
Hey.
That's a nasty cut.
Yeah.
Wendell, was that you fucking with me out in the hall?
- Not me.
Must've been Darlene.
- Oh, tell the truth, Wendell.
- Truth or dare?
- Ooh, you up for another game, Kitty?
- Can I go first?
- Be my guest.
- Okay.
Darlene, dare or double dare?
- Yeah?
I don't know,
I'm feeling a little frisky tonight.
How about a double dare to start?
- I double dare you--
- What the hell--?
--to give Kitty a little seductive dance.
Darlene?
You guys, stop.
Darlene, why are you doing this?
Stop!
Darlene, stop!
Double dare or triple dare, Kitty?
I triple dare you to let Wendell kiss you on the lips.
Here, Kitty Kitty.
Come on, pussycat.
Where are you going, babe?
Where are you going, pussy?
Here, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty.
I don't want to talk to you in there.
We're not done with our game yet.
How long have I been out?
Not long-- hour or two.
Somebody will be here soon.
I should go.
Francis...
Thank you for talking to me.
I'm sorry, but... l--
I can help you out there.
I can help you without your family.
You don't need them, Francis.
I'll take care of you.
I'll take care of you.
Please, don't kill me.
You're leaving me here to die.
I know.
Hey, Dad, over here.
Did you know your redwood is in violation of the neighborhood safety growth code?
- No.
- Uh-huh.
That's a good job, son.
Hi, I'm Larry Davies.
I'm-
- I'm Katherine-- Kitty's uncle.
- Kitty is a friend of Darlene's.
- Yeah, sure.
Yeah.
This is my son, Allen.
Lieutenant Commander Daniels, private sector.
David Hamilton.
Just for your information, Kitty's gonna be staying with us this college semester.
So if you see her around, that's why.
Is everything all right?
Yeah.
Look, I'm sure it's nothing.
We're just a little worried, that's all.
We haven't heard from her all day and she isn't answering her cell phone.
Is she here, by chance?
Unfortunately, no one's here.
Darlene doesn't have a cell phone-- brain tumors.
That's strange, you know?
It's just not like her.
She said she was gonna be spending the night here last night with Darlene, and she knew we had plans for this morning.
I put a couple of calls in to some friends of mine down at the local sheriff's office, just in case.
But if you hear from her, please call that number.
Of course, of course.
Hey, look, l--
I know we are bothering you and all that, but we didn't have your number.
So we just thought we'd pop by and check.
So, if something turns up--
Just let me know if there's anything I can do.
Take care.
What did you do?
Why, nothing, David.
She left here this morning.
We really haven't seen her since.
I can't believe you two did this!
Oh, and what about the dozen homos you have buried under the house?
Yeah, Mr. Perfect, how do you explain that?
Are you that blind in your make-believe world, you don't think we know?
I use my head!
I pick transients and drifters, not some neighborhood girl whose cousin or-- or brother or whatever is the police!
You know why you hate us so much, David?
It's because we represent everything you wish you could have, but are just too afraid to face.
You two always-- fuck it up!
Are you trying to scare us, David, like when we were kids?
We're not little kids anymore.
So what are you gonna do, David?
When are you gonna realize this isn't the first time and certainly not the last time it's gonna happen?
Pull it together.
Hey!
- Mom and Dad--
- Mom and Dad were the exception.
None of us have the kind of self-control to have what they did.
The only difference between you and us, David, is we don't look at ourselves in the mirror and lie.
We accept who we are.
We don't deny it.
We have to move again.
All right, pack up what we need--
- Hi, this is Paul.
- Hey, Paul--
Please leave your message at the sound of the tone.
Don't forget to leave your phone number.
Bye.
Paul, it's Francis.
There's something really important we gotta talk about about my family and um...
I can't-
- I can't do it over the phone.
If you could meet me in person, that'd be great.
l-l-I just-- fuck!
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I know, Lenny.
I know.
It's coming.
It's coming, Lenny!
Please sit still.
Actually, it's-- it's kind of funny.
My father taught me how to do this.
It's kooky, I know, I know.
He just wanted to make sure if something were to happen to him, we'd still survive.
Now you gotta get it just right, so no air gets in.
It has a longer shelf life that way.
It's kind of like... frozen food.
You have something on your face there.
Oh, I apologize,
I don't mean to make you self-conscious or anything.
"David," he said, "David--
David, one day you might have to be the man of this family.
David...
David," he said-- he said, "David, you might have to be the one that takes care of your brothers and your sister."
And I do, I do, but they don't care.
Do you think they appreciate what I do for them?
No no no no.
Look, missy,
I don't mean to be a rude cunt, but it sort of seems to me that you're not listening to me.
I just want what's best for them.
I just want what's best for them.
I just want what's best for them.
Goodbye, Lenny.
Francis?
Hey, Francis, I got your message.
Francis?
David, are you here?
Francis?
Francis?
Francis, is that you?
Francis, you out here?
Hello?
David?
David?
Da--
David?
David?
David?
Hello?
David, are you all right?
Hey, I'll try to get you out.
Here, listen, I'm gonna-- shit.
You hiding there, huh?
Are you all right?
Hi.
Everything's going to be okay.
Stop it, stop--
What are you doing?
- Ah, no!
- No, Lenny!
No!
Stop!
No no!
Ooh, what happened?
- He's still alive.
We can drain him.
- Not him.
Aren't you the one who said they're just cattle to us and nothing else?
- Just do what you want.
- Look at this.
So, I guess he took her with him?
Fuck!
I didn't know the little fucker had it in him.
I'm actually kind of proud of the kid.
Yeah, well, he's gonna get himself in trouble.
He's right on the verge.
We've gotta find him.
Maybe you should go get him.
He looks up to you.
Will you still help me out there?
Francis, where are we?
We're hiding.
Are you okay?
We should get some help.
Francis, I need your help.
I can't come near you.
Francis, I can't hear you.
What?
What did you say, Francis?
You're bleeding.
Francis, you're scaring me.
There's something I need to tell you.
Please-- please, just help me get up.
We need to get help.
We're born, not made.
- Not like everybody thinks.
- I don't understand.
Oh Christ, let me go.
Please, please--
Not like the fucking movies.
Francis, please stop.
You have to go.
Francis, please don't do this.
Franny.
Franny.
I know.
We all gotta go through it our first time.
It's just the way it is, okay?
- I wish Mom and Dad were here.
- It just hurts so bad, David.
I know, I know.
It's just part of growing up, okay?
It's what we are.
What does it mean to be happy?
To be content in the world around you?
Is family the heart of everything--
even existence?
So what do we do now?
We have to move again.
The twins are packing up the house.
We're gonna leave in a few hours.
What about Lenny?
We're gonna have to bring him out of the box early.
Will he be okay?
You were brought out of the box early.
I was?
Yeah.
See how you turned out?
- Dave?
- Yeah?
I'm sorry.
So am I, Francis.
- Are you ready?
- Okay.
You guys, I really hate keeping him like this.
You know it's the way it's always been.
He would've killed everything in sight.
- Kind of like us.
You ready, David?
- Let me do this.
We're gonna open the door.
We don't have time for this.
- This is Lenny!
- Darlene, come on.
- David, let's go!
- He is-- he is our family!
I can do this.
Okay.
Are you sure?
Fine.
Lenny?
Lenny?
Lenny?
Hey, baby.
Excited?
Hey, baby.
You see?
We live with a disease.
Mom used to say it was the one thing that kept us close.
I always thought that it was the one thing that would keep us apart.
But I was wrong, and everything you thought you knew about us is wrong.
We live in the houses next to you, we work in the stores you shop at.
Our kids play with your kids.
We're just trying to be an ordinary family, trying to figure out where we fit in in the world.
But we do need blood, and we need a lot of it preferably fresh and not frozen.
Howdy.
We're the Thompsons.
Previously:
(in German)
(in German)
- Who are you?
- It's a pity you'll never know.
- Sydney...
- Vaughn...
How did you...?
Sloane is part of this.
He works with Prophet Five.
It's my chance to stop him.
- We expected to hear from you sooner.
- I ran into a few complications.
And Sydney?
She's dead.
Langley can't know what Sydney's doing.
Continue to assume that Prophet Five has moles inside the ClA.
Michael Linds in Berlin will arrange transport of the body.
- I'll get right on it.
- Come with me.
Anna's dead.
Sydney has infiltrated Prophet Five.
Sydney's presenting herself as Anna?
Is that wise?
- Her call.
I wasn't consulted.
Your status?
- Be up and running in a minute.
Sydney embedded a tracker into the chip Anna had to retrieve.
We can follow her.
We suspect Prophet Five intended for Anna to do a task only Sydney could do.
It's our opportunity to determine their endgame.
- That's ifthey believe Sydney is Anna.
- I know.
Patching Vaughn through.
- (Marshall) Vaughn. can you hear me?
- You're clear.
- Where is he?
- Hamburg.
He and Sydney uncovered a storeroom of data - material he and Renee's father gathered while investigating Prophet Five.
You'll join Vaughn, transmit the documentation back here for analysis.
Vaughn, it's Dixon.
It's good to hear your voice.
You too.
I'll see you soon.
- Marshall, how we doing?
- Triangulating the coordinates.
One sec.
You know, I cried at your funeral.
Uh, yeah, uh, sorry about that.
No, no... thank you.
I need a good cry now and again.
OK, tracker's hot.
Got her.
There she is.
She's on Tiergartenstrabe.
(Peyton) I have the chip in hand.
Of course.
We're en route now.
Our superiors were quite pleased with your performance.
- You seem surprised.
- Not at all.
Your reputation's well-deserved.
To the great Anna Espinosa.
Great seems a little strong, doesn't it?
- Don't tell me you're getting modest?
- Hm.
It's this body.
I have this uncontrollable urge now to act like a girl scout all the time.
Well, let's get you back to Zurich before you start trying to sell me cookies.
I'm sure our superiors are eager to get their hands on that.
This?
This is an inconvenience.
Nothing more.
- What just happened?
- I'm not sure.
I think the tracker crashed.
- Cra...
What does that mean?
- We've lost Sydney.
- Find her.
- I can't.
It must have fritzed out.
- Patch into a traffic cam, just find her!
- Don't worry.
I'm on it.
OK, I got her.
- They're headed south on A7.
- The airport.
Marshall, I'm headed east.
I'm gonna need directions.
OK, give me a sec.
Left at the next intersection.
- You're closing in.
- I'm gonna need a green light in a hurry.
- It's all in German.
- Marshall!
- "Anschlag"?
- "Grun" - green.
(brakes screech)
(PA announcements in German)
Shall we?
You finished the translation of page 47.
The circle will be complete when the Chosen One finds the rose in San Cielo.
Congratulations, Mr. Sloane.
Thanks to your work, we're closer than ever to comprehending Rambaldi's greatest mystery.
You understand the meaning of the deciphered message?
Enough to proceed.
However, I do have one concern.
Rambaldi's prophecies have always taken into account the smallest variables.
This is a man who predicted events hundreds of years before we were born.
The rose in question is indeed unique, as unique as Sydney herself.
What is unclear, however, is whether Anna Espinosa posing as Sydney is able to complete the task.
Well, then I guess you've got your work cut out for you.
After you.
- Sloane's here.
- Of course.
You didn't think we'd dispose of him this soon, did you?
I hear your mission was a success.
- I should offer you congratulations.
- Thank you.
Did you encounter any complications?
Just one, but I've dealt with her once and for all.
We should celebrate, Arvin.
Sydney Bristow is dead.
Remarkable likeness, isn't it?
So this is why you needed her.
Or should I say me?
In his prophecies Rambaldi referred to Sydney as the Chosen One.
He foretold that she would bring forth his final works.
And you really believe that?
That a man who lived 500 years ago had intentions for Sydney Bristow?
Excuse me.
I may be mistaken, but I always believed you to be a follower of Rambaldi's works.
Only when it suits my checkbook.
I'm not someone who'd guide my life by some perverted sense of faith.
As long as I have to look like this, I might as well make some use of it.
What does Rambaldi want me to do?
Retrieve an artifact from San Cielo, a monastery outside Rome.
Monastery?
That sounds fun.
Do I get to wear a habit?
I think I've told you all you need to know for now.
We leave within the hour.
Does this mean you're sending me to my room?
There's a change of clothes for you upstairs.
Second door on the left.
Sadly, he did, yeah.
Can you imagine what happened when they got home?
Can I steal you a sec?
The new encryption module for the coms - my math is wrong.
- Go ahead.
I can handle this.
- She'll be back in a sec.
Didn't Langley just convert all of our coms?
- This isn't about the coms.
- What's going on?
Last week when Sloane infiltrated the network, I built a bot to monitor the servers.
This morning a message came through this office with no id tags, intended for Allen Korman.
- Korman?
You mean the guy that...
- Yeah, him.
Why would Tom be contacting a guy who killed his wife?
So I did some digging.
Travel itinerary.
Korman's flying into LA tonight.
This doesn't make any sense.
I talked to Tom myself.
He went to confront Korman, but saw him with his family and changed his mind.
Rachel, Korman doesn't have any family.
I checked.
Tom's been lying to you.
I wanted to tell you first, but I have to tell Mr. Bristow about this.
- No, you don't.
- Yes, we have to.
The contact is anonymous.
Tom is not a bad guy.
- We don't know anything about him.
- Because I know.
Look, just let me check into it first.
Give me 24 hours.
I promise, if we don't have an answer by then, we'll go to Jack together.
All right. 24 hours.
(humming)
(hissing)
(phone rings)
- Hello?
- (Sydney) It's me.
I don't have much time.
- Where are you?
- Zurich, an estate, highly secure.
- Sloane is here.
- What is he telling you?
That page 47 references San Cielo, a monastery near Rome.
We're going there.
- Where are you?
- In your kitchen, playing with Isabelle.
You are?
How is she?
- Happy.
- (giggles and gurgles)
- Dad, did she just...
- Giggle?
Yeah.
Apparently I'm funny.
She hasn't done that before.
That was a first.
- Of which there will be many.
- I know.
I'll notify Vaughn and Dixon about Rome.
If you learn...
- (knocking)
- I have to go.
Tell Isabelle I love her.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
You're shorter than I remember.
- This is all regarding Prophet Five?
- This entire bunker contains evidence of mysterious deaths, assassinations, car bombings.
All of them involving people who were investigating Prophet Five.
- They killed anyone who got too close.
- But they didn't get you?
They might have if not for Jack.
In hospital he convinced me that Prophet Five wouldn't rest until they killed me, and that I was in no condition to fight back.
- How'd he manage it?
- Sodium morphate.
It slowed down my body functions to a point that mimicked death.
Apparently I spent four hours in a drawer at the morgue waiting for Jack's contact to reach me to administer the antidote.
Then a couple days of traveling before I made it to Nepal.
You know, it's funny.
It's the first time I ever felt Jack accepted me.
Or he manufactured an elaborate scheme to postpone your wedding to his daughter.
(laughs)
I have something for you.
Fortunately, she looks more like her mother.
Yeah.
Yeah, she does.
Dixon, thank you.
(phone rings)
Yeah, Jack.
Of course.
We'll contact you when we arrive.
Jack's sending in a team to box all this up.
Sydney's en route with Sloane.
We're gonna provide backup.
- Where are they headed?
- Rome.
Anna.
Well...
I made our arrangements.
Your contact will be meeting you on the ground.
He'll provide you with access to San Cielo.
No more than I need to know.
Well, I'm sure you have questions.
So do I.
Tell me... how did it happen?
How did I kill Sydney?
- Yeah.
- Why do you care?
Well...
Sydney was a remarkable agent.
I imagine it wasn't easy.
Sydney wasn't a martyr or a legend.
She was just a person... who deserved nothing more than to be shot in the back.
And so she was.
The Chosen One.
She died just as easy as anyone.
I see.
Well, thank you.
We'll be landing shortly.
I know what you have planned for Anna after this mission is over.
You have reservations?
Oh, no.
I want to be the one who kills her.
You smell nice.
So we looked into the Monastery San Cielo.
You sure about that name?
- Yeah.
Why?
- Marshall couldn't find any record of it.
I'm meeting someone inside the OTB.
He's supposed to brief me on the rest.
I saw a picture of Isabelle.
I don't know how we do this anymore.
We do it the way we've always done it.
It's the only way to keep her safe.
We end this.
OK.
Dixon and I will have your back.
If anything happens, we'll pull you out.
- So who is this contact?
- Sloane said I'd know him when I saw him.
Syd, be careful.
(sport announcements on TV in Italian)
(Sark) I wouldn't do that if I were you.
If you want my advice, I'd take Tokyo Rose in the third.
It's a sure bet.
Julian.
Last time I saw you was Venice.
Where, as I recall, you betrayed me to the ClA.
- They took me into custody.
- And yet, Anna, here you are, looking better than ever.
That's for a year spent in a federal holding facility.
(in Italian)
What was that one for?
I'll get back to you.
Right.
So, what are you drinking?
- Did you find him?
- The Cardinal?
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.
I'm gonna give you to three to start talking.
Not here.
Somebody might be watching.
I didn't lie to you.
Korman killed my wife.
But the order came from somebody else.
Closest I've gotten is a name.
The Cardinal.
Well, you two seem to be pretty chummy.
He works freelance.
We did a job once - deep-cover op.
He doesn't even know my real name.
Look, I've gotta find out why, Rachel.
She was a schoolteacher.
She wasn't a part of this life.
If somebody wanted to hurt me, why didn't they just come after me?
And Korman knows?
He does now.
He found the Cardinal.
What does he want?
Money?
His car.
It was seized when he turned himself in to WlTSEC.
You could have told me, Tom.
I would have kept it to myself.
No.
I couldn't have.
I spent four years, and this is as close as I've got to an answer.
I couldn't trust anybody.
If I hack into the federal database, I should be able to find the car.
I couldn't ask you to do that.
You didn't.
It's Sark.
Her contact?
Yep.
Better the enemy you know.
She can handle Sark.
Another?
Perhaps you shouldn't.
We're on the clock.
We are?
Here I thought we were just catching up on old times.
In that case, maybe it's time you fill me in on the plan.
- What has Sloane told you?
- Just that our target is San Cielo.
That's not entirely true.
The rose you're supposed to acquire, if you're to believe page 47, is being held in a facility known by Rambaldi as San Cielo.
The rest of the world now refers to it as La Fossa Maximum Security Prison.
We're breaking into a prison?
According to Sloane, Rambaldi, in the days leading up to his execution, was held there.
He believes he hid the rose in the northwest isolation wing.
The text specifies only the Chosen One can obtain the item in question.
I guess you'll have to do.
(in Italian)
An explosion?
I suggest you take cover.
(beeping)
(in Italian)
Wait, this is your plan for getting us into La Fossa?
!
Yes.
Grazie.
Follow my lead, will you?
(in Italian)
- Have you accessed the prison's network?
- Not yet.
Vaughn and Dixon are in the sewers now.
The prison internet connection runs through a junction box.
It'll be vulnerable.
- Merlin, are you there?
- Yeah.
Vaughn. go ahead.
We're 70 meters in.
Still no sign of the junction box.
You're almost under the switch room.
You're close.
Got it.
It's a standard ipx node.
- You should be able to access the feeds.
- Doing that now.
Do it quickly.
I don't like the idea of Sydney being in prison with Sark as her backup.
(in Italian)
Lucky for you I won't be here for long, otherwise I'd pull out your tongue and choke you with it.
(coughs)
(gasps for breath)
(in Italian)
Do you realize we just broke about a half-dozen federal laws?
Unless they moved it, Korman's car should be down this aisle.
Look, just stay low, check for VlN numbers.
You ready?
Let's go.
This is it.
This shouldn't take long.
- Can I help?
- Yeah, just keep an eye out for the guard.
Is there any reason you're connecting the carburetor to the intake tube?
- Is this the carburetor?
- Yeah.
Maybe I should keep an eye out for the guard.
- All right, you should be tied in now.
- Yeah, we're hot.
Getting a picture?
Copy.
It's coming through.
See if you can isolate the women's block.
Wait, was that...
Is that the women's showers?
No, that's men.
Definitely men.
There she is.
Wait a minute.
She's in isolation.
You think that's part of her plan?
We have to hope so.
(man) Eccolo.
Andiamo!
Si. questo e bene.
(in Italian)
Marshall, what happened?
Did we lose the signal?
I don't know.
We've been kicked out.
Looks like somebody else tried to hack in.
Sark.
Any way to regain our tap?
We have to keep track of her.
You could look for the alarm lines and then try to cross-wind 'em.
- Know what he's talking about?
- 50%.
(beeping)
(door unlocks)
(weak moaning)
(chatter)
Sark, where are you?
(gasps)
I've been waiting for you for a very long time.
You have me confused with someone else.
Hm.
I can't imagine confusing you with anyone else.
As difficult as this must be for you to understand,
I know you.
We've never met.
No, we haven't.
We don't have much time.
Come with me.
I'm not going anywhere with you unless you tell me who you are.
The circle will be complete when the Chosen One finds the rose.
I am the rose.
Now, if you will come with me.
And, Mr. Harvey, how can I help you?
You have two suspects in custody who are wanted fugitives from my country, and we'd like to have them extradited, with your permission.
- Then I'm afraid we have a problem.
- Why is that, sir?
These two have committed crimes on Italian land and I cannot possibly release them before their first judicial hearing.
But you could release them with the permission of the general prosecutor,
Adriana Macelli.
Well, yes, of course.
But Signora Macelli...
Mrs. Macelli is expecting your call.
Pronto.
Procuratrice Macelli.
Signora Macelli.
Buongiorno.
Well, looks like we may be almost there.
I was supposed to meet her.
- Who?
- My wife.
When she died.
It was our half-year anniversary.
I was gonna pick her up at work... take her out to dinner.
But contact called.
I never made it.
I was working five investigations, and maybe I screwed up, got my stories confused.
Maybe somebody from my past...
Revenge.
I don't know.
You'll find out soon enough.
Thanks for doing this.
Honestly, this is the closest thing I've had to a night out since I joined the ClA.
Wanna hop in and give me some gas?
(engine starts)
Hey!
Who did this?
You don't need me to tell you.
He told me you'd be coming.
All!
hadtodowaswait.
This is yours for the time being.
What is it?
His greatest gift and also his greatest curse.
- Meaning?
- What you hold in your hand is simply defiance of the natural order.
The end of nature itself.
Some very bad people want what's in this amulet.
I can't stop them if you don't tell me what it is.
You don't understand.
You can't stop them.
You don't know me very well.
Hm.
You're more charming than I could have imagined.
I used to believe as you do that there were decisions to be made.
But in the end it's just fate.
It's out of our hands, and now it's just a matter of time.
Amatteroftime untilwhat?
Until the stars fall from the sky, until the end of light.
You have gotten what you came for.
The guards will be making rounds soon.
You need to go.
- Will you be all right?
- Hm...
I'm not a part of the battle to come.
Go!
- Dixon, I got her!
- I'll call you back.
She's heading to the women's block.
She must have got what she came for.
Maybe she's headed for extraction.
Good luck with this one.
He's all yours.
Thank you.
Where's Anna?
Annawon'tbejoining us.
Were you successful?
Tell me, Anna, did you retrieve the rose?
No.
There was nothing there.
I don't believe you.
(moans)
Sydney deserved better than an anonymous bullet.
You didn't even have the courage to face her.
At least I'll look you in the eye.
- Marshall, talk to me!
- There's a grate into the iso ward.
No time.
We need to distract Sloane.
Their surveillance feed - can we use it to get into security controls?
Marshall, hurry!
- Got it.
- (alarm)
I don't die that easy.
Sir?
We've had a breach.
You better get out of here.
Stay in your cell.
Stay back!
(gunshot)
Sydney, you OK?
Yeah.
Let's get outta here.
- Thank you.
- Why was the hit ordered on my wife?
- If I tell you, you'd never let me walk away.
- You have my word.
I don't believe you.
Go ahead.
Shoot me.
First tell me why she had to die.
Truth is she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
- I don't understand.
- My information said you were picking her up at her job.
I was waiting at the bottom of the stairs.
You were supposed to be with her.
It was a mistake.
She died because I thought she was you.
I'm going to disappear now.
If you come after me I will know, and I'll do what I set out to do four years ago.
(beeping)
- This is pretty amazing.
- Have you ever seen anything so perfect?
No.
You did good.
Thanks.
- You're gonna be just like your mom.
- Oh, I hope not.
I hope she's a doctor or a teacher, or just anything that does not involve wearing a wig.
I don't know.
I think she'd look pretty cute in a little pink wig.
Maybe not.
You OK?
Yeah, it's just...
I'm still a little sore, I guess.
- We came so close, Vaughn.
- Sydney...
Sloane, Prophet Five - they're still out there.
Hey.
I thought we agreed tonight it's just us, OK?
(Isabelle snores)
Oh, my God.
All right, the snoring, it kills me.
(phone rings)
- Hello?
- (Sloane) It was you.
Sydney.
Of course.
How could I have ever thought otherwise?
I saw it in you the first time we met.
You're a survivor. just like me.
And now. thanks to you.
I have everything I need.
(children) Bad robot!
Previously:
- Who are you?
- It's a pity you'll never know.
- Sydney...
- Vaughn...
How did you?
Sloane is part of this.
He works with Prophet Five.
It's my chance to stop him.
- We expected to hear from you sooner.
- I ran into a few complications.
And Sydney?
She's dead.
Langley can't know what Sydney's doing.
Continue to assume that Prophet Five has moles inside the CIA.
Michael Linds in Berlin will arrange transport of the body.
- I'll get right on it.
- Come with me.
Anna's dead.
Sydney has infiltrated Prophet Five.
Sydney's presenting herself as Anna?
Is that wise?
- Her call.
I wasn't consulted.
Your status?
- Be up and running in a minute.
Sydney embedded a tracker into the chip Anna had to retrieve.
We can follow her.
We suspect Prophet Five intended for Anna to do a task only Sydney could do.
It's our opportunity to determine their endgame.
- That's if they believe Sydney is Anna.
- I know.
Patching Vaughn through.
- Vaughn, can you hear me?
- You're clear.
- Where is he?
- Hamburg.
He and Sydney uncovered a storeroom of data - material he and Renée's father gathered while investigating Prophet Five.
You'll join Vaughn, transmit the documentation back here for analysis.
Vaughn, it's Dixon.
It's good to hear your voice.
You too.
I'll see you soon.
- Marshall, how we doing?
- Triangulating the coordinates.
One sec.
You know, I cried at your funeral.
Uh, yeah, uh, sorry about that.
No, no... thank you.
I need a good cry now and again.
OK, tracker's hot.
Got her.
There she is.
She's on Tiergartenstraße.
I have the chip in hand.
Of course.
We're en route now.
Our superiors were quite pleased with your performance.
- You seem surprised.
- Not at all.
Your reputation's well-deserved.
To the great Anna Espinosa.
Great seems a little strong, doesn't it?
- Don't tell me you're getting modest?
- Hm.
It's this body.
I have this uncontrollable urge now to act like a girl scout all the time.
Well, let's get you back to Zurich before you start trying to sell me cookies.
I'm sure our superiors are eager to get their hands on that.
This?
This is an inconvenience.
Nothing more.
- What just happened?
- I'm not sure.
I think the tracker crashed.
- Cra...
What does that mean?
- We've lost Sydney.
- Find her.
- I can't.
It must have fritzed out.
- Patch into a traffic cam, just find her!
- Don't worry.
I'm on it.
OK, I got her.
- They're headed south on A7.
- The airport.
Marshall, I'm headed east.
I'm gonna need directions.
OK, give me a sec.
Left at the next intersection.
- You're closing in.
- I'm gonna need a green light in a hurry.
- It's all in German.
- Marshall!
- "Anschlag"?
- "Grün" - green.
Shall we?
You finished the translation of page 47.
The circle will be complete when the Chosen One finds the rose in San Cielo.
Congratulations, Mr. Sloane.
Thanks to your work, we're closer than ever to comprehending Rambaldi's greatest mystery.
You understand the meaning of the deciphered message?
Enough to proceed.
However, I do have one concern.
Rambaldi's prophecies have always taken into account the smallest variables.
This is a man who predicted events hundreds of years before we were born.
The rose in question is indeed unique, as unique as Sydney herself.
What is unclear, however, is whether Anna Espinosa posing as Sydney is able to complete the task.
Well, then I guess you've got your work cut out for you.
After you.
- Sloane's here.
- Of course.
You didn't think we'd dispose of him this soon, did you?
I hear your mission was a success.
- I should offer you congratulations.
- Thank you.
Did you encounter any complications?
Just one, but I've dealt with her once and for all.
We should celebrate, Arvin.
Sydney Bristow is dead.
Remarkable likeness, isn't it?
So this is why you needed her.
Or should I say me?
In his prophecies Rambaldi referred to Sydney as the Chosen One.
He foretold that she would bring forth his final works.
And you really believe that?
That a man who lived 500 years ago had intentions for Sydney Bristow?
Excuse me.
I may be mistaken, but I always believed you to be a follower of Rambaldi's works.
Only when it suits my checkbook.
I'm not someone who'd guide my life by some perverted sense of faith.
As long as I have to look like this, I might as well make some use of it.
What does Rambaldi want me to do?
Retrieve an artifact from San Cielo, a monastery outside Rome.
Monastery?
That sounds fun.
Do I get to wear a habit?
I think I've told you all you need to know for now.
We leave within the hour.
Does this mean you're sending me to my room?
There's a change of clothes for you upstairs.
Second door on the left.
Sadly, he did, yeah.
Can you imagine what happened when they got home?
Can I steal you a sec?
The new encryption module for the coms - my math is wrong.
- Go ahead.
I can handle this.
- She'll be back in a sec.
Didn't Langley just convert all of our coms?
- This isn't about the coms.
- What's going on?
Last week when Sloane infiltrated the network, I built a bot to monitor the servers.
This morning a message came through this office with no ID tags, intended for Allen Korman.
- Korman?
You mean the guy that...
- Yeah, him.
Why would Tom be contacting a guy who killed his wife?
So I did some digging.
Travel itinerary.
Korman's flying into LA tonight.
This doesn't make any sense.
I talked to Tom myself.
He went to confront Korman, but saw him with his family and changed his mind.
Rachel, Korman doesn't have any family.
I checked.
Tom's been lying to you.
I wanted to tell you first, but I have to tell Mr. Bristow about this.
- No, you don't.
- Yes, we have to.
The contact is anonymous.
Tom is not a bad guy.
- We don't know anything about him.
- Because I know.
Look, just let me check into it first.
Give me 24 hours.
I promise, if we don't have an answer by then, we'll go to Jack together.
All right. 24 hours.
- Hello?
- It's me.
I don't have much time.
- Where are you?
- Zurich, an estate, highly secure.
- Sloane is here.
- What is he telling you?
That page 47 references San Cielo, a monastery near Rome.
We're going there.
- Where are you?
- In your kitchen, playing with Isabelle.
You are?
How is she?
Happy.
- Dad, did she just...
- Giggle?
Yeah.
Apparently I'm funny.
She hasn't done that before.
That was a first.
- Of which there will be many.
- I know.
I'll notify Vaughn and Dixon about Rome.
If you learn...
I have to go.
Tell Isabelle I love her.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
You're shorter than I remember.
- This is all regarding Prophet Five?
- This entire bunker contains evidence of mysterious deaths, assassinations, car bombings.
All of them involving people who were investigating Prophet Five.
- They killed anyone who got too close.
- But they didn't get you?
They might have if not for Jack.
In hospital he convinced me that Prophet Five wouldn't rest until they killed me, and that I was in no condition to fight back.
- How'd he manage it?
- Sodium morphate.
It slowed down my body functions to a point that mimicked death.
Apparently I spent four hours in a drawer at the morgue waiting for Jack's contact to reach me to administer the antidote.
Then a couple days of traveling before I made it to Nepal.
You know, it's funny.
It's the first time I ever felt Jack accepted me.
Or he manufactured an elaborate scheme to postpone your wedding to his daughter.
I have something for you.
Fortunately, she looks more like her mother.
Yeah.
Yeah, she does.
Dixon, thank you.
Yeah, Jack.
Of course.
We'll contact you when we arrive.
Jack's sending in a team to box all this up.
Sydney's en route with Sloane.
We're gonna provide backup.
- Where are they headed?
- Rome.
Anna.
Well...
I made our arrangements.
Your contact will be meeting you on the ground.
He'll provide you with access to San Cielo.
No more than I need to know.
Well, I'm sure you have questions.
So do I.
Tell me... how did it happen?
How did I kill Sydney?
- Yeah.
- Why do you care?
Well...
Sydney was a remarkable agent.
I imagine it wasn't easy.
Sydney wasn't a martyr or a legend.
She was just a person... who deserved nothing more than to be shot in the back.
And so she was.
The Chosen One.
She died just as easy as anyone.
I see.
Well, thank you.
We'll be landing shortly.
I know what you have planned for Anna after this mission is over.
You have reservations?
Oh, no.
I want to be the one who kills her.
You smell nice.
So we looked into the Monastery San Cielo.
You sure about that name?
- Yeah.
Why?
- Marshall couldn't find any record of it.
I'm meeting someone inside the OTB.
He's supposed to brief me on the rest.
I saw a picture of Isabelle.
I don't know how we do this anymore.
We do it the way we've always done it.
It's the only way to keep her safe.
We end this.
OK.
Dixon and I will have your back.
If anything happens, we'll pull you out.
- So who is this contact?
- Sloane said I'd know him when I saw him.
Syd, be careful.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
If you want my advice, I'd take Tokyo Rose in the third.
It's a sure bet.
Julian.
Last time I saw you was Venice.
Where, as I recall, you betrayed me to the CIA.
- They took me into custody.
- And yet, Anna, here you are, looking better than ever.
That's for a year spent in a federal holding facility.
What was that one for?
I'll get back to you.
Right.
So, what are you drinking?
- Did you find him?
- The Cardinal?
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.
I'm gonna give you to three to start talking.
Not here.
Somebody might be watching.
I didn't lie to you.
Korman killed my wife.
But the order came from somebody else.
Closest I've gotten is a name.
The Cardinal.
Well, you two seem to be pretty chummy.
He works freelance.
We did a job once - deep-cover op.
He doesn't even know my real name.
Look, I've gotta find out why, Rachel.
She was a schoolteacher.
She wasn't a part of this life.
If somebody wanted to hurt me, why didn't they just come after me?
And Korman knows?
He does now.
He found the Cardinal.
What does he want?
Money?
His car.
It was seized when he turned himself in to WITSEC.
You could have told me, Tom.
I would have kept it to myself.
No.
I couldn't have.
I spent four years, and this is as close as I've got to an answer.
I couldn't trust anybody.
If I hack into the federal database, I should be able to find the car.
I couldn't ask you to do that.
You didn't.
It's Sark.
Her contact?
Yep.
Better the enemy you know.
She can handle Sark.
Another?
Perhaps you shouldn't.
We're on the clock.
We are?
Here I thought we were just catching up on old times.
In that case, maybe it's time you fill me in on the plan.
- What has Sloane told you?
- Just that our target is San Cielo.

You're almost under the switch room.
You're close.
Got it.
It's a standard IPX node.
- You should be able to access the feeds.
- Doing that now.
Do it quickly.
I don't like the idea of Sydney being in prison with Sark as her backup.
Lucky for you I won't be here for long, otherwise I'd pull out your tongue and choke you with it.
Do you realize we just broke about a half-dozen federal laws?

I think she'd look pretty cute in a little pink wig.
Maybe not.
You OK?
Yeah, it's just...
I'm still a little sore, I guess.
- We came so close, Vaughn.
- Sydney...
Sloane, Prophet Five - they're still out there.
Hey.
I thought we agreed tonight it's just us, OK?
Oh, my God.
All right, the snoring, it kills me.
- Hello?
- It was you, Sydney.
Of course.
How could I have ever thought othe^rwise?
I saw it in you the first time we met.
You're a survivor, just like me.
And now, thanks to you, I have everything I need.
Bad robot!
- Who are you?
- It's a pity you'll never know.
Sloane is part of this.
He works with Prophet Five.
This is my chance to stop him.
We were expecting to hear from you sooner.
I ran into a few complications.
And Sydney?
She's dead.
Langley can't know what Sydney's doing.
We should continue to act on the assumption that Prophet Five has moles inside the C.I.A.
Contact Michael Linz in Berlin.
He'll send the body back.
I'll get right on it.
Come with me.
Anna's dead.
Sydney seized the opportunity to infiltrate Prophet Five.
Sydney's presenting herself as Anna?
Do you think that's wise?
It was Sydney's call.
I wasn't consulted.
What's your status?
We'll be up and running in a minute.
Sydney embedded a tracker into the chip that Anna was tasked to retrieve.
We'll be able to follow her from here.
We suspect Prophet Five had intended for Anna to do some task only Sydney could perform.
Learning what that is may be an opportunity to determine their endgame.
- That's if they believe Sydney is Anna.
- I know.
Patching Vaughn through.
Vaughn, can you hear me?
You're clear.
Where is he?
Hamburg.
He and Sydney uncovered a storeroom of information... material that Vaughn and Renée Rienne's fathers gathered during their investigation of Prophet 5.
You'll join Vaughn.
Transmit the documentation back here for analysis.
Vaughn, it's Dixon.
It's good to hear your voice.
You, too.
I'll see you soon.
Marshall, how we doing?
I'm triangulating the coordinates.
Just give me a sec.
You know, I cried at your funeral.
- Sorry about that.
- No, no, thank you.
I need a good cry now and again.
Okay, tracker's hot.
Got her.
There she is.
She's on...
Tiergartenstrasse.
I have the chip in hand.
Of course.
We're en route now.
Our superiors were quite pleased with your performance.
You seem surprised.
Not at all.
Your reputation's well-deserved.
To the great Anna Espinosa.
"Great" seems a little strong, doesn't it?
Don't tell me you're getting modest.
It's this body.
I have this uncontrollable urge now to act like a girl scout all the time.
Well, let's get you back to Zurich before you start trying to sell me cookies.
I'm sure our superiors are eager to get their hands on that.
This?
This is an inconvenience.
Nothing more.
- What just happened?
- I'm not sure.
I think the tracker crashed.
Crashed?
What does that mean, crashed?
- We've lost Sydney.
- Marshall, find her!
I can't.
I think it must've fritzed out.
Patch into a traffic cam.
Do something!
Just find her!
Don't worry, I'm on it.
Okay, I got her.
They're headed south on A7.
The airport.
Marshall, I'm on Doverkamp, headed east.
I need directions.
Wait, give me a sec.
Left at the next intersection.
You're closing in.
Marshall, I'm gonna need a green light in a hurry.
Easier said than done.
It's all in German.
- Anschlag?
- Grun.
Green.
Shall we?
You finished the translation of page 47.
"The circle will be complete,"
"when the chosen one finds the rose in San Cielo."
Congratulations, Mr. Sloane.
Thanks to your work, we're closer than we've ever been to comprehending Rambaldi's greatest mystery.
You understand the meaning of the deciphered message?
Enough to proceed.
However, I do have one concern.
Rambaldi's prophecies have always taken into account the smallest variables.
This is a man who predicted events hundreds of years before we were born.
The rose in question is indeed unique... as unique as Sydney herself.
What is unclear, however, is whether Anna Espinosa, posing as Sydney, is able to complete the task.
Well, then I guess you've got your work cut out for you.
After you.
Sloane's here.
Of course.
You didn't think we'd dispose of him this soon, did you?
I hear your mission was a success.
I suppose I should offer you congratulations.
Thank you.
Did you encounter any complications?
Just one.
But I've dealt with her once and for all.
We should celebrate, Arvin.
Sydney Bristow is dead.
Sync by Anyone, Sixe, Guilamu
Remarkable likeness, isn't it?
So this is why you needed her.
Or should I say me?
In his prophecies, Rambaldi referred to Sydney as "the chosen one."
He foretold that she would bring forth his final works.
And you really believe that... that a man who lived 500 years ago had intentions for Sydney Bristow?
Excuse me.
I may be mistaken, but I always believed you to be a follower of Rambaldi's works.
Only when it suits my checkbook.
I'm not someone who'd guide my life by some perverted sense of faith.
But as long as I have to look like this, I might as well make some use of it.
What does Rambaldi want me to do?
Retrieve an artifact from San Cielo...
A monastery outside Rome.
Monastery?
That sounds fun.
Do I get to wear a habit?
I think I've told you all you need to know for now.
We leave within the hour.
Does this mean you're sending me to my room?
There's a change of clothes for you upstairs.
Second door on the left.
Sadly, he did, yeah.
Can you imagine what happened when they got home?
Could I steal you for a sec?
The new encryption module for the comms think my math is wrong.
Go ahead.
I can handle this.
She'll be back in a second.
Didn't Langley just convert all of our comms to...
This isn't about the comms.
Marshall, what's going on?
Last week, when Sloane infiltrated the network,
I built a bot to monitor the servers, you know, flag any abnormal activity?
This morning a message came through this office without any I.D. Tags.
Intended for Allen Korman.
Korman?
- You mean the guy that...
- Yeah, him.
I mean, why would Tom be contacting a guy who killed his wife ?
So, I did some digging.
Travel itinerary.
Korman's flying into L.A. Tonight.
This doesn't make any sense.
Look, I talked to Tom myself.
He said he came to Korman to confront him, but when he saw Korman with his family, he changed his mind.
Rachel, Korman doesn't have any family.
I checked.
Tom's been lying to you.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to tell you first, but...
I have to tell Mr. Bristow.
- No, you don't.
- Yes, we have to.
Look, you said it yourself...
The contact is anonymous...
Tom is not a bad guy!
- How do you know that ?
- Because I know.
Look, just let me check into it first.
Give me 24 hours.
I promise, if we don't have an answer by then, we'll go to Jack together.
All right. 24 hours.
Hey, it's me.
I don't have much time.
- Where are you?
- Zurich.
An estate, highly secure.
Sloane is here.
- What is he telling you?
- That page 47 references San Cielo...
A monastery outside Rome.
We're going there.
Where are you?
Right now, in your kitchen, playing with Isabelle.
You are?
How is she?
Happy.
- Dad, did she just...
- Giggle?
Yeah.
Apparently, I'm funny.
She hasn't done that before.
That was a first.
Of which there will be many.
I know.
I'll notify Vaughn and Dixon about Rome.
If you learn anything more...
I have to go.
Tell Isabelle I love her.
You ready?
Hey.
Hey.
You're shorter than I remember.
This is all regarding Prophet Five?
This entire bunker contains evidence of... mysterious deaths, assassinations, car bombings, all of them involving people who were investigating Prophet Five.
They basically killed anyone who got too close.
But they didn't get you.
No.
They might have, if not for Jack.
When I was in the hospital, he convinced me that Prophet Five wouldn't rest until they killed me, and that I was in no condition to fight back.
How'd he manage it?
Sodium morphate.
It slowed down my body functions to a point that mimicked death.
Apparently, I spent four hours in a drawer at the morgue waiting for Jack's contact reach me to administer the antidote.
Then a couple days of traveling before I made it to Nepal.
You know, it's funny, it's the 1st time I ever felt Jack accepted me.
Or else, he manufactured a very elaborate scheme to postpone your wedding to his daughter.
I have something for you.
Fortunately, she looks more like her mother.
Yeah, she does.
Dixon, thank you.
Yeah, Jack.
Of course.
We'll contact you when we arrive.
Jack's sending a team to box all this up.
Sydney's en route with Sloane.
We're gonna provide backup.
Where are they headed?
Rome.
Well...
I made our arrangements.
Your contact will be meeting you on the ground.
He'll provide you with access to San Cielo.
No more than I need to know.
Well,
I am sure you have questions.
So do I.
Tell me...
How did it happen?
How did I kill Sydney?
Why do you care?
Sydney was a remarkable agent.
I imagine it wasn't easy.
Sydney wasn't a martyr or a legend.
She was just a person... who deserved nothing more than to be shot in the back... and so she was.
The Chosen One.
She died just as easy as anyone.
I see.
Well, thank you.
We'll be landing shortly.
I know what you have planned for Anna after this mission is over.
You have reservations?
Oh, no.
I want to be the one who kills her.
You smell nice.
So we looked into the monastery San Cielo.
- You're sure about that name?
- Yeah, why?
Marshall couldn't find any record of it.
I'm meeting someone inside the O.T.B.
He's supposed to brief me on the rest.
I saw a picture of Isabelle.
I don't know how we do this anymore.
We do it the way we've always done it.
It's the only way to keep her safe.
We end this.
Okay.
Dixon and I will have your back.
If anything happens, we're gonna pull you out.
So who's this contact?
Sloane said I'd know him when I saw him.
Syd, be careful.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
If you want my advice, take Tokyo Rose in the third.
It's a sure bet.
Julian, last time I saw you, it was at Venice... where, as I recall, you betrayed me to the C.I.A.
They took me into custody.
And yet, Anna, here you are.
Looking better than ever.
That's, for a year spent in a federal holding facility.
Now what was that one for?
I'll get back to you.
Right.
So what are you drinking?
Did you find him?
The Cardinal?
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.
I'm gonna give you to "three" to start talking.
Not here.
Somebody might be watching.
I didn't lie to you.
Korman killed my wife.
But the order came from somebody else.
The closest I've gotten is a name...
The Cardinal.
Well, you two seem to be pretty chummy.
He works freelance.
We did a job once... deep cover op.
He doesn't even know my real name.
Look, I've gotta find out why, Rachel.
She was a schoolteacher.
She wasn't a part of this life.
If somebody wanted to hurt me, why didn't they just come after me?
And Korman knows?
He does now.
He found The Cardinal.
What does he want?
- Money?
- His car... it was seized when he turned himself in to witsec.
You could've told me, tom.
I would've kept it to myself.
No, I couldn't have.
I've spent four years, and this is as close as I've got to an answer.
I couldn't trust anybody.
If I hack into the federal database,
I should be able to find the car.
I couldn't ask you to do that.
You didn't.
It's Sark.
The contact?
Yep.
Better the enemy you know...
She can handle Sark.
Another?
Perhaps you shouldn't.
We're on the clock.
We are.
Here I thought we were just catching up on old times.
Well, in that case, maybe it's time you fill me in on the plan.
What has Sloane told you?
Just that our target is San Cielo.
Well, that's not entirely true.
The rose that you're suppose to acquire, if you're to believe page 47, is being held in a facility known by Rambaldi as San Cielo.
The rest of the world now refers to it as La Fossa maximum security prison.
We're breaking into a prison?
According to Sloane, Milo Rambaldi, in the days leading up to his execution, was held there.
He believes he hid the rose in the northwest isolation wing.
The text specifies that only the Chosen One can obtain the item in question.
I guess you'll have to do.
An explosion?
I suggest you take cover.
Wait, this is your plan for getting us into La Fossa?
Yes.
Grazzie.
Follow my lead, will you?
Have you been able to access the prison's internal network?
Not yet.
Vaughn and Dixon are moving through the sewers now.
Right here--prison internet connection runs out through a junction box.
It should be vulnerable.
Merlin, you there?
Yeah, Vaughn, go ahead.
We're about 70 meters in.
Still no sign of the junction box.
You're almost directly under the switch room.
- You should be close.
- Got it.
It's a standard IP-X node.
Good.
You should be able to splice the line
- and access the surveillance feeds.
- Doing that now.
Do it quickly.
I don't like the idea Sydney being in a maximum security prison with Sark as her backup.
Being my friend will make your time more pleasurable.
Lucky for you, I won't be here for long.
Otherwise, I'd pull out your tongue and choke you with it.
You realize we just broke about a half dozen federal laws.
Unless they moved it, Korman's car should be right down this aisle.
Look, just stay low, check for V.I.N. Numbers.
You ready?
Let's go.
This is it.
This shouldn't take long.
Can I help?
Yeah, just keep an eye out for the guard.
Is there any particular reason you're connecting the carburetor to the intake tube?
This is the carburetor?
Yeah.
Maybe, uh, I should keep an eye out for the guard.
All right.
You should be tied in now.
Yeah, we're hot.
You getting a picture?
Copy.
It's coming through.
See if you can isolate the women's block.
Wait a minute.
Was that...
was that the women's showers?
No, that's men.
Definitely men.
There she is.
Wait a minute.
She's in isolation.
You think that's part of a plan?
We have to hope so.
Hold him down.
This is gonna hurt.
Marshall, what happened?
- Did we lose the signal?
- I don't know.
Everything just went wacky.
We've been kicked out.
Looks like somebody else is trying to hack into the system.
Sark.
Is there any way to regain our tap?
We have to keep track of her.
You could look for the alarm lines and then try to cross-wind 'em and get a Von Eck signal.
Know what he's talking about?
50%.
This is it.
Sark, where are you?
I've been waiting for you for a very long time.
I think you have me confused with someone else.
I can't imagine confusing you with anyone else.
As difficult as this must be for you to understand...
I know you.
We've never met.
No.
We haven't.
We don't have much time.
Come with me.
I'm not going anywhere with you unless you tell me who you are.
"The circle will be complete when the chosen one finds the rose."
I am the rose.
Now... if you will come with me...
And, Mr. Harvey, how can I help you?
You have two suspects in custody who are wanted fugitives from my country, and we would like to have them extradited with your permission, of course.
Then I'm afraid we have a problem.
Why is that, sir?
These two have committed crimes on Italian land, and I cannot possibly release them before their first judicial hearing.
But you could release them if you got the permission of the general prosecutor,
Adriana Micelli.
Well, yes, of course.
But signora Micelli...
Mrs. Micelli is expecting your call.
Pronto.
Signora Micelli, Buongiorno.
Well...
looks like we may be almost there.
I was supposed to meet her.
Who?
My wife... night she died.
It was our half-year anniversary.
I was gonna pick her up at work... take her out to dinner.
But contact called.
I never made it.
I was working five investigations, and maybe I screwed up, got my stories confused.
Or maybe somebody from my past... revenge.
I don't know.
You'll find out so enough.
Thanks for doing this.
Honestly... this is the closest thing I've had to a night out since I joined the C.I.A.
You want to hop in and give me some gas?
Who did this?
You don't need me to tell you.
He told me you'd be coming.
All I had to do was wait.
This is yours for the time being.
What is it?
His greatest gift... and also his greatest curse.
Meaning?
What you hold in your hand is simply a defiance of the natural order...
The end of nature itself.
Some very bad people want what's in this amulet.
I can't stop them if you don't tell me what it is.
You don't understand.
You can't stop them.
You don't know me very well.
You're more charming than I could have imagined.
I used to believe as you do, that there were decisions to be made.
But in the end, it's just fate.
It's out of our hands.
And now it's just a matter of time.
A matter of time until what?
Until the stars fall from the sky.
Until the end of light.
You have gotten what you came for.
The guards will be making rounds soon.
You need to go.
Will you be all right?
I'm not a part of the battle to come.
Go.
Dixon, I got her.
I'll call you back.
Looks like she's heading back to the women's block.
She must have got what she came for.
Maybe she's headed for extraction.
Good luck with this one.
He's all yours.
Thank you.
Where's Anna?
Anna won't be joining us.
Were you successful?
Tell me, Anna...
Did you retrieve the rose?
There was nothing there.
I don't believe you.
Sydney deserved better than an anonymous bullet.
You didn't even have the courage to face her.
At least I look you in the eye.
Marshall, talk to me!
There's a grate to the iso ward about 30 yards ahead of you.
He'll never make it in time.
We need to distract Sloane!
Marshall, the surveillance feed they're tapped into, can we use it to get into security controls?
Marshall, hurry!
Got it.
I don't die that easy.
Sir, we've had a breach.
You better get out of here.
Stay in your cell.
Stay back!
You okay?
Yeah, let's get out of here.
Thank you.
Why was the hit ordered on my wife?
If I tell you, you'll never let me walk away from here.
You have my word.
I don't believe you.
Go ahead.
Shoot me.
First, tell me why she had to die.
Truth is, she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I don't understand.
My information said you were picking her up at her job.
I was waiting t the bottom of the stairs.
You were supposed to be with her.
It was a mistake.
She died because I thought she was you.
I'm going to disappear now.
If you come after me, I'll know.
And I'll do what I set out to do four years ago.
This is pretty amazing.
Have you ever seen anything so perfect?
No.
You did good.
Thanks.
You're gonna be just like your mom, aren't you?
Oh, I hope not.
I hope she's a doctor or a teacher or just anything that does not involve wearing a wig.
I don't know.
I think she'd look pretty cute in a little pink wig.
Maybe not.
You okay?
Yeah, it just...
I'm still a little sore, I guess.
We came so close, Vaughn.
Sloane and Prophet Five...
They're still out there.
Hey, I thought we agreed tonight it's just us, okay?
Oh, my God.
All right, the snoring... it kills me.
Hello?
It was you, Sydney.
Of course.
How could I have ever thought otherwise?
I saw it in you the first time we met.
You're a survivor... just like me.
And now thanks to you, I have everything I need.
Who are you?

I'll notify Vaughn and Dixon about Rome.
If you learn anything more...
I have to go.
Tell Isabelle I love her.
You ready?
Hey.
Hey.
You're shorter than I remember.
This is all regarding Prophet Five?
This entire bunker contains evidence of... mysterious deaths, assassinations, car bombings, all of them involving people who were investigating Prophet Five.
They basically killed anyone who got too close.
But they didn't get you.
No.
They might have, if not for Jack.
When I was in the hospital, he convinced me that Prophet Five wouldn't rest until they killed me, and that I was in no condition to fight back.
How'd he manage it?
Sodium morphate.
It slowed down my body functions to a point that mimicked death.
Apparently, I spent four hours in a drawer at the morgue waiting for Jack's contact reach me to administer the antidote.
Then a couple days of traveling before I made it to Nepal.
You know, it's funny, it's the 1st time I ever felt Jack accepted me.
Or else, he manufactured a very elaborate scheme to postpone your wedding to his daughter.
I have something for you.
Fortunately, she looks more like her mother.
Yeah, she does.
Dixon, thank you.
Yeah, Jack.
Of course.
We'll contact you when we arrive.
Jack's sending a team to box all this up.
Sydney's en route with Sloane.
We're gonna provide backup.
Where are they headed?
Rome.
Anna.
Well...
I made our arrangements.
Your contact will be meeting you on the ground.
He'll provide you with access to San Cielo.
No more than I need to know.
Well,
I am sure you have questions.
So do I.
Tell me...
How did it happen?
How did I kill Sydney?
Why do you care?
Sydney was a remarkable agent.
I imagine it wasn't easy.
Sydney wasn't a martyr or a legend.
She was just a person... who deserved nothing more than to be shot in the back... and so she was.
The Chosen One.
She died just as easy as anyone.
I see.
Well, thank you.
We'll be landing shortly.
I know what you have planned for Anna after this mission is over.
You have reservations?
Oh, no.
I want to be the one who kills her.
You smell nice.
So we looked into the monastery San Cielo.
You're sure about that name?
Yeah, why?
Marshall couldn't find any record of it.
I'm meeting someone inside the OTB.
He's supposed to brief me on the rest.
I saw a picture of Isabelle.
I don't know how we do this anymore.
We do it the way we've always done it.
It's the only way to keep her safe.
We end this.
Okay.
Dixon and I will have your back.
If anything happens, we're gonna pull you out.
So who's this contact?
Sloane said I'd know him when I saw him.
Syd, be careful.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
If you want my advice, take Tokyo Rose in the third.
It's a sure bet.
Julian, last time I saw you, it was at Venice... where, as I recall, you betrayed me to the CIA
They took me into custody.
And yet, Anna, here you are.
Looking better than ever.
That's, for a year spent in a federal holding facility.
Now what was that one for?
I'll get back to you.
R ight.
So what are you drinking?
Did you find him?
The Cardinal?
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.
I'm gonna give you to "three" to start talking.
Not here.
Somebody might be watching.
I didn't lie to you.
Korman killed my wife.
But the order came from somebody else.
The closest I've gotten is a name...
The Cardinal.
Well, you two seem to be pretty chummy.
He works freelance.
We did a job once... deep cover op.
He doesn't even know my real name.
Look, I've gotta find out why, Rachel.
She was a schoolteacher.
She wasn't a part of this life.
If somebody wanted to hurt me, why didn't they just come after me?
And Korman knows?
He does now.
He found The Cardinal.
What does he want?
- Money?
- His car... it was seized when he turned himself in to witsec.
You could've told me, tom.
I would've kept it to myself.
No, I couldn't have.
I've spent four years, and this is as close as I've got to an answer.
I couldn't trust anybody.
If I hack into the federal database,
I should be able to find the car.
I couldn't ask you to do that.
You didn't.
It's Sark.
The contact?
Yep.
Better the enemy you know...
She can handle Sark.
Another?
Perhaps you shouldn't.
We're on the clock.
We are.
Here I thought we were just catching up on old times.
Well, in that case, maybe it's time you fill me in on the plan.
What has Sloane told you?
Just that our target is San Cielo.
Well, that's not entirely true.
The rose that you're suppose to acquire, if you're to believe page 47, is being held in a facility known by Rambaldi as San Cielo.
The rest of the world now refers to it as La Fossa maximum security prison.
We're breaking into a prison?
According to Sloane, Milo Rambaldi, in the days leading up to his execution, was held there.
He believes he hid the rose in the northwest isolation wing.
The text specifies that only the Chosen One can obtain the item in question.
I guess you'll have to do.
An explosion?
I suggest you take cover.
Wait, this is your plan for getting us into La Fossa?
Yes.
Grazzie.
Follow my lead, will you?
Have you been able to access the prison's internal network?
Not yet.
Vaughn and Dixon are moving through the sewers now.
Right here... prison internet connection runs out through a junction box.
It should be vulnerable.
Merlin, you there?
Yeah, Vaughn, go ahead.
We're about 70 meters in.
Still no sign of the junction box.
You're almost directly under the switch room.
You should be close.
Got it.
It's a standard IP-X node.
Good.
You should be able to splice the line and access the surveillance feeds.
Doing that now.
Do it quickly.
I don't like the idea Sydney being in a maximum security prison with Sark as her backup.
Being my friend will make your time more pleasurable.
Lucky for you, I won't be here for long.
Otherwise, I'd pull out your tongue and choke you with it.
You realize we just broke about a half dozen federal laws.
Unless they moved it, Korman's car should be right down this aisle.
Look, just stay low, check for V.I.N. Numbers.
You ready?
Let's go.
This is it.
This shouldn't take long.
Can I help?
Yeah, just keep an eye out for the guard.
Is there any particular reason you're connecting the carburetor to the intake tube?
This is the carburetor?
Y eah.
Maybe, uh, I should keep an eye out for the guard.
All right.
You should be tied in now.
Yeah, we're hot.
You getting a picture?
Copy.
It's coming through.
See if you can isolate the women's block.
Wait a minute.
Was that... was that the women's showers?
No, that's men.
Definitely men.
There she is.
Wait a minute.
She's in isolation.
You think that's part of a plan?
We have to hope so.
Hold him down.
This is gonna hurt.
Marshall, what happened?
Did we lose the signal?
I don't know.
Everything just went wacky.
We've been kicked out.
Looks like somebody else is trying to hack into the system.
Sark.
Is there any way to regain our tap?
We have to keep track of her.
You could look for the alarm lines and then try to cross-wind 'em and get a Von Eck signal.
Know what he's talking about?
50%.
This is it.
Sark, where are you?
I've been waiting for you for a very long time.
I think you have me confused with someone else.
I can't imagine confusing you with anyone else.
As difficult as this must be for you to understand...
I know you.
We've never met.
No.
We haven't.
We don't have much time.
Come with me.
I'm not going anywhere with you unless you tell me who you are.
"The circle will be complete when the chosen one finds the rose. "
I am the rose.
Now... if you will come with me...
And, Mr. Harvey, how can I help you?
You have two suspects in custody who are wanted fugitives from my country, and we would like to have them extradited with your permission, of course.
Then I'm afraid we have a problem.
Why is that, sir?
These two have committed crimes on Italian land, and I cannot possibly release them before their first judicial hearing.
But you could release them if you got the permission of the general prosecutor,
Adriana Micelli.
Well, yes, of course.
But signora Micelli...
Mrs. Micelli is expecting your call.
Pronto.
Signora Micelli, Buongiorno.
Well...
looks like we may be almost there.
I was supposed to meet her.
Who?
My wife... night she died.
It was our half-year anniversary.
I was gonna pick her up at work... take her out to dinner.
But contact called.
I never made it.
I was working five investigations, and maybe I screwed up, got my stories confused.
Or maybe somebody from my past... revenge.
I don't know.
You'll find out so enough.
Thanks for doing this.
Honestly... this is the closest thing I've had to a night out since I joined the CIA.
You want to hop in and give me some gas?
Who did this?
You don't need me to tell you.
He told me you'd be coming.
All I had to do was wait.
This is yours for the time being.
What is it?
His greatest gift... and also his greatest curse.
Meaning?
What you hold in your hand is simply a defiance of the natural order...
The end of nature itself.
Some very bad people want what's in this amulet.
I can't stop them if you don't tell me what it is.
You don't understand.
You can't stop them.
You don't know me very well.
You're more charming than I could have imagined.
I used to believe as you do, that there were decisions to be made.
But in the end, it's just fate.
It's out of our hands.
And now it's just a matter of time.
A matter of time until what?
Until the stars fall from the sky.
Until the end of light.
You have gotten what you came for.
The guards will be making rounds soon.
You need to go.
Will you be all right?
I'm not a part of the battle to come.
Go.
Dixon, I got her.
I'll call you back.
Looks like she's heading back to the women's block.
She must have got what she came for.
Maybe she's headed for extraction.
Good luck with this one.
He's all yours.
Thank you.
Where's Anna?
Anna won't be joining us.
Were you successful?
Tell me, Anna...
Did you retrieve the rose?
There was nothing there.
I don't believe you.
Sydney deserved better than an anonymous bullet.
You didn't even have the courage to face her.
At least I look you in the eye.
Marshall, talk to me!
There's a grate to the iso ward about 30 yards ahead of you.
He'll never make it in time.
We need to distract Sloane!
Marshall, the surveillance feed they're tapped into, can we use it to get into security controls?
Marshall, hurry!
Got it.
I don't die that easy.
Sir, we've had a breach.
You better get out of here.
Stay in your cell.
Stay back!
You okay?
Yeah, let's get out of here.
Thank you.
Why was the hit ordered on my wife?
If I tell you, you'll never let me walk away from here.
You have my word.
I don't believe you.
Go ahead.
Shoot me.
First, tell me why she had to die.
Truth is, she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I don't understand.
My information said you were picking her up at her job.
I was waiting t the bottom of the stairs.
You were supposed to be with her.
It was a mistake.
She died because I thought she was you.
I'm going to disappear now.
If you come after me, I'll know.
And I'll do what I set out to do four years ago.
This is pretty amazing.
Have you ever seen anything so perfect?
No.
You did good.
Thanks.
You're gonna be just like your mom, aren't you?
Oh, I hope not.
I hope she's a doctor or a teacher or just anything that does not involve wearing a wig.
I don't know.
I think she'd look pretty cute in a little pink wig.
Maybe not.
You okay?
Yeah, it just...
I'm still a little sore, I guess.
We came so close, Vaughn.
Sloane and Prophet Five...
They're still out there.
Hey, I thought we agreed tonight it's just us, okay?
Oh, my God.
All right, the snoring... it kills me.
Hello?
It was you, Sydney.
Of course.
How could I have ever thought otherwise?
I saw it in you the first time we met.
You're a survivor... just like me.
And now thanks to you, I have everything I need.

Previously on "Lost":
My leg!
Aah!
I need you to go up through the grate and into the vents.
- That button has to be pushed.
- Okay.
I crawled through your vents, and I stood at your computer, and you know what happened?
Nothing happened, John.
I never entered the numbers, I never pressed the button.
If you want to do something nice for Libby, there's a beautiful beach 3 kilometers from here.
You could take her there.
Come on, give me the blankets.
Blankets?
I will handle the blankets, okay?
Take us to the guns.
Now.
Ah, that bitch.
Stole my damn gun.
Ana Lucia.
Why would she need a gun?
We caught one of them-- the others.
He's locked up in there.
Give me the gun.
I'll kill him.
I'm sorry.
Michael?
What are you building?
Hello, Ana.
Well, hello, yourself.
So are you gonna tell me?
- What is it?
- I'm building a church.
Now why the hell would you want to do that?
Because I was told to.
Told to by who?
I was just told.
I think it was in a dream.
A dream like this one?
You need to help John.
Yemi?
- Hello, brother.
- Oh, Yemi.
Forgive me.
I should have listened to you.
You were right.
- I did not mean to do it--
- Shh, shh, shh.
The work being done in this place is important, Eko.
It is more important than anything, and it is in danger.
You must help John.
He has lost his way.
You must make him take you to the question mark.
John will not want to show you, so you must make him.
Eko...
There are many distractions, brother.
But you must move past them.
What is done, is done.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, yemi.
And, Eko... bring the ax.
What's the matter?
You all right, mate?
I need to find John.
- What were you thinking, John?
- Jack, leave him alone.
No, Jack, don't leave him alone.
Shut it, Sawyer.
If Ana hadn't lifted your gun--
Oh, ain't that swell-- gimpy McCrutch over here covers up that the artist formerly known as Henry Gale tried to strangle your little amiga, and suddenly it's on me when she goes vigilante.
How about you go back to the beach?
Hey, enough, both of you.
Michael, hey!
He shot me.
- Who?
- He's gone!
He ran out.
Go, I got him.
Jack...
I was sleeping, and I heard gunshots.
I got up.
I came out of the bedroom.
And this-- there was this guy-- he had a gun, and...
Come on.
We've got to get you up, all right?
Let me help you.
She's dead.
Okay, we've got to get her up.
We've got to get her out to the back room, okay?
Grant us this mercy, O Lord, we beseech thee.
Amen.
She's in shock.
We've got to keep pressure on this.
Can you do anything?
- Jack--
- I heard you.
Just keep pressure on her, okay?
- How is she?
- I'm doing what I can.
How long ago?
What?
When did this happen?
How long ago did he leave?
I don't know, uh...
20 minutes, maybe a half-hour ago.
We can pick up the trail, catch up to him.
Man's got a head start, a gun, he ain't afraid of using--
He shot three of our people.
One of them's dead--
Who's gonna take care of Libby while you're off playing Daniel Boone?
I will go.
John, you have tracking experience, yes?
Yeah.
We will find his trail together.
If you find anything-- anything, you come right back here, and we figure out what we're gonna do next together.
Let's go, John.
How long has it been since your last confession?
Good question.
Too many years for me to even remember.
What do you wish to ask God's forgiveness for?
What sins have you committed?
Let's see.
Well, I slept with another woman besides my wife.
Just once, or many times?
How many is many?
To receive god's forgiveness, you must be penitent for your sins.
I also forged I.D. papers for a guy pretending to be a priest.
Do you have it?
So what'd you do, padre?
Skim from the collection plate?
You know I've got some friends in Los Angeles.
I could get you on with them.
- Doing what?
- You know... stuff.
Good morning, father Tunde.
Good morning, monsignor.
This is Mr. Caldwell.
He has been helping me arrange my trip to the United States.
I'm sorry, father, but I've got some bad news.
You're going to have to postpone your trip.
It appears we have a miracle.
My daughter, she...
she drowned.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
Oh, no, you don't understand.
She came back to life.
We were out in the back blocks, and Charlotte must have slipped, and she went into the river, and...
she's not much of a swimmer.
She was dead.
And the next day, she woke up.
Don't you understand?
It's a miracle.
A confirmation of faith.
Everyone needs to know about this.
People need--
- Where is your daughter now?
- At home, with my husband.
And what does he think?
The world needs to know about this.
We need to tell the Vatican, we need to tell the world--
I'm sorry, we can't just do that, Mrs. Malkin.
The church needs to conduct an investigation before anyone can be told.
Father Tunde will start this process, if you will permit him.
Mrs. Malkin, would you excuse us for a moment, please?
Of course.
Monsignor, with all due respect, I cannot do what you have asked.
Why not?
Because I do not believe what this woman says.
Why do you think I chose you?
Are you seeing something I'm not?
Hey!
I haven't seen a single track or a piece of sign since we left the hatch.
What the hell are you following?
Where is the question mark?
The what?
The question mark, John.
Where is it?
You know what?
You keep chasing after your own shadow.
I'm going back.
I know you do not want to show it... but you must.
No, I don't have to show you anything.
Then I'm sorry.
You hit me.
Why did you...
Because you were being difficult.
Are you insane?
No.
Ana Lucia, your friend, was just murdered, and you--
Ana wants me to help you, John.
- Help me do what?
- Find the question mark.
You don't even know what you're talking about, do you?
No.
But you know what I am talking about, John.
And that is all that matters.
Here.
Here, you wanna find your damn question mark?
Here it is-- here, this is it right here.
Here, take it, take it, because it's nothing.
It's a memory.
It's ten seconds of nothing.
- This is your hatch, yes?
- It's not my hatch.
If the swan is where we came from, then we go that way.
We shouldn't even be out here.
Ana Lucia would still be alive... if I'd just told Jack that Henry attacked her.
And now she wants us to go here, John.
She wants us to go here, John, together.
She said this in my dream.
Oh, of course, your dream.
Tell me, John.
Haven't you ever followed a dream?
So the vatican's really interested in this one, eh?
That depends upon what I put in my report.
Why don't you just start by telling me what happened that night?
Well, I got a call out around 1:00 A.M.
Ambrose brought this girl in, dead.
She'd been in the water two hours.
Have you had much experience in this type of death?
Yeah, of course, I'm an undertaker.
Well, it's just my day job.
I mean, I'm perfectly qualified to be a coroner.
I mean, I did-- I did go to medical school.
And when did you find out that she was not dead?
During the autopsy.
During the autopsy?
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to believe me.
I figured you'd want to have a listen for yourself.
Decedent is a caucasian female, 161 centimeters, 51.3 kilos.
The body prepped and washed by the very lovely Valerie McTavish...
Ian...
Commencing with the post.
This is a clear case of drowning.
I'll begin with the thoracic-abdominal incision--
Take it.
No, please...
I don't want to ever listen to that tape again.
- Lost already?
- Your map is inexact.
No kidding.
These landmarks...
Is this a river?
No, it's a wavy line.
I didn't draw it, I just transcribed it.
I told you, I don't even know if it is a map.
Let's assume it is.
- What's the ax for?
- I don't know yet.
You were the one that found this plane, yes?
Y eah.
It was up there.
- And what made it fall?
- Boone.
Boone made it fall.
Then he died.
"It was a sacrifice that the island demanded."
Excuse me?
Nothing.
So, what's next?
We make camp... get some sleep... and wait for further instruction.
Where the hell are they?
Just calm down.
Finding his trail in the dark's not gonna be easy.
They'll be back.
Jack.
She say anything?
Libby?
She's still unconscious.
The bleeding's stopped.
That's good, right?
No.
It's not good.
- And there's nothing you--
- I can make her comfortable.
I don't have what I need.
Why are you looking at me?
I gave you all the damn meds two days ago--
The heroin, Sawyer.
Give me 20 minutes.
Kate's gonna go with you.
- It doesn't take two people to go--
- Kate is going with you.
What are you talking about?
Why would he need me to go with him?
Jacko here knows his heroin's in my stash with the guns.
So I can either show you where it's at, or let poor Libby suffer.
- That pretty much it, doc?
- Yeah.
That's pretty much it.
Let's go, freckles.
I'm curious about something.
Yeah, what's that?
How did Ana Lucia get your gun?
I don't know.
She must've lifted it off me.
She pickpocketed your gun?
How'd she do that?
Well, if I knew how she did it, she wouldn't be able to do it, now would she?
After you.
I thought you were taking me to your stash.
Do you have to make everything so damn difficult?
Just go in.
You kept the guns here.
All this time, right under you.
Fooled you, didn't I?
Hey, guys.
You seen Libby around?
Eko.
Yemi.
Shh.
You'll wake John.
Come.
Follow me.
Yemi.
Yemi!
Yemi.
Wake up, John.
You all right, John?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
You had a dream.
Was there a man?
A priest?
The man that you saw was my brother.
Your brother.
This is why we needed to come together.
This is how we are going to be led, and how we will know where to go next.
But I don't know where to go.
Did he tell you anything?
- No, he--
- Nothing?
Anything?
It wasn't even me.
It was-- it was you.
It-- it didn't...
He... he wanted me to follow him.
Follow him where?
Wait here.
Eko, it was just a dream.
It's not safe.
Eko!
Father, I'm afraid it's not a very good time.
You'll have to come back later.
Mrs. Malkin, I must speak to your daughter.
Yesterday at the church, you said--
I know what I said.
It's just, right this minute, it's not a very good time.
Get back in the house, Joyce.
Get her inside.
- Richard, please--
- Inside --now.
I know why you're here, friend, but you can save yourself the trouble.
What happened here was not a miracle.
The doctor that treated your daughter feels differently.
Treated her?
You mean tried to cut her open.
He's just trying to cover up his own negligence.
He tell you the whole story, how she supposedly drowned?
She fell into a mountain river.
Her body shut down, she went into hypothermia, which made her appear dead.
Then why is your wife so convinced otherwise?
'Cause she's a zealot.
All of this-- everything she's doing-- is to spite me.
Why would she spite you?
Because she knows I'm a fraud.
Because I make my living as a psychic.
You see, that's what I do.
I gather intelligence on people, and I exploit it.
Every day, I meet people looking for a miracle-- desperate to find one.
But there are none to be had.
Not in this world, anyway.
I will report back to my monsignor that there was no miracle here.
Your daughter is alive.
This is all that matters.
Eko!
Be careful.
Eko!
Eko!
I'm fine.
Hey, Eko!
What's up there?
Do you see anything?
I don't see nothing.
- It's salted.
- What?
The earth has been salted so that nothing can grow.
Why would anyone want to salt... there's nothing here.
I believe they made a circle.
A target, so that this place can be seen from up above.
They?
What place?
The place that this plane fell upon, John.
Come on.
John.
Please, will you help me with this?
Wait.
Eko.
May I?
Please.
Be my guest.
We were gonna have our first date.
Date?
Yeah.
Picnic on the beach.
I'm glad you're okay, man.
John.
Hello.
I'm Dr. Mark Wickmund, and this is the orientation film for station 5 of Dharma Initiative.
Station 5, or the pearl, is a monitoring station where the activities of participants in Dharma Initiative projects can be observed and recorded.
Not only for posterity, but for the ongoing refinement of the Initiative as a whole.
As Karen Degroot herself has written,
"careful observation is the only key to true and complete awareness."
Your tour of duty in the pearl will last three weeks.
And during this time, you and your partner will observe a psychological experiment in progress.
Your duty is to observe team members in another station on the island.
These team members are not aware that they are under surveillance, or that they are the subjects of an experiment.
Working in 8-hour shifts, you and your partner will record everything you observe in the notebooks we've provided.
What is the nature of the experiment, you might ask?
What do these subjects believe they are accomplishing, as they struggle to fulfill their tasks?
You, as the observer, don't need to know.
All you need to know is the subjects believe their job is of the utmost importance.
Remember, everything that occurs, no matter how minute or seemingly unimportant, must be recorded.
Each time a notebook is filled with the fruits of your diligent observation--
...one of the containers provided.
Then, simply place the container in the pneumatic tube, and... presto.
It will be transported directly to us.
At the end of your 8-hour shift, proceed to the Pala ferry, which will take you back to-- ...on behalf of the Degroots, Alvar Hanso, and all of us here at the Dharma Initiative, thank you.
Namaste... and good luck.
Would you like to watch that again?
No.
No, I've seen enough.
What are you doing?
I am taking this back with us.
Why?
Because they may be important.
Important?
I'm sorry, weren't you just watching the same thing I was?
Yes, John.
And I believe the work you have been doing is more important now than ever.
- What... work?
- Pushing the button.
That's not work.
That's a-- that's a-- a joke.
Rats in a maze...
with no cheese.
It is work, John.
- We are being tested.
- Tested?
The reason to do it-- push the button-- is not because we are told to do so in a film.
All right.
Well, then, what is the reason...
Mr. Eko?
We do it because we believe we are meant to.
Isn't that the reason you pushed it, John?
I was never... meant to do... anything!
Every single second of my pathetic little life, is as useless as that button!
You think it's important?
You think it's necessary?
It's nothing.
It's nothing.
It's meaningless.
And who are you to tell me that it's not?
That's flight 815, leaving from gate 23.
Thank you.
- What are you doing here?
- I had to see you.
Look, your father said I shouldn't--
I know.
He doesn't want me talking to you.
And I know you probably think I'm crazy.
But I have a message for you, and I promised to deliver it.
A message?
He says you were a good priest.
Who says that?
Yemi.
Speaking about my brother...
is not a joke.
So you should be very careful what you say next.
I saw him when I was...
between places.
He said that you would come and see me.
He said even though you were pretending, you were a good man.
Who put you up to this?
Did your father tell you to do this?
He wants you to knowt hat he will see you soon.
He said that even though you don't have faith in yourself, he has faith in you.
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want from me?
Why are you doing this to me?
Is everything... all right?
He has faith in you.
One day, you'll believe me.
This cross was worn by my brother, Yemi.
Yemi was a great man, a priest.
A man of God.
And because I betrayed him, he was shot and died.
He was placed on a plane which took off from an airstrip in Nigeria, half a world from here.
Then, the plane that I was on crashed on this island.
And somehow, here-- I found my brother again.
I found him in the same plane that took off from Nigeria, in the same plane that lies above us now, that has concealed this place.
And I took this cross from around Yemi's neck, and put it back on mine-- just as it was on the day I first took another man's life.
So let me ask you, how can you say this is meaningless?
I believe the work being done in the hatch is more important than anything.
If you will not continue to push that button, John,
I will.
Can... can I talk to her?
Sure.
Hey.
It's Hurley.
Hugo.
I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.
I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.
Libby?
Michael...
Previously on Lost:
I need you to go up through the grate and into the vents.
That button has to be pushed.
OK.
I crawled through your vents and I stood at your computer.
And you know what happened?
Nothing happened, John.
I never entered the numbers.
I never pressed the button.
If you want to do something nice for Libby, there's a beautiful beach three kilometres from here.
You could take her there.
Come on, give me the blankets.
- Blankets?
- I will handle the blankets, OK?
Take us to the guns.
Now.
Oh, that bitch.
She stole my damn gun.
Ana Lucia.
Why would she need a gun?
We caught one of them.
The Others.
He's locked up in there.
Give me the gun.
I'll kill him.
I'm sorry.
Michael?
What are you building?
- Hello, Ana.
- Well, hello, yourself.
So you gonna tell me?
What is it?
I'm building a church.
Now, why the hell would you wanna do that?
- Because I was told to.
- Told to by who?
I was just told.
I think it was in a dream.
A dream like this one?
You need to help John.
Yemi?
Hello, brother.
Yemi.
Forgive me.
I should have listened to you.
You were right.
I didn't mean to do what I did.
The work being done in this place is important, Eko.
It is more important than anything, and it is in danger.
You must help John.
He has lost his way.
You must make him take you to the question mark.
John will not want to show you, so you must make him.
Eko.
There are many distractions, brother, but you must move past them.
What is done is done.
Do you understand?
Yes, Yemi.
And, Eko?
Bring the axe.
What's the matter?
You all right, mate?
I need to find John.
- What were you thinking?
- Leave him alone.
- No, don't.
- Shut it, Sawyer.
- If Ana hadn't lifted your gun...
- Swell.
Gimpy McCrutch covers up that the Artist Formerly Known As Henry Gale tried to strangle your little amiga and it's on me when she goes vigilante.
- How about you go back to the beach?
- Hey, enough.
Both of you.
Michael.
Hey.
- He shot me.
- Who?
- He's gone.
He ran out.
- Go.
I got him.
I was sleeping and I heard gunshots.
I got up.
I came out of the bedroom and there was this guy.
He had a gun and...
All right, come on.
We gotta get you up, all right?
Let me help you.
She's dead.
Kate, we gotta get her up.
We gotta get her up to the back room, OK?
Grant us this mercy, O Lord, we beseech thee.
Amen.
She's in shock.
All right, we gotta keep pressure on this one.
Can you do anything?
Jack?
I heard you.
Just keep pressure on her, OK?
How is she?
I'm doing what I can.
- How long ago?
- What?
When did this happen?
How long ago did he leave?
I don't know.
Twenty minutes, maybe a half-hour ago.
We can pick up the trail, catch up to him.
- Man's got a head start, a gun...
- He shot three people.
One's dead.
Who's gonna take care of Libby while you're off playing Daniel Boone?
I will go.
John, you have tracking experience, yes?
Yeah.
We will find his trail together.
You find anything, you come right back here and we figure out what we're gonna do next together.
Let's go, John.
How long has it been since your last confession?
Good question.
Too many years for me to even remember.
What do you wish to ask God's forgiveness for?
- What sins have you committed?
- Well, let's see.
Well, I slept with another woman besides my wife.
- Just once or many times?
- How many is "many"?
To receive God's forgiveness you must be penitent for your sins.
I also forged ID papers for a guy pretending to be a priest.
Do you have it?
So what did you do, Padre?
Skim from the collection plate?
You know, I've got some friends in Los Angeles.
I could get you on with them.
- Doing what?
- You know, stuff.
- Morning, Father Tunde.
- Good morning, Monsignor.
Mr Caldwell has been helping me arrange my trip to the United States.
I'm sorry, but I've got some bad news.
You're gonna have to postpone your trip.
It appears we have a miracle.
My daughter, she... she drowned.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
Oh, no, you don't understand.
She came back to life.
We were out in the backblocks and Charlotte must have slipped and she went into the river and she's not much of a swimmer.
She was dead, and the next day she woke up.
Don't you understand?
It's a miracle.
A confirmation of faith.
Everyone needs to know about this.
- Where is your daughter now?
- At home with my husband.
And what does he think?
The world needs to know.
We need to tell the Vatican.
I'm sorry.
We can't just do that, Mrs Malkin.
The church needs to conduct an investigation before anyone can be told.
Father Tunde will start this process, if you'll permit him.
Mrs Malkin, would you excuse us for a moment?
Of course.
Monsignor, with all due respect, I cannot do what you have asked.
Why not?
Because I do not believe what this woman says.
Why do you think I chose you?
Are you seeing something I'm not?
Hey.
I haven't seen a single track or piece of sign since we left the hatch.
- What the hell are you following?
- Where is the question mark?
The what?
The question mark, John.
Where is it?
You know what?
You keep chasing after your own shadow.
I'm going back.
I know you do not want to show me, but you must.
- No, I don't have to show you anything.
- Then I'm sorry.
You hit me.
- Why did you...?
- Because you were being difficult.
Are you insane?
No.
Ana Lucia, your friend, was just murdered and you...
Ana wants me to help you, John.
- Help me do what?
- Find the question mark.
You don't know what you're talking about.
No.
But you know what I am talking about, John, and that is all that matters.
Here.
Here.
You wanna find your damn question mark?
Here, this is it right here.
Here, take it.
Because it's nothing.
It's a memory.
It's ten seconds of nothing.
- This is your hatch, yes?
- It's not my hatch.
If the swan is where we came from, then we go that way.
We shouldn't even be out here.
Ana Lucia would still be alive if I'd just told Jack that Henry attacked her.
Now she wants us to go here, John.
She wants us to go here, John.
Together.
- She said this in my dream.
- Oh, of course, your dream.
Tell me, John, haven't you ever followed a dream?
So, the Vatican's really interested in this one, eh?
That depends upon what I put in my report.
Why don't you just start by telling me what happened that night?
Well, I got a call.
That was around 1 a.m.
Ambos brought this girl in dead.
She'd been in the water two hours.
Have you had experience in this type of death?
Yeah, of course.
I'm an undertaker.
Well, I mean, it's my day job.
I'm perfectly qualified to be a coroner.
I mean, I did go to medical school.
And when did you find out that she was not dead?
During the autopsy.
During the autopsy?
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to believe me.
I figured you'd want to have a listen for yourself.
Decedent is a Caucasian female.
She's 161 centimetres, 51.3 kilos.
Body was prepped and washed by the very lovely Valerie McTavish.
Ian, stop it.
Commencing with the post.
This is a clear case of drowning.
- I'll begin with the thoracic...
- No!
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
- Val...
Take it.
No, please.
I don't want to ever listen to that tape again.
- You lost already?
- Your map is inexact.
- No kidding?
- These landmarks.
- Is this a river?
- No, it's a wavy line.
I didn't draw it.
I just transcribed it.
I don't even know if it is a map.
- Let's assume it is.
- What's the axe for?
I don't know yet.
You were the one that found this plane, yes?
Yeah.
It was up there.
And what made it fall?
Boone.
Boone made it fall.
Then he died.
Sacrifice that the island demanded.
Excuse me?
Nothing.
So, what's next?
We make camp, get some sleep, and wait for further instruction.
Where in the hell are they?
Just calm down.
Finding his trail in the dark is not gonna be easy.
They'll be back.
Jack.
She say anything?
Libby?
She's still unconscious.
The bleeding's stopped.
- That's good, right?
- No.
It's not good.
- And there's nothing you can...?
- I can make her comfortable.
But I don't have what I need.
I gave you all the damn meds two days ago.
The heroin, Sawyer.
- Give me twenty minutes.
- Kate's gonna go with you.
- It doesn't take two people to carry...
- Kate is going with you.
Why would he need me to go with him?
Jacko here knows his heroin's in my stash with the guns.
So I can either show you where it's at or let poor Libby suffer.
- That pretty much it, Doc?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
That's pretty much it.
Let's go, Freckles.
- I'm curious about something.
- Yeah, what's that?
How did Ana Lucia get your gun?
I don't know.
She must have lifted it off me.
She pickpocketed your gun?
How'd she do that?
Well, if I knew how she did it, she wouldn't be able to do it, would she?
After you.
I thought you were taking me to your stash.
Do you have to make everything so damn difficult?
Just go in.
You kept the guns here.
All this time, right under you.
Fooled you, didn't I?
Hey, guys.
You seen Libby around?
Eko.
Yemi.
You'll wake John.
Come.
Follow me.
Yemi.
Yemi.
Yemi.
Wake up, John.
Are you all right, John?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
You had a dream?
Was there a man?
A priest?
The man that you saw was my brother.
Your brother?
This is why we needed to come together.
This is how we are going to be led, how we will know where to go.
- I don't know where to go.
- Did he tell you anything?
- No.
He...
- Nothing?
Anything?
It wasn't even me.
It was you.
It didn't...
He wanted me to follow him.
Follow him where?
Wait here.
Eko, it was just a dream.
It's not safe.
Eko.
Father, it's not a very good time.
Come back later.
I must speak to your daughter.
- Yesterday you said...
- I know what I said.
Just right this minute it's not a very good time.
All right.
Get back in the house, Joyce.
Get her inside.
- Richard, please...
- Inside.
Now.
I know why you're here, friend, but save yourself the trouble.
What happened here was not a miracle.
The doctor that treated your daughter feels differently.
Treated her?
You mean tried to cut her open.
He's trying to cover up his own negligence.
He tell you the whole story, how she supposedly drowned?
She fell into a mountain river.
Her body shut down.
She went into hypothermia, which made her appear dead.
Then why is your wife so convinced otherwise?
Cos she's a zealot.
All of this, everything she's doing, it's to spite me.
- Why would she spite you?
- Because she knows I'm a fraud.
Because I make my living as a psychic.
You see, that's what I do.
I gather intelligence on people and I exploit it.
Every day I meet people looking for a miracle, desperate to find one.
But there are none to be had.
Not in this world, anyway.
I will report back to my monsignor that there was no miracle here.
Your daughter is alive.
This is all that matters.
Eko.
Be careful.
Eko.
Eko.
I'm fine.
Hey, Eko.
What's up there?
Do you see anything?
I don't see nothing.
- It's salted.
- What?
The earth has been salted so that nothing can grow.
Why would anyone wanna salt it?
There's nothing here.
I believe they made a circle, a target, so that this place can be seen from up above.
They?
What place?
The place that this plane fell upon, John.
Come on.
John.
Will you help me with this?
Wait.
Eko.
- May I?
- Please.
Be my guest.
We were gonna have our first date.
Date?
Yeah.
Picnic on the beach.
I'm glad you're OK, man.
John.
Hello.
I'm Dr Mark Wickmund, and this is the orientation film for Station 5 of The Dharma Initiative.
Station 5, or The Pearl, is a monitoring station where the activities of participants in Dharma initiative projects can be observed and recorded not only for posterity, but for the ongoing refinement of the Initiative as a whole.
As Karen DeGroot herself has written,
"Careful observation is the only key to true and complete awareness."
Your tour of duty in The Pearl will last three weeks and during this time you will observe a psychological experiment in progress.
Your duty is to observe team members in another station on the island.
These team members are not aware they are under surveillance or that they are subjects of an experiment.
Working in eight-hour shifts, you and your partner will record everything you observe in the notebooks we've provided.
What is the nature of the experiment, you might ask?
What do these subjects believe they are accomplishing as they struggle to fulfil their tasks?
You, as the observer, don't need to know.
AH you need to know is the subjects believe their job is of the utmost importance.
Remember, everything that occurs, no matter how minute or seemingly unimportant, must be recorded.
Each time a notebook is filled with the fruits of your diligent observation, roll it up, and place it in one of the containers provided.
Then simply place the container in the pneumatic tube and presto,
it will be transported directly to us.
At the end of your eight-hour shift, proceed to the Pala Ferry, which will take you back to the barracks to prepare for your next...
On behalf of the DeGroots, Alvar Hanso, and all of us here at The Dharma Initiative, thank you.
Namaste and good luck.
Would you like to watch that again?
No.
No, I've seen enough.
What are you doing?
I'm taking this back with us.
Why?
Because they may be important.
Important?
I'm sorry.
Weren't you just watching the same thing I was?
Yes, John, and I believe the work you have been doing is more important now than ever.
What work?
Pushing the button.
That's not work.
That's a joke.
Rats in a maze with no cheese.
It is work, John.
We are being tested.
Tested?
The reason to do it, push the button, is not because we are told to do so in a film.
Oh, well.
Well, then, what is the reason, Mr Eko?
We do it because we believe we are meant to.
Isn't that the reason you pushed it, John?
I was never meant to do anything.
Every single second of my pathetic little life is as useless as that button.
You think it's important?
You think it's necessary?
It's nothing.
It's nothing.
It's meaningless.
And who are you to tell me that it's not?
That's flight 815 leaving from gate 23.
- Thank you.
- 840 starting to board at gate 16.
- What are you doing here?
- I had to see you.
- Look, your father said...
- I know.
He doesn't want me talking to you, and I know you probably think I'm crazy, but I have a message for you and I promised to deliver it.
A message?
- He says you were a good priest.
- Who says that?
Yemi.
Speaking about my brother is not a joke, so you should be very careful what you say next.
I saw him when I was between places.
He said that you would come and see me.
He said even though you were pretending, you're a good man.
Who put you up to this?
Did your father tell you to do this?
He will see you soon.
He said that even though you don't have faith in yourself, he has faith in you.
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want?
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Is everything... all right?
He has faith in you.
One day you'll believe me.
Oceanic Airlines ﬂight 815 is now boarding for Los Angeles.
This cross was worn by my brother Yemi.
Yemi was a great man, a priest, a man of God, and because I betrayed him, he was shot and died.
He was placed on a plane which took off from an airstrip in Nigeria, half a world from here.
Then the plane that I was on crashed on this island.
And somehow, here, I found my brother again.
I found him in the same plane that took off from Nigeria, in the same plane that lies above us now that has concealed this place.
And I took this cross from around Yemi's neck and put it back on mine.
Just as it was on the day I first took another man's life.
So let me ask you, how can you say this is meaningless?
I believe the work being done in the hatch is more important than anything.
If you will not continue to push the button, John...
I will.
Can...
Can I talk to her?
Sure.
Hey.
It's Hurley.
Hugo.
I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.
I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.
Libby?
- Michael.
- Michael.
He's OK.
He made it, Libby.
It's OK.
It's all right.
Previously on Lost:
I need you to go up through the grate and into the vents.
That button has to be pushed.

I'll kill him.
I'm sorry.
Michael?
What are you building?
- Hello, Ana.
- Well, hello, yourself.
So you gonna tell me?
What is it?
I'm building a church.
Now, why the hell would you wanna do that?
- Because I was told to.
- Told to by who?
I was just told.
I think it was in a dream.
A dream like this one?
You need to help John.
Yemi?
Hello, brother.
Yemi.
Forgive me.
I should have listened to you.
You were right.
I didn't mean to do what I did.
The work being done in this place is important, Eko.
It is more important than anything, and it is in danger.
You must help John.
He has lost his way.
You must make him take you to the question mark.
John will not want to show you, so you must make him.
Eko.
There are many distractions, brother, but you must move past them.
What is done is done.
Do you understand?
Yes, Yemi.
And, Eko?
Bring the axe.
What's the matter?
You all right, mate?
I need to find John.
- What were you thinking?
- Leave him alone.
- No, don't.
- Shut it, Sawyer.
- If Ana hadn't lifted your gun...

Well, I mean, it's my day job.
I'm perfectly qualified to be a coroner.
I mean, I did go to medical school.
And when did you find out that she was not dead?
During the autopsy.
During the autopsy?
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to believe me.
I figured you'd want to have a listen for yourself.
Decedent is a Caucasian female.
She's 161 centimetres, 51.3 kilos.
Body was prepped and washed by the very lovely Valerie Mc Tavish.
Lan, stop it.
Commencing with the post.
This is a clear case of drowning.
- I'll begin with the thoracic...
- No!
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
- Val...
Take it.
No, please.
I don't want to ever listen to that tape again.
- You lost already?
- Your map is inexact.
- No kidding?
- These landmarks.
- Is this a river?
- No, it's a wavy line.
I didn't draw it.
I just transcribed it.
I don't even know if it is a map.
- Let's assume it is.
- What's the axe for?
I don't know yet.
You were the one that found this plane, yes?
Yeah.
It was up there.
And what made it fall?
Boone.
Boone made it fall.
Then he died.
Sacrifice that the island demanded.
Excuse me?
Nothing.
So, what's next?
We make camp, get some sleep, and wait for further instruction.
Where in the hell are they?
Just calm down.
Finding his trail in the dark is not gonna be easy.
They'll be back.
Jack.
She say anything?
Libby?
She's still unconscious.
The bleeding's stopped.
- That's good, right?
- No.
It's not good.
- And there's nothing you can?
- I can make her comfortable.
But I don't have what I need.
I gave you all the damn meds two days ago.
The heroin, Sawyer.
- Give me twenty minutes.
- Kate's gonna go with you.
- It doesn't take two people to carry...
- Kate is going with you.
Why would he need me to go with him?
Jacko here knows his heroin's in my stash with the guns.
So I can either show you where it's at or let poor Libby suffer.
- That pretty much it, Doc?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
That's pretty much it.
Let's go, Freckles.
- I'm curious about something.
- Yeah, what's that?
How did Ana Lucia get your gun?
I don't know.
She must have lifted it off me.
She pickpocketed your gun?
How'd she do that?
Well, if I knew how she did it, she wouldn't be able to do it, would she?
After you.
I thought you were taking me to your stash.
Do you have to make everything so damn difficult?
Just go in.
You kept the guns here.
All this time, right under you.
Fooled you, didn't I?
Hey, guys.
You seen Libby around?
Eko.
Yemi.
You'll wake John.
Come.
Follow me.
Yemi.
Yemi.
Yemi.
Wake up, John.
Are you all right, John?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
You had a dream?
Was there a man?
A priest?
The man that you saw was my brother.
Your brother?
This is why we needed to come together.
This is how we are going to be led, how we will know where to go.
- I don't know where to go.
- Did he tell you anything?
- No.
He...
- Nothing?
Anything?
It wasn't even me.
It was you.
It didn't...
He wanted me to follow him.
Follow him where?
Wait here.
Eko, it was just a dream.
It's not safe.
Eko.
Father, it's not a very good time.
Come back later.
I must speak to your daughter.
- Yesterday you said...
- I know what I said.
Just right this minute it's not a very good time.
All right.
Get back in the house, Joyce.
Get her inside.
- Richard, please...
- Inside.
Now.
I know why you're here, friend, but save yourself the trouble.
What happened here was not a miracle.
The doctor that treated your daughter feels differently.
Treated her?
You mean tried to cut her open.
He's trying to cover up his own negligence.
He tell you the whole story, how she supposedly drowned?
She fell into a mountain river.
Her body shut down.
She went into hypothermia, which made her appear dead.
Then why is your wife so convinced otherwise?
Cos she's a zealot.
All of this, everything she's doing, it's to spite me.
- Why would she spite you?
- Because she knows I'm a fraud.
Because I make my living as a psychic.
You see, that's what I do.
I gather intelligence on people and I exploit it.
Every day I meet people looking for a miracle, desperate to find one.
But there are none to be had.
Not in this world, anyway.
I will report back to my monsignor that there was no miracle here.
Your daughter is alive.
This is all that matters.
Eko.
Be careful.
Eko.
Eko.
I'm fine.
Hey, Eko.
What's up there?
Do you see anything?
I don't see nothing.
- It's salted.
- What?
The earth has been salted so that nothing can grow.
Why would anyone wanna salt it?
There's nothing here.
I believe they made a circle, a target, so that this place can be seen from up above.
They?
What place?
The place that this plane fell upon, John.
Come on.
John.
Will you help me with this?
Wait.
Eko.
- May I?
- Please.
Be my guest.
We were gonna have our first date.
Date?
Yeah.
Picnic on the beach.
I'm glad you're OK, man.
John.
Hello.
I'm Dr Mark Wickmund, and this is the orientation film for Station 5 of The Dharma Initiative.
Station 5, or The Pearl, is a monitoring station where the activities of participants in Dharma Initiative projects can be observed and recorded not only for posterity, but for the ongoing refinement of the Initiative as a whole.
As Karen DeGroot herself has written,
"Careful observation is the only key to true and complete awareness. "
Your tour of duty in The Pearl will last three weeks and during this time you will observe a psychological experiment in progress.
Your duty is to observe team members in another station on the island.
These team members are not aware they are under surveillance or that they are subjects of an experiment.
Working in eight-hour shifts, you and your partner will record everything you observe in the notebooks we've provided.
What is the nature of the experiment, you might ask?
What do these subjects believe they are accomplishing as they struggle to fulfil their tasks?
You, as the observer, don't need to know.
All you need to know is the subjects believe theirjob is of the utmost importance.
Remember, everything that occurs, no matter how minute or seemingly unimportant, must be recorded.
Each time a notebook is filled with the fruits of your diligent observation, roll it up, and place it in one of the containers provided.
Then simply place the container in the pneumatic tube and presto,
it will be transported directly to us.
At the end of your eight-hour shift, proceed to the Pala Ferry, which will take you back to the barracks to prepare for your next...
On behalf of the DeGroots, Alvar Hanso, and all of us here at The Dharma Initiative, thank you.
Namaste and good luck.
Would you like to watch that again?
No.
No, I've seen enough.
What are you doing?
I'm taking this back with us.
Why?
Because they may be important.
Important?
I'm sorry.
Weren't you just watching the same thing I was?
Yes, John, and I believe the work you have been doing is more important now than ever.
What work?
Pushing the button.
That's not work.
That's a joke.
Rats in a maze with no cheese.
It is work, John.
We are being tested.
Tested?
The reason to do it, push the button, is not because we are told to do so in a film.
Oh, well.
Well, then, what is the reason, Mr Eko?
We do it because we believe we are meant to.
Isn't that the reason you pushed it, John?
I was never meant to do anything.
Every single second of my pathetic little life is as useless as that button.
You think it's important?
You think it's necessary?
It's nothing.
It's nothing.
It's meaningless.
And who are you to tell me that it's not?
That's flight 815 leaving from gate 23.
- Thank you.
- 840 starting to board at gate 16.
- What are you doing here?
- I had to see you.
- Look, your father said...
- I know.
He doesn't want me talking to you, and I know you probably think I'm crazy, but I have a message for you and I promised to deliver it.
A message?
- He says you were a good priest.
- Who says that?
Yemi.
Speaking about my brother is not a joke, so you should be very careful what you say next.
I saw him when I was between places.
He said that you would come and see me.
He said even though you were pretending, you're a good man.
Who put you up to this?
Did your father tell you to do this?
He will see you soon.
He said that even though you don't have faith in yourself, he has faith in you.
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want?
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Is everything... all right?
He has faith in you.
One day you'll believe me.
Oceanic Airlines flight 815 is now boarding for Los Angeles.
This cross was worn by my brother Yemi.
Yemi was a great man, a priest, a man of God, and because I betrayed him, he was shot and died.
He was placed on a plane which took off from an airstrip in Nigeria, half a world from here.
Then the plane that I was on crashed on this island.
And somehow, here, I found my brother again.
I found him in the same plane that took off from Nigeria, in the same plane that lies above us now that has concealed this place.
And I took this cross from around Yemi's neck and put it back on mine.
Just as it was on the day I first took another man's life.
So let me ask you, how can you say this is meaningless?
I believe the work being done in the hatch is more important than anything.
If you will not continue to push the button, John...
I will.
Can...
Can I talk to her?
Sure.
Hey.
It's Hurley.
Hugo.
I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.
I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.
Libby?
- Michael.
- Michael.
He's OK.
He made it, Libby.
It's OK.
It's all right.
Previously on "Lost":
My leg!
Aah!
I need you to go up through the grate and into the vents.
- That button has to be pushed.
- Okay.
I crawled through your vents, and I stood at your computer, and you know what happened?
Nothing happened, John.
I never entered the numbers, I never pressed the button.
If you want to do something nice for Libby, there's a beautiful beach 3 kilometers from here.
You could take her there.
Come on, give me the blankets.
Blankets?
I will handle the blankets, okay?
Take us to the guns.
Now.
Ah, that bitch.
Stole my damn gun.
Ana Lucia.
Why would she need a gun?
We caught one of them-- the others.
He's locked up in there.
Give me the gun.
I'll kill him.
I'm sorry.
Michael?
What are you building?
Hello, Ana.
Well, hello, yourself.
So are you gonna tell me?
- What is it?
- I'm building a church.
Now why the hell would you want to do that?
Because I was told to.
Told to by who?
I was just told.
I think it was in a dream.
A dream like this one?
You need to help John.
Yemi?
- Hello, brother.
- Oh, Yemi.
Forgive me.
I should have listened to you.
You were right.
- I did not mean to do it--
- Shh, shh, shh.
The work being done in this place is important, Eko.
It is more important than anything, and it is in danger.
You must help John.
He has lost his way.
You must make him take you to the question mark.
John will not want to show you, so you must make him.
Eko...
There are many distractions, brother.
But you must move past them.
What is done, is done.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, yemi.
And, Eko... bring the ax.
What's the matter?
You all right, mate?
I need to find John.
- What were you thinking, John?
- Jack, leave him alone.
No, Jack, don't leave him alone.
Shut it, Sawyer.
If Ana hadn't lifted your gun--
Oh, ain't that swell-- gimpy McCrutch over here covers up that the artist formerly known as Henry Gale tried to strangle your little amiga, and suddenly it's on me when she goes vigilante.
How about you go back to the beach?
Hey, enough, both of you.
Michael, hey!
He shot me.
- Who?
- He's gone!
He ran out.
Go, I got him.
Jack...
I was sleeping, and I heard gunshots.
I got up.
I came out of the bedroom.
And this-- there was this guy-- he had a gun, and...
Come on.
We've got to get you up, all right?
Let me help you.
She's dead.
Okay, we've got to get her up.
We've got to get her out to the back room, okay?
Grant us this mercy, O Lord, we beseech thee.
Amen.
She's in shock.
We've got to keep pressure on this.
Can you do anything?
- Jack--
- I heard you.
Just keep pressure on her, okay?
- How is she?
- I'm doing what I can.
How long ago?
What?
When did this happen?
How long ago did he leave?
I don't know, uh...
20 minutes, maybe a half-hour ago.
We can pick up the trail, catch up to him.
Man's got a head start, a gun, he ain't afraid of using--
He shot three of our people.
One of them's dead--
Who's gonna take care of Libby while you're off playing Daniel Boone?
I will go.
John, you have tracking experience, yes?
Yeah.
We will find his trail together.
If you find anything-- anything, you come right back here, and we figure out what we're gonna do next together.
Let's go, John.
How long has it been since your last confession?
Good question.
Too many years for me to even remember.
What do you wish to ask God's forgiveness for?
What sins have you committed?
Let's see.
Well, I slept with another woman besides my wife.
Just once, or many times?
How many is many?
To receive god's forgiveness, you must be penitent for your sins.
I also forged I.D. papers for a guy pretending to be a priest.
Do you have it?
So what'd you do, padre?
Skim from the collection plate?
You know I've got some friends in Los Angeles.
I could get you on with them.
- Doing what?
- You know... stuff.
Good morning, father Tunde.
Good morning, monsignor.
This is Mr. Caldwell.
He has been helping me arrange my trip to the United States.
I'm sorry, father, but I've got some bad news.
You're going to have to postpone your trip.
It appears we have a miracle.
My daughter, she...
she drowned.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
Oh, no, you don't understand.
She came back to life.
We were out in the back blocks, and Charlotte must have slipped, and she went into the river, and...
she's not much of a swimmer.
She was dead.
And the next day, she woke up.
Don't you understand?
It's a miracle.
A confirmation of faith.
Everyone needs to know about this.
People need--
- Where is your daughter now?
- At home, with my husband.
And what does he think?
The world needs to know about this.
We need to tell the Vatican, we need to tell the world--
I'm sorry, we can't just do that, Mrs. Malkin.
The church needs to conduct an investigation before anyone can be told.
Father Tunde will start this process, if you will permit him.
Mrs. Malkin, would you excuse us for a moment, please?
Of course.
Monsignor, with all due respect, I cannot do what you have asked.
Why not?
Because I do not believe what this woman says.
Why do you think I chose you?
Are you seeing something I'm not?
Hey!
I haven't seen a single track or a piece of sign since we left the hatch.
What the hell are you following?
Where is the question mark?
The what?
The question mark, John.
Where is it?
You know what?
You keep chasing after your own shadow.
I'm going back.
I know you do not want to show it... but you must.
No, I don't have to show you anything.
Then I'm sorry.
You hit me.
Why did you...
Because you were being difficult.
Are you insane?
No.
Ana Lucia, your friend, was just murdered, and you--
Ana wants me to help you, John.
- Help me do what?
- Find the question mark.
You don't even know what you're talking about, do you?
No.
But you know what I am talking about, John.
And that is all that matters.
Here.
Here, you wanna find your damn question mark?
Here it is-- here, this is it right here.
Here, take it, take it, because it's nothing.
It's a memory.
It's ten seconds of nothing.
- This is your hatch, yes?
- It's not my hatch.
If the swan is where we came from, then we go that way.
We shouldn't even be out here.
Ana Lucia would still be alive... if I'd just told Jack that Henry attacked her.
And now she wants us to go here, John.
She wants us to go here, John, together.
She said this in my dream.
Oh, of course, your dream.
Tell me, John.
Haven't you ever followed a dream?
So the vatican's really interested in this one, eh?
That depends upon what I put in my report.
Why don't you just start by telling me what happened that night?
Well, I got a call out around 1:00 A.M.
Ambrose brought this girl in, dead.
She'd been in the water two hours.
Have you had much experience in this type of death?
Yeah, of course, I'm an undertaker.
Well, it's just my day job.
I mean, I'm perfectly qualified to be a coroner.
I mean, I did-- I did go to medical school.
And when did you find out that she was not dead?
During the autopsy.
During the autopsy?
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to believe me.
I figured you'd want to have a listen for yourself.
Decedent is a caucasian female, 161 centimeters, 51.3 kilos.

Ian...
Commencing with the post.
This is a clear case of drowning.
I'll begin with the thoracic-abdominal incision--
Take it.
No, please...
I don't want to ever listen to that tape again.
- Lost already?
- Your map is inexact.
No kidding.
These landmarks...
Is this a river?
No, it's a wavy line.

That's good, right?
No.
It's not good.
- And there's nothing you--
- I can make her comfortable.
I don't have what I need.
Why are you looking at me?
I gave you all the damn meds two days ago--
The heroin, Sawyer.
Give me 20 minutes.
Kate's gonna go with you.
- It doesn't take two people to go--
- Kate is going with you.
What are you talking about?
Why would he need me to go with him?
Jacko here knows his heroin's in my stash with the guns.
So I can either show you where it's at, or let poor Libby suffer.

You had a dream.

The man that you saw was my brother.
Your brother.
This is why we needed to come together.

Father, I'm afraid it's not a very good time.
You'll have to come back later.
Mrs. Malkin, I must speak to your daughter.
Yesterday at the church, you said--
I know what I said.
It's just, right this minute, it's not a very good time.
Get back in the house, Joyce.
Get her inside.
- Richard, please--
- Inside --now.
I know why you're here, friend, but you can save yourself the trouble.

Namaste... and good luck.
Would you like to watch that again?
No.
No, I've seen enough.
What are you doing?
I am taking this back with us.
Why?
Because they may be important.

I'm sorry, weren't you just watching the same thing I was?
Yes, John.
And I believe the work you have been doing is more important now than ever.
- What... work?
- Pushing the button.
That's not work.
That's a-- that's a-- a joke.
Rats in a maze...
with no cheese.
It is work, John.
- We are being tested.
- Tested?
The reason to do it-- push the button-- is not because we are told to do so in a film.
All right.
Well, then, what is the reason...
Mr. Eko?
We do it because we believe we are meant to.
Isn't that the reason you pushed it, John?
I was never... meant to do... anything!

Thank you.
- What are you doing here?
- I had to see you.
Look, your father said I shouldn't--
I know.
He doesn't want me talking to you.
And I know you probably think I'm crazy.
But I have a message for you, and I promised to deliver it.
A message?
He says you were a good priest.
Who says that?
Yemi.

So you should be very careful what you say next.

He said that you would come and see me.
He said even though you were pretending, you were a good man.
Who put you up to this?
Did your father tell you to do this?
He wants you to knowt hat he will see you soon.
He said that even though you don't have faith in yourself, he has faith in you.
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want from me?
Why are you doing this to me?
Is everything... all right?
He has faith in you.
One day, you'll believe me.
This cross was worn by my brother, Yemi.
Yemi was a great man, a priest.
A man of God.
And because I betrayed him, he was shot and died.
He was placed on a plane which took off from an airstrip in Nigeria, half a world from here.

And I took this cross from around Yemi's neck, and put it back on mine-- just as it was on the day I first took another man's life.
So let me ask you, how can you say this is meaningless?
I believe the work being done in the hatch is more important than anything.
If you will not continue to push that button, John,
I will.
Can... can I talk to her?
Sure.
Hey.
It's Hurley.
Hugo.
I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.
I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.
Libby?
Michael...
Michael... he's okay.
He made it, Libby, he's okay.
It's all right.
Previously on Lost:
I need you to go up through the grate and into the vents.
That button has to be pushed.
OK.
I crawled through your vents and I stood at your computer.
And you know what happened?
Nothing happened, John.
I never entered the numbers.
I never pressed the button.
If you want to do something nice for Libby, there's a beautiful beach three kilometres from here.
You could take her there.
Come on, give me the blankets.
- Blankets?
- l will handle the blankets, OK?
Take us to the guns.
Now.
Oh, that bitch.
She stole my damn gun.
Ana Lucia.
Why would she need a gun?
We caught one of them.
The Others.
He's locked up in there.
Give me the gun. I'll kill him.
I'm sorry.
Michael?
What are you building?
- Hello, Ana.
- Well, hello, yourself.
So you gonna tell me?
What is it?
I'm building a church.
Now, why the hell would you wanna do that?
- Because I was told to.
- Told to by who?
I was just told.
I think it was in a dream.
A dream like this one?
You need to help John.
Yemi?
Hello, brother.
Yemi.
Forgive me. I should have listened to you.
You were right.
I didn't mean to do what I did.
The work being done in this place is important, Eko.
It is more important than anything, and it is in danger.
You must help John.
He has lost his way.
You must make him take you to the question mark.
John will not want to show you, so you must make him.
Eko.
There are many distractions, brother, but you must move past them.
What is done is done.
Do you understand?
Yes, Yemi.
And, Eko?
Bring the axe.
What's the matter?
You all right, mate?
I need to find John.
- What were you thinking?
- Leave him alone.
- No, don't.
- Shut it, Sawyer.
- lf Ana hadn't lifted your gun...
- Swell.
Gimpy McCrutch covers up that the Artist Formerly Known As Henry Gale tried to strangle your little amiga and it's on me when she goes vigilante.
- How about you go back to the beach?
- Hey, enough.
Both of you.
Michael.
Hey.
- He shot me.
- Who?
- He's gone.
He ran out.
- Go. I got him.
I was sleeping and I heard gunshots.
I got up.
I came out of the bedroom and there was this guy.
He had a gun and...
All right, come on.
We gotta get you up, all right?
Let me help you.
She's dead.
Kate, we gotta get her up.
We gotta get her up to the back room, OK?
Grant us this mercy, O Lord, we beseech thee.
Amen.
She's in shock.
All right, we gotta keep pressure on this one.
Can you do anything?
Jack?
I heard you.
Just keep pressure on her, OK?
How is she?
I'm doing what I can.
- How long ago?
- What?
When did this happen?
How long ago did he leave?
I don't know.
Twenty minutes, maybe a half-hour ago.
We can pick up the trail, catch up to him.
- Man's got a head start, a gun...
- He shot three people.
One's dead.
Who's gonna take care of Libby while you're off playing Daniel Boone?
I will go.
John, you have tracking experience, yes?
Yeah.
We will find his trail together.
You find anything, you come right back here and we figure out what we're gonna do next together.
Let's go, John.
How long has it been since your last confession?
Good question.
Too many years for me to even remember.
What do you wish to ask God's forgiveness for?
- What sins have you committed?
- Well, let's see.
Well, I slept with another woman besides my wife.
- Just once or many times?
- How many is "many"?
To receive God's forgiveness you must be penitent for your sins.
I also forged id papers for a guy pretending to be a priest.
Do you have it?
So what did you do, Padre?
Skim from the collection plate?
You know, I've got some friends in Los Angeles. I could get you on with them.
- Doing what?
- You know, stuff.
- Morning, Father Tunde.
- Good morning, Monsignor.
Mr Caldwell has been helping me arrange my trip to the United States.
I'm sorry, but I've got some bad news.
You're gonna have to postpone your trip.
It appears we have a miracle.
My daughter, she... she drowned.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
Oh, no, you don't understand.
She came back to life.
We were out in the backblocks and Charlotte must have slipped and she went into the river and she's not much of a swimmer.
She was dead, and the next day she woke up.
Don't you understand?
It's a miracle.
A confirmation of faith.
Everyone needs to know about this.
- Where is your daughter now?
- At home with my husband.
And what does he think?
The world needs to know.
We need to tell the Vatican.
I'm sorry.
We can't just do that, Mrs Malkin.
The church needs to conduct an investigation before anyone can be told.
Father Tunde will start this process, if you'll permit him.
Mrs Malkin, would you excuse us for a moment?
Of course.
Monsignor, with all due respect, I cannot do what you have asked.
Why not?
Because I do not believe what this woman says.
Why do you think I chose you?
Are you seeing something I'm not?
Hey.
I haven't seen a single track or piece of sign since we left the hatch.
- What the hell are you following?
- Where is the question mark?
The what?
The question mark, John.
Where is it?
You know what?
You keep chasing after your own shadow.
I'm going back.
I know you do not want to show me, but you must.
- No, I don't have to show you anything.
- Then I'm sorry.
You hit me.
- Why did you...?
- Because you were being difficult.
Are you insane?
No.
Ana Lucia, your friend, was just murdered and you...
Ana wants me to help you, John.
- Help me do what?
- Find the question mark.
You don't know what you're talking about.
No.
But you know what I am talking about, John, and that is all that matters.
Here.
Here.
You wanna find your damn question mark?
Here, this is it right here.
Here, take it.
Because it's nothing. lt's a memory.
It's ten seconds of nothing.
- This is your hatch, yes?
- lt's not my hatch.
If the swan is where we came from, then we go that way.
We shouldn't even be out here.
Ana Lucia would still be alive if I'd just told Jack that Henry attacked her.
Now she wants us to go here, John.
She wants us to go here, John.
Together.
- She said this in my dream.
- Oh, of course, your dream.
Tell me, John, haven't you ever followed a dream?
So, the Vatican's really interested in this one, eh?
That depends upon what I put in my report.
Why don't you just start by telling me what happened that night?
Well, I got a call.
That was around 1 a.m.
Ambos brought this girl in dead.
She'd been in the water two hours.
Have you had experience in this type of death?
Yeah, of course. I'm an undertaker.
Well, I mean, it's my day job.
I'm perfectly qualified to be a coroner.
I mean, I did go to medical school.
And when did you find out that she was not dead?
During the autopsy.
During the autopsy?
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to believe me.
I figured you'd want to have a listen for yourself.
Decedent is a Caucasian female.
She's 16 1 centimetres, 5 1.3 kilos.
Body was prepped and washed by the very lovely Valerie Mc Tavish.
Ian, stop it.
Commencing with the post.
This is a clear case of drowning.
- I'll begin with the thoracic...
- No!
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
- Val...
Take it.
No, please. I don't want to ever listen to that tape again.
- You lost already?
- Your map is inexact.
- No kidding?
- These landmarks.
- ls this a river?
- No, it's a wavy line.
I didn't draw it. I just transcribed it.
I don't even know if it is a map.
- Let's assume it is.
- What's the axe for?
I don't know yet.
You were the one that found this plane, yes?
Yeah.
It was up there.
And what made it fall?
Boone.
Boone made it fall.
Then he died.
Sacrifice that the island demanded.
Excuse me?
Nothing.
So, what's next?
We make camp, get some sleep, and wait for further instruction.
Where in the hell are they?
Just calm down.
Finding his trail in the dark is not gonna be easy.
They'll be back.
Jack.
She say anything?
Libby?
She's still unconscious.
The bleeding's stopped.
- That's good, right?
- No.
It's not good.
- And there's nothing you can...?
- l can make her comfortable.
But I don't have what I need.
I gave you all the damn meds two days ago.
The heroin, Sawyer.
- Give me twenty minutes.
- Kate's gonna go with you.
- lt doesn't take two people to carry...
- Kate is going with you.
Why would he need me to go with him?
Jacko here knows his heroin's in my stash with the guns.
So I can either show you where it's at or let poor Libby suffer.
- That pretty much it, Doc?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
That's pretty much it.
Let's go, Freckles.
- l'm curious about something.
- Yeah, what's that?
How did Ana Lucia get your gun?
I don't know.
She must have lifted it off me.
She pickpocketed your gun?
How'd she do that?
Well, if I knew how she did it, she wouldn't be able to do it, would she?
After you.
I thought you were taking me to your stash.
Do you have to make everything so damn difficult?
Just go in.
You kept the guns here.
All this time, right under you.
Fooled you, didn't I?
Hey, guys.
You seen Libby around?
Eko.
Yemi.
You'll wake John.
Come.
Follow me.
Yemi.
Yemi.
Yemi.
Wake up, John.
Are you all right, John?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
You had a dream?
Was there a man?
A priest?
The man that you saw was my brother.
Your brother?
This is why we needed to come together.
This is how we are going to be led, how we will know where to go.
- l don't know where to go.
- Did he tell you anything?
- No.
He...
- Nothing?
Anything?
It wasn't even me. lt was you.
It didn't...
He wanted me to follow him.
Follow him where?
Wait here.
Eko, it was just a dream. lt's not safe.
Eko.
Father, it's not a very good time.
Come back later.
I must speak to your daughter.
- Yesterday you said...
- l know what I said.
Just right this minute it's not a very good time.
All right.
Get back in the house, Joyce.
Get her inside.
- Richard, please...
- Inside.
Now.
I know why you're here, friend, but save yourself the trouble.
What happened here was not a miracle.
The doctor that treated your daughter feels differently.
Treated her?
You mean tried to cut her open.
He's trying to cover up his own negligence.
He tell you the whole story, how she supposedly drowned?
She fell into a mountain river.
Her body shut down.
She went into hypothermia, which made her appear dead.
Then why is your wife so convinced otherwise?
Cos she's a zealot.
All of this, everything she's doing, it's to spite me.
- Why would she spite you?
- Because she knows I'm a fraud.
Because I make my living as a psychic.
You see, that's what I do. I gather intelligence on people and I exploit it.
Every day I meet people looking for a miracle, desperate to find one.
But there are none to be had.
Not in this world, anyway.
I will report back to my monsignor that there was no miracle here.
Your daughter is alive.
This is all that matters.
Eko.
Be careful.
Eko.
Eko.
I'm fine.
Hey, Eko.
What's up there?
Do you see anything?
I don't see nothing.
- lt's salted.
- What?
The earth has been salted so that nothing can grow.
Why would anyone wanna salt it?
There's nothing here.
I believe they made a circle, a target, so that this place can be seen from up above.
They?
What place?
The place that this plane fell upon, John.
Come on.
John.
Will you help me with this?
Wait.
Eko.
- May I?
- Please.
Be my guest.
We were gonna have our first date.
Date?
Yeah.
Picnic on the beach.
I'm glad you're OK, man.
John.
Hello.
I'm Dr Mark Wickmund, and this is the orientation film for Station 5 of The Dharma Initiative.
Station 5, or The Pearl, is a monitoring station where the activities of participants in Dharma Initiative projects can be observed and recorded not only for posterity, but for the ongoing refinement of the Initiative as a whole.
As Karen DeGroot herself has written,
"Careful observation is the only key to true and complete awareness. "
Your tour of duty in The Pearl will last three weeks and during this time you will observe a psychological experiment in progress.
Your duty is to observe team members in another station on the island.
These team members are not aware they are under surveillance or that they are subjects of an experiment.
Working in eight-hour shifts, you and your partner will record everything you observe in the notebooks we've provided.
What is the nature of the experiment, you might ask?
What do these subjects believe they are accomplishing as they struggle to fulfil their tasks?
You, as the observer, don't need to know.
All you need to know is the subjects believe theirjob is of the utmost importance.
Remember, everything that occurs, no matter how minute or seemingly unimportant, must be recorded.
Each time a notebook is filled with the fruits of your diligent observation, roll it up, and place it in one of the containers provided.
Then simply place the container in the pneumatic tube and presto,
it will be transported directly to us.
At the end of your eight-hour shift, proceed to the Pala Ferry, which will take you back to the barracks to prepare for your next...
On behalf of the DeGroots, Alvar Hanso, and all of us here at The Dharma Initiative, thank you.
Namaste and good luck.
Would you like to watch that again?
No.
No, I've seen enough.
What are you doing?
I'm taking this back with us.
Why?
Because they may be important.
Important?
I'm sorry.
Weren't you just watching the same thing I was?
Yes, John, and I believe the work you have been doing is more important now than ever.
What work?
Pushing the button.
That's not work.
That's a joke.
Rats in a maze with no cheese.
It is work, John.
We are being tested.
Tested?
The reason to do it, push the button, is not because we are told to do so in a film.
Oh, well.
Well, then, what is the reason, Mr Eko?
We do it because we believe we are meant to.
Isn't that the reason you pushed it, John?
I was never meant to do anything.
Every single second of my pathetic little life is as useless as that button.
You think it's important?
You think it's necessary?
It's nothing. lt's nothing.
It's meaningless.
And who are you to tell me that it's not?
That's flight 81 5 leaving from gate 23.
- Thank you.
- 840 starting to board at gate 16.
- What are you doing here?
- l had to see you.
- Look, your father said...
- l know.
He doesn't want me talking to you, and I know you probably think I'm crazy, but I have a message for you and I promised to deliver it.
A message?
- He says you were a good priest.
- Who says that?
Yemi.
Speaking about my brother is not a joke, so you should be very careful what you say next.
I saw him when I was between places.
He said that you would come and see me.
He said even though you were pretending, you're a good man.
Who put you up to this?
Did your father tell you to do this?
He will see you soon.
He said that even though you don't have faith in yourself, he has faith in you.
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want?
- Why are you doing this to me?
- ls everything... all right?
He has faith in you.
One day you'll believe me.
Oceanic Airlines flight 8 1 5 is now boarding for Los Angeles.
This cross was worn by my brother Yemi.
Yemi was a great man, a priest, a man of God, and because I betrayed him, he was shot and died.
He was placed on a plane which took off from an airstrip in Nigeria, half a world from here.
Then the plane that I was on crashed on this island.
And somehow, here, I found my brother again.
I found him in the same plane that took off from Nigeria, in the same plane that lies above us now that has concealed this place.
And I took this cross from around Yemi's neck and put it back on mine.
Just as it was on the day I first took another man's life.
So let me ask you, how can you say this is meaningless?
I believe the work being done in the hatch is more important than anything.
If you will not continue to push the button, John,... I will.
Can...
Can I talk to her?
Sure.
Hey.
It's Hurley.
Hugo.
I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.
I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.
Libby?
- Michael.
- Michael.
He's OK.
He made it, Libby.
It's OK. lt's all right.
Previously on Lost:
I need you to go up through the grate and into the vents.
That button has to be pushed.
OK.
I crawled through your vents and I stood at your computer.

He's locked up in there.
Give me the gun. I'll kill him.
I'm sorry.
Michael?
What are you building?
- Hello, Ana.
- Well, hello, yourself.
So you gonna tell me?
What is it?
I'm building a church.
Now, why the hell would you wanna do that?
- Because I was told to.
- Told to by who?
I was just told.
I think it was in a dream.
A dream like this one?
You need to help John.
Yemi?
Hello, brother.
Yemi.
Forgive me. I should have listened to you.
You were right.
I didn't mean to do what I did.
The work being done in this place is important, Eko.
It is more important than anything, and it is in danger.
You must help John.
He has lost his way.
You must make him take you to the question mark.
John will not want to show you, so you must make him.
Eko.
There are many distractions, brother, but you must move past them.
What is done is done.
Do you understand?
Yes, Yemi.
And, Eko?
Bring the axe.
What's the matter?
You all right, mate?
I need to find John.
- What were you thinking?
- Leave him alone.
- No, don't.
- Shut it, Sawyer.
- lf Ana hadn't lifted your gun...
- Swell.

We gotta get her up to the back room, OK?
Grant us this mercy, O Lord, we beseech thee.
Amen.
She's in shock.
All right, we gotta keep pressure on this one.
Can you do anything?
Jack?
I heard you.
Just keep pressure on her, OK?
How is she?
I'm doing what I can.
- How long ago?
- What?
When did this happen?
How long ago did he leave?
I don't know.
Twenty minutes, maybe a half-hour ago.
We can pick up the trail, catch up to him.
- Man's got a head start, a gun...
- He shot three people.
One's dead.

Let's go, Freckles.
- l'm curious about something.
- Yeah, what's that?
How did Ana Lucia get your gun?
I don't know.
She must have lifted it off me.
She pickpocketed your gun?
How'd she do that?
Well, if I knew how she did it, she wouldn't be able to do it, would she?
After you.
I thought you were taking me to your stash.
Do you have to make everything so damn difficult?
Just go in.
You kept the guns here.
All this time, right under you.
Fooled you, didn't I?
Hey, guys.
You seen Libby around?
Eko.
Yemi.
You'll wake John.
Come.
Follow me.
Yemi.
Yemi.
Yemi.
Wake up, John.
Are you all right, John?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
You had a dream?
Was there a man?
A priest?
The man that you saw was my brother.
Your brother?
This is why we needed to come together.
This is how we are going to be led, how we will know where to go.
- l don't know where to go.
- Did he tell you anything?
- No.
He...
- Nothing?
Anything?
It wasn't even me. lt was you.
It didn't...
He wanted me to follow him.
Follow him where?
Wait here.
Eko, it was just a dream. lt's not safe.
Eko.
Father, it's not a very good time.
Come back later.
I must speak to your daughter.
- Yesterday you said...
- l know what I said.
Just right this minute it's not a very good time.
All right.
Get back in the house, Joyce.
Get her inside.
- Richard, please...
- Inside.
Now.
I know why you're here, friend, but save yourself the trouble.
What happened here was not a miracle.
The doctor that treated your daughter feels differently.
Treated her?
You mean tried to cut her open.
He's trying to cover up his own negligence.
He tell you the whole story, how she supposedly drowned?
She fell into a mountain river.
Her body shut down.
She went into hypothermia, which made her appear dead.
Then why is your wife so convinced otherwise?
Cos she's a zealot.
All of this, everything she's doing, it's to spite me.
- Why would she spite you?
- Because she knows I'm a fraud.
Because I make my living as a psychic.
You see, that's what I do. I gather intelligence on people and I exploit it.
Every day I meet people looking for a miracle, desperate to find one.
But there are none to be had.
Not in this world, anyway.
I will report back to my monsignor that there was no miracle here.
Your daughter is alive.
This is all that matters.
Eko.
Be careful.
Eko.
Eko.
I'm fine.
Hey, Eko.
What's up there?
Do you see anything?
I don't see nothing.
- lt's salted.
- What?
The earth has been salted so that nothing can grow.
Why would anyone wanna salt it?
There's nothing here.
I believe they made a circle, a target, so that this place can be seen from up above.
They?
What place?
The place that this plane fell upon, John.
Come on.
John.
Will you help me with this?
Wait.
Eko.
- May I?
- Please.
Be my guest.
We were gonna have our first date.
Date?
Yeah.
Picnic on the beach.
I'm glad you're OK, man.
John.
Hello.
I'm Dr Mark Wickmund, and this is the orientation film for Station 5 of The Dharma Initiative.
Station 5, or The Pearl, is a monitoring station where the activities of participants in Dharma Initiative projects can be observed and recorded not only for posterity, but for the ongoing refinement of the Initiative as a whole.
As Karen DeGroot herself has written,
"Careful observation is the only key to true and complete awareness. "
Your tour of duty in The Pearl will last three weeks and during this time you will observe a psychological experiment in progress.
Your duty is to observe team members in another station on the island.
These team members are not aware they are under surveillance or that they are subjects of an experiment.
Working in eight-hour shifts, you and your partner will record everything you observe in the notebooks we've provided.
What is the nature of the experiment, you might ask?
What do these subjects believe they are accomplishing as they struggle to fulfil their tasks?
You, as the observer, don't need to know.
All you need to know is the subjects believe theirjob is of the utmost importance.
Remember, everything that occurs, no matter how minute or seemingly unimportant, must be recorded.
Each time a notebook is filled with the fruits of your diligent observation, roll it up, and place it in one of the containers provided.
Then simply place the container in the pneumatic tube and presto,
it will be transported directly to us.
At the end of your eight-hour shift, proceed to the Pala Ferry, which will take you back to the barracks to prepare for your next...
On behalf of the DeGroots, Alvar Hanso, and all of us here at The Dharma Initiative, thank you.
Namaste and good luck.
Would you like to watch that again?
No.
No, I've seen enough.
What are you doing?
I'm taking this back with us.
Why?
Because they may be important.
Important?
I'm sorry.
Weren't you just watching the same thing I was?
Yes, John, and I believe the work you have been doing is more important now than ever.
What work?
Pushing the button.
That's not work.
That's a joke.
Rats in a maze with no cheese.
It is work, John.
We are being tested.
Tested?
The reason to do it, push the button, is not because we are told to do so in a film.
Oh, well.
Well, then, what is the reason, Mr Eko?
We do it because we believe we are meant to.
Isn't that the reason you pushed it, John?
I was never meant to do anything.
Every single second of my pathetic little life is as useless as that button.
You think it's important?
You think it's necessary?
It's nothing. lt's nothing.
It's meaningless.
And who are you to tell me that it's not?
That's flight 81 5 leaving from gate 23.
- Thank you.
- 840 starting to board at gate 16.
- What are you doing here?
- l had to see you.
- Look, your father said...
- l know.
He doesn't want me talking to you, and I know you probably think I'm crazy, but I have a message for you and I promised to deliver it.
A message?
- He says you were a good priest.
- Who says that?
Yemi.
Speaking about my brother is not a joke, so you should be very careful what you say next.
I saw him when I was between places.
He said that you would come and see me.
He said even though you were pretending, you're a good man.
Who put you up to this?
Did your father tell you to do this?
He will see you soon.
He said that even though you don't have faith in yourself, he has faith in you.
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want?
- Why are you doing this to me?
- ls everything... all right?
He has faith in you.
One day you'll believe me.
Oceanic Airlines flight 8 1 5 is now boarding for Los Angeles.
This cross was worn by my brother Yemi.
Yemi was a great man, a priest, a man of God, and because I betrayed him, he was shot and died.
He was placed on a plane which took off from an airstrip in Nigeria, half a world from here.
Then the plane that I was on crashed on this island.
And somehow, here, I found my brother again.
I found him in the same plane that took off from Nigeria, in the same plane that lies above us now that has concealed this place.
And I took this cross from around Yemi's neck and put it back on mine.
Just as it was on the day I first took another man's life.
So let me ask you, how can you say this is meaningless?
I believe the work being done in the hatch is more important than anything.
If you will not continue to push the button, John,... I will.
Can...
Can I talk to her?
Sure.
Hey.
It's Hurley.
Hugo.
I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.
I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.
Libby?
- Michael.
- Michael.
He's OK.
He made it, Libby.
It's OK. lt's all right.
Previously on Lost:
I need you to go up through the grate and into the vents.
That button has to be pushed.
OK.
I crawled through your vents and I stood at your computer.
And you know what happened?
Nothing happened, John.
I never entered the numbers.
I never pressed the button.
If you want to do something nice for Libby, there's a beautiful beach three kilometres from here.
You could take her there.
Come on, give me the blankets.
- Blankets?
- I will handle the blankets, OK?
Take us to the guns.
Now.
Oh, that bitch.
She stole my damn gun.
Ana Lucia.
Why would she need a gun?
We caught one of them.
The Others.
He's locked up in there.
Give me the gun.
I'll kill him.
I'm sorry.
Michael?
What are you building?
- Hello, Ana.
- Well, hello, yourself.
So you gonna tell me?
What is it?
I'm building a church.
Now, why the hell would you wanna do that?
- Because I was told to.
- Told to by who?
I was just told.
I think it was in a dream.
A dream like this one?
You need to help John.
Yemi?
Hello, brother.
Yemi.
Forgive me.
I should have listened to you.
You were right.
I didn't mean to do what I did.
The work being done in this place is important, Eko.
It is more important than anything, and it is in danger.
You must help John.
He has lost his way.
You must make him take you to the question mark.
John will not want to show you, so you must make him.
Eko.
There are many distractions, brother, but you must move past them.
What is done is done.
Do you understand?
Yes, Yemi.
And, Eko?
Bring the axe.
What's the matter?
You all right, mate?
I need to find John.
- What were you thinking?
- Leave him alone.
- No, don't.
- Shut it, Sawyer.
- If Ana hadn't lifted your gun...
- Swell.
Gimpy McCrutch covers up that the Artist Formerly Known As Henry Gale tried to strangle your little amiga and it's on me when she goes vigilante.
- How about you go back to the beach?
- Hey, enough.
Both of you.
Michael.
Hey.
- He shot me.
- Who?
- He's gone.
He ran out.
- Go.
I got him.
I was sleeping and I heard gunshots.
I got up.
I came out of the bedroom and there was this guy.
He had a gun and...
All right, come on.
We gotta get you up, all right?
Let me help you.
She's dead.
Kate, we gotta get her up.
We gotta get her up to the back room, OK?
Grant us this mercy, O Lord, we beseech thee.
Amen.
She's in shock.
All right, we gotta keep pressure on this one.
Can you do anything?
Jack?
I heard you.
Just keep pressure on her, OK?
How is she?
I'm doing what I can.
- How long ago?
- What?
When did this happen?
How long ago did he leave?
I don't know.
Twenty minutes, maybe a half-hour ago.
We can pick up the trail, catch up to him.
- Man's got a head start, a gun...
- He shot three people.
One's dead.
Who's gonna take care of Libby while you're off playing Daniel Boone?
I will go.
John, you have tracking experience, yes?
Yeah.
We will find his trail together.
You find anything, you come right back here and we figure out what we're gonna do next together.
Let's go, John.
How long has it been since your last confession?
Good question.
Too many years for me to even remember.
What do you wish to ask God's forgiveness for?
- What sins have you committed?
- Well, let's see.
Well, I slept with another woman besides my wife.
- Just once or many times?
- How many is "many"?
To receive God's forgiveness you must be penitent for your sins.
I also forged ID papers for a guy pretending to be a priest.
Do you have it?
So what did you do, Padre?
Skim from the collection plate?
You know, I've got some friends in Los Angeles.
I could get you on with them.
- Doing what?
- You know, stuff.
- Morning, Father Tunde.
- Good morning, Monsignor.
Mr Caldwell has been helping me arrange my trip to the United States.
I'm sorry, but I've got some bad news.
You're gonna have to postpone your trip.
It appears we have a miracle.
My daughter, she... she drowned.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
Oh, no, you don't understand.
She came back to life.
We were out in the backblocks and Charlotte must have slipped and she went into the river and she's not much of a swimmer.
She was dead, and the next day she woke up.
Don't you understand?
It's a miracle.
A confirmation of faith.
Everyone needs to know about this.
- Where is your daughter now?
- At home with my husband.
And what does he think?
The world needs to know.
We need to tell the Vatican.
I'm sorry.
We can't just do that, Mrs Malkin.
The church needs to conduct an investigation before anyone can be told.
Father Tunde will start this process, if you'll permit him.
Mrs Malkin, would you excuse us for a moment?
Of course.
Monsignor, with all due respect, I cannot do what you have asked.
Why not?
Because I do not believe what this woman says.
Why do you think I chose you?
Are you seeing something I'm not?
Hey.
I haven't seen a single track or piece of sign since we left the hatch.
- What the hell are you following?
- Where is the question mark?
The what?
The question mark, John.
Where is it?
You know what?
You keep chasing after your own shadow.
I'm going back.
I know you do not want to show me, but you must.
- No, I don't have to show you anything.
- Then I'm sorry.
You hit me.
- Why did you?
- Because you were being difficult.
Are you insane?
No.
Ana Lucia, your friend, was just murdered and you...
Ana wants me to help you, John.
- Help me do what?
- Find the question mark.
You don't know what you're talking about.
No.
But you know what I am talking about, John, and that is all that matters.
Here.
Here.
You wanna find your damn question mark?
Here, this is it right here.
Here, take it.
Because it's nothing.
It's a memory.
It's ten seconds of nothing.
- This is your hatch, yes?
- It's not my hatch.
If the swan is where we came from, then we go that way.
We shouldn't even be out here.
Ana Lucia would still be alive if I'd just told Jack that Henry attacked her.
Now she wants us to go here, John.
She wants us to go here, John.
Together.
- She said this in my dream.
- Oh, of course, your dream.
Tell me, John, haven't you ever followed a dream?
So, the Vatican's really interested in this one, eh?
That depends upon what I put in my report.
Why don't you just start by telling me what happened that night?
Well, I got a call.
That was around 1 a.m.
Ambos brought this girl in dead.
She'd been in the water two hours.
Have you had experience in this type of death?
Yeah, of course.
I'm an undertaker.
Well, I mean, it's my day job.
I'm perfectly qualified to be a coroner.
I mean, I did go to medical school.
And when did you find out that she was not dead?
During the autopsy.
During the autopsy?
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to believe me.
I figured you'd want to have a listen for yourself.
Decedent is a Caucasian female.
She's 161 centimetres, 51.3 kilos.
Body was prepped and washed by the very lovely Valerie Mc Tavish.
Lan, stop it.
Commencing with the post.
This is a clear case of drowning.
- I'll begin with the thoracic...
- No!
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
- Val...
Take it.
No, please.
I don't want to ever listen to that tape again.
- You lost already?
- Your map is inexact.
- No kidding?
- These landmarks.
- Is this a river?
- No, it's a wavy line.
I didn't draw it.
I just transcribed it.
I don't even know if it is a map.
- Let's assume it is.
- What's the axe for?
I don't know yet.
You were the one that found this plane, yes?
Yeah.
It was up there.
And what made it fall?
Boone.
Boone made it fall.
Then he died.
Sacrifice that the island demanded.
Excuse me?
Nothing.
So, what's next?
We make camp, get some sleep, and wait for further instruction.
Where in the hell are they?
Just calm down.
Finding his trail in the dark is not gonna be easy.
They'll be back.
Jack.
She say anything?
Libby?
She's still unconscious.
The bleeding's stopped.
- That's good, right?
- No.
It's not good.
- And there's nothing you can?
- I can make her comfortable.
But I don't have what I need.
I gave you all the damn meds two days ago.
The heroin, Sawyer.
- Give me twenty minutes.
- Kate's gonna go with you.
- It doesn't take two people to carry...
- Kate is going with you.
Why would he need me to go with him?
Jacko here knows his heroin's in my stash with the guns.
So I can either show you where it's at or let poor Libby suffer.
- That pretty much it, Doc?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
That's pretty much it.
Let's go, Freckles.
- I'm curious about something.
- Yeah, what's that?
How did Ana Lucia get your gun?
I don't know.
She must have lifted it off me.
She pickpocketed your gun?
How'd she do that?
Well, if I knew how she did it, she wouldn't be able to do it, would she?
After you.
I thought you were taking me to your stash.
Do you have to make everything so damn difficult?
Just go in.
You kept the guns here.
All this time, right under you.
Fooled you, didn't I?
Hey, guys.
You seen Libby around?
Eko.
Yemi.
You'll wake John.
Come.
Follow me.
Yemi.
Yemi.
Yemi.
Wake up, John.
Are you all right, John?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
You had a dream?
Was there a man?
A priest?
The man that you saw was my brother.
Your brother?
This is why we needed to come together.
This is how we are going to be led, how we will know where to go.
- I don't know where to go.
- Did he tell you anything?
- No.
He...
- Nothing?
Anything?
It wasn't even me.
It was you.
It didn't...
He wanted me to follow him.
Follow him where?
Wait here.
Eko, it was just a dream.
It's not safe.
Eko.
Father, it's not a very good time.
Come back later.
I must speak to your daughter.
- Yesterday you said...
- I know what I said.
Just right this minute it's not a very good time.
All right.
Get back in the house, Joyce.
Get her inside.
- Richard, please...
- Inside.
Now.
I know why you're here, friend, but save yourself the trouble.
What happened here was not a miracle.
The doctor that treated your daughter feels differently.
Treated her?
You mean tried to cut her open.
He's trying to cover up his own negligence.

But there are none to be had.
Not in this world, anyway.
I will report back to my monsignor that there was no miracle here.
Your daughter is alive.
This is all that matters.
Eko.
Be careful.
Eko.
Eko.
I'm fine.
Hey, Eko.
What's up there?
Do you see anything?
I don't see nothing.
- It's salted.
- What?
The earth has been salted so that nothing can grow.
Why would anyone wanna salt it?
There's nothing here.
I believe they made a circle, a target, so that this place can be seen from up above.

What place?
The place that this plane fell upon, John.
Come on.
John.
Will you help me with this?
Wait.
Eko.
- May I?
- Please.
Be my guest.
We were gonna have our first date.
Date?
Yeah.
Picnic on the beach.
I'm glad you're OK, man.
John.

On behalf of the DeGroots, Alvar Hanso, and all of us here at The Dharma Initiative, thank you.
Namaste and good luck.
Would you like to watch that again?
No.
No, I've seen enough.
What are you doing?
I'm taking this back with us.
Why?
Because they may be important.
Important?
I'm sorry.
Weren't you just watching the same thing I was?
Yes, John, and I believe the work you have been doing is more important now than ever.
What work?
Pushing the button.
That's not work.
That's a joke.
Rats in a maze with no cheese.
It is work, John.
We are being tested.
Tested?
The reason to do it, push the button, is not because we are told to do so in a film.
Oh, well.
Well, then, what is the reason, Mr Eko?
We do it because we believe we are meant to.
Isn't that the reason you pushed it, John?
I was never meant to do anything.
Every single second of my pathetic little life is as useless as that button.
You think it's important?
You think it's necessary?
It's nothing.
It's nothing.
It's meaningless.
And who are you to tell me that it's not?
That's flight 815 leaving from gate 23.
- Thank you.
- 840 starting to board at gate 16.
- What are you doing here?
- I had to see you.
- Look, your father said...
- I know.
He doesn't want me talking to you, and I know you probably think I'm crazy, but I have a message for you and I promised to deliver it.
A message?
- He says you were a good priest.
- Who says that?
Yemi.
Speaking about my brother is not a joke, so you should be very careful what you say next.
I saw him when I was between places.
He said that you would come and see me.
He said even though you were pretending, you're a good man.
Who put you up to this?
Did your father tell you to do this?
He will see you soon.
He said that even though you don't have faith in yourself, he has faith in you.
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want?
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Is everything... all right?
He has faith in you.
One day you'll believe me.
Oceanic Airlines flight 815 is now boarding for Los Angeles.
This cross was worn by my brother Yemi.
Yemi was a great man, a priest, a man of God, and because I betrayed him, he was shot and died.
He was placed on a plane which took off from an airstrip in Nigeria, half a world from here.
Then the plane that I was on crashed on this island.
And somehow, here, I found my brother again.
I found him in the same plane that took off from Nigeria, in the same plane that lies above us now that has concealed this place.
And I took this cross from around Yemi's neck and put it back on mine.
Just as it was on the day I first took another man's life.
So let me ask you, how can you say this is meaningless?
I believe the work being done in the hatch is more important than anything.
If you will not continue to push the button, John...
I will.
Can...
Can I talk to her?
Sure.
Hey.
It's Hurley.
Hugo.
I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.
I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.
Libby?
- Michael.
- Michael.
He's OK.
He made it, Libby.
It's OK.
It's all right.
Previously on Lost:
I need you to go up through the grate and into the vents.

The Others.
He's locked up in there.
Give me the gun.
I'll kill him.
I'm sorry.
Michael?
What are you building?
- Hello, Ana.
- Well, hello, yourself.
So you gonna tell me?
What is it?
I'm building a church.
Now, why the hell would you wanna do that?
- Because I was told to.
- Told to by who?
I was just told.
I think it was in a dream.
A dream like this one?
You need to help John.
Yemi?
Hello, brother.
Yemi.
Forgive me.
I should have listened to you.
You were right.
I didn't mean to do what I did.
The work being done in this place is important, Eko.
It is more important than anything, and it is in danger.
You must help John.
He has lost his way.
You must make him take you to the question mark.
John will not want to show you, so you must make him.
Eko.
There are many distractions, brother, but you must move past them.
What is done is done.
Do you understand?
Yes, Yemi.
And, Eko?
Bring the ax.
What's the matter?
You all right, mate?
I need to find John.
- What were you thinking?
- Leave him alone.
- No, don't.
- Shut it, Sawyer.
- If Ana hadn't lifted your gun...

- He shot me.
- Who?
- He's gone.
He ran out.
- Go.
I got him.
I was sleeping and I heard gunshots.
I got up.
I came out of the bedroom and there was this guy.
He had a gun and...
All right, come on.
We gotta get you up, all right?
Let me help you.
She's dead.
Kate, we gotta get her up.
We gotta get her up to the back room, OK?
Grant us this mercy, O Lord, we beseech thee.
Amen.
She's in shock.
All right, we gotta keep pressure on this one.
Can you do anything?
Jack?
I heard you.
Just keep pressure on her, OK?
How is she?
I'm doing what I can.
- How long ago?
- What?
When did this happen?
How long ago did he leave?
I don't know.
Twenty minutes, maybe a half-hour ago.
We can pick up the trail, catch up to him.
- Man's got a head start, a gun...
- He shot three people.
One's dead.
Who's gonna take care of Libby while you're off playing Daniel Boone?
I will go.
John, you have tracking experience, yes?
Yeah.
We will find his trail together.
You find anything, you come right back here and we figure out what we're gonna do next together.
Let's go, John.
How long has it been since your last confession?
Good question.
Too many years for me to even remember.
What do you wish to ask God's forgiveness for?
- What sins have you committed?
- Well, let's see.
Well, I slept with another woman besides my wife.
- Just once or many times?
- How many is "many"?
To receive God's forgiveness you must be penitent for your sins.
I also forged ID papers for a guy pretending to be a priest.
Do you have it?
So what did you do, Padre?
Skim from the collection plate?
You know, I've got some friends in Los Angeles.
I could get you on with them.
- Doing what?
- You know, stuff.
- Morning, Father Tunde.
- Good morning, Monsignor.
Mr. Caldwell has been helping me arrange my trip to the United States.
I'm sorry, but I've got some bad news.
You're gonna have to postpone your trip.
It appears we have a miracle.
My daughter, she... she drowned.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
Oh, no, you don't understand.
She came back to life.
We were out in the backblocks and Charlotte must have slipped and she went into the river and she's not much of a swimmer.
She was dead, and the next day she woke up.
Don't you understand?
It's a miracle.
A confirmation of faith.
Everyone needs to know about this.
- Where is your daughter now?
- At home with my husband.
And what does he think?
The world needs to know.
We need to tell the Vatican.
I'm sorry.
We can't just do that, Mrs. Malkin.
The church needs to conduct an investigation before anyone can be told.
Father Tunde will start this process, if you'll permit him.
Mrs. Malkin, would you excuse us for a moment?
Of course.
Monsignor, with all due respect, I cannot do what you have asked.
Why not?
Because I do not believe what this woman says.
Why do you think I chose you?
Are you seeing something I'm not?
Hey.
I haven't seen a single track or piece of sign since we left the hatch.
- What the hell are you following?
- Where is the question mark?
The what?
The question mark, John.
Where is it?
You know what?
You keep chasing after your own shadow.
I'm going back.
I know you do not want to show me, but you must.
- No, I don't have to show you anything.
- Then I'm sorry.
You hit me.
- Why did you...?
- Because you were being difficult.
Are you insane?
No.
Ana Lucia, your friend, was just murdered and you...
Ana wants me to help you, John.
- Help me do what?
- Find the question mark.
You don't know what you're talking about.
No.
But you know what I am talking about, John, and that is all that matters.
Here.
Here.
You wanna find your damn question mark?
Here, this is it right here.
Here, take it.
Because it's nothing.
It's a memory.
It's ten seconds of nothing.
- This is your hatch, yes?
- It's not my hatch.
If the swan is where we came from, then we go that way.
We shouldn't even be out here.
Ana Lucia would still be alive if I'd just told Jack that Henry attacked her.
Now she wants us to go here, John.
She wants us to go here, John.
Together.
- She said this in my dream.
- Oh, of course, your dream.
Tell me, John, haven't you ever followed a dream?
So, the Vatican's really interested in this one, eh?
That depends upon what I put in my report.
Why don't you just start by telling me what happened that night?
Well, I got a call.
That was around 1 a.m.
Ambos brought this girl in dead.
She'd been in the water two hours.
Have you had experience in this type of death?
Yeah, of course.
I'm an undertaker.
Well, I mean, it's my day job.
I'm perfectly qualified to be a coroner.
I mean, I did go to medical school.
And when did you find out that she was not dead?
During the autopsy.
During the autopsy?
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to believe me.
I figured you'd want to have a listen for yourself.
Decedent is a Caucasian female.
She's 161 centimeters, 51.3 kilos.
Body was prepped and washed by the very lovely Valerie McTavish.
Ian, stop it.
Commencing with the post.
This is a clear case of drowning.
- I'll begin with the thoracic...
- No!
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
- Val...
Take it.
No, please.
I don't want to ever listen to that tape again.
- You lost already?
- Your map is inexact.
- No kidding?
- These landmarks.
- Is this a river?
- No, it's a wavy line.
I didn't draw it.
I just transcribed it.
I don't even know if it is a map.
- Let's assume it is.
- What's the ax for?
I don't know yet.
You were the one that found this plane, yes?
Yeah.
It was up there.
And what made it fall?
Boone.
Boone made it fall.
Then he died.
Sacrifice that the island demanded.
Excuse me?
Nothing.
So, what's next?
We make camp, get some sleep, and wait for further instruction.
Where in the hell are they?
Just calm down.
Finding his trail in the dark is not gonna be easy.
They'll be back.
Jack.
She say anything?
Libby?
She's still unconscious.
The bleeding's stopped.
- That's good, right?
- No.
It's not good.
- And there's nothing you can...?
- I can make her comfortable.
But I don't have what I need.
I gave you all the damn meds two days ago.
The heroin, Sawyer.
- Give me twenty minutes.
- Kate's gonna go with you.
- It doesn't take two people to carry...
- Kate is going with you.
Why would he need me to go with him?
Jacko here knows his heroin's in my stash with the guns.
So I can either show you where it's at or let poor Libby suffer.
- That pretty much it, Doc?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
That's pretty much it.
Let's go, Freckles.
- I'm curious about something.
- Yeah, what's that?
How did Ana Lucia get your gun?
I don't know.
She must have lifted it off me.
She pickpocketed your gun?
How'd she do that?
Well, if I knew how she did it, she wouldn't be able to do it, would she?
After you.
I thought you were taking me to your stash.
Do you have to make everything so damn difficult?
Just go in.
You kept the guns here.
All this time, right under you.
Fooled you, didn't I?
Hey, guys.
You seen Libby around?
Eko.
Yemi.
You'll wake John.
Come.
Follow me.
Yemi.
Wake up, John.
Are you all right, John?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
You had a dream?
Was there a man?
A priest?
The man that you saw was my brother.
Your brother?
This is why we needed to come together.
This is how we are going to be led, how we will know where to go.
- I don't know where to go.
- Did he tell you anything?
- No.
He...
- Nothing?
Anything?
It wasn't even me.
It was you.
It didn't...
He wanted me to follow him.
Follow him where?
Wait here.
Eko, it was just a dream.
It's not safe.
Eko.
Father, it's not a very good time.
Come back later.
I must speak to your daughter.
- Yesterday you said...
- I know what I said.
Just right this minute it's not a very good time.
All right.
Get back in the house, Joyce.
Get her inside.
- Richard, please...
- Inside.
Now.
I know why you're here, friend, but save yourself the trouble.
What happened here was not a miracle.
The doctor that treated your daughter feels differently.
Treated her?
You mean tried to cut her open.
He's trying to cover up his own negligence.
He tell you the whole story, how she supposedly drowned?
She fell into a mountain river.
Her body shut down.
She went into hypothermia, which made her appear dead.
Then why is your wife so convinced otherwise?
'Cause she's a zealot.
All of this, everything she's doing, it's to spite me.
- Why would she spite you?
- Because she knows I'm a fraud.
Because I make my living as a psychic.
You see, that's what I do.
I gather intelligence on people and I exploit it.
Every day I meet people looking for a miracle, desperate to find one.
But there are none to be had.
Not in this world, anyway.
I will report back to my monsignor that there was no miracle here.
Your daughter is alive.
This is all that matters.
Eko.
Be careful.
Eko.
I'm fine.
Hey, Eko.
What's up there?
Do you see anything?
I don't see nothing.
- It's salted.
- What?
The earth has been salted so that nothing can grow.
Why would anyone wanna salt it?
There's nothing here.
I believe they made a circle, a target, so that this place can be seen from up above.
They?
What place?
The place that this plane fell upon, John.
Come on.
John.
Will you help me with this?
Wait.
Eko.
- May I?
- Please.
Be my guest.
We were gonna have our first date.
Date?
Yeah.
Picnic on the beach.
I'm glad you're OK, man.
John.
Hello.
I'm Dr. Mark Wickmund, and this is the orientation film for Station 5 of The Dharma Initiative.
Station 5, or The Pearl, is a monitoring station where the activities of participants in Dharma Initiative projects can be observed and recorded not only for posterity, but for the ongoing refinement of the Initiative as a whole.
As Karen DeGroot herself has written,
"Careful observation is the only key to true and complete awareness."
Your tour of duty in The Pearl will last three weeks and during this time you will observe a psychological experiment in progress.
Your duty is to observe team members in another station on the island.
These team members are not aware they are under surveillance or that they are subjects of an experiment.
Working in eight-hour shifts, you and your partner will record everything you observe in the notebooks we've provided.
What is the nature of the experiment, you might ask?
What do these subjects believe they are accomplishing as they struggle to fulfill their tasks?
You, as the observer, don't need to know.
All you need to know is the subjects believe their job is of the utmost importance.
Remember, everything that occurs, no matter how minute or seemingly unimportant, must be recorded.
Each time a notebook is filled with the fruits of your diligent observation, roll it up, and place it in one of the containers provided.
Then simply place the container in the pneumatic tube and presto,
it will be transported directly to us.
At the end of your eight-hour shift, proceed to the Pala Ferry, which will take you back to the barracks to prepare for your next...
On behalf of the DeGroots, Alvar Hanso, and all of us here at The Dharma Initiative, thank you.
Namaste and good luck.
Would you like to watch that again?
No.
No, I've seen enough.
What are you doing?
I'm taking this back with us.
Why?
Because they may be important.
Important?
I'm sorry.
Weren't you just watching the same thing I was?
Yes, John, and I believe the work you have been doing is more important now than ever.
What work?
Pushing the button.
That's not work.
That's a joke.
Rats in a maze with no cheese.
It is work, John.
We are being tested.
Tested?
The reason to do it, push the button, is not because we are told to do so in a film.
Oh, well.
Well, then, what is the reason, Mr. Eko?
We do it because we believe we are meant to.
Isn't that the reason you pushed it, John?
I was never meant to do anything.
Every single second of my pathetic little life is as useless as that button.
You think it's important?
You think it's necessary?
It's nothing.
It's nothing.
It's meaningless.
And who are you to tell me that it's not?
That's flight 815 leaving from gate 23.
- Thank you.
- 840 starting to board at gate 16.
- What are you doing here?
- I had to see you.
- Look, your father said...
- I know.
He doesn't want me talking to you, and I know you probably think I'm crazy, but I have a message for you and I promised to deliver it.
A message?
- He says you were a good priest.
- Who says that?
Yemi.
Speaking about my brother is not a joke, so you should be very careful what you say next.
I saw him when I was between places.
He said that you would come and see me.
He said even though you were pretending, you're a good man.
Who put you up to this?
Did your father tell you to do this?
He will see you soon.
He said that even though you don't have faith in yourself, he has faith in you.
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want?
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Is everything... all right?
He has faith in you.
One day you'll believe me.
Oceanic Airlines flight 815 is now boarding for Los Angeles.
This cross was worn by my brother Yemi.
Yemi was a great man, a priest, a man of God, and because I betrayed him, he was shot and died.
He was placed on a plane which took off from an airstrip in Nigeria, half a world from here.
Then the plane that I was on crashed on this island.
And somehow, here, I found my brother again.
I found him in the same plane that took off from Nigeria, in the same plane that lies above us now that has concealed this place.
And I took this cross from around Yemi's neck and put it back on mine.
Just as it was on the day I first took another man's life.
So let me ask you, how can you say this is meaningless?
I believe the work being done in the hatch is more important than anything.
If you will not continue to push the button, John...
I will.
Can...
Can I talk to her?
Sure.
Hey.
It's Hurley.
Hugo.
I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.
Libby?
- Michael.
- Michael.
He's OK.
He made it, Libby.
It's OK.
It's all right.
Previously on "Lost":
My leg!
Aah!
I need you to go up through the grate and into the vents.
- That button has to be pushed.
- Okay.
I crawled through your vents, and I stood at your computer, and you know what happened?
Nothing happened, John.
I never entered the numbers, I never pressed the button.
If you want to do something nice for Libby, there's a beautiful beach 3 kilometers from here.
You could take her there.
Come on, give me the blankets.
Blankets?
I will handle the blankets, okay?
Take us to the guns.
Now.
Ah, that bitch.
Stole my damn gun.
Ana Lucia.
Why would she need a gun?
We caught one of them-- the others.
He's locked up in there.
Give me the gun.
I'll kill him.
I'm sorry.
Michael?
What are you building?
Hello, Ana.
Well, hello, yourself.
So are you gonna tell me?
- What is it?
- I'm building a church.
Now why the hell would you want to do that?
Because I was told to.
Told to by who?
I was just told.
I think it was in a dream.
A dream like this one?
You need to help John.
Yemi?
- Hello, brother.
- Oh, Yemi.
Forgive me.
I should have listened to you.
You were right.
- I did not mean to do it--
- Shh, shh, shh.
The work being done in this place is important, Eko.
It is more important than anything, and it is in danger.
You must help John.
He has lost his way.
You must make him take you to the question mark.
John will not want to show you, so you must make him.
Eko...
There are many distractions, brother.
But you must move past them.
What is done, is done.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, yemi.
And, Eko... bring the ax.
What's the matter?
You all right, mate?
I need to find John.
- What were you thinking, John?
- Jack, leave him alone.
No, Jack, don't leave him alone.
Shut it, Sawyer.
If Ana hadn't lifted your gun--
Oh, ain't that swell-- gimpy McCrutch over here covers up that the artist formerly known as Henry Gale tried to strangle your little amiga, and suddenly it's on me when she goes vigilante.
How about you go back to the beach?
Hey, enough, both of you.
Michael, hey!
He shot me.
- Who?
- He's gone!
He ran out.
Go, I got him.
Jack...
I was sleeping, and I heard gunshots.
I got up.
I came out of the bedroom.
And this-- there was this guy-- he had a gun, and...
Come on.
We've got to get you up, all right?
Let me help you.
She's dead.
Okay, we've got to get her up.
We've got to get her out to the back room, okay?
Grant us this mercy, O Lord, we beseech thee.
Amen.
She's in shock.
We've got to keep pressure on this.
Can you do anything?
- Jack--
- I heard you.
Just keep pressure on her, okay?
- How is she?
- I'm doing what I can.
How long ago?
What?
When did this happen?
How long ago did he leave?
I don't know, uh...
20 minutes, maybe a half-hour ago.
We can pick up the trail, catch up to him.
Man's got a head start, a gun, he ain't afraid of using--
He shot three of our people.
One of them's dead--
Who's gonna take care of Libby while you're off playing Daniel Boone?
I will go.
John, you have tracking experience, yes?
Yeah.
We will find his trail together.
If you find anything-- anything, you come right back here, and we figure out what we're gonna do next together.
Let's go, John.
How long has it been since your last confession?
Good question.
Too many years for me to even remember.
What do you wish to ask God's forgiveness for?
What sins have you committed?
Let's see.
Well, I slept with another woman besides my wife.
Just once, or many times?
How many is many?
To receive god's forgiveness, you must be penitent for your sins.
I also forged I.D. papers for a guy pretending to be a priest.
Do you have it?
So what'd you do, padre?
Skim from the collection plate?
You know I've got some friends in Los Angeles.
I could get you on with them.
- Doing what?
- You know... stuff.
Good morning, father Tunde.
Good morning, monsignor.
This is Mr. Caldwell.
He has been helping me arrange my trip to the United States.
I'm sorry, father, but I've got some bad news.
You're going to have to postpone your trip.
It appears we have a miracle.
My daughter, she...
she drowned.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
Oh, no, you don't understand.
She came back to life.
We were out in the back blocks, and Charlotte must have slipped, and she went into the river, and...
she's not much of a swimmer.
She was dead.
And the next day, she woke up.
Don't you understand?
It's a miracle.
A confirmation of faith.
Everyone needs to know about this.
People need--

Haven't you ever followed a dream?
So the vatican's really interested in this one, eh?
That depends upon what I put in my report.
Why don't you just start by telling me what happened that night?
Well, I got a call out around 1:00 A.M.

Take it.

Father, I'm afraid it's not a very good time.
You'll have to come back later.
Mrs. Malkin, I must speak to your daughter.
Yesterday at the church, you said--
I know what I said.
It's just, right this minute, it's not a very good time.
Get back in the house, Joyce.

Not in this world, anyway.
I will report back to my monsignor that there was no miracle here.
Your daughter is alive.
This is all that matters.
Eko!
Be careful.
Eko!
Eko!
I'm fine.
Hey, Eko!
What's up there?
Do you see anything?
I don't see nothing.
- It's salted.
- What?
The earth has been salted so that nothing can grow.
Why would anyone want to salt... there's nothing here.
I believe they made a circle.
A target, so that this place can be seen from up above.
They?
What place?
The place that this plane fell upon, John.
Come on.
John.
Please, will you help me with this?
Wait.
Eko.
May I?
Please.
Be my guest.
We were gonna have our first date.
Date?
Yeah.
Picnic on the beach.
I'm glad you're okay, man.
John.
Hello.
I'm Dr. Mark Wickmund, and this is the orientation film for station 5 of Dharma Initiative.
Station 5, or the pearl, is a monitoring station where the activities of participants in Dharma Initiative projects can be observed and recorded.
Not only for posterity, but for the ongoing refinement of the Initiative as a whole.
As Karen Degroot herself has written,
"careful observation is the only key to true and complete awareness."
Your tour of duty in the pearl will last three weeks.
And during this time, you and your partner will observe a psychological experiment in progress.
Your duty is to observe team members in another station on the island.
These team members are not aware that they are under surveillance, or that they are the subjects of an experiment.
Working in 8-hour shifts, you and your partner will record everything you observe in the notebooks we've provided.
What is the nature of the experiment, you might ask?
What do these subjects believe they are accomplishing, as they struggle to fulfill their tasks?
You, as the observer, don't need to know.
All you need to know is the subjects believe their job is of the utmost importance.
Remember, everything that occurs, no matter how minute or seemingly unimportant, must be recorded.
Each time a notebook is filled with the fruits of your diligent observation--
...one of the containers provided.
Then, simply place the container in the pneumatic tube, and... presto.
It will be transported directly to us.
At the end of your 8-hour shift, proceed to the Pala ferry, which will take you back to-- ...on behalf of the Degroots, Alvar Hanso, and all of us here at the Dharma Initiative, thank you.
Namaste... and good luck.
Would you like to watch that again?
No.
No, I've seen enough.
What are you doing?
I am taking this back with us.
Why?
Because they may be important.
Important?
I'm sorry, weren't you just watching the same thing I was?
Yes, John.
And I believe the work you have been doing is more important now than ever.
- What... work?
- Pushing the button.
That's not work.
That's a-- that's a-- a joke.
Rats in a maze...
with no cheese.
It is work, John.
- We are being tested.
- Tested?
The reason to do it-- push the button-- is not because we are told to do so in a film.
All right.
Well, then, what is the reason...
Mr. Eko?
We do it because we believe we are meant to.
Isn't that the reason you pushed it, John?
I was never... meant to do... anything!
Every single second of my pathetic little life, is as useless as that button!
You think it's important?
You think it's necessary?
It's nothing.
It's nothing.
It's meaningless.
And who are you to tell me that it's not?
That's flight 815, leaving from gate 23.
Thank you.
- What are you doing here?
- I had to see you.
Look, your father said I shouldn't--
I know.
He doesn't want me talking to you.
And I know you probably think I'm crazy.
But I have a message for you, and I promised to deliver it.
A message?
He says you were a good priest.
Who says that?
Yemi.
Speaking about my brother...
is not a joke.
So you should be very careful what you say next.
I saw him when I was...
between places.
He said that you would come and see me.
He said even though you were pretending, you were a good man.
Who put you up to this?
Did your father tell you to do this?
He wants you to knowt hat he will see you soon.
He said that even though you don't have faith in yourself, he has faith in you.
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want from me?
Why are you doing this to me?
Is everything... all right?
He has faith in you.
One day, you'll believe me.
This cross was worn by my brother, Yemi.
Yemi was a great man, a priest.
A man of God.
And because I betrayed him, he was shot and died.
He was placed on a plane which took off from an airstrip in Nigeria, half a world from here.
Then, the plane that I was on crashed on this island.
And somehow, here-- I found my brother again.
I found him in the same plane that took off from Nigeria, in the same plane that lies above us now, that has concealed this place.
And I took this cross from around Yemi's neck, and put it back on mine-- just as it was on the day I first took another man's life.
So let me ask you, how can you say this is meaningless?
I believe the work being done in the hatch is more important than anything.
If you will not continue to push that button, John,
I will.
Can... can I talk to her?
Sure.
Hey.
It's Hurley.
Hugo.
I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.
I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.
Libby?
Michael...
Michael... he's okay.
He made it, Libby, he's okay.
It's all right.
Previously on Lost:
I need you to go up through the grate and into the vents.
That button has to be pushed.
OK.
I crawled through your vents and I stood at your computer.
And you know what happened?
Nothing happened, John.
I never entered the numbers.
I never pressed the button.
If you want to do something nice for Libby, there's a beautiful beach three kilometers from here.
You could take her there.
Come on, give me the blankets.
- Blankets?
- I will handle the blankets, OK?
Take us to the guns.
Now.
Oh, that bitch.
She stole my damn gun.
Ana Lucia.
Why would she need a gun?
We caught one of them.
The Others.
He's locked up in there.
Give me the gun.
I'll kill him.
I'm sorry.
Michael?
What are you building?
- Hello, Ana.
- Well, hello, yourself.
So you gonna tell me?
What is it?
I'm building a church.
Now, why the hell would you wanna do that?
- Because I was told to.
- Told to by who?
I was just told.
I think it was in a dream.
A dream like this one?
You need to help John.
Yemi?
Hello, brother.
Yemi.
Forgive me.
I should have listened to you.
You were right.
- I didn't mean to do what I did.
- Shh.
The work being done in this place is important, Eko.
It is more important than anything, and it is in danger.
You must help John.
He has lost his way.
You must make him take you to the question mark.
John will not want to show you, so you must make him.
Eko.
There are many distractions, brother, but you must move past them.
What is done is done.
Do you understand?
Yes, Yemi.
And, Eko?
Bring the ax.
What's the matter?
You all right, mate?
I need to find John.
- What were you thinking, John?
- Leave him alone.
- No, don't.
- Shut it, Sawyer.
- If Ana hadn't lifted your gun...
- Swell.
Gimpy McCrutch covers up that the Artist Formerly Known As Henry Gale tried to strangle your little amiga and it's on me when she goes vigilante.
- How about you go back to the beach?
- Hey, enough.
Both of you.
Michael.
Hey.
- He shot me.
- Who?
- He's gone.
He ran out.
- Go.
I got him.
I was sleeping and I heard gunshots.
I got up.
I came out of the bedroom and there was this guy.
He had a gun and...
All right, come on.
We gotta get you up, all right?
Let me help you.
She's dead.
Kate, we gotta get her up.
We gotta get her up to the back room, OK?
Grant us this mercy, O Lord, we beseech thee.
Amen.
She's in shock.
All right, we gotta keep pressure on this one.
Can you do anything?
Jack?
I heard you.
Just keep pressure on her, OK?
How is she?
I'm doing what I can.
- How long ago?
- What?
When did this happen?
How long ago did he leave?
I don't know.
Twenty minutes, maybe a half-hour ago.
We can pick up the trail, catch up to him.
- Man's got a head start, a gun...
- He shot three people.
One's dead.
Who's gonna take care of Libby while you're off playing Daniel Boone?
I will go.
John, you have tracking experience, yes?
Yeah.
We will find his trail together.
You find anything, you come right back here and we figure out what we're gonna do next together.
Let's go, John.
How long has it been since your last confession?
Good question.
Too many years for me to even remember.
What do you wish to ask God's forgiveness for?
- What sins have you committed?
- Well, let's see.
Well, I slept with another woman besides my wife.
- Just once or many times?
- How many is "many"?
To receive God's forgiveness you must be penitent for your sins.
I also forged ID papers for a guy pretending to be a priest.
Do you have it?
So what did you do, Padre?
Skim from the collection plate?
You know, I've got some friends in Los Angeles.
I could get you on with them.
- Doing what?
- You know, stuff.
- Morning, Father Tunde.
- Good morning, Monsignor.
Mr. Caldwell has been helping me arrange my trip to the United States.
I'm sorry, Father, but I've got some bad news.
You're gonna have to postpone your trip.
It appears we have a miracle.
My daughter, she... she drowned.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
Oh, no, you don't understand.
She came back to life.
We were out in the backblocks and Charlotte must have slipped and she went into the river and she's not much of a swimmer.
She was dead, and the next day she woke up.
Don't you understand?
It's a miracle.
A confirmation of faith.
Everyone needs to know about this.
- Where is your daughter now?
- At home with my husband.
And what does he think?
The world needs to know.
We need to tell the Vatican.
I'm sorry.
We can't just do that, Mrs. Malkin.
The church needs to conduct an investigation before anyone can be told.
Father Tunde will start this process, if you'll permit him.
Mrs. Malkin, would you excuse us for a moment?
Of course.
Monsignor, with all due respect, I cannot do what you have asked.
Why not?
Because I do not believe what this woman says.
Why do you think I chose you?
Are you seeing something I'm not?
Hey.
I haven't seen a single track or piece of sign since we left the hatch.
- What the hell are you following?
- Where is the question mark?
The what?
The question mark, John.
Where is it?
You know what?
You keep chasing after your own shadow.
I'm going back.
I know you do not want to show me, but you must.
- No, I don't have to show you anything.
- Then I'm sorry.
You hit me.
- Why did you?
- Because you were being difficult.
Are you insane?
No.
Ana Lucia, your friend, was just murdered and you...
Ana wants me to help you, John.
- Help me do what?
- Find the question mark.
You don't know what you're talking about.
No.
But you know what I am talking about, John, and that is all that matters.
Here.
Here.
You wanna find your damn question mark?
Here, this is it right here.
Here, take it.
Because it's nothing.
It's a memory.
It's ten seconds of nothing.
- This is your hatch, yes?
- It's not my hatch.
If the swan is where we came from, then we go that way.
We shouldn't even be out here.
Ana Lucia would still be alive if I'd just told Jack that Henry attacked her.
Now she wants us to go here, John.
She wants us to go here, John.
Together.
- She said this in my dream.
- Oh, of course, your dream.
Tell me, John, haven't you ever followed a dream?
So, the Vatican's really interested in this one, eh?
That depends upon what I put in my report.
Why don't you just start by telling me what happened that night?
Well, I got a call.
That was around 1 a. m.
Ambos brought this girl in dead.
She'd been in the water two hours.
Have you had experience in this type of death?
Yeah, of course.
I'm an undertaker.
Well, I mean, it's my day job.
I'm perfectly qualified to be a coroner.
I mean, I did go to medical school.
And when did you find out that she was not dead?
During the autopsy.
During the autopsy?
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to believe me.
I figured you'd want to have a listen for yourself.
Decedent is a Caucasian female. 161 centimeters, 51.3 kilos.
Body was prepped and washed by the very lovely Valerie Mc Tavish.
Ian, stop it.
Commencing with the post.
This is a clear case of drowning.
- I'll begin with the thoracic...
- No!
- Oh, my God.
She's alive!
- Val...
Take it.
No, please.
I don't want to ever listen to that tape again.
- You lost already?
- Your map is inexact.
- No kidding?
- These landmarks.
- Is this a river?
- No, it's a wavy line.
I didn't draw it.
I just transcribed it.
I don't even know if it is a map.
- Let's assume it is.
- What's the ax for?
I don't know yet.
You were the one that found this plane, yes?
Yeah.
It was up there.
And what made it fall?
Boone.
Boone made it fall.
Then he died.
A sacrifice that the island demanded.
Excuse me?
Nothing.
So, what's next?
We make camp, get some sleep, and wait for further instruction.
Where in the hell are they?
Just calm down.
Finding his trail in the dark is not gonna be easy.
They'll be back.
Jack.
She say anything?
Libby?
She's still unconscious.
The bleeding's stopped.
- That's good, right?
- No.
It's not good.
- And there's nothing you can?
- I can make her comfortable.
But I don't have what I need.
Why look at me?
I gave you all the meds two days ago.
The heroin, Sawyer.
- Give me twenty minutes.
- Kate's gonna go with you.
- It doesn't take two people to carry...
- Kate is going with you.
Why would he need me to go with him?
Jacko here knows his heroin's in my stash with the guns.
So I can either show you where it's at or let poor Libby suffer.
- That pretty much it, Doc?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
That's pretty much it.
Let's go, Freckles.
- I'm curious about something.
- Yeah, what's that?
How did Ana Lucia get your gun?
I don't know.
She must have lifted it off me.
She pickpocketed your gun?
How'd she do that?
Well, if I knew how she did it, she wouldn't be able to do it, would she?
After you.
I thought you were taking me to your stash.
Do you have to make everything so damn difficult?
Just go in.
You kept the guns here.
All this time, right under you.
Fooled you, didn't I?
Hey, guys.
You seen Libby around?
Eko.
- Yemi.
- Shh.
You'll wake John.
Come.
Follow me.
Yemi.
Yemi.
Yemi.
Wake up, John.
Are you all right, John?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
You had a dream?
Was there a man?
A priest?
The man that you saw was my brother.
Your brother?
This is why we needed to come together.
This is how we are going to be led, how we will know where to go.
- I don't know where to go.
- Did he tell you anything?
- No.
He...
- Nothing?
Anything?
It wasn't even me.
It was you.
It didn't...
He... he wanted me to follow him.
Follow him where?
Wait here.
Eko, it was just a dream.
It's not safe.
Eko!
Father, I'm afraid it's not a very good time.
Come back later.
Mrs. Malkin, I must speak to your daughter.
- Yesterday you said...
- I know what I said.
It's just right this minute it's not a very good time.
All right.
Get back in the house, Joyce.
Get her inside.
- Richard, please...
- Inside.
Now.
I know why you're here, friend, but save yourself the trouble.
What happened here was not a miracle.
The doctor that treated your daughter feels differently.
Treated her?
You mean tried to cut her open.
He's just trying to cover up his own negligence.
He tell you the whole story, how she supposedly drowned?
She fell into a mountain river.
Her body shut down.
She went into hypothermia, which made her appear dead.
Then why is your wife so convinced otherwise?
'Cause she's a zealot.
All of this, everything she's doing, it's to spite me.
- Why would she spite you?
- Because she knows I'm a fraud.
Because I make my living as a psychic.
You see, that's what I do.
I gather intelligence on people and I exploit it.
Every day I meet people looking for a miracle, desperate to find one.
But there are none to be had.
Not in this world, anyway.
I will report back to my monsignor that there was no miracle here.
Your daughter is alive.
This is all that matters.
Eko.
Be careful.
Eko.
Eko.
I'm fine.
Hey, Eko.
What's up there?
Do you see anything?
I don't see nothing.
- It's salted.
- What?
The earth has been salted so that nothing can grow.
Why would anyone wanna salt it?
There's nothing here.
I believe they made a circle, a target, so that this place can be seen from up above.

The place that this plane fell upon, John.
Come on.
John.
Will you help me with this?
Wait.
Eko.
- May I?
- Please.
Be my guest.
We were gonna have our first date.
Date?
Yeah.
Picnic on the beach.
I'm glad you're OK, man.

Would you like to watch that again?

No, I've seen enough.

Oceanic Airlines flight 815 is now boarding for Los Angeles.
This cross was worn by my brother Yemi.
Yemi was a great man, a priest, a man of God, and because I betrayed him, he was shot and died.

All right, come on.
We gotta get you up, all right?
[Eko] Let me help you.
[Michael moans]
She's dead.
[she coughs, Sawyer groans]
[Libby splutters]
[Jack] Kate, we gotta get her up.
We gotta get her up to the back room, OK?

[whimpers]
How is she?
I'm doing what I can.
- How long ago?
- What?
When did this happen?
How long ago did he leave?
I don't know.
Twenty minutes, maybe a half-hour ago.
We can pick up the trail, catch up to him.

You know, I've got some friends in Los Angeles.
I could get you on with them.
- Doing what?
- You know, stuff.
- Morning, Father Tunde.
- Good morning, Monsignor.
Mr. Caldwell has been helping me arrange my trip to the United States.
I'm sorry, Father, but I've got some bad news.
You're gonna have to postpone your trip.
It appears we have a miracle.
My daughter, she... she drowned.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
Oh, no, you don't understand.
She came back to life.
We were out in the backblocks and Charlotte must have slipped and she went into the river and she's not much of a swimmer.
She was dead, and the next day she woke up.
Don't you understand?
It's a miracle.
A confirmation of faith.
Everyone needs to know about this.
- Where is your daughter now?
- At home with my husband.
And what does he think?
The world needs to know.
We need to tell the Vatican.
I'm sorry.
We can't just do that, Mrs. Malkin.
The church needs to conduct an investigation before anyone can be told.
Father Tunde will start this process, if you'll permit him.
[sighs]
Mrs. Malkin, would you excuse us for a moment?
Of course.
Monsignor, with all due respect, I cannot do what you have asked.
Why not?
Because I do not believe what this woman says.
Why do you think I chose you?
Are you seeing something I'm not?
Hey.
I haven't seen a single track or piece of sign since we left the hatch.
- What the hell are you following?
- Where is the question mark?
The what?
The question mark, John.
Where is it?
You know what?
You keep chasing after your own shadow.
I'm going back.
I know you do not want to show me, but you must.
- No, I don't have to show you anything.
- Then I'm sorry.
You hit me.
- Why did you...?
- Because you were being difficult.
Are you insane?
No.
[sighs]
Ana Lucia, your friend, was just murdered and you...
Ana wants me to help you, John.
- Help me do what?
- Find the question mark.
You don't know what you're talking about.
No.
But you know what I am talking about, John, and that is all that matters.
Here.
Here.
You wanna find your damn question mark?
Here, this is it right here.
Here, take it.
Because it's nothing.
It's a memory.
It's ten seconds of nothing.
- This is your hatch, yes?
- It's not my hatch.
If the swan is where we came from, then we go that way.
We shouldn't even be out here.
Ana Lucia would still be alive if I'd just told Jack that Henry attacked her.
Now she wants us to go here, John.
She wants us to go here, John.
Together.
- She said this in my dream.
- Oh, of course, your dream.
Tell me, John, haven't you ever followed a dream?
So, the Vatican's really interested in this one, eh?
That depends upon what I put in my report.
Why don't you just start by telling me what happened that night?
Well, I got a call.
That was around 1 a.m.
Ambos brought this girl in dead.
She'd been in the water two hours.
Have you had experience in this type of death?
Yeah, of course.
I'm an undertaker.
Well, I mean, it's my day job.
I'm perfectly qualified to be a coroner.
I mean, I did go to medical school.
And when did you find out that she was not dead?
During the autopsy.
During the autopsy?
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to believe me.
I figured you'd want to have a listen for yourself.
[undertaker] Decedent is a Caucasian female. 16 1 centimeters, 51. 3 kilos.
Body was prepped and washed by the very lovely Valerie McTavish.
[Valerie] Ian, stop it.
Commencing with the post.
This is a clear case of drowning.
- I'll begin with the thoracic...
- [girl screams] No!
- Oh, my God.
She's alive!
- Val... [piercing screams] [overlapping shouts and screams] [stops]
T ake it.
No, please.
I don't want to ever listen to that tape again.
- You lost already?
- Your map is inexact.
- No kidding?
- These landmarks.
- Is this a river?
- No, it's a wavy line.
I didn't draw it.
I just transcribed it.
I don't even know if it is a map.
- Let's assume it is.
- What's the ax for?
I don't know yet.
You were the one that found this plane, yes?
Yeah.
It was up there.
And what made it fall?
Boone.
Boone made it fall.
Then he died.
A sacrifice that the island demanded.
Excuse me?
Nothing.
So, what's next?
We make camp, get some sleep, and wait for further instruction.
Where in the hell are they?
Just calm down.
Finding his trail in the dark is not gonna be easy.
They'll be back.
Jack.
She say anything?
Libby?
She's still unconscious.
The bleeding's stopped.
- That's good, right?
- No.
It's not good.
- And there's nothing you can...?
- I can make her comfortable.
But I don't have what I need.
Why look at me?
I gave you all the meds two days ago.
The heroin, Sawyer.
- Give me twenty minutes.
- Kate's gonna go with you.
- It doesn't take two people to carry...
- Kate is going with you.
Why would he need me to go with him?
Jacko here knows his heroin's in my stash with the guns.
So I can either show you where it's at or let poor Libby suffer.
- That pretty much it, Doc?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
That's pretty much it.
[Sawyer] Let's go, Freckles.
- [Kate] I'm curious about something.
- Yeah, what's that?
How did Ana Lucia get your gun?
I don't know.
She must have lifted it off me.
She pickpocketed your gun?
How'd she do that?
Well, if I knew how she did it, she wouldn't be able to do it, would she?
After you.
I thought you were taking me to your stash.
Do you have to make everything so damn difficult?
Just go in.
You kept the guns here.
All this time, right under you.
Fooled you, didn't I?
[Hurley] Hey, guys.
You seen Libby around?
[man] Eko.
- Yemi.
- Shh.
You'll wake John.
Come.
Follow me.
Yemi.
[strains]
Yemi.
Yemi.
- Wake up, John.
- [screams] [thud, John grunts]
Are you all right, John?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
You had a dream?
Was there a man?
A priest?
The man that you saw was my brother.
Your brother?
This is why we needed to come together.
This is how we are going to be led, how we will know where to go.
- I don't know where to go.
- Did he tell you anything?
- No.
He...
- Nothing?
Anything?
It wasn't even me.
It was you.
It didn't...
He... he wanted me to follow him.
Follow him where?
Wait here.
Eko, it was just a dream.
It's not safe.
Eko!
Father, I'm afraid it's not a very good time.
Come back later.
Mrs. Malkin, I must speak to your daughter.
- Yesterday you said...
- I know what I said.
It's just right this minute it's not a very good time.
All right.
Get back in the house, Joyce.
Get her inside.
- Richard, please...
- Inside.
Now.
I know why you're here, friend, but save yourself the trouble.
What happened here was not a miracle.
The doctor that treated your daughter feels differently.
Treated her?
You mean tried to cut her open.
He's just trying to cover up his own negligence.
He tell you the whole story, how she supposedly drowned?
She fell into a mountain river.
Her body shut down.
She went into hypothermia, which made her appear dead.
Then why is your wife so convinced otherwise?
'Cause she's a zealot.
All of this, everything she's doing, it's to spite me.
- Why would she spite you?
- Because she knows I'm a fraud.
Because I make my living as a psychic.
You see, that's what I do.
I gather intelligence on people and I exploit it.
Every day I meet people looking for a miracle, desperate to find one.
But there are none to be had.
Not in this world, anyway.
I will report back to my monsignor that there was no miracle here.
Your daughter is alive.
This is all that matters.
Eko.
Be careful.
Eko.
Eko.
I'm fine.
Hey, Eko.
What's up there?
Do you see anything?
I don't see nothing.
- It's salted.
- What?
The earth has been salted so that nothing can grow.
Why would anyone wanna salt it?
There's nothing here.
I believe they made a circle, a target, so that this place can be seen from up above.
They?
What place?
The place that this plane fell upon, John.
Come on.
[heavy thud]
John.
Will you help me with this?
Wait.
Eko.
- May I?
- Please.
Be my guest.
[clanking]
[Hurley] We were gonna have our first date.
Date?
Yeah.
Picnic on the beach.
I'm glad you're OK, man.

[synthesizer intro music]
Hello.
I'm Dr. Mark Wickmund, and this is the orientation film for Station 5 of The Dharma Initiative.
Station 5, or The Pearl, is a monitoring station where the activities of participants in Dharma Initiative projects can be observed and recorded not only for posterity, but for the ongoing refinement of the Initiative as a whole.
As Karen DeGroot herself has written,
"Careful observation is the only key to true and complete awareness. "
Your tour of duty in The Pearl will last three weeks and during this time you will observe a psychological experiment in progress.
Your duty is to observe team members in another station on the island.
These team members are not aware they are under surveillance or that they are subjects of an experiment.
Working in eight-hour shifts, you and your partner will record everything you observe in the notebooks we 've provided.
What is the nature of the experiment, you might ask?
What do these subjects believe they are accomplishing as they struggle to fulfill their tasks?
You, as the observer, don't need to know.
All you need to know is the subjects believe their job is of the utmost importance.
Remember, everything that occurs, no matter how minute or seemingly unimportant, must be recorded.
Each time a notebook is filled with the fruits of your diligent observation, roll it up, and place it in one of the containers provided.
Then simply place the container in the pneumatic tube and presto,
it will be transported directly to us.
At the end of your eight-hour shift, proceed to the Pala Ferry, which will take you back to the barracks to prepare for your next...
On behalf of the DeGroots, Alvar Hanso, and all of us here at The Dharma Initiative, thank you.
Namaste and good luck.
[video recorder clicks]
Would you like to watch that again?
No.
No, I've seen enough.
What are you doing?
I'm taking this back with us.
Why?
Because they may be important.
Important?
I'm sorry.
Weren't you just watching the same thing I was?
Yes, John, and I believe the work you have been doing is more important now than ever.
What work?
Pushing the button.
[laughing ruefully] That's not work.
That's a joke.
Rats in a maze with no cheese.
It is work, John.
We are being tested.
Tested?
The reason to do it, push the button, is not because we are told to do so in a film.
Oh, well.
Well, then, what is the reason, Mr. Eko?
We do it because we believe we are meant to.
Isn't that the reason you pushed it, John?
I was never meant to do anything!
Every single second of my pathetic little life is as useless as that button!
You think it's important?
You think it's necessary?
It's nothing.
It's nothing.
It's meaningless.
And who are you to tell me that it's not?
That's flight 81 5 leaving from gate 23.
- Thank you.
- [PA] 840 starting to board at gate 16.
[whoosh of jet engines]
- What are you doing here?
- I had to see you.
- Look, your father said...
- I know.
He doesn't want me talking to you, and I know you probably think I'm crazy, but I have a message for you and I promised to deliver it.
A message?
- He says you were a good priest.
- Who says that?
Yemi.
Speaking about my brother is not a joke, so you should be very careful what you say next.
I saw him when I was between places.
He said that you would come and see me.
He said even though you were pretending, you're a good man.
Who put you up to this?
Did your father tell you to do this?
He wants you to know he will see you soon.
He said that even though you don't have faith in yourself, he has faith in you.
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want?
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Is everything... all right?
He has faith in you.
One day you'll believe me.
[PA] Oceanic Airlines flight 815 is now boarding for Los Angeles.
This cross was worn by my brother Yemi.
Yemi was a great man, a priest, a man of God, and because I betrayed him, he was shot and died.
He was placed on a plane which took off from an airstrip in Nigeria, half a world from here.
Then the plane that I was on crashed on this island.
And somehow, here, I found my brother again.
I found him in the same plane that took off from Nigeria, in the same plane that lies above us now that has concealed this place.
And I took this cross from around Yemi's neck and put it back on mine.
Just as it was on the day I first took another man's life.
So let me ask you, how can you say this is meaningless?
I believe the work being done in the hatch is more important than anything.
If you will not continue to push the button, John,...
I will.
Can...
Can I talk to her?
Sure.
Hey.
[sniffs] It's Hurley.
Hugo.
I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.
I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.
[wheezes]
Libby?
- [strained] Michael.
- Michael.
He's OK.
He made it, Libby.
It's OK.
It's all right.
[whimpers] [short, rapid breaths]

- Are you getting off at Austin?
- Huh?
Yeah.
- Going home?
- Sort of.
- Visiting?
- Yeah.
- Relatives.
- Yeah.
- What kind?
- Mother and brother.
- Mother's getting married.
- Hmm.
- Is he nice?
- My brother?
- No.
The man your mother's gonna marry.
- Oh.
Haven't met him.
- I'm Susan.
- Michael.
- So you live here?
- Yeah.
- Where do you work?
- I'm training to be a teller at the Grand Texas Bank.
[ Michael's Voice ] Ah.
So when do you take your test?
[ Susan's Voice ] Oh, I don't know.
It's a self-study, so you can take it whenever you're ready.
Just don't think that I'm ready yet.
Well, there's one way to find out.
Mom?
Michael?
Michael!
[ Chuckling ]
- Give me a hug!
- Oh, I stink.
I've been on a bus.
I don't care.
Nice butt.
[ Gasps ] You bastard.
[ Chuckling ]
- How's it goin'?
- Good, good, good.
Shouldn't you be out clubbing motorists or something?
No, I'm on the night shift.
Plus, I'm beating the homeless now.
- Oh, I see.
- They're not as mobile.
So...
how's it goin'?
It's goin'.
You workin'?
- You hiring'?
- [ Chuckles ] Yeah.
That's what the force needs:
another confused white boy.
Hear she's dating a small-time hood that bought the Ember, if you're interested.
I'm here for the wedding.
Tell me about Ed.
Did you run a check on him?
- No, I did not.
- Bullshit, I know you did.
All right, a small one.
But he's clean.
- No moving violations, no nothin'?
- Not in Texas.
Hurray for Mom.
I don't know.
I, uh--
I can't decide right now.
You go first.
I don't play the lottery.
It's a waste of money.
Well, if I won, it's always been a dream of mine to breed dogs.
- No.
No.
- No?
Okay.
- How 'bout a stamp collection then?
- Okay, that I'll go for.
All right.
- How 'bout you, Michael?
- I wouldn't believe it.
If it were true, I'd smile.
I'd just sit there quietly for five minutes, smile and be rich.
I don't know.
Come on, Mom, what?
You know I can't make decisions, but, um-- [ Clears Throat ]
I know one thing I want, I want the biggest TV they make.
Two of 'em, with everything on it.
- Extra cheese?
- Yeah.
So how long you gonna stay, Michael?
Maybe a little while.
See some friends.
We got an opening, if you're looking for somethin'.
Thanks.
It's a kind offer.
I thought you needed law enforcement or military service for a job like that.
Helpful, but not mandatory.
If I put in a good word, they'd probably take him, no problem.
- Beat goin' back to Sports Town.
- I doubt that would be an option.
[ Announcer ] This is the official lotto Texas drawing for August 13, 1994.
ln the next 60 seconds, you can become Texas' newest millionaire!
- Are you registered somewhere?
- Michael, when you're getting married at 56, you don't register.
Oh.
Can you get me some quick picks while you're out?
- Sure.
How many?
- Oh, five or so.
Don't wait up.

Tommy, this is Michael Chambers.
Michael, Tommy Dundee.
- Heard you moved.
- Mother's getting married.
- To who?
- A good guy.
- Never heard of him.
- [ Chuckling ]
Well.
Let Tommy buy you a drink.
You'll buy him a drink, won't you?
- I'll buy him a drink.
- Some other time.
Good to see you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Uh, yeah.
- What the hell was that?
- What?
- What's he doing here?
- I don't know.
He just showed up.
Yeah, nobody's ex just shows up.
He wants something.
- Don't have an aneurysm.
- Let's go in the back.
I'm tired of watching guys sit up and b-b-beg you.
It's like goddamn Sea World in here.
§ 'Cause I found an angel with a broken wing §
- Hey, did you get my Twinkie?
- Huh?
- My Twinkie.
Did you get it?
- I'm sorry, you wanted a Twinkie?
- I'm kidding, Michael.
- Oh, okay.
- Close it up.
- All right.
I hope I didn't wake you when I came in.
Did you get my quick picks?
Oh, jeez, I totally forgot.
I'm sorry.
I-I'll get some, I'll get some today.
Rachel called.
She leave a number?
By the phone.
[ Michael ] We're on the back nine, a short par four.
I hit a big tee shot.
Lands in the wrong fairway.
This guy hits a beautiful drive, cuts past the dogleg, drops about 20 yards from the pin.
Do you wanna hear this?
- Please.
- Okay.
Uh.
- Uh, where was I?
- The pin.
Right, right.
So I'm down 200 for the game.
This jerk is really riding' me, talking about my hair gettin' in my eyes and crap like that.
So I bet him two grand I could win the hole.
He says, why not three?
I say, why not five?
Then he hesitates.
He says, okay, five.
Then I knew he was... a eunuch.
So, I'm 230 yards out, I hit the best three... wood of my life.
I'm on the green, putting for a bird.
He sculls his approach shot, the ball sails over the green.
- He's double bogey for the hole.
- Gosh, that's exciting.
- If you keep this up--
- Keep what up?
- [ Gasps, Sighs ]
- Chambers!
- Yeah?
- How'd you know Dallas was gonna beat the spread?
You know, I can't begin to describe to you how.
- I just knew.
- Some people are interested in trying to garnish your wages.
- I suggest you take care of 'em.
- Okay, thanks.
Take my advice.
Don't spend that money.
- Get yourself squared.
- Thanks.
Hmm.
Feels almost as good as you.
God, I love betting.
[ Michael ] I was surprised to get your call.
I was surprised to see you at the club.
Just getting my weekly dose of secondhand smoke.
Right.
- So how's the acting gig?
- I gave it up.
- Really?
- Isn't that what you wanted?
I never interfered.
Oh.
So beneath the apathetic exterior, there was actually a raging indifference.
I get it.
- So tell me about Tommy Dundee.
- Tommy?
- We go out.
- How long?
A few months.
He treat you okay?
Not as well as guys without money.
He's gonna teach me how to manage the club.
He looks like he might be into a few things besides managing a club.
Yeah.
- For instance?
- I don't know.
You don't know 'cause you don't know, or 'cause you don't want to know?
I don't know 'cause I don't ask.
I wrote you a long letter after you left about everything.
- Took me a week.
- I never got it.
- I burned it.
- Ooh, I walked right into that one.
Must be a new sensation for you, walking into something.
- ls this yours?
- Yup.
- Nice.
- Men buy me Mustangs.
I don't know why.
- Can I see you again?
- [ Sighs ] I don't think that's a good idea.
- Rachel.
- You humiliated me.
I didn't get a warning, an explanation, and I had to deal with all the ugly shit you left behind.
- It wasn't right.
- I know that.
[ Door Opening ]
[ Door Closing ]
Don't call me.
Don't try and find me.
It makes it hard with Tommy.
[ Engine Starts ]
- [ Guard #1 ] She goes where?
- [ Guard #2 ] To the library.
She's been taking this correspondence course.
She's studying.
- Until 11:00 every night.
- It closes at 11:00.
I checked.
Gee, you're a one-man Warren Commission.
Take my advice.
Follow her.
- I couldn't do that.
- You'll thank me.
- Hey, Ed.
- How's it going, boys?
You know, same shit, different day.
I wanted you to meet Michael Chambers, Annie's boy.
He's putting in an application.
- Tom.
- Casey.
- Nice to meet you.
- Comin' to work here?
- Yeah.
- You'll love it.
If you like saltpeter.
Someone under 40, you tryin' to scare him off?
- Just doin' our part.
- Look at us.
We're only 22 years old.
- See you guys later.
- Nice to meet you.
The library?
That's right.
Ed, Ed!
Can you take my spot on number five run?
Deborah's having some strange contractions...
- and I'm gonna meet her at the doctor's office.
- Okay.
Go ahead.
- I'll take it.
- Oh, thanks.
- You better start workin' so I can retire.
- I'll do my best.
Let me tell you about Hinkle.
When you first go in, he'll offer you a candy mint.
Don't take it.
At the end of the meeting, he'll offer it to you again.
Take it and eat it right in front of him.
You'll get the job.
[ Laughing ] You're kidding, right?
Do I look like I'm kidding?
- First time, no; second time, yes?
- That's it.
Okay.
Thanks.
Mint?
No, thank you.
Fine.
Ed Dutton speaks highly of you.
He's a very good man, Ed.
I hope so.
He'll be my stepfather in a few days.
Yes.
That's a copy of Armored Transport Now!
It's a magazine we publish, not just for ourselves, but for the entire industry.
And here I thought cash was on the way out.
Many of the services we provide here used to be provided by the banks.
For example, a bank might have us pick up all the cash from a fast-food chain, process and verify it here and then deposit it directly into the Fed, bypassing their branch altogether.
- That sort of thing.
- Oh, I see.
May I keep this?
Where have you been working the past couple of years?
- Offshore.
- That's serious work.
- Serious money.
- Mm-hmm.
-You have any experience with firearms?
-No.
[ Hinkle ] He'll learn.
We don't need marksmen, just people who can think clearly.
That I can do.
Good.
Well.
Are you sure you wouldn't like a mint?
Actually, now that you mention it, I would.
Mmm.
We'll be in touch.
Sometime this week, we'll have you come in for the polygraph.
[ Choking ] A polygraph?
Great.
I'll look forward to it.
- Where are my fries?
- You didn't ask for fries.
-Well, you got fries.
-Michael, you want fries, you gotta ask.
Yes, Officer.
- How's Rachel?
- She's fine, doing the audition thing.
- Tell her I said hello.
- I will.
Listen, I talked to Mom last night.
She told me you hadn't sent her any money in two months.
We had an arrangement.
She needs the money.
I got the money.
I can give it to her today, with interest.
-l can give her three months in advance.
-She doesn't care about interest.
She doesn't care about "in advance." She wants to know if you can be counted on.
It's really boring having this conversation every six months.
- I agree.
- Jesus!
This is our mother.
She needs our help.
And seeing you avoid being around after Dad died--
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- You didn't even go see her--
- Can we not turn this into a Eugene O'Neill play?
- I've got the money.
- This time.
Thanks for the protection, Officer.
You never should've left the Village People, David.
- Fuck you.
- [ Chuckling ]
- Hello?
- [ Rachel ] Michael.
Hi.
- Are you there?
- I'm here.
- How are you?
- Good.
- What about you?
- Good.
- Are you on a car phone?
- Yeah.
- Courtesy of--
- Mm-hmm.
So, are you staying?
I think so.
I might get that job.
Really?
Um, I gotta go.
- W-W-Wait--
- I'll talk to you soon.
[ Disconnects ]
There's one question this test never gets around to asking.
It's a question I need an answer to.
What's that?
When can you start?
- That's it?
- [ Chuckling ] That's it.
- Welcome aboard.
- [ Rachel's Voice ] Eleven.
Forty-one.
Twenty-three.
Here we go.
- What do you think?
- Hmm?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do another one.
- Twelve.
- Not so smiley.
- Nine.
- Much better.
Why go up for this?
It's not acting.
It's exposure.
Like Vanna White, you know.
Oh.
Well, that's something to aspire to.
I hope you like egg salad, 'cause I'm making a ton.
Great.
We'll have it for dinner.
I thought we were going to San Miguel.
Let's go to San Miguel after the game on Saturday.
I gotta make some calls.
I'm not staying in.
I told Diane we'd meet her at the Ember.
That's fine.
I'll be here.
You never do what you say you're gonna do.
[ TV ] Florida at LSU.
This is the fork in the road for both teams.
Some are calling it a toss-up, but given the home field advantage... and nine apparently healthy seniors--
Hey!
Whoa!
Hey!
- Remember me?
- Rachel, right?
- [ TV Continues ]
- Dick.
I'm sorry.
Hi, Dick.
[ Sighs ]
God, the picture on this TV sucks.
It sucks, and it's small.
- Smallish and sucky.
- ...convert that threat into scoring opportunities.
- Everybody in yet?
- No, there's one still out.
[ Knocking On Door ]
Hey, come on in!
- Mom, you look beautiful.
- Thank you.
- You really do.
- Thank you.
- That's a nice suit.
- It's Dad's.
I-l wanted to give you this beforehand.
Oh!
Oh, David, they're beautiful!
I'll have to get my ears pierced.
[ Kissing ]
I don't have anything.
That's all right.
I'm just glad you're here.
I don't need presents.
[ Minister ] Would you repeat after me:
With this ring, I thee wed.
With this ring, I thee wed.
And pledge to thee my faith and love.
And pledge to thee my faith and love.
I can't believe you wore Dad's suit to Mom's wedding.
[ Minister ] I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
[ Guests Applauding ]
[ Man On Phone ] Well, it depends.
Some say he's doubtful;
some say he's probable.
[ Michael ] What's the difference between doubtful and probable?
Doubtful means he probably won't play;
- probable means he'll play, but there's some doubt.
- Oh, that clears everything up.
- So is he doubtful or probable?
- Doubtful.
- Michael, did you get a call--
- How close is your source?
- You wanna know how close my source is, he's a she.
- Wow.
- This is inside inside.
- Wow.
- Michael!
- I gotta go.
Talk to you.
Isn't that amazing?
It's a 12-foot Paraclipse with terrestrial filters.
- I don't care if it turns coffee beans into diamonds--
- How did you know?
- What's it doing in our back yard?
- Wait till you see the image quality.
- It's like looking out a window.
- We have plenty of windows.
- [ Doorbell Ringing ]
- We have one more.
It's the new TV.
Excuse me.
ls that thing safe?
Yes, ma'am.
It's, uh, it's safe.
Just don't stand in front of it.
- [ Michael ] Come on in.
- [ Man ] Where do you want it?
Try right in front of the fireplace.
God, it's big.
It's huge.
- Did you order a stand?
- It comes with a stand, doesn't it?
- It doesn't come with a stand.
- I gotta have a stand.
- There's one in the truck.
Costs extra.
- Fine, fine.
- [ Phone Ringing ]
- Don't answer that.
- The one-fifteen.
- Great!
It's huge!
- Michael.
- Yeah.
Tell me you didn't use the rest of the money to buy this stuff.
- Okay, I didn't use the rest of it.
- Thank God.
- I used some of the rest of it.
- Michael!
- What else was I gonna use?
We've lost our credit cards.
- [ Phone Ringing ]
- You lost our credit cards.
- Fine, I lost 'em.
It doesn't change the fact that I had to use cash.
- How much cash?
- I got an incredible deal for not charging.
- How much?
For everything.
- For the dish, the installation,
- For everything!
Michael!
- the subscription fees-
- About seven.
- Hundred?
- [ Laughing ]
You're so good.
That's good.
- Seven... thousand.
- Yeah.
How are you gonna pay the people you owe?
They call constantly.
- Listen.
- [ Sighs ]
Grrr.
I got this whole thing worked out.
It's not even a system.
It's more like, I just know.
I just know which way to bet.
It's like being connected.
It-It's like knowing something that no one else knows.
- God, I wish I could describe the feeling to you.
- You don't have to.
- Hey, how did it go?
- What?
The audition.
Hmm.
Did Jane Duncan call after I left?
Jane Duncan?
No.
When you were on the phone and I was getting ready, did anybody try and click through?
- I don't know.
- They were trying to call me not to come.
Because they decided to go with a lottery official instead of an actress.
I sat there for an hour looking like an idiot before somebody told me.
I'm sorry.
That must have been awful.
[ Disgusted Sigh ]
- There's the stand.
- Did you at least remember to get my plane ticket?
Yes and no.
- What the hell does that mean?
- I did remember, but I didn't get it.
- Michael, this audition has been planned for months!
- I got you something else.
- Julie's expecting me!
- I got you something else.
I got you something else.
- What?
What did you do?
- I'll give you a hint.
We don't have enough to fly to L.A., but you could drive there in style.
What?
That's mine?
- Michael--
- You hate it, I'll take it back.
- Wait.
- Uh, if you like it, we'll keep it.
- You make me really, really mad.
- [ Grunting ] Ooh, careful!
Careful, it'll come off.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Oh, I don't know, about 45 minutes.
Forty-five minutes?
What do you think went on in there?
I don't know.
I wasn't inside.
You don't have to be inside to figure it out.
- Look, I gotta trust her.
- Michael Chambers, line 2.
- Michael Chambers, line 2.
- You're either very smart or very stupid.
I can't figure out which.
- Hello.
- [ Rachel ] It's me.
He proposed.
Christ.
Christ.
What did you say?
I pretended I wasn't expecting it.
I said I needed time.
This is my problem:
When I think about trying again with you,
I have no idea if it's a moment of strength or a moment of weakness.
Do you remember the last time we went away?
- The conversation we had in front of the fire?
- Yes.
I don't want to be on the outside.
It's too painful.
I won't make that mistake again.
I promise.
What do you think would happen if we went away for the weekend?
I don't see how we can resolve this any other way.
We could go back to Whispering Pines.
We could do that.
We had a good time there.
What about Tommy?
I'll pick you up Friday at 6:00.
- Can we take my car?
- Yeah, we can take your car.
I forgot.
Suddenly, Friday at 6:00 seems like a long way off.
It's only two days.
- All you have to do is say no.
- No.
[ Phone Beeping ]

- Rachel around?
- Nope.
- What about Tommy?
- Nope.
It's sort of important.
We were supposed to hook up, and she never showed.

- Where to?
- Uh, Vegas, I think.

- Yeah.
It was nice to meet you.
I'll speak to you soon.

- Bye.
- He'll call.
- What do you want?
You met the guy on a bus.
Have you seen David lately?
Not since you and Ed got divorced-- married!
[ Ed Laughing ]
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Michael, when you get to be my age, you realize... sometimes the planets just don't line up.
And there's nothing you can do about it.
Of course, sometimes they do line up.
And there's nothing you can do about that either.
[ Phone Ringing ]
Hi, this is Susan Crenshaw.
I'm not in right now, but if you leave me a message, I'll call you right back.
[ Beep ]
- Hi, this is Michael Chambers.
I'm sorry to call so late--
- Hello!
- Oh, you're there.
- [ Chuckling ] Yeah.
- I just didn't feel like talking to anybody.
- Okay, bye.
[ Laughing ] No, I didn't mean you.
What are you doing?
Sittin' around.
What are you doing?
Sitting around.
[ Laughing ]
Are you with me?
Yeah.
- I feel like you're somewhere else.
- [ Chuckles ]
I feel like I'm in an ad for fine wine.
But it's nice, really nice.
I like to be close.
This is close.
This is close to you?
Isn't it?
- You're not very present tense.
- Wh-Wh--
Is that like an acting thing?
I love you.
- [ Susan ] Mmm.
That was nice.
- Mmm.
There's somebody else, isn't there?
- Sort of.
- Sort of?
Where is she?
[ Michael ] I don't know.
There's what you want and there's what's good for you.
- Uh, they never meet.
- They never meet.
Except for my mother and stepfather.
Maybe they think they're wrong for each other.
Nah, they're too old for that shit.
Then why do anything with anybody?
Because anything is better than nothing.
The idea that you think you make sense is really terrifying.
Yeah, I know.
- Have a nice day, Michael.
- Nice seein' you.
That the last of it?
- That the last of it, Michael?
- Yeah.
Listen.
Give me two minutes.
I gotta use the bathroom.
Michael?
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Good.
And you?
Good.
Did you just get here?
- No, just on my way out.
- I have to go downstairs to meet a delivery.
Great.
I'll go with you.
Later they find out that Bob, this manager, is letting this new guy fill the ATM... without having the second person there with the offsetting key.
Which you're not supposed to do, obviously.
It turns out this guy was stealing money... and splitting it with Bob.
- A little office intrigue.
- [ Laughing ] Yeah.
- Hello.
Susan Crenshaw?
- Yes.
I need you to sign.
This is for you.

I swear to God I have no idea how that got there.

I didn't ask him to come here.
If he bribes her to take me a note, I can't control that.
- [ Waitress ] Tommy, I just--
- Get out of here!
- If you want him out of the club, keep him out.
- You bet I will.
If I find out you're seeing him, I'll make the both of you very uncomfortable.

You could've hit her with the rug salesman.
- [ Casey ] No point.
She'd only been seeing him a few weeks.
- [ Tom ] That the last one?
Yup.
But if you get adultery, you can slip out on alimony.
- Didn't want to get into all that.

I was waiting and you never showed and then you're fucking married.
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't have time to play games with you.
Why didn't you come?
It is idiotic to be having this conversation after what happened.
- What are you talking about?
You owe me an explanation.
- Michael.
- There's nothing to explain.
- You haven't told me why you didn't show.
- I shouldn't have to.
- What the hell happened to you?
All right, let's just get this over with.
Where are you?
- I'm in the Salem Street house.
- Oh, God, you're kidding.
- You're renting it?
- Yeah.
You don't do anything halfway, I'll give you that.
- I'll be there in a minute.
And no funny stuff.
- Fine.
- Chambers.
- [ Man On Phone ] Yeah?
Thirty dimes on LSU.
- Thirty?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- [ Phone Turns Off ]
All right, all right, all right, all right.
Get us a field goal.
- Come on.
- Good call to go for the field goal.
You've got time, if you make it, to go for an onside kick.
Here's the kick.
It is long, and it is good.
- A tie.
I can live with a tie.
- We have a tied game, with 1:19 to go, at 13.
I can live with a tie.
Come on, Florida.
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.
Dropping to throw, Morris.
Throwing to the sideline.
Complete.
Out of bounds to Emmitt Smith.
- And that'll stop the clock.
- We're all right.
We're all right.
Morris, deep over the middle, complete to the 45.
- Oh, I can't watch this.
- To the 44-yard line.
They're edging toward field goal range with that catch.
- Again, Morris--
- Oh, God!
God!
- They got a bunch of it.
An 18-yard pickup.
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Thirty seconds remaining now.
Morris is four out of five.
- [ Michael ] Hit him!
Hit!
Emmitt Smith going to the far side of the field.
That may hurt them,
- because they may not be able to stop the clock.
- No more time outs.
They got wrapped up at the 24-yard line by Jimmy Young.
- They're done.
- They're gonna have a hard time stopping the clock.
- The game is over, gentlemen.
- Nine seconds, eight, seven, six,
- five, they're at the 24.
- The game is--
He drops back and throws it away with one second remaining.
I believe the clock is retired, but they'll give 'em the one second.
They'll give 'em the one second even though the clock shows nothing.
It's come down to this.
This field goal try... will be attempted from about 41 yards.
Here's the snap, the kick; it's high.
It is long, and it is...
good!
Florida has won on the final play of the game.
Sixteen to thirteen.
In the final analysis, it will be the penalties... and the Tigers' mistakes that cost them this win, because they really played well against the Florida Gators.
[ Michael's Voice ] I got good news, and I got bad news.
The good news is I have till Tuesday to cough it up.
The bad news is I have till Tuesday to cough it up.
So I have a year to get you a present, right?
- Yup.
- I figured I'd get you something you could really use.
Like hemlock.
Happy?
[ Clicking Tongue ] Like an Oscar winner.
You know me.
I like money.
- Not much.
- Beats goin' to jail.
Jail?
What's jail got to do with it?
Ask your brother.
What?
What did he do?
He threatened me.
How?
When?
When you left town, he was pursuing me.
He'd call.
He'd follow me.
This went on for a long time.
I kept asking him to stop.
Finally he did.
-That night we talked about going away--
-Mm-hmm.
He saw us.
He saw us in the car.
He came to see me.
He said he was still obsessed with me, that if he couldn't have me, neither could you.
He tried to come on to me.
I started screaming at him.
If I didn't stay away from you,
- he'd frame me for possession and send me up.
- Jesus.
I tried to call his bluff, and he pulled out a bag... and started dragging me to his car.
Why didn't you call me?
Because when your psychopathic brother with a badge starts throwing his weight around,
I figured, forget this.
And forget you.
The Chambers family is a bad investment.
But why Tommy?
Why marry Tommy?
- He did ask.
- Aw, come on.
That's not a reason.
- You asked once.
- Tell me it was the same thing.
Look me in the eye, and tell me it was the same thing.
He treats me bad.
- Look at my arms.
- [ Gasps ] Oh, my God, Rachel.
I know they've killed people.
I just know it.
I don't know how to get out of it.
You can get out of it.
How?
I'm married to Mack the Knife.
How do I get out of it?
We leave.
We'll live somewhere else.
I'm good at leaving.
You know that.
He'll find us.
No, he won't.
[ Indistinct Noise ]
- What was that?
- Somebody's in the house.
[ Stairs Creak ]
[ Rachel ] Michael?
In here.
[ Tommy ] Hi, hon.
You know, it don't look right.
You... can't exactly say it looks right, now can you?
It's a risk... in business that the people closest to you... may do you wrong.
Usually I can...
figure out a way to get... satisfaction.
Let's say they're...
skimming.
Well, they can give me the money back, work it off, something.
I'm... pretty good at balancing these things out.
But, see, you can't unfuck my wife!
So I find myself looking to the outer edges of... acceptable behavior to... make myself feel better.
It's not nice, what comes to mind.
- Tommy, it was my idea to come--
- That's not helping, hon!
I wanted to talk to you.
So the napkin should have been under my drink.
Now everything makes sense.
I had it all wrong, didn't I?
- That's right.
- I see.
I wanted to make you a business proposition.
I wanted her opinion first about how best to approach you.
And she suggested that you... seduce her as a way to approach me?
What business could we possibly have together?
A job.
[ Tommy ] A job.
A job job?
Yeah.
Why come to me?
You're the only crook I know.
ls that... polite?
What kind of a job is it, Michael, that you need a crook?
- Where I work.
- Where you work.
Armored cars.
I work with armored cars.
And?
And every Monday the cars go to the retailers, and they collect all the cash from over the weekend:
lottery ticket sales and merchandise sales.
It's taken back to the company to be verified.
And the whole wad's taken to the bank.
ln one truck.
Could be anywhere from a couple hundred thousand to a million.
Small bills.
Totally untraceable.
Well.
Hey, school's out.
So what now?
[ Conversation Continues, Indistinct ]
[ Door Closes ]
- Well, it's you and me, kid.
- What?
- George collared me.
- Oh, th-that's not fair.
Y-You've been out all day.
- [ Chuckles ]
- What about Casey, Tom?
- Suddenly I'm not good enough?
- No, no, that's not it.
It's just what I said.
You've been out all day.
[ Sniffles ] Aah, it's a short run.
- Number 19, Chambers and Dutton.
- Well, here we go.
[ Dispatcher ] Number 19, Chambers and Dutton.
[ Michael ] Trucks complete their runs by 4:00.
[ Michael ] Trucks complete their runs by 4:00.
The money's wrapped and verified by 6:00.
The truck has to be at the bank by 6:30, or the company pays the interest on missing the day.
So the entire facility is geared towards getting every dollar on that truck.
This is how it works.
When we get into the bank, there are loading docks in the secured delivery area.
You go in, just after we arrive, in a van, posing as a legitimate vendor using the 4-digit access code which I'll provide.
- And then you scoop it up.
- How do you make sure you're the driver?
I check.
If I'm not assigned, I go to the driver... and tell him I need the extra hours.
- And he just gives them to you?
- I can be pretty persuasive.
Hmm.
If it goes smoothly, they'll know somebody was on the inside.
- They're gonna put heat on you.
- I just keep denying it.
There's nothing they can do.
- They're gonna put heat on you.
- I just keep denying it.
There's nothing they can do.
All right, this is how we'll handle it.
I know this guy, a broker.
I don't know his name, and I don't want to know his name, because he is serious.
You think I can exert pressure?
This guy scares the shit out of me.
But this is what he does-- He organizes jobs.
He's got some high-level day gig with an insurance company or something, so he knows all the ways to beat the cops and the ops.
That's why nobody knows him by name or face.
I call him up and tell him everything about what we're doing.
And then he puts the whole thing together.
He hires the men from out of town.
You won't know them.
They will not know you.
They'll just do the job, and then they will drop at a predetermined time... to a predetermined person at a predetermined place.
That's good.
Who handles the drop?
We'll use one of my guys.
- I want somebody I know.
- Gee, that's tough, Michael!
I want somebody I know!
- What about her?
- "What about her" what?
He wants you to hold the money.
And if I say no?
- Then it's off.
- You're holdin' the money.
When?
- The sooner the better.
- One more thing.
I'm not taking a short count.
The broker alone takes 20 percent on any job he crews.
It's a two-way split.
You can cut your half any way you like.
I'd rather eat airline food.
Can you do it without me?
- Well, Michael, you know I can't.
- Then it's 50-50.
- I don't like it.
- When you see all that cash, you'll like it.
So what's the total for the day?
About a million three.
Hello?
- Hello?
- When you pass Brazos--
- Who is this?
- Shut up.
When you pass Brazos going down Fifth Street, you'll see a man wearing a yellow suit and sunglasses.
If our end is going according to plan, he'll take off his sunglasses.
If your end is going according to plan, you signal him by lifting your fingers off the wheel for one second.
If you don't lift your fingers, we will assume you want to abort.
- Wh-What if-- - [ Click ]
Thanks for calling.
§§ [ Country Rock ]
Are you sure we should go through with this?
You could say they wouldn't switch you--
No, no, we're very close now.
We have to follow it through.
It's gonna be fine.
This time tomorrow, the hard part will be over.
God, I hope so.
Once you get the drop, drive straight to Whispering Pines.
Don't stop for anything.
It may take me a couple of days.
They'll be asking questions.
We'll have to let things cool off.
I can't wait for this whole thing to be over.
Watch it!
Jesus!
Sorry.
Whenever you're ready, Michael.
Yeah.
- Cash or coins first?
- Ed, I hate to ask you this, but could I stay with the truck?
- How come?
- Well, there's a woman in the bank I'd prefer not--
- Ohh, a woman. [ Laughs ]
- No problem.
Thanks.

- [ Assistant ] Very proud.
And even though you've only been with the company a short time, we want to make very sure that you don't worry about the financial side of your illness.
As a matter of fact, when the time comes, we'd like very much to do an in-depth profile of you for Armored Transport Now!
I think I told you it's read by everyone in the industry.
- Don't forget about Mr. Fox.
- Oh, yes, Mr. Fox, the founder of Perennial and a wonderful man, would like to meet you and have his photograph taken with you... to accompany the article.
When the time comes, of course.
When the time comes.
I said, is there something I should know?
Ah, you're all right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
How about you?
I can't tell.
Michael.
Michael.
They've been asking questions.
The police and your brother.
My brother.
I think they want something.
And I don't think what they want is good for you.
I told you.
Those things never meet.
Yeah, you told me.
I told you.
I told you.
I told you.
No, you didn't, Mr. Chambers.
-I'm sorry?
-I want you to describe what happened... from the moment you entered the delivery bay of Grand Texas Bank... until you lost consciousness.
I-
- I-I pulled up.
I pulled into the dock.
- Dock number one.
- Yes, number one.
I-I-I a-and Ed.
I, uh, I turned the engine off, and, and Ed--
Oh, they killed him.
Didn't they kill him?
Yes.
[ Breathing Heavily ]
Maybe, uh, maybe we should come back.
[ Crying ]
You fake bastard.
You think you got everybody fooled.
You think because the job was sloppy and people got shot, nobody thinks you were in.
It won't wash.
I'm gonna bring you down.
Not because you got Ed killed, although that would be plenty reason enough.
But because I think you're worthless.
You've always been worthless.
You were nonexistent as a brother to me.
You didn't lift a finger to prop Mom up after Dad died.
You've skated along on your looks and charm, just like a woman, leaving everybody else to clean up after you.
Well, I'm gonna clean up, all right, and I'm starting with you.
Get out.
- You're an accessory to murder.
- No, you don't know what you're talking about.
- You were the inside man;
we both know it.
- You've got nothing.
I've got a bank employee you seduced to obtain a vendor I.D. number.
Uh-huh.
[ Chuckles ]
How did it happen?
They come to you?
Trap you into it?
Was it her?
What kind of shit did she tell you?
Did she make you promises?
Tell you Tommy was mean to her, you two should run away together?
Or did she get you in a compromising situation?
You only had one way out.
Was it like that?
You really think she's waiting for you?
You think you're safe from the bears, locked in your log cabin, bolts on the door?
Well-- [ Chuckles ]
You just locked yourself inside with another bunch of grizzlies.
Here's how.
Let's say she is on the level.
She double-crossed Tommy Dundee, and she's waiting for you.
You think Tommy Dundee is gonna let you get away with that?
You better hope she double-crossed you and that her and Tommy are laughing, because if she's not with him right now, somebody's gonna make their way in here to check on you.
And they won't be interested in your full recovery.
[ Chuckles ]
I suppose I could protect you, stake somebody outside the door.
But since you're such a hero,
I convinced my boss you wouldn't need protection.
Who'd want to hurt the man of the hour?
The pillar of courage?
Hell, people want to shake your hand.
Couple uniforms downstairs to keep away the press and the well-wishers, sure.
But somebody outside the door?
What's the point?
- It's all your fault.
- Right!
- Oh, if you'd left her alone.
- No.
If you had left her alone!
What is it with you?
Thank God you're bedridden.
I wouldn't be able to stomach the hypocrisy of you showing up to Ed's funeral... and standing next to our mother.
[ Breathing Heavily ]
[ Relieved Sigh ]
Mr. Chambers, how are you?
What can I help you with?
Could you adjust these pillows?
My neck is really getting stiff.
Of course.
Well, part of the problem is you've got your bed... tilted too far forward.
Let me take you down--
No, no, no!
I really like it this way.
-But--
-It's just the pillow.
The angle's fine.
- If you could just adjust the pillows.
- All right.
- How's that?
- Fine, thank you.
I was about to see you anyway.
It's time for your pill.
That's all right.
I really don't need it.
Well, I think you'll find it very difficult to sleep without it.
It's okay.
Maybe a little later.
I really feel okay.
Well, you don't look okay.
No, really.
I'll have it later.
If you say so.
Say-
- Could you tell me who that gentleman is waiting out there?
Why is he here?
Oh, that's Mr. Rodman.
His sister was in a traffic accident last night and hasn't woken up yet.
Maybe he'd like to come in and talk to me?
I don't know.
I can certainly ask, although visiting hours are nearly over.
Could you ask?
I'd really, really appreciate it.
Of course.
Leave the door open!
[ Nurse Talking To Mr. Rodman ]
[ Footsteps ]
- Why, Mr. Rodman said he'd be happy to talk with you.
- Thank you.
Uh, Mr. Rodman?
Mr. Chambers.
- Howdy.
- Hello.
Uh, she said you just wanted to talk about--
Yeah, I-I-I-- Please, sit down.
I-I-I, uh, I just sorta came alive... and felt like talking.
With my luck, all my visitors were already gone.
I'd reckon you'd get a lot of visitors.
- Why do you say that?
- You're famous, ain't ya?
Yeah.
Well.
Oh, boy.
What's that?
Your pills?
Yeah.
- That's a pain pill, ain't it?
- Yeah.
That'll make you sleep.
- You better take it, hadn't you?
- No.
I'm fine.
Okay.
So, who, uh-- What you got in there, spare shoes?
- What's that?
- In your coat.
Oh, I gotta carry that for my job.
They're obnoxious as hell, but...
I'm in real estate, and I really don't have a choice.
They're convenient.
So, where'd you say you work?
Oh, I didn't.
Uh, Don Sembera Realty.
Oh.
How long you been there?
About six years.
You must know Jeanette Scott.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Jeanette.
Yeah, she sold me a house once.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
Small world.
Who are you?
I don't know.
Who do you want me to be?
Who are you?
Did Tommy send you?
Buddy, I don't know who you're talking about.
Tommy?
I don't know any Jeanette Scott.
I made that up.
Thank you. l-l didn't know who you were talkin' about either.
I didn't know-
- I didn't recognize that name.
I was tryin' to be agreeable.
Trying to be agreeable!
Tommy Dundee sent you here to kill me!
I'll leave.
I was tryin' to be nice.
I'm sorry.
I mean, goddamn you.
Goddamn you.
My sister's layin' down there, and I don't know if she'll get up again.
- There's other people in here got problems.
- Wait.
Wait, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.
I'm--
I'm-
- I guess I'm a little spooked.
Half the time I-- I--
- I don't know what I'm saying.
- I know, I don't usually talk like that either, but... you catch me off guard like that--
She told me you wanted me to come in here and talk.
- I know.
I'm sorry.
- I wanted to talk too.
P-P-Please sit down again.
I'm sorry.
So, uh, tell me about your job.
Do you like it?
I got a good job.
The market... basically sucks right now, but--
It's-
- Unless you're buying.
Uh, you weren't thinking about buying, were you?
Somebody's gettin' sleepy over there.
Sorry.
Uh, I'm gonna let you sleep.
- No, no, please.
- I'm gonna get out of here.
- No.
Can't do it.
- Uh, could you do me a favor?
Just a small favor.
A favor?
Yeah, I'd really appreciate it.
Really.
- It ain't a sponge bath, is it?
- [ Chuckles ]
[ Chuckles ] That was good.
If you could, uh, just wait here until I've gotten a little nap?
Just sit here with me for a while until I've slept good.
I'd like to, but-- I got my sister down there.
Please. l--
I just need a little sleep.
- Okay.
Just for a little bit, okay?
- Thank you.
I'm just so, uh--
I'm just gonna sit over here, okay?
[ Gasping ]
[ Bed Clanking ]
It's time to go.
[ Moaning ]
What's he paying' you?
Ten?
Twenty-five?
I'll give you a hundred.
You know I've got it.
You know I do.
[ Moans ]
Rachel.
I don't know how it happened when you were a kid, or who you learned it from.
But you have very strange ideas about... sharing.
All our negotiating, 20 percent, 50 percent, that's playground bullshit.
A fair share is whatever you can take.
And I'm taking everything.
[ Gunshot ]
[ Tommy Sighs ]
Oh, Jesus Christ, Howard!
You're not gonna bleed like this are you?
Rachel.
Rachel.
Rachel.
Rachel!
Please.
[ Grunting ]
Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you fucking kidding me?
You have made a mistake.
I will deal with you and your mistake in a moment.
You--
You don't have any choice.
You have to shoot me.
But I don't think you will.
[ Gunshot ]
[ Michael Moaning ]
Oh.
I can't get up.
If you could just... give me a hand--
[ Moaning ]
When you left, there was something I didn't understand.
You didn't just leave me, you left... everybody.
Everything.
It made me feel very... interchangeable.
But now I understand the appeal of just walking away.
There's something very powerful about being absent.
I think you did the right thing when you left.
But you shouldn't have come back.
Rachel.
Rachel, please.
[ Falling Over ]
Michael.
Right?
[ Car Starting ]
[ Car Starting ]
[ Car Starting ]
- Are you getting off at Austin?
- Huh?
Yeah.
- Going home?
- Sort of.
- Visiting?
- Yeah.
- Relatives.
- Yeah.
- What kind?
- Mother and brother.
Mother's getting married.
- Is he nice?
- My brother?
No.
The man your mother's gonna marry.
Haven't met him.
- I'm Susan.
- Michael.
- So you live here?
- Yeah.
- Where do you work?
- I'm training to be a teller at the Grand Texas Bank.
So when do you take your test?
I don't know.
It's a self-study, so you can take it whenever you're ready.
Just don't think that I'm ready yet.
Well, there's one way to find out.
Mom?
Michael?
Michael!
- Give me a hug!
- Oh, I stink.
I've been on a bus.
I don't care.
Nice butt.
You bastard.
- How's it goin'?
- Good, good, good.
Shouldn't you be out clubbing motorists or something?
No, I'm on the night shift.
Plus, I'm beating the homeless now.
- Oh, I see.
- They're not as mobile.
So...
how's it goin'?
It's goin'.
You workin'?
- You hiring'?
- Yeah.
That's what the force needs:
another confused white boy.
Hear she's dating a small-time hood that bought the Ember, if you're interested.
I'm here for the wedding.
Tell me about Ed.
Did you run a check on him?
- No, I did not.
- Bullshit, I know you did.
All right, a small one.
But he's clean.
- No moving violations, no nothin'?
- Not in Texas.
Hurray for Mom.
I don't know.
I, uh--
I can't decide right now.
You go first.
I don't play the lottery.
It's a waste of money.
Well, if I won, it's always been a dream of mine to breed dogs.
- No.
No.
- No?
Okay.
- How 'bout a stamp collection then?
- Okay, that I'll go for.
All right.
- How 'bout you, Michael?
- I wouldn't believe it.
If it were true, I'd smile.
I'd just sit there quietly for five minutes, smile and be rich.
I don't know.
Come on, Mom, what?
You know I can't make decisions, but, um--
I know one thing I want, I want the biggest TV they make.
Two of 'em, with everything on it.
- Extra cheese?
- Yeah.
So how long you gonna stay, Michael?
Maybe a little while.
See some friends.
We got an opening, if you're looking for somethin'.
Thanks.
It's a kind offer.
I thought you needed law enforcement or military service for a job like that.
Helpful, but not mandatory.
If I put in a good word, they'd probably take him, no problem.
- Beat goin' back to Sports Town.
- I doubt that would be an option.
This is the official lotto Texas drawing for August 13, 1994.
ln the next 60 seconds, you can become Texas' newest millionaire!
- Are you registered somewhere?
- Michael, when you're getting married at 56, you don't register.
Can you get me some quick picks while you're out?
- Sure.
How many?
- Oh, five or so.
Don't wait up.
Good luck.
I'll ride around your city I'll ride around your town
Don't tell me where you're headed 'cause anywhere you're headed, buddy, I'm bound
Don't talk about your passion Don't talk about your pain
Don't talk about my station 'Cause it doesn't really help the situation
Mind if I sit?
How is it you can show your face without getting hurt?
I squared with everyone.
- Everyone?
- Okay.
So how are you?
Tommy, this is Michael Chambers.
Michael, Tommy Dundee.
- Heard you moved.
- Mother's getting married.
- To who?
- A good guy.
Never heard of him.
Well.
Let Tommy buy you a drink.
You'll buy him a drink, won't you?
- I'll buy him a drink.
- Some other time.
Good to see you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Uh, yeah.
- What the hell was that?
- What?
- What's he doing here?
- I don't know.
He just showed up.
Yeah, nobody's ex just shows up.
He wants something.
- Don't have an aneurysm.
- Let's go in the back.
I'm tired of watching guys sit up and b-b-beg you.
It's like goddamn Sea World in here.
§ 'Cause I found an angel with a broken wing §
- Hey, did you get my Twinkie?
- Huh?
- My Twinkie.
Did you get it?
- I'm sorry, you wanted a Twinkie?
- I'm kidding, Michael.
- Oh, okay.
- Close it up.
- All right.
I hope I didn't wake you when I came in.
Did you get my quick picks?
Oh, jeez, I totally forgot.
I'm sorry.
I-I'll get some, I'll get some today.
Rachel called.
She leave a number?
By the phone.
We're on the back nine, a short par four.
I hit a big tee shot.
Lands in the wrong fairway.
This guy hits a beautiful drive, cuts past the dogleg, drops about 20 yards from the pin.
Do you wanna hear this?
- Please.
- Okay.
- Uh, where was I?
- The pin.
Right, right.
So I'm down 200 for the game.
This jerk is really riding' me, talking about my hair gettin' in my eyes and crap like that.
So I bet him two grand I could win the hole.
He says, why not three?
I say, why not five?
Then he hesitates.
He says, okay, five.
Then I knew he was... a eunuch.
So, I'm 230 yards out, I hit the best three... wood of my life.
I'm on the green, putting for a bird.
He sculls his approach shot, the ball sails over the green.
- He's double bogey for the hole.
- Gosh, that's exciting.
- If you keep this up--
- Keep what up?
Chambers!
- Yeah?
- How'd you know Dallas was gonna beat the spread?
You know, I can't begin to describe to you how.
- I just knew.
- Some people are interested in trying to garnish your wages.
- I suggest you take care of 'em.
- Okay, thanks.
Take my advice.
Don't spend that money.
- Get yourself squared.
- Thanks.
Feels almost as good as you.
God, I love betting.
I was surprised to get your call.
I was surprised to see you at the club.
Just getting my weekly dose of secondhand smoke.
Right.
- So how's the acting gig?
- I gave it up.
- Really?
- Isn't that what you wanted?
I never interfered.
Oh.
So beneath the apathetic exterior, there was actually a raging indifference.
I get it.
- So tell me about Tommy Dundee.
- Tommy?
- We go out.
- How long?
A few months.
He treat you okay?
Not as well as guys without money.
He's gonna teach me how to manage the club.
He looks like he might be into a few things besides managing a club.
Yeah.
- For instance?
- I don't know.
You don't know 'cause you don't know, or 'cause you don't want to know?
I don't know 'cause I don't ask.
I wrote you a long letter after you left about everything.
- Took me a week.
- I never got it.
- I burned it.
- Ooh, I walked right into that one.
Must be a new sensation for you, walking into something.
- ls this yours?
- Yup.
- Nice.
- Men buy me Mustangs.
I don't know why.
- Can I see you again?
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Rachel.
- You humiliated me.
I didn't get a warning, an explanation, and I had to deal with all the ugly shit you left behind.
- It wasn't right.
- I know that.
Don't call me.
Don't try and find me.
It makes it hard with Tommy.
- She goes where?
- To the library.
She's been taking this correspondence course.
She's studying.
- Until 11:00 every night.
- It closes at 11:00.
I checked.
Gee, you're a one-man Warren Commission.
Take my advice.
Follow her.
- I couldn't do that.
- You'll thank me.
- Hey, Ed.
- How's it going, boys?
You know, same shit, different day.
I wanted you to meet Michael Chambers, Annie's boy.
He's putting in an application.
- Tom.
- Casey.
- Nice to meet you.
- Comin' to work here?
- Yeah.
- You'll love it.
If you like saltpeter.
Someone under 40, you tryin' to scare him off?
- Just doin' our part.
- Look at us.
We're only 22 years old.
- See you guys later.
- Nice to meet you.
The library?
That's right.
Ed, Ed!
Can you take my spot on number five run?
Deborah's having some strange contractions...
- and I'm gonna meet her at the doctor's office.
- Okay.
Go ahead.
- I'll take it.
- Oh, thanks.
- You better start workin' so I can retire.
- I'll do my best.
Let me tell you about Hinkle.
When you first go in, he'll offer you a candy mint.
Don't take it.
At the end of the meeting, he'll offer it to you again.
Take it and eat it right in front of him.
You'll get the job.
You're kidding, right?
Do I look like I'm kidding?
- First time, no; second time, yes?
- That's it.
Okay.
Thanks.
Mint?
No, thank you.
Fine.
Ed Dutton speaks highly of you.
He's a very good man, Ed.
I hope so.
He'll be my stepfather in a few days.
Yes.
That's a copy of Armored Transport Now!
It's a magazine we publish, not just for ourselves, but for the entire industry.
And here I thought cash was on the way out.
Many of the services we provide here used to be provided by the banks.
For example, a bank might have us pick up all the cash from a fast-food chain, process and verify it here and then deposit it directly into the Fed, bypassing their branch altogether.
- That sort of thing.
- Oh, I see.
May I keep this?
Where have you been working the past couple of years?
- Offshore.
- That's serious work.
Serious money.
- You have any experience with firearms?
- No.
He'll learn.
We don't need marksmen, just people who can think clearly.
That I can do.
Good.
Well.
Are you sure you wouldn't like a mint?
Actually, now that you mention it, I would.
We'll be in touch.
Sometime this week, we'll have you come in for the polygraph.
A polygraph?
Great.
I'll look forward to it.
- Where are my fries?
- You didn't ask for fries.
-Well, you got fries.
-Michael, you want fries, you gotta ask.
Yes, Officer.
- How's Rachel?
- She's fine, doing the audition thing.
- Tell her I said hello.
- I will.
Listen, I talked to Mom last night.
She told me you hadn't sent her any money in two months.
We had an arrangement.
She needs the money.
I got the money.
I can give it to her today, with interest.
-l can give her three months in advance.
-She doesn't care about interest.
She doesn't care about "in advance." She wants to know if you can be counted on.
It's really boring having this conversation every six months.
- I agree.
- Jesus!
This is our mother.
She needs our help.
And seeing you avoid being around after Dad died--
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- You didn't even go see her--
- Can we not turn this into a Eugene O'Neill play?
- I've got the money.
- This time.
Thanks for the protection, Officer.
You never should've left the Village People, David.
Fuck you.
- Hello?
- Michael.
Hi.
- Are you there?
- I'm here.
- How are you?
- Good.
- What about you?
- Good.
- Are you on a car phone?
- Yeah.
Courtesy of--
So, are you staying?
I think so.
I might get that job.
Really?
Um, I gotta go.
- W-W-Wait--
- I'll talk to you soon.
There's one question this test never gets around to asking.
It's a question I need an answer to.
What's that?
When can you start?
- That's it?
- That's it.
- Welcome aboard.
- Eleven.
Forty-one.
Twenty-three.
Here we go.
- What do you think?
- Hmm?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do another one.
- Twelve.
- Not so smiley.
- Nine.
- Much better.
Why go up for this?
It's not acting.
It's exposure.
Like Vanna White, you know.
Oh.
Well, that's something to aspire to.
I hope you like egg salad, 'cause I'm making a ton.
Great.
We'll have it for dinner.
I thought we were going to San Miguel.
Let's go to San Miguel after the game on Saturday.
I gotta make some calls.
I'm not staying in.
I told Diane we'd meet her at the Ember.
That's fine.
I'll be here.
You never do what you say you're gonna do.
Florida at LSU.
This is the fork in the road for both teams.
Some are calling it a toss-up, but given the home field advantage... and nine apparently healthy seniors--
- Remember me?
- Rachel, right?
Dick.
I'm sorry.
Hi, Dick.
God, the picture on this TV sucks.
It sucks, and it's small.
- Smallish and sucky.
- ...convert that threat into scoring opportunities.
- Everybody in yet?
- No, there's one still out.
Hey, come on in!
- Mom, you look beautiful.
- Thank you.
- You really do.
- Thank you.
- That's a nice suit.
- It's Dad's.
I-l wanted to give you this beforehand.
Oh, David, they're beautiful!
I'll have to get my ears pierced.
I don't have anything.
That's all right.
I'm just glad you're here.
I don't need presents.
Would you repeat after me:
With this ring, I thee wed.
With this ring, I thee wed.
And pledge to thee my faith and love.
And pledge to thee my faith and love.
I can't believe you wore Dad's suit to Mom's wedding.
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Well, it depends.
Some say he's doubtful;
some say he's probable.
What's the difference between doubtful and probable?
Doubtful means he probably won't play;
- probable means he'll play, but there's some doubt.
- Oh, that clears everything up.
- So is he doubtful or probable?
- Doubtful.
- Michael, did you get a call--
- How close is your source?
- You wanna know how close my source is, he's a she.
- Wow.
- This is inside inside.
- Wow.
- Michael!
- I gotta go.
Talk to you.
Isn't that amazing?
It's a 12-foot Paraclipse with terrestrial filters.
- I don't care if it turns coffee beans into diamonds--
- How did you know?
- What's it doing in our back yard?
- Wait till you see the image quality.
- It's like looking out a window.
- We have plenty of windows.
We have one more.
It's the new TV.
Excuse me.
ls that thing safe?
Yes, ma'am.
It's, uh, it's safe.
Just don't stand in front of it.
- Come on in.
- Where do you want it?
Try right in front of the fireplace.
God, it's big.
It's huge.
- Did you order a stand?
- It comes with a stand, doesn't it?
- It doesn't come with a stand.
- I gotta have a stand.
- There's one in the truck.
Costs extra.
- Fine, fine.
Don't answer that.
- The one-fifteen.
- Great!
It's huge!
- Michael.
- Yeah.
Tell me you didn't use the rest of the money to buy this stuff.
- Okay, I didn't use the rest of it.
- Thank God.
- I used some of the rest of it.
- Michael!
What else was I gonna use?
We've lost our credit cards.
- You lost our credit cards.
- Fine, I lost 'em.
It doesn't change the fact that I had to use cash.
- How much cash?
- I got an incredible deal for not charging.
- How much?
For everything.
- For the dish, the installation,
- For everything!
Michael!
- the subscription fees-
- About seven.
Hundred?
You're so good.
That's good.
- Seven... thousand.
- Yeah.
How are you gonna pay the people you owe?
They call constantly.
Listen.
I got this whole thing worked out.
It's not even a system.
It's more like, I just know.
I just know which way to bet.
It's like being connected.
It-It's like knowing something that no one else knows.
- God, I wish I could describe the feeling to you.
- You don't have to.
- Hey, how did it go?
- What?
The audition.
Did Jane Duncan call after I left?
Jane Duncan?
No.
When you were on the phone and I was getting ready, did anybody try and click through?
- I don't know.
- They were trying to call me not to come.
Because they decided to go with a lottery official instead of an actress.
I sat there for an hour looking like an idiot before somebody told me.
I'm sorry.
That must have been awful.
- There's the stand.
- Did you at least remember to get my plane ticket?
Yes and no.
- What the hell does that mean?
- I did remember, but I didn't get it.
- Michael, this audition has been planned for months!
- I got you something else.
- Julie's expecting me!
- I got you something else.
I got you something else.
- What?
What did you do?
- I'll give you a hint.
We don't have enough to fly to L.A., but you could drive there in style.
What?
That's mine?
- Michael--
- You hate it, I'll take it back.
- Wait.
- Uh, if you like it, we'll keep it.
- You make me really, really mad.
- Ooh, careful!
Careful, it'll come off.
Oh, I don't know, about 45 minutes.
Forty-five minutes?
What do you think went on in there?
I don't know.
I wasn't inside.
You don't have to be inside to figure it out.
- Look, I gotta trust her.
- Michael Chambers, line 2.
- Michael Chambers, line 2.
- You're either very smart or very stupid.
I can't figure out which.
- Hello.
- It's me.
He proposed.
Christ.
Christ.
What did you say?
I pretended I wasn't expecting it.
I said I needed time.
This is my problem:
When I think about trying again with you,
I have no idea if it's a moment of strength or a moment of weakness.
Do you remember the last time we went away?
- The conversation we had in front of the fire?
- Yes.
I don't want to be on the outside.
It's too painful.
I won't make that mistake again.
I promise.
What do you think would happen if we went away for the weekend?
I don't see how we can resolve this any other way.
We could go back to Whispering Pines.
We could do that.
We had a good time there.
What about Tommy?
I'll pick you up Friday at 6:00.
- Can we take my car?
- Yeah, we can take your car.
I forgot.
Suddenly, Friday at 6:00 seems like a long way off.
It's only two days.
- All you have to do is say no.
- No.
The mobile customer is away from the phone... or has traveled beyond the service area.
Please call again later.
Take my courage
- Rachel around?
- Nope.
- What about Tommy?
- Nope.
It's sort of important.
We were supposed to hook up, and she never showed.
- Don't know where she is?
- Everybody got in a car and took off.
- Where to?
- Uh, Vegas, I think.
- Rachel too?
You're sure?
- She's hard to miss.
Michael.
Hi.
How are you?
- Good.
I had a feeling I'd see you.
- Yeah, me too.
- Hi, I'm Deborah.
- Hi.
Michael.
- I'm sorry.
Listen, I'm sorry.
I-I gotta run.
- Oh.
I'll talk to you soon?
- Yeah.
- Still have my number?
You're sure?
- Yeah.
It was nice to meet you.
I'll speak to you soon.
- I gotta go.
- Bye.
- He'll call.
- What do you want?
You met the guy on a bus.
Have you seen David lately?
Not since you and Ed got divorced-- married!
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Michael, when you get to be my age, you realize... sometimes the planets just don't line up.
And there's nothing you can do about it.
Of course, sometimes they do line up.
And there's nothing you can do about that either.
Hi, this is Susan Crenshaw.
I'm not in right now, but if you leave me a message, I'll call you right back.
- Hi, this is Michael Chambers.
I'm sorry to call so late--
- Hello!
- Oh, you're there.
- Yeah.
- I just didn't feel like talking to anybody.
- Okay, bye.
No, I didn't mean you.
What are you doing?
Sittin' around.
What are you doing?
Sitting around.
Are you with me?
Yeah.
I feel like you're somewhere else.
I feel like I'm in an ad for fine wine.
But it's nice, really nice.
I like to be close.
This is close.
This is close to you?
Isn't it?
You're not very present tense.
Is that like an acting thing?
I love you.
That was nice.
There's somebody else, isn't there?
- Sort of.
- Sort of?
Where is she?
I don't know.
There's what you want and there's what's good for you.
- Uh, they never meet.
- They never meet.
Except for my mother and stepfather.
Maybe they think they're wrong for each other.
Nah, they're too old for that shit.
Then why do anything with anybody?
Because anything is better than nothing.
The idea that you think you make sense is really terrifying.
Yeah, I know.
- Have a nice day, Michael.
- Nice seein' you.
That the last of it?
- That the last of it, Michael?
- Yeah.
Listen.
Give me two minutes.
I gotta use the bathroom.
Michael?
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Good.
And you?
Good.
Did you just get here?
- No, just on my way out.
- I have to go downstairs to meet a delivery.
Great.
I'll go with you.
Later they find out that Bob, this manager, is letting this new guy fill the ATM... without having the second person there with the offsetting key.
Which you're not supposed to do, obviously.
It turns out this guy was stealing money... and splitting it with Bob.
- A little office intrigue.
- Yeah.
- Hello.
Susan Crenshaw?
- Yes.
I need you to sign.
This is for you.
- Here you go.
Bye-bye.
- Bye.
So.
Yeah.
- Back to work.
- All right.
Take care.
- Rachel in tonight?
- Haven't seen her.
Hey, I need three scotch waters, dirty Tanqueray martini up, two Rolling Rock and a Red Stripe.
I'm trying to get a message to Rachel. is she here?
Tommy's wife?
Yeah.
Tommy's wife?
Right.
Tommy's wife.
- Yeah, she's in back.
- Do me one small favor,
and the other half... is yours.
- Call it.
- It's my club.
That's what I call it.
Steve Austin can walk the plank
Doin' the skoliosis skank
Hey.
I-l put it down right in front of her, and she wouldn't look at it,
- so--
- Thanks.
Doin' the skoliosis skank
This song's about Jeremy's back
Yeah!
Loser racks.
Whatcha readin' about, hon?
Tit jobs?
Yeah, I'm thinkin' about having one put on my forehead.
Could be interesting.
- What the hell is this?
- What?
What the hell is this?
I don't know.
- Are you rolling this guy behind my back?
- Tommy.
I swear to God I have no idea how that got there.
That's all that happened, Tommy, I swear.
See?
I didn't ask him to come here.
If he bribes her to take me a note, I can't control that.
- Tommy, I just--
- Get out of here!
- If you want him out of the club, keep him out.
- You bet I will.
If I find out you're seeing him, I'll make the both of you very uncomfortable.
Why "uncontested"?
You could've hit her with the rug salesman.
- No point.
She'd only been seeing him a few weeks.
- That the last one?
Yup.
But if you get adultery, you can slip out on alimony.
- Didn't want to get into all that.
- He'll never make it.
The company'll be eating interest big time, especially on this haul.
He'll make it.
He'll make it.
George Rittenhouse, line three.
George Rittenhouse, line three.
Yeah?
What?
Oh, no.
I'll be right there.
- Deborah broke water.
- Hey, good luck.
- Good luck!
- Thanks!
So why didn't you want to get into it?
- Bastard.
Who?
- Somebody.
- Since when?
- Since before the beginning.
- Hello.
Myself speaking.
- That was a really stupid thing to do.
- Don't ever show up again.
- Rach!
Where are you?
- I'm in my car.
- What happened?
I was waiting and you never showed and then you're fucking married.
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't have time to play games with you.
Why didn't you come?
It is idiotic to be having this conversation after what happened.
- What are you talking about?
You owe me an explanation.
- Michael.
- There's nothing to explain.
- You haven't told me why you didn't show.
- I shouldn't have to.
- What the hell happened to you?
All right, let's just get this over with.
Where are you?
- I'm in the Salem Street house.
- Oh, God, you're kidding.
- You're renting it?
- Yeah.
You don't do anything halfway, I'll give you that.
- I'll be there in a minute.
And no funny stuff.
- Fine.
- Chambers.
- Yeah?
Thirty dimes on LSU.
- Thirty?
- Yeah.
Okay.
All right, all right, all right, all right.
Get us a field goal.
- Come on.
- Good call to go for the field goal.
You've got time, if you make it, to go for an onside kick.
Here's the kick.
It is long, and it is good.
- A tie.
I can live with a tie.
- We have a tied game, with 1:19 to go, at 13.
I can live with a tie.
Come on, Florida.
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.
Dropping to throw, Morris.
Throwing to the sideline.
Complete.
Out of bounds to Emmitt Smith.
- And that'll stop the clock.
- We're all right.
We're all right.
Morris, deep over the middle, complete to the 45.
- Oh, I can't watch this.
- To the 44-yard line.
They're edging toward field goal range with that catch.
- Again, Morris--
- Oh, God!
God!
- They got a bunch of it.
An 18-yard pickup.
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Thirty seconds remaining now.
Morris is four out of five.
- Hit him!
Hit!
Emmitt Smith going to the far side of the field.
That may hurt them,
- because they may not be able to stop the clock.
- No more time outs.
They got wrapped up at the 24-yard line by Jimmy Young.
- They're done.
- They're gonna have a hard time stopping the clock.
- The game is over, gentlemen.
- Nine seconds, eight, seven, six,
- five, they're at the 24.
- The game is--
He drops back and throws it away with one second remaining.
I believe the clock is retired, but they'll give 'em the one second.
They'll give 'em the one second even though the clock shows nothing.
It's come down to this.
This field goal try... will be attempted from about 41 yards.
Here's the snap, the kick; it's high.
It is long, and it is...
good!
Florida has won on the final play of the game.
Sixteen to thirteen.
In the final analysis, it will be the penalties... and the Tigers' mistakes that cost them this win, because they really played well against the Florida Gators.
I got good news, and I got bad news.
The good news is I have till Tuesday to cough it up.
The bad news is I have till Tuesday to cough it up.
So I have a year to get you a present, right?
- Yup.
- I figured I'd get you something you could really use.
Like hemlock.
Happy?
Like an Oscar winner.
You know me.
I like money.
- Not much.
- Beats goin' to jail.
Jail?
What's jail got to do with it?
Ask your brother.
What?
What did he do?
He threatened me.
How?
When?
When you left town, he was pursuing me.
He'd call.
He'd follow me.
This went on for a long time.
I kept asking him to stop.
Finally he did.
-That night we talked about going away--
-Mm-hmm.
He saw us.
He saw us in the car.
He came to see me.
He said he was still obsessed with me, that if he couldn't have me, neither could you.
He tried to come on to me.
I started screaming at him.
If I didn't stay away from you,
- he'd frame me for possession and send me up.
- Jesus.
I tried to call his bluff, and he pulled out a bag... and started dragging me to his car.
Why didn't you call me?
Because when your psychopathic brother with a badge starts throwing his weight around,
I figured, forget this.
And forget you.
The Chambers family is a bad investment.
But why Tommy?
Why marry Tommy?
- He did ask.
- Aw, come on.
That's not a reason.
- You asked once.
- Tell me it was the same thing.
Look me in the eye, and tell me it was the same thing.
He treats me bad.
- Look at my arms.
- Oh, my God, Rachel.
I know they've killed people.
I just know it.
I don't know how to get out of it.
You can get out of it.
How?
I'm married to Mack the Knife.
How do I get out of it?
We leave.
We'll live somewhere else.
I'm good at leaving.
You know that.
He'll find us.
No, he won't.
- What was that?
- Somebody's in the house.
Michael?
In here.
Hi, hon.
You know, it don't look right.
You... can't exactly say it looks right, now can you?
It's a risk... in business that the people closest to you... may do you wrong.
Usually I can...
figure out a way to get... satisfaction.
Let's say they're...
skimming.
Well, they can give me the money back, work it off, something.
I'm... pretty good at balancing these things out.
But, see, you can't unfuck my wife!
So I find myself looking to the outer edges of... acceptable behavior to... make myself feel better.
It's not nice, what comes to mind.
- Tommy, it was my idea to come--
- That's not helping, hon!
I wanted to talk to you.
So the napkin should have been under my drink.
Now everything makes sense.
I had it all wrong, didn't I?
- That's right.
- I see.
I wanted to make you a business proposition.
I wanted her opinion first about how best to approach you.
And she suggested that you... seduce her as a way to approach me?
What business could we possibly have together?
A job.
A job.
A job job?
Yeah.
Why come to me?
You're the only crook I know.
ls that... polite?
What kind of a job is it, Michael, that you need a crook?
- Where I work.
- Where you work.
Armored cars.
I work with armored cars.
And?
And every Monday the cars go to the retailers, and they collect all the cash from over the weekend:
lottery ticket sales and merchandise sales.
It's taken back to the company to be verified.
And the whole wad's taken to the bank.
ln one truck.
Could be anywhere from a couple hundred thousand to a million.
Small bills.
Totally untraceable.
Well.
Hey, school's out.
So what now?
- Well, it's you and me, kid.
- What?
- George collared me.
- Oh, th-that's not fair.
Y-You've been out all day.
What about Casey, Tom?
- Suddenly I'm not good enough?
- No, no, that's not it.
It's just what I said.
You've been out all day.
Aah, it's a short run.
- Number 19, Chambers and Dutton.
- Well, here we go.
Number 19, Chambers and Dutton.
Trucks complete their runs by 4:00.
The money's wrapped and verified by 6:00.
The truck has to be at the bank by 6:30, or the company pays the interest on missing the day.
So the entire facility is geared towards getting every dollar on that truck.
This is how it works.
When we get into the bank, there are loading docks in the secured delivery area.
You go in, just after we arrive, in a van, posing as a legitimate vendor using the 4-digit access code which I'll provide.
- And then you scoop it up.
- How do you make sure you're the driver?
I check.
If I'm not assigned, I go to the driver... and tell him I need the extra hours.
- And he just gives them to you?
- I can be pretty persuasive.
If it goes smoothly, they'll know somebody was on the inside.
- They're gonna put heat on you.
- I just keep denying it.
There's nothing they can do.
- They're gonna put heat on you.
- I just keep denying it.
There's nothing they can do.
All right, this is how we'll handle it.
I know this guy, a broker.
I don't know his name, and I don't want to know his name, because he is serious.
You think I can exert pressure?
This guy scares the shit out of me.
But this is what he does-- He organizes jobs.
He's got some high-level day gig with an insurance company or something, so he knows all the ways to beat the cops and the ops.
That's why nobody knows him by name or face.
I call him up and tell him everything about what we're doing.
And then he puts the whole thing together.
He hires the men from out of town.
You won't know them.
They will not know you.
They'll just do the job, and then they will drop at a predetermined time... to a predetermined person at a predetermined place.
That's good.
Who handles the drop?
We'll use one of my guys.
- I want somebody I know.
- Gee, that's tough, Michael!
I want somebody I know!
- What about her?
- "What about her" what?
He wants you to hold the money.
And if I say no?
- Then it's off.
- You're holdin' the money.
When?
- The sooner the better.
- One more thing.
I'm not taking a short count.
The broker alone takes 20 percent on any job he crews.
It's a two-way split.
You can cut your half any way you like.
I'd rather eat airline food.
Can you do it without me?
- Well, Michael, you know I can't.
- Then it's 50-50.
- I don't like it.
- When you see all that cash, you'll like it.
So what's the total for the day?
About a million three.
Hello?
- Hello?
- When you pass Brazos--
- Who is this?
- Shut up.
When you pass Brazos going down Fifth Street, you'll see a man wearing a yellow suit and sunglasses.
If our end is going according to plan, he'll take off his sunglasses.
If your end is going according to plan, you signal him by lifting your fingers off the wheel for one second.
If you don't lift your fingers, we will assume you want to abort.
Wh-What if--
Thanks for calling.
Are you sure we should go through with this?
You could say they wouldn't switch you--
No, no, we're very close now.
We have to follow it through.
It's gonna be fine.
This time tomorrow, the hard part will be over.
God, I hope so.
Once you get the drop, drive straight to Whispering Pines.
Don't stop for anything.
It may take me a couple of days.
They'll be asking questions.
We'll have to let things cool off.
I can't wait for this whole thing to be over.
Watch it!
Jesus!
Sorry.
Whenever you're ready, Michael.
Yeah.
- Cash or coins first?
- Ed, I hate to ask you this, but could I stay with the truck?
- How come?
- Well, there's a woman in the bank I'd prefer not--
Ohh, a woman.
No problem.
Thanks.
Susan!
Hey, hey, how are you?
Good.
Stay there!
Ed, get down!
Are you awake?
I don't know.
I might-- I might be dreaming.
I might be dreaming.
You're going to be fine.
They say you'll recover completely.
Everyone is very proud of you.
Proud?
For trying to stop the robbery.
I'm--
I'm really sorry you couldn't save Ed.
I know you tried.
I know you tried.
I'm tired, so tired.
Michael.
Michael, if you can understand me, just nod.
I-l can understand.
I want to let you know that Perennial Armored Car...
- is very proud of your performance.
- Very proud.
And even though you've only been with the company a short time, we want to make very sure that you don't worry about the financial side of your illness.
As a matter of fact, when the time comes, we'd like very much to do an in-depth profile of you for Armored Transport Now!
I think I told you it's read by everyone in the industry.
- Don't forget about Mr. Fox.
- Oh, yes, Mr. Fox, the founder of Perennial and a wonderful man, would like to meet you and have his photograph taken with you... to accompany the article.
When the time comes, of course.
When the time comes.
I said, is there something I should know?
Ah, you're all right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
How about you?
I can't tell.
Michael.
Michael.
They've been asking questions.
The police and your brother.
My brother.
I think they want something.
And I don't think what they want is good for you.
I told you.
Those things never meet.
Yeah, you told me.
I told you.
I told you.
I told you.
No, you didn't, Mr. Chambers.
-I'm sorry?
-I want you to describe what happened... from the moment you entered the delivery bay of Grand Texas Bank... until you lost consciousness.
I-
- I-I pulled up.
I pulled into the dock.
- Dock number one.
- Yes, number one.
I-I-I a-and Ed.
I, uh, I turned the engine off, and, and Ed--
Oh, they killed him.
Didn't they kill him?
Yes.
Maybe, uh, maybe we should come back.
You fake bastard.
You think you got everybody fooled.
You think because the job was sloppy and people got shot, nobody thinks you were in.
It won't wash.
I'm gonna bring you down.
Not because you got Ed killed, although that would be plenty reason enough.
But because I think you're worthless.
You've always been worthless.
You were nonexistent as a brother to me.
You didn't lift a finger to prop Mom up after Dad died.
You've skated along on your looks and charm, just like a woman, leaving everybody else to clean up after you.
Well, I'm gonna clean up, all right, and I'm starting with you.
Get out.
- You're an accessory to murder.
- No, you don't know what you're talking about.
- You were the inside man;
we both know it.
- You've got nothing.
I've got a bank employee you seduced to obtain a vendor I.D. number.
How did it happen?
They come to you?
Trap you into it?
Was it her?
What kind of shit did she tell you?
Did she make you promises?
Tell you Tommy was mean to her, you two should run away together?
Or did she get you in a compromising situation?
You only had one way out.
Was it like that?
You really think she's waiting for you?
You think you're safe from the bears, locked in your log cabin, bolts on the door?
Well--
You just locked yourself inside with another bunch of grizzlies.
Here's how.
Let's say she is on the level.
She double-crossed Tommy Dundee, and she's waiting for you.
You think Tommy Dundee is gonna let you get away with that?
You better hope she double-crossed you and that her and Tommy are laughing, because if she's not with him right now, somebody's gonna make their way in here to check on you.
And they won't be interested in your full recovery.
I suppose I could protect you, stake somebody outside the door.
But since you're such a hero,
I convinced my boss you wouldn't need protection.
Who'd want to hurt the man of the hour?
The pillar of courage?
Hell, people want to shake your hand.
Couple uniforms downstairs to keep away the press and the well-wishers, sure.
But somebody outside the door?
What's the point?
- It's all your fault.
- Right!
- Oh, if you'd left her alone.
- No.
If you had left her alone!
What is it with you?
Thank God you're bedridden.
I wouldn't be able to stomach the hypocrisy of you showing up to Ed's funeral... and standing next to our mother.
Mr. Chambers, how are you?
What can I help you with?
Could you adjust these pillows?
My neck is really getting stiff.
Of course.
Well, part of the problem is you've got your bed... tilted too far forward.
Let me take you down--
No, no, no!
I really like it this way.
-But--
-It's just the pillow.
The angle's fine.
- If you could just adjust the pillows.
- All right.
- How's that?
- Fine, thank you.
I was about to see you anyway.
It's time for your pill.
That's all right.
I really don't need it.
Well, I think you'll find it very difficult to sleep without it.
It's okay.
Maybe a little later.
I really feel okay.
Well, you don't look okay.
No, really.
I'll have it later.
If you say so.
Say-
- Could you tell me who that gentleman is waiting out there?
Why is he here?
Oh, that's Mr. Rodman.
His sister was in a traffic accident last night and hasn't woken up yet.
Maybe he'd like to come in and talk to me?
I don't know.
I can certainly ask, although visiting hours are nearly over.
Could you ask?
I'd really, really appreciate it.
Of course.
Leave the door open!
- Why, Mr. Rodman said he'd be happy to talk with you.
- Thank you.
Uh, Mr. Rodman?
Mr. Chambers.
- Howdy.
- Hello.
Uh, she said you just wanted to talk about--
Yeah, I-I-I-- Please, sit down.
I-I-I, uh, I just sorta came alive... and felt like talking.
With my luck, all my visitors were already gone.
I'd reckon you'd get a lot of visitors.
- Why do you say that?
- You're famous, ain't ya?
Yeah.
Well.
Oh, boy.
What's that?
Your pills?
Yeah.
- That's a pain pill, ain't it?
- Yeah.
That'll make you sleep.
- You better take it, hadn't you?
- No.
I'm fine.
Okay.
So, who, uh-- What you got in there, spare shoes?
- What's that?
- In your coat.
I gotta carry that for my job.
They're obnoxious as hell, but...
I'm in real estate, and I really don't have a choice.
They're convenient.
So, where'd you say you work?
I didn't.
Don Sembera Realty.
How long you been there?
About six years.
You must know Jeanette Scott.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Jeanette.
Yeah, she sold me a house once.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
Small world.
Who are you?
I don't know.
Who do you want me to be?
Who are you?
Did Tommy send you?
Buddy, I don't know who you're talking about.
Tommy?
I don't know any Jeanette Scott.
I made that up.
Thank you. l-l didn't know who you were talkin' about either.
I didn't know-
- I didn't recognize that name.
I was tryin' to be agreeable.
Trying to be agreeable!
Tommy Dundee sent you here to kill me!
I'll leave.
I was tryin' to be nice.
I'm sorry.
I mean, goddamn you.
Goddamn you.
My sister's layin' down there, and I don't know if she'll get up again.
- There's other people in here got problems.
- Wait.
Wait, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.
I'm--
I'm-
- I guess I'm a little spooked.
Half the time I-- I--
- I don't know what I'm saying.
- I know, I don't usually talk like that either, but... you catch me off guard like that--
She told me you wanted me to come in here and talk.
- I know.
I'm sorry.
- I wanted to talk too.
P-P-Please sit down again.
I'm sorry.
So, uh, tell me about your job.
Do you like it?
I got a good job.
The market... basically sucks right now, but--
It's-
- Unless you're buying.
Uh, you weren't thinking about buying, were you?
Somebody's gettin' sleepy over there.
Sorry.
Uh, I'm gonna let you sleep.
- No, no, please.
- I'm gonna get out of here.
- No.
Can't do it.
- Uh, could you do me a favor?
Just a small favor.
A favor?
Yeah, I'd really appreciate it.
Really.
It ain't a sponge bath, is it?
That was good.
If you could, uh, just wait here until I've gotten a little nap?
Just sit here with me for a while until I've slept good.
I'd like to, but-- I got my sister down there.
Please. l--
I just need a little sleep.
- Okay.
Just for a little bit, okay?
- Thank you.
I'm just so, uh--
I'm just gonna sit over here, okay?
It's time to go.
What's he paying' you?
Ten?
Twenty-five?
I'll give you a hundred.
You know I've got it.
You know I do.
Rachel.
I don't know how it happened when you were a kid, or who you learned it from.
But you have very strange ideas about... sharing.
All our negotiating, 20 percent, 50 percent, that's playground bullshit.
A fair share is whatever you can take.
And I'm taking everything.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Howard!
You're not gonna bleed like this are you?
Rachel.
Rachel.
Rachel.
Rachel!
Please.
Are you fucking kidding me?
You have made a mistake.
I will deal with you and your mistake in a moment.
You--
You don't have any choice.
You have to shoot me.
But I don't think you will.
I can't get up.
If you could just... give me a hand--
When you left, there was something I didn't understand.
You didn't just leave me, you left... everybody.
Everything.
It made me feel very... interchangeable.
But now I understand the appeal of just walking away.
There's something very powerful about being absent.
I think you did the right thing when you left.
But you shouldn't have come back.
Rachel.
Rachel, please.
Michael.
Right?
Oh, Gracie, I think it's so sweet that you're writing the President a letter.
I mean, he really needs some cheering up.
First, he loses the House and the Senate, then he jogs to McDonald's and finds out a McLean has 10 grams of fat.
Ten?
What about those Chicken McNuggets?
Niles, so that's how you got those McLove handles.
Fran, I don't know what's right.
What's the right way to address the man who runs our entire country?
Dear Newt?
Don't be so smart, you.
"B," you're a good writer.
Go help your sister.
If it's a nice letter, forget it.
/ What?
What are you?
A republican?
I've got a trust fund.
I'm no boob. / Go.
Maxwell, if he wants the damn play, then let him have it.
It isn't even finished.
/ Who?
Andrew Lloyd Webber.
Look, Cee Cee, I found this play first.
I want to produce it.
Just once I want to be on top.
/ I want you on top too, Maxwell.
You're just not going to win.
You might as well give up.
Se la vie. / La vie.
Why shouldn't he try for it?
His shows are just as good.
As good as "Phantom of the Opera"?
/ Uh-huh.
Maxwell, for your own good, give up.
It's a futile fight.
For God sakes, I know when I'm licked.
Just give me a minute to get that image out of my head.
Nope, Nope.
Gonna have to live with it.
It is reassuring no know that if anything happens to me, you're here to continue my work.
Well, maybe she's right.
I should just withdraw the offer.
That way it won't look like I've lost to him again.
Lost?
You haven't even begun to fight.
Mr. Sheffield the only thing that Andrew Lloyd Webber has that you don't is a middle name.
I've got a middle name.
/ Oh, well, there you are.
What is it?
Beverly.
/ Moving on.
Okay.
Here's something else that you have that he doesn't.
Yeah?
What's that, Miss Fine?
/ Me.
Right, Niles?
What about a Whopper?
Fran, you know, Clifford, that geek at my school?
Uh-huh.
Oh, honey, you know, he's not such a geek.
Not everyone can pull off mittens clipped to their sleeves.
Well, he offered to help me with my PSAT's. / Yeah?
But I can't be seen with him.
/ Sweetie, it's the '90's.
Le gdek, chez chic.
See, here's the progression -- pocket protector, software genius, compound in Malibu.
Ohhhh ...
Listen to me.
You'll be smart.
Meanwhile, I'm a maid.
All right.
It's all set.
I'm taking the playwright to dinner tonight.
And I happen to know he fancies himself as a bit of a ladies' man so I thought maybe I'd set him up with Cindy, huh?
Nothing like a super model on the rebound.
Hey?
/ Ohhhh.
Now, you see, Mr. Sheffield, that's why you're wearing Donna Karan, and I'm wearing -- well, actually, I'm wear Donna Karan too, but they cut the label out.
So what's this guy like?
/ Dakota Williams?
Oh, he's an elderly southern gentleman, you know, a real man's man, ah, drinking, chain smoking, plain talking.
Oh, gee, and you want to fix him up with Cindy Crawford.
I don't know.
From Richard Gear to Yosemite Sam?
You know what, leave everything to me.
I have just the gal for you -- cheap, foul-mouthed, finds secondhand smoke a big turn-on.
Oh, Miss Fine, you wouldn't want to go with him.
I didn't mean me.
I hate smoke.
Do you think you can convince this friend of yours to go out with him?
Oh, I don't know.
She's got to be willing to have cocktails in a mansion, dinner at a five-star restaurant, and ride around all night in a limo with some famous guy who's too old to jump her.
Gonna be tough.
Now, Niles, you must be particularly attentive to Mr. Williams this evening.
I want his visit here to be first class in every way.
Yeah, Niles, stay on your toes.
Ohhhh!
Oh, my toes.
Ah, there you are, Miss Fine.
Now guess what.
After dinner I've chartered a boat to take us around Manhattan with a Cajun blues band I've flew in from New Orleans.
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, now you're showing some gumbos.
Oh, he's here.
Nanny Fine, take a powder.
Now, now, now, Cee Cee, if it weren't for Miss Fine, we wouldn't be entertaining a Pulitzer Prize winner here this evening.
Pulitzer Clearing House?
How much did he win?
Miss Fine, take a powder.
Mr. Dakota Williams.
Ah, I'm just Dak to you all.
Welcome.
/ I do not stand on ceremony, and just to prove it, I'll drink anything you got.
As long as it's sour mash whiskey.
/ Oh, we got that, all right.
Don't we, Niles?
/ What are you nuts?
Sir ...
I'm Cee Cee Babcock, Mr. Williams.
Your plays are so profound.
Where do you get your inspiration?
Give me an uptight alcoholic spinster, and I'll give you a play.
Ta-ta.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Oh ...
Sugar, sugar, sugar, little darling, who are you?
Hi, I'm Fran Fine.
You know, I was the lead in one of your plays in high school.
Because of my accent, everyone thought I was from the south.
Must have been an amazing production.
Oh, when I played the death scene with my mamie, how I loved her, how I loved her ...
Anyway, there wasn't a dry eye in Flushing.
Flushing?
Like a toilet?
On a good day.
Oh, Sheffield, this is one saucy woman.
We're going to get along like two June bugs on a summer picnic.
Yeah.
Well, actually, actually, she's not your date. / No.
Huh?
Your date's even cruder.
Yes, much.
I'll get that.
/ Me too.
Oh, Miss Fine, I can taste victory already.
And it's all you.
I have you to thank. / You ain't seen nothing yet.
Wait till you get a load of the chick I fixed him up with.
Ta-ta!
I'm sorry I'm late.
I had to dig up a brassiere that hooks in the front.
What?
No good?
Are you out of your bloody mind?
Oh, look who's here, Bob's Big Boy.
Miss Fine you fixed up America's foremost living playwright with a woman whose greatest attribute is making rice that doesn't stick together?
He was smiling when he met her.
He's drunk out of his mind.
/ All right.
She's on pain killers.
Maybe neither of them will realize they're together.
Miss Fine, Miss Fine, haven't I been good to you?
/ Yes, you have.
Gave you a job when you needed one?
/ Yes, you did.
All the Slim Fast bars you can eat?
/ Uh-huh.
And how do you repay me?
/ I was just trying to be the woman behind the man.
How would you like to be the woman behind the Burger King counter?
The one on 57th Street is hiring.
You know, for a minute there when I saw Yetta,
I thought that she was Dakota's date.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Oh, let me tell her in lieu of a Christmas bonus.
No!
Oh, it's your fault.
Maxwell, let's kill her.
Cee Cee, I prefer to do this without any witnesses.
Niles .../ Oh, huh.
Mr. Sheffield, let me just tell you my thinking.
Andrew Lloyd Webber would have never thought to fix him up with someone like Grandma Yetta.
Well, Nanny Fine finally dug a hole deep enough to bury her and her hair.
Ha, ha.
Oh, Miss Babcock, you have a little something, ah ...
Oh, well, give me that.
How's that?
How do I look?
Yummy.
All right.
Would you keep it down.
We've got company.
Cee Cee?
/ What?
What on earth happened to your face?
She cut herself shaving.
Oh ...
So, anyway, 30 years I'm thinking it's a beauty mark.
Suddenly I wake up, it's the size of Danny DeVito.
Yetta. / Yetta ...
That's nothing.
I got something that looks like a gas cap off a '64 Corvair growing on my butt.
We believe you.
We believe you.
Oh, I got something for you.
But first I gotta take off my girdle.
You little tease.
You're such a turn-on.
Did you hear that?
Yetta, big turn-on.
Excuse me, Mr. Williams.
I know we could all go on and on about Yetta.
Hell, she turns me on.
But why don't we see if we can't work out a deal before you're sober -- supper -- your supper.
Sheffield, is this how you do business?
Aha, just show me where to sign.
Come on, honeysuckle.
It's all body language.
Watch the walk.
Miss Fine, you never cease to amaze me.
Well, I don't know why you're so shocked.
I mean, you asked me to fix the man up with someone.
I followed my instincts.
Simple, yet bonus worthy.
Miss Fine, I could just kiss you.
Coulda, shoulda, woulda, but didn't.
Stop it.
You're embarrassing me.
Oh, he keeps calling me his right arm.
Miss Fine, you have more lives than Garfield.
Oh, Niles, lox, eggs, and onions.
/ Yes.
Grandma Yetta left her breakfast order on the door nob before she went to bed.
Well, when she sleeps over, she always thinks she's at the Fountain Blu.
If you want to make a buck, tie your shirt into a calypso knot and serve her a pina colada.
Oh, Miss Fine ...
/ Coming.
I'm feeling a little short time to get on my pedestal.
Oh, there she is.
/ Who?
My right arm.
Oh, stop it.
You're embarrassing me.
Well, I'm sorry, Miss Fine.
I just can't help it.
I own Dakota Williams' next play.
/ Oh ...
I finally beat Andrew Lloyd Webber, and it wouldn't have happened if it weren't for you.
Oh, you did it all yourself.
I was merely your, um, um ...
Right arm.
Stop it.
You're em -- oh, it's you.
Good morning.
/ Good morning.
Good morning.
I'll have some of everything.
I'm on the American plan.
So, tell me, did the dinner last night go well?
You got home so late.
Oh, she was quite the little vixen.
Oh, Yetta, you didn't drop anything under the table and go look for it, did you?
One time.
Just to see if I still had it.
Good God, that was you?
That was you?
Do you two want to be alone?
Meanwhile, Dak and I are a match made in heaven.
I like dark meat; he likes light.
I could hear the movie;
he could see it.
I got a right lung; he's got a left.
But the best part is he's retired.
No, no, he's not retired yet, Yetta.
He's still got a play to finish.
Good luck.
The man hasn't written a word in 20 years.
Oh, Yetta, you're confused.
Mr. Sheffield just bought his play.
That's right.
The first act is on my desk right now.
Did you happen to notice it was written with a quill pen?
What is she saying?
/ I'm saying don't hold your breath for the second act.
The man's got writer's blockage.
/ Oh, no.
Oh, God ...
Thank you for introducing us.
Most guys my age are senile.
I'll be in the gift shop.
All right.
Let's -- let's recap.
I now own a play that is totally worthless, and Andrew Webber does not.
My right arm is strangely silent.
Did it have a stroke?
It's thinking.
Try and follow me for a minute here.
Why would Dak sign a deal with you when he could have signed a deal with Andrew Lloyd Webber?
Because my plays are just as good.
/ No, really.
It's because of Yetta.
You know, he might back out of the deal if she dumps him.
Wait, wait, Miss Fine, Dak is the most exciting man Yetta's ever met.
I mean, what would possibly make her leave him?
Well, she had her eye on the couch in the lobby.
Yetta ...
I hate when they don't put prices on things.
Honey, where do you start?
Look, Yetta, I know you've grown very fond of Dak, but, well, you should know he drinks far too much.
He swears like a sailor, and, well, frankly, he's a scoundrel with women.
Mr. Sheffield, are you trying to talk her out of it or into it?
Let me handle it.
Yetta, you gotta break up with him.
Why?
He's cute, and he's loaded.
If we got married, some day it would all be yours.
What are we really doing here?
Oh, no, wait a minute, wait a minute.
I can't do this.
I -
- I can't ask her to give up her last chance for happiness just so I can get out of a bloody business deal.
Hold it.
This was business?
I was just a cheap tawdry sex toy?
Why does this always happen to me?
I'm very sorry, Yetta.
Hey, I was there.
How could you not use me?
Business is important.
I myself am an entremanure.
My family's going to have to stop breeding.
Franny, let me talk to your husband in private.
You want to talk business, here's the deal.
I'll give up Dak if you quit fooling around with the blond.
Shame on you.
Look what you've got.
Mags, lighten up.
What's with the unga-blues-onaputum?
Unga what?
/ Sour pus.
You know, it's a face like that that kept Molly Ringwald from a film career as an adult.
Fran, the worst thing has happened.
The computer nerd asked me out.
Oh, so he's getting a little interactive, huh?
Fran, I don't want to go out with him.
Ah, he'll wear that hat with those ear flaps.
Honey, let me impart some wisdom on you.
My mother always dressed my father in leisure suits, and no one has ever stolen him away.
Fran, you don't understand.
My best friend Whitney's going out with a football player who is so studly.
All right, honey, honey.
Let me just give you the progression here -- star quarterback, pulled groin, beer gut -- can I check your oil, please.
Huh?
Maxwell, I'm coming in, and I have terrible news
Isn't that redundant?
Cee Cee, nothing can spoil this perfect day.
Just about now Andrew Lloyd Webber is probably realizing that he owns Dakota Williams' long-awaited opus named
"You Better Like Act One Cause There Ain't No Act Two."
I read, "Dakota Williams' closes a deal with Andrew Lloyd Webber to produce his new play -- / Uh-huh.
"-- which he finished in one night."
Oh, Miss Fine ...
Are you doing the hokey-pokey and you need your right-arm man?
I'd take it out before he shakes it all about.
Huh?
Webber stole our playwright.
Well, tell us something we don't know.
Ha, ha, ha.
All right.
"The playwright was inspired to complete the deeply personal project by a recent bout of unrequited love.
In contrast to his usual heroine, the pivotal character is an earthy, elderby, Hebraic woman named Zetta."
Ever since I started working here, I don't need a treadmill.
I have to get Miss Grace.
Mr. Clinton's here.
Clinton?
The President?
He knows Barbra Streisand.
It's so exciting.
Who are you?
I'm Roger Clinton.
Do you know Streisand?
Well, I was at the inauguration, but I had terrible seats. / Oh ...
Miss Fine, you haven't been dismissed.
I haven't finished with you yet.
Not now, Mr. Sheffield.
We have company.
Roger Clinton is here. / Oh ...
Ah, why?
Well, your daughter wrote my brother a letter.
And he was so touched by it, he asked me to stop by while I was in town.
Where's the President?
/ Honey, honey, he couldn't make it.
But his brother came instead.
/ Oh.
Isn't this exciting?
Honey, go get your camera.
Why would I want a picture -- / Go.
Ah, you know, Mr. Clinton, Miss Fine here is a great admirer and supporter of your entire family.
/ Yes, I am.
Thank you.
That's nice to hear.
As a matter of fact, you should send for her in '96. / Oh ...
Yes.
She is an inspiration to have in your corner.
Well, I'll tell Bill.
You know, he's always looking for a good right arm.
Mr. Sheffield, that was so nice of you.
You know, I thought you were a republican. / I am.
Thank you for my gift.
Well, Yetta, I just hope you enjoy it.
You know, for the club chair, I would have put out.
Well, that's what happens when you get involved with an entremanure.
And It stretches way up and way down the whole square.
They've all got their eyes up on top of this big building here...
What I was thinking, as like a New Year's resolution...
Is to stop getting so caught up In my own thoughts... because I'm like way too Introspective, I think.
I resolve to never again have sex with Kyle, or anyone, again... unless I really love and respect them.
... To spend more time with the dog, and Sharon.
... To give up coffee.
There, that's an easy one.
I resolve to stop obsessing over Angela Chase.
... To badger Mom Into letting me wear make-up.
... To find some place where I really belong.
But what If not thinking turns me Into this really shallow person?
I better rethink this becoming less Introspective thing.
... To stop drinking, but this time really stop.
I resolve to be less judgmental, less critical, to lighten up.
And above all, to be more supportive and less suspicious... no matter how much it sometimes seems like he's hiding something.
... To tell Hallle Lowenthal once and for all... that I'm not going into the restaurant business with her... and to stop all those long talks with her after class.
Wait a second, Isn't tonight New Year's Eve?
Llsten to that crowd.
Not much time left as you can see by the digital clock...
Okay, so I'll stay Introspective... but I do resolve to stop doing Jordan Catalano's homework.
Here It comes In ten seconds.
... Nine, eight, seven, six, five... four, three, two, one.
- Happy New Year's rocking Eve.
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
- Great pancakes!
- Thanks...
I just did what it said on the package.
Damn, I wrote ninety-four.
I'm going to be late.
My green sweater disappeared.
No, it's under the coffee table next to the stack of magazines.
There's a stack of magazines?
There is now.
Listen, I'm going to try and get home early tonight after my class?
- No, you don't have to rush home.
- I don't?
No, you take all the time you need, it's whatever makes you happy.
- It is?
- Yes.
You're doing the dishes again?
Okay, I'm out of here, you guys have a great first day back at school.
Well, you have a good day at work.
Tonight's Hollandaise, right?
- Right!
- Well, good luck.
Come on, we're going to be late for the bus.
I forgot my other glove.
It's freezing out there!
If only he had come into our lives when the girls were still...
- Young and impressionable.
- Rickie?
He's incredible.
Now that he reorganized the linen closet... you can't use a dish without washing it.
And he's like my mother, only mature.
- We should adopt.
- If only it were that easy.
God, he is such a great kid, I mean, what is going on?
Why haven't we heard from his aunt and uncle?
He's been here a week!
I forgot my Odyssey.
- I've tried to ask him about it.
- I know.
He just changes the subject.
I mean, don't they care?
Do they even know where he is?
Do you think I should talk to him again?
Well, we have to try to contact his family, or he has to...
I mean, he can't just stay here forever.
Okay.
Let's just get down to basics.
Did anyone start the book?
Anyone read the book jacket?
Okay...
I haven't had a cup of coffee in almost twelve hours...
I need a little help here!
What does Odysseus want?
Enrique?
Any thoughts?
- To...
- To what?
Hold it!
I want everyone to write two pages, due tomorrow... on what does Odysseus want.
No excuses!
The thing about resolutions Is, It's hard to remember them around... somebody like Jordan Catalano.
This is wrong.
What?
You doing my homework, it's wrong.
I was just trying to help.
It's like I'm taking advantage of you or something.
You're not taking advantage of me.
Yes, I am.
It would be different if we were... but now you're just... you know, a friend or whatever.
I can't do this anymore.
I couldn't believe It, for the first time In my life...
I actually stuck to a resolution.
- Hey, Cherski!
- Hi!
Hey, it's Sharon!
Excuse me, we're here.
Sharon, are you avoiding me?
What?
Kyle, isn't that a little self-centered on your part... to think that people are spending their day avoiding you?
Can you open the door please?
Later, Graff, this place is too crowded.
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey, Vinnovich.
- I know why you've been avoiding me.
- You do?
Yes, because you think that what happened... the other night didn't mean as much to me as it did to you.
It did.
I love you, Sharon.
- Sorry.
- That's right.
She's a witness, I love you and I don't care who knows it.
So, that's all I want to say.
So, Brad is completely putuzed... about whether my gown should be ivory or bisque.
And I'm like, can't we just elope to Monte Carlo?
Listen, I need to clarify something.
- You're not going to do the restaurant.
- No, I'm not.
I'm a sane person, I have no desire to squander my family's savings.
So, we really should stop talking about it because...
What?
Nothing!
It's fine.
What, you wanted an argument?
Well, no, no, I just...
- No, great!
I'm glad we discussed it.
- Me, too... because I found this absolutely fantastic space that you can get... for a song.
No, it's perfect, now that you're not involved... you can give me an objective opinion.
It's got this truly amazing bronze fountain with mermaids!
It's a storefront down by the train station!
Hallie.
So, does the fountain work?
So I can't even wear lipstick?
For fun?
Around the house?
Yes.
To school?
No.
How about if I wear it for fun, and then we go out for pizza?
How about just to take a walk?
How about in our driveway?
Danielle!
- Daddy!
Daddy, hi!
- Hi.
Hi!
So I guess you stayed late after all.
- Yes.
Sorry.
- No, that's okay, really!
I got stuck talking to Hallie Lowenthal.
Did you?
That's great, how is Hallie?
She's fine, I told her I wasn't doing this restaurant thing.
Good.
I mean, that's what you wanted to tell her, right?
I mean, isn't that what you wanted me to tell her?
Only if that's what you really want?
- Rickie!
What's up?
- Nothing!
I'm just going home.
What?
When?
I guess now.
I talked to Angela, Tino's going to pick me up.
- So, how did Hollandaise go?
- It was fine.
Listen, Rickie...
Rickie, are you sure that this is what you want?
Yes, yes, I talked to them, my aunt and uncle, and... you know, really talked to them, straightened it all out... and I think things are really going to work out.
So, look, I really thank you guys, but, you know...
- They're like my family, so...
- Wait a second.
Rickie, we want to talk to your aunt and uncle.
No, no, no, I know!
And she's been meaning to call and thank you... or whatever, but I think she's a little embarrassed.
So, thank you... for everything.
And...
- Bye.
- Bye.
Everybody, I want those Odysseus essays before you leave.
And, you should all be on page 50 by Friday.
Yes, thank you.
- You gave up caffeine, too?
- Oh, my God...
I was just staying at a friend's house.
Angela Chase, she's in your other sophomore English... the girl with the red hair that's kind of growing out.
Where is your essay?
See, her little sister had this really, really bad headache and...
I had to go with her to the emergency room.
So I actually didn't get a chance to actually do the assignment.
Rickie?
Hi.
How's your sister feeling?
Fine.
Oh, my God, I better get to Soc.
Wait, Rickie!
Rayanne is all concerned.
You have to tell her everything is okay...
- I mean, everything is okay, right?
- Of course, of course.
Well, tell Rayanne, okay?
She thinks my mom kicked you out or something, she's driving me crazy.
Okay, I'll talk to her.
Later.
Wait.
Yes.
Angela.
So Rickie stayed at your house last night?
No.
I must be confused, I thought...
No, he was, now he's back with his family.
I mean, everything is calmed down over there now I guess.
I mean, I hope so, because...
Well, good.
Yes, I hope so, too.
Can I just ask you something?
Say there's someone who's really smart in a lot of ways... but isn't doing real well in school, especially in English.
Say no more.
The sign-up sheet for the peer tutoring program... you can start right after school today.
Come on, Cherski, work those abs!
- Why are you even here?
Quit it!
- Come on, it makes it easier.
I keep reliving that moment with you and Kyle.
Shut up.
I still can't believe the fact of it.
How he declared his love for you.
So this is it for you now, you know, because you're totally fulfilled, right?
Right?
See, Kyle and I had broken up officially.
But then, New Year's Eve...
I was watching that River Runs Through It movie... and he called, and...
Oh, gosh, what is wrong with me?
- Look, take me and Bobby...
- Who's Bobby?
That guy I was with when you and Kyle interrupted us?
That guy's name is Phil.
Whatever, it's not like Bill and I are in love or anything.
Phil!
Whatever!
I mean, you don't have to be in love to have a good time.
Yes, but let's say he loved you while you were just using him... for, you know... because you were watching this movie.
- What movie?
- This Brad Pitt movie.
Say no more.
Yes.
And then say you call Phil over, or Bill.
- Say I call both of them.
- No, wait, wait.
Let's say though, that you had a better time then you used to... when you were technically supposed to love him... like a much better time.
Is this that really dull movie with all the fishing?
I'm going to Kyle, I'm going to tell him the truth... and then I'm going to never have sex again with anyone... until I know it's absolutely the exact right person... and I am in complete and total love.
I just hope Brad Pitt is available and in the tri-state area.
- Sorry!
- No, I was just...
It's freezing out there.
My car didn't almost start.
It's freezing in here... but isn't it great?
- Personally, I see a dance floor.
- Another roller rink.
You know, Brad has this theory about you.
You look so alarmed.
I'm always alarmed when anyone's actually talked about me.
He thinks you secretly and passionately yearn to do this... and if you don't you'll kill yourself or somebody else, or something.
Brad said this about me?
Brad is surprisingly perceptive!
So?
What do you think?
Well, it needs a little work.
No, seriously, I need to know what you think, I mean...
I am going to do this and I understand of course that you aren't.
But I just need to know what you think.
I think it's wonderful.
That's Great!
Then you'll do it!
No!
This is why I almost didn't come!
Get me out of here!
I will see you in class.
You know Brad has another theory about you.
He says you'll cave in at the last minute.
Bye.
Yes!
What?
Let's just say that Graham has a little input, output confusion.
- I'm almost done.
- Thanks, Neil, that's great.
Want me to explain to you what the problem is?
No.
So, I guess Graham told you that he decided not to open the restaurant.
I'm actually kind of sorry about it, I mean, that I wasn't more supportive.
What restaurant?
You mean he didn't tell you about this restaurant... that he was thinking about opening?
My brother was thinking about opening a restaurant?
By himself?
Well, no, as a matter of fact his partner was supposed to be...
- You know, that woman?
- Which woman is this?
You know, that Hallie Lowenthal woman.
- Hallie?
- Lowenthal.
He didn't tell you about Hallie Lowenthal from his cooking class?
Wait, wait, what's her name again?
Holly?
Hallie Lowenthal.
Right, yes.
Yes!
Yes!
Of course!
Hallie.
I really should wear a watch, is what I should do.
- Hey!
- Hey.
I just was a...
What are you doing here?
Fixed the stereo.
Want to know what the problem was?
No.
So great!
Hi.
I have to go upstairs.
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing.
Why, what did you do?
Nothing, Shut up!
Nothing.
Wait, you actually signed me up?
I know, in a way it was wrong, but I just have a feeling... that this is going to be really good.
I don't know...
Whoever is going to tutor you, their name is next to yours.
"Brain Krakow?"
Wait, maybe this is a bad idea.
No, I mean, if I'm already signed up.
- Are you, "Brain"?
- Brian.
We are drama club!
Come on, give me some drama!
Okay, all right.
But if you move, don't you leave a forwarding number?
I mean, is there a number?
Because they wouldn't just move without telling me.
Because that would be crazy... that would be impossible... because people just don't do that... do they?
Enrique?
Enrique?
- Enrique.
- Mr. Katimski?
Gee whiz, you're here early.
Could I speak to you before class about the Odyssey?
Of course!
Come on.
If you want to take that doughnut off my hands, be my guest...
I gave up coffee for New Year's... it's kind of taken the point out of doughnuts.
What's up?
Okay, well, you know that essay that I never handed in... about what Odysseus wants?
- Can I get an extension on that?
- Okay.
Because I read it, it's about this lonely guy... that wanders the world for many years, right?
Right.
And the way that it starts in the middle...
What's that called again?
I know you told us...
- "En medius res".
- Right.
It's in the middle of things.
Right.
Because see, right now it's sort of like... it's sort of like I don't have a place to live.
Oh, God.
What happened?
But, I mean, it's okay, it's actually going to be fine.
I was staying at my friend Angela's house for a while... and they're really nice... they're this really great family...
But in a way that made me feel lonelier...
- And I know that sounds ungrateful...
- No, no, no, I understand.
And see, my uncle...
I was living with my aunt and uncle because... well, it's sort of a long story And you're certain that your aunt and uncle have relocated?
I'm certain.
Kathy, obviously he can't, I mean, there has to be some solution here.
Well, actually, I'm thinking of a place for, is it Enrique?
It's Rickie, but actually I was thinking that...
I could get a job or maybe even an apartment.
Rickie, I got to say, I'm not sure that's realistic.
The place I'm thinking of for you is called Pride House.
What kind of a place is that?
Well, a friend of a friend of mine runs it... and it's got a really warm atmosphere, has a super dedicated staff... and it's great, it's almost like a family.
- That sounds pretty good, doesn't it?
- Yes, I guess.
Let me make a few calls and I'll pull in a few favors... and we'll see what we can do.
Go to your next class and I'll let you know when we know something.
Good!
This sounds...
My goodness, I've got a class myself.
Are you okay?
You need another doughnut?
No, I'm fine, thanks.
Welcome.
Richard, I'm on hold here.
Listen, a place like Pride House has a waiting list, you know?
I mean, assuming he's qualified, even if I pull every string known to man... it's going to take a few weeks to get him in.
No, but, Kathy, that's...
What is he supposed to do tonight?
It's not a perfect system.
Yes, I'll hold.
No.
It isn't.
- So, Happy New Year.
- What?
Yes, right.
So, how's everything?
How's Delia Fisher?
- What do you want Krakow?
- Nothing, why?
Why would I want anything?
I don't want anything.
- I just need like a favor.
- Involving Delia Fisher?
Involving Jordan Catalano.
- I was put with him for tutoring.
- So?
So I'd just rather not tutor him, I mean... you have someone you're tutoring, so could you switch with me?
So you and Kyle are back together now?
No, no, it's just...
I can't discuss it, okay?
So, why can't you tutor Jordan Catalano?
I can't discuss it either.
Because it just makes me feel like a hypocrite or something, you know?
Yeah, I do actually.
"I love you beary much"?
Oh, my God!
Shut up!
Wait, wait, Cherski, wait.
I mean, just this whole situation... see it's like I can't even look at him, so...
I know.
It just really boils down to respect, you know...
I have zero respect for him, so for me to tutor someone that I don't respect... wouldn't that almost be like using him?
It is definitely wrong to use people.
- So you'll switch with me?
- No.
No, that won't solve it... that's like the cowards' way out.
I can live with that, because, you know, I kind of am a coward, so...
No.
No, you have to be honest... you have to tell him that it was a mistake... and that you can't pretend anymore and that whole using him thing... and that you know, you didn't want to hurt him!
I'm supposed to say all that to Jordan Catalano?
Hey, Cherski!
Cute bear Krakow!
What's the name?
So I basically have no real background in the type of stuff you're weak in... so you should probably just resign up and...
Where's my pen?
What's that bear?
That?
That's just this thing this girl gave me.
Yes?
I think I should tell you, even though I signed up to tutor people...
I may have to drop out of the program or whatever...
Do you have an eraser I could use for a second?
My eraser won't erase.
- Here you can keep it.
- Thanks.
- What?
- She would sleep with you.
What?
!
- She would sleep with you.
- Because I gave her my eraser?
No, because she would.
- Go get her number.
- What?
How am I supposed to get her number, I just ask her... just ask some girl I don't even know for her phone number... without warning?
So, anyway... the Odyssey is this real long book right, and...
I don't believe this.
I don't.
You do this?
This is how you live?
Yes.
- Hi.
What's so funny?
- Nothing.
You sort of had to be there.
I have to sharpen my pencil.
Look, if this is weird for you, being tutored...
I don't mind helping you a little longer.
It's not so weird.
So...
Good.
You could have sex with me though, if you really want to help.
Oh, God.
- Oh, my God.
- I guess that's a no.
I'll let you get back to your work.
Have a seat.
Enrique.
They came and got me out of class.
So did she reach them, or...
No.
I mean...
Mr. Katimski, I just want to thank you for taking the time out, because... that Pride place Ms. Krazy... whatever her name is...
It sounded good... and I would have never gone to guidance by myself, so thanks.
- Look, Rickie.
- Wait, you called me Rickie.
They don't, well, you're on the waiting list.
Which is good, which is very good.
The only thing is the immediate problem.
So, Mrs. Krzynowski has temporarily placed you in a facility.
- What do you mean, you mean...
- No, it's not forever.
But what?
Is it like...
Look, I don't...
Rickie...
- No, no, okay.
I know.
- I mean...
She wants to see you in her office.
She needs to fill out some forms.
Sure.
Enrique, wait.
I know this is going to work out.
Yeah, me, too.
Come on, stop it!
God, you are relentless!
I'm home!
I don't care what his theory is.
What?
Hang on a second.
Hi, it's Hallie Lowenthal.
Tell her hi.
Patty says hi.
- Yes, she says hi back.
- Great!
Fabulous.
- What?
- Nothing.
- No, I was just...
- Sorry.
So sorry.
- I should get off the phone.
- No, don't get off the phone.
Okay, I will talk to you in class!
- She just wanted to ask me something.
- No problem.
So you are considering going into business with Hallie or you aren't?
I'm not.
I told you that.
Okay, it was just a question, it wasn't a criticism.
You know, you never told me what your New Year's resolution was.
Exercise more.
Mine, too.
Hey, you.
Hey, I'm talking to you, where are you going?
Will somebody please get the door?
- I need to speak to...
- Danlelle, who Is It?
I can't tell yet.
Hi, I'm looking for Enrique Vasquez.
My name is Richard...
- Mr. Katimski!
- Katimski.
Why do I know that name?
Mom, he's my English teacher.
Enrique Vasquez, do you mean, Rickie?
- What happened to Rickie?
- So, Enrique is not here?
No, he isn't, why?
He was brought to a shelter last night... but I got a phone call from one of our counselors, this morning...
Aren't they going to be late, for school?
Girls, go to school.
Can I get you a cup of coffee, or something?
No coffee.
Don't you realize this boy was under your roof.
Now, how can you just let him go like that?
- Who are you?
- But Rickie told us...
I don't care what he told you!
Now why did you believe...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Forgive me.
I'm really sorry.
No, you're absolutely right!
- We should have called.
- Who are you?
I'm your daughters' English teacher.
I am very sorry.
I have never...
This is not how I normally behave.
No, no, it's okay, because I have felt so bad about this.
No, see I gave up coffee for New Year's, and I'm going through some... kind of withdrawal and...
Forgive me, I had no right to point a finger of blame at you... especially since I've...
Your daughter Angela, a very delightful person by the way... with a firm grasp of language... but she doesn't work up to her full potential.
Are you sure you don't want a cup of coffee?
The old temptress.
I have to tell him the complete truth.
I can't become the type of person that would use another person like that... because I could end up like you!
No offense.
None taken.
Hey, Kyle.
Cherski here has something to tell you.
Shut up!
Hey!
You must have lost this?
I found it hanging from a urinal.
Thanks.
Kyle, we really have to talk.
Listen, I rented this video, and I thought maybe we could... hang at your place tonight and watch it?
Kyle, there's something that I have to explain.
It's that movie where these two housewives on the run... in this convertible and they're babes, but they're really old babes?
- Kyle, look.
- Who else is in it?
- You know that guy...
- Brad Pitt?
Yeah!
He's hitchhiking, and they pick him up!
He's wearing a cowboy hat and no shirt!
And next thing you know, Brad Pitt and that wacky babe... are going at it in this cheap hotel all night long!
What did you want to explain?
Nothing!
- How about 7:30?
- That's fantastic!
God, I cannot believe how intense that was.
I know.
I mean, he seems like a sweet guy.
Absolutely.
I just hope we hear from him.
Rickie.
Well, look, he knows where we are if he needs us.
Listen, Patty... there's something I have to tell you.
It's been kind of weighing on me.
I haven't been completely honest... about something and I just can't...
Oh, God, just say it.
Just say it.
I want to open this restaurant.
See, I missed Angela's birth because I got stuck in that airport... and I missed college because I did.
And I missed Woodstock twice.
And I don't want to miss this.
I will be totally supportive.
Really?
But I thought, I mean, you mean that?
Yes!
God, yes!
I will be unbelievably supportive.
Wait, wait a second!
What did you think I was going to say?
Never mind!
That girl who's number you got for me?
She's junior, so I don't know if you still think I should call her...
I mean...
I cannot stop thinking about how you did that... how you just got up and went over there?
I mean, how did you do that?
- Maybe we better get down to work.
- Okay.
You can even start with the basics, you know?
Okay.
I mean, even if it seems like too basic?
Start with that.
And then after if you want...
I can teach you how to get someone's phone number.
Hello?
Mr. Katimski?
It's me, Enrique.
I'm sorry to bother you, but...
Enrique!
You're not, don't be silly.
Where are you?
I'm fine!
I'm really fine!
How are you?
Enrique, listen to me.
Do you need a place to stay?
Because I was at the Chases today, and they care about you.
- You can go back there.
- You were at the Chases?
Why?
Because I was worried about you!
I am worried about you!
But, but it's okay!
I'm fine, I'm really fine!
You don't have to worry.
And actually, I found this place to stay.
- What place?
Where?
- Just a place.
I can't stay at that shelter.
- I know, Enrique, listen.
Never mind, we can talk about it tomorrow.
You have a safe place?
To spend the night?
Yes.
Okay.
Take care?
- Could you please stop doing that?
- No.
So, what's going to happen to him?
The kid?
The kid will be just fine, if he lives through the night.
That guidance counselor promised me that she'd pull some strings... to get him in some group home... it should only take five or six weeks, it'll be fine!
It was question, not a criticism.
But you're thinking, why didn't I tell him that he could stay here tonight...
- You're thinking...
- No, I'm not.
Well, I am!
We all know what could happen if we did take him in, if it got out... you realize what people could make of it?
- I'd lose my job, be crucified.
- I didn't say anything.
What am I supposed to do?
Just decide like that, that I'm the solution to some kids life?
How egotistical is that?
God, I just hate myself, but I can't!
Don't hate yourself.
Hallie?
Sorry, I didn't see you.
Did I scare you?
I do have that affect on people.
You don't scare me.
So, Patty is really behind this now, she's very into it.
That's great!
So here's the deal.
I did a major schmooze job on the landlord, he said if we sign now... he'll waive the first two months, so, worst case we've thrown away... ten months rent, but at least we'll have a place to show investors.
I hope to God I haven't pressured you into this.
Are you crazy?
Of course you pressured me into it, no question.
No, be honest...
I mean, people only do what they want to do, I mean... you wouldn't be here if you didn't really want to be, right?
You know...
Brad had this theory about you... actually about me.
He had a theory?
Then he lost it?
No, he probably still has it, but... we broke up.
What?
When did this happen?
We just decided to not be engaged anymore.
Well, I mean, he decided.
I don't know, it's just, you know, it's the New Year... and you find yourself kind of taking stock or what have you... coming to certain realizations.
I'm really sorry.
So, what was this theory?
God, if I don't get over to that lawyer we won't even have a lease!
You won't regret this.
Your address was in the phonebook.
I'm sorry.
It just got so hard to be alone!
Come on.
And It stretches way up and way down the whole square.
They've all got their eyes up on top of this big building here...
What I was thinking, as like a New Year's resolution...
Is to stop getting so caught up In my own thoughts... because I'm like way too Introspective, I think.
I resolve to never again have sex with Kyle, or anyone, again... unless I really love and respect them.
... To spend more time with the dog, and Sharon.
... To give up coffee.
There, that's an easy one.
I resolve to stop obsessing over Angela Chase.
... To badger Mom Into letting me wear make-up.
... To find some place where I really belong.
But what If not thinking turns me Into this really shallow person?
I better rethink this becoming less Introspective thing.
... To stop drinking, but this time really stop.
I resolve to be less judgmental, less critical, to lighten up.
And above all, to be more supportive and less suspicious... no matter how much it sometimes seems like he's hiding something.
... To tell Hallle Lowenthal once and for all... that I'm not going into the restaurant business with her... and to stop all those long talks with her after class.
Wait a second, Isn't tonight New Year's Eve?
Llsten to that crowd.
Not much time left as you can see by the digital clock...
Okay, so I'll stay Introspective... but I do resolve to stop doing Jordan Catalano's homework.
Here It comes In ten seconds.
... Nine, eight, seven, six, five... four, three, two, one.
- Happy New Year's rocking Eve.
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
- Great pancakes!
- Thanks...
I just did what it said on the package.
Damn, I wrote ninety-four.
I'm going to be late.
My green sweater disappeared.
No, it's under the coffee table next to the stack of magazines.
There's a stack of magazines?
There is now.
Listen, I'm going to try and get home early tonight after my class?
- No, you don't have to rush home.
- I don't?
No, you take all the time you need, it's whatever makes you happy.
- It is?
- Yes.
You're doing the dishes again?
Okay, I'm out of here, you guys have a great first day back at school.
Well, you have a good day at work.
Tonight's Hollandaise, right?
- Right!
- Well, good luck.
Come on, we're going to be late for the bus.
I forgot my other glove.
It's freezing out there!
If only he had come into our lives when the girls were still...
- Young and impressionable.
- Rickie?
He's incredible.
Now that he reorganized the linen closet... you can't use a dish without washing it.
And he's like my mother, only mature.
- We should adopt.
- If only it were that easy.
God, he is such a great kid, I mean, what is going on?
Why haven't we heard from his aunt and uncle?
He's been here a week!
I forgot my Odyssey.
- I've tried to ask him about it.
- I know.
He just changes the subject.
I mean, don't they care?
Do they even know where he is?
Do you think I should talk to him again?
Well, we have to try to contact his family, or he has to...
I mean, he can't just stay here forever.
Okay.
Let's just get down to basics.
Did anyone start the book?
Anyone read the book jacket?
Okay...
I haven't had a cup of coffee in almost twelve hours...
I need a little help here!
What does Odysseus want?
Enrique?
Any thoughts?
- To...
- To what?
Hold it!
I want everyone to write two pages, due tomorrow... on what does Odysseus want.
No excuses!
The thing about resolutions Is, It's hard to remember them around... somebody like Jordan Catalano.
This is wrong.
What?
You doing my homework, it's wrong.
I was just trying to help.
It's like I'm taking advantage of you or something.
You're not taking advantage of me.
Yes, I am.
It would be different if we were... but now you're just... you know, a friend or whatever.
I can't do this anymore.
I couldn't believe It, for the first time In my life...
I actually stuck to a resolution.
- Hey, Cherski!
- Hi!
Hey, it's Sharon!
Excuse me, we're here.
Sharon, are you avoiding me?
What?
Kyle, isn't that a little self-centered on your part... to think that people are spending their day avoiding you?
Can you open the door please?
Later, Graff, this place is too crowded.
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey, Vinnovich.
- I know why you've been avoiding me.
- You do?
Yes, because you think that what happened... the other night didn't mean as much to me as it did to you.
It did.
I love you, Sharon.
- Sorry.
- That's right.
She's a witness, I love you and I don't care who knows it.
So, that's all I want to say.
So, Brad is completely putuzed... about whether my gown should be ivory or bisque.
And I'm like, can't we just elope to Monte Carlo?
Listen, I need to clarify something.
- You're not going to do the restaurant.
- No, I'm not.
I'm a sane person, I have no desire to squander my family's savings.
So, we really should stop talking about it because...
What?
Nothing!
It's fine.
What, you wanted an argument?
Well, no, no, I just...
- No, great!
I'm glad we discussed it.
- Me, too... because I found this absolutely fantastic space that you can get... for a song.
No, it's perfect, now that you're not involved... you can give me an objective opinion.
It's got this truly amazing bronze fountain with mermaids!
It's a storefront down by the train station!
Hallie.
So, does the fountain work?
So I can't even wear lipstick?
For fun?
Around the house?
Yes.
To school?
No.
How about if I wear it for fun, and then we go out for pizza?
How about just to take a walk?
How about in our driveway?
Danielle!
- Daddy!
Daddy, hi!
- Hi.
Hi!
So I guess you stayed late after all.
- Yes.
Sorry.
- No, that's okay, really!
I got stuck talking to Hallie Lowenthal.
Did you?
That's great, how is Hallie?
She's fine, I told her I wasn't doing this restaurant thing.
Good.
I mean, that's what you wanted to tell her, right?
I mean, isn't that what you wanted me to tell her?
Only if that's what you really want?
- Rickie!
What's up?
- Nothing!
I'm just going home.
What?
When?
I guess now.
I talked to Angela, Tino's going to pick me up.
- So, how did Hollandaise go?
- It was fine.
Listen, Rickie...
Rickie, are you sure that this is what you want?
Yes, yes, I talked to them, my aunt and uncle, and... you know, really talked to them, straightened it all out... and I think things are really going to work out.
So, look, I really thank you guys, but, you know...
- They're like my family, so...
- Wait a second.
Rickie, we want to talk to your aunt and uncle.
No, no, no, I know!
And she's been meaning to call and thank you... or whatever, but I think she's a little embarrassed.
So, thank you... for everything.
And...
- Bye.
- Bye.
Everybody, I want those Odysseus essays before you leave.
And, you should all be on page 50 by Friday.
Yes, thank you.
- You gave up caffeine, too?
- Oh, my God...
I was just staying at a friend's house.
Angela Chase, she's in your other sophomore English... the girl with the red hair that's kind of growing out.
Where is your essay?
See, her little sister had this really, really bad headache and...
I had to go with her to the emergency room.
So I actually didn't get a chance to actually do the assignment.
Rickie?
Hi.
How's your sister feeling?
Fine.
Oh, my God, I better get to Soc.
Wait, Rickie!
Rayanne is all concerned.
You have to tell her everything is okay...
- I mean, everything is okay, right?
- Of course, of course.
Well, tell Rayanne, okay?
She thinks my mom kicked you out or something, she's driving me crazy.
Okay, I'll talk to her.
Later.
Wait.
Yes.
Angela.
So Rickie stayed at your house last night?
No.
I must be confused, I thought...
No, he was, now he's back with his family.
I mean, everything is calmed down over there now I guess.
I mean, I hope so, because...
Well, good.
Yes, I hope so, too.
Can I just ask you something?
Say there's someone who's really smart in a lot of ways... but isn't doing real well in school, especially in English.
Say no more.
The sign-up sheet for the peer tutoring program... you can start right after school today.
Come on, Cherski, work those abs!
- Why are you even here?
Quit it!
- Come on, it makes it easier.
I keep reliving that moment with you and Kyle.
Shut up.
I still can't believe the fact of it.
How he declared his love for you.
So this is it for you now, you know, because you're totally fulfilled, right?
Right?
See, Kyle and I had broken up officially.
But then, New Year's Eve...
I was watching that River Runs Through It movie... and he called, and...
Oh, gosh, what is wrong with me?
- Look, take me and Bobby...
- Who's Bobby?
That guy I was with when you and Kyle interrupted us?
That guy's name is Phil.
Whatever, it's not like Bill and I are in love or anything.
Phil!
Whatever!
I mean, you don't have to be in love to have a good time.
Yes, but let's say he loved you while you were just using him... for, you know... because you were watching this movie.
- What movie?
- This Brad Pitt movie.
Say no more.
Yes.
And then say you call Phil over, or Bill.
- Say I call both of them.
- No, wait, wait.
Let's say though, that you had a better time then you used to... when you were technically supposed to love him... like a much better time.
Is this that really dull movie with all the fishing?
I'm going to Kyle, I'm going to tell him the truth... and then I'm going to never have sex again with anyone... until I know it's absolutely the exact right person... and I am in complete and total love.
I just hope Brad Pitt is available and in the tri-state area.
- Sorry!
- No, I was just...
It's freezing out there.
My car didn't almost start.
It's freezing in here... but isn't it great?
- Personally, I see a dance floor.
- Another roller rink.
You know, Brad has this theory about you.
You look so alarmed.
I'm always alarmed when anyone's actually talked about me.
He thinks you secretly and passionately yearn to do this... and if you don't you'll kill yourself or somebody else, or something.
Brad said this about me?
Brad is surprisingly perceptive!
So?
What do you think?
Well, it needs a little work.
No, seriously, I need to know what you think, I mean...
I am going to do this and I understand of course that you aren't.
But I just need to know what you think.
I think it's wonderful.
That's Great!
Then you'll do it!
No!
This is why I almost didn't come!
Get me out of here!
I will see you in class.
You know Brad has another theory about you.
He says you'll cave in at the last minute.
Bye.
Yes!
What?
Let's just say that Graham has a little input, output confusion.
- I'm almost done.
- Thanks, Neil, that's great.
Want me to explain to you what the problem is?
No.
So, I guess Graham told you that he decided not to open the restaurant.
I'm actually kind of sorry about it, I mean, that I wasn't more supportive.
What restaurant?
You mean he didn't tell you about this restaurant... that he was thinking about opening?
My brother was thinking about opening a restaurant?
By himself?
Well, no, as a matter of fact his partner was supposed to be...
- You know, that woman?
- Which woman is this?
You know, that Hallie Lowenthal woman.
- Hallie?
- Lowenthal.
He didn't tell you about Hallie Lowenthal from his cooking class?
Wait, wait, what's her name again?
Holly?
Hallie Lowenthal.
Right, yes.
Yes!
Yes!
Of course!
Hallie.
I really should wear a watch, is what I should do.
- Hey!
- Hey.
I just was a...
What are you doing here?
Fixed the stereo.
Want to know what the problem was?
No.
So great!
Hi.
I have to go upstairs.
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing.
Why, what did you do?
Nothing, Shut up!
Nothing.
Wait, you actually signed me up?
I know, in a way it was wrong, but I just have a feeling... that this is going to be really good.
I don't know...
Whoever is going to tutor you, their name is next to yours.
"Brain Krakow?"
Wait, maybe this is a bad idea.
No, I mean, if I'm already signed up.
- Are you, "Brain"?
- Brian.
We are drama club!
Come on, give me some drama!
Okay, all right.
But if you move, don't you leave a forwarding number?
I mean, is there a number?
Because they wouldn't just move without telling me.
Because that would be crazy... that would be impossible... because people just don't do that... do they?
Enrique?
Enrique?
- Enrique.
- Mr. Katimski?
Gee whiz, you're here early.
Could I speak to you before class about the Odyssey?
Of course!
Come on.
If you want to take that doughnut off my hands, be my guest...
I gave up coffee for New Year's... it's kind of taken the point out of doughnuts.
What's up?
Okay, well, you know that essay that I never handed in... about what Odysseus wants?
- Can I get an extension on that?
- Okay.
Because I read it, it's about this lonely guy... that wanders the world for many years, right?
Right.
And the way that it starts in the middle...
What's that called again?
I know you told us...
- "En medius res".
- Right.
It's in the middle of things.
Right.
Because see, right now it's sort of like... it's sort of like I don't have a place to live.
Oh, God.
What happened?
But, I mean, it's okay, it's actually going to be fine.
I was staying at my friend Angela's house for a while... and they're really nice... they're this really great family...
But in a way that made me feel lonelier...
- And I know that sounds ungrateful...
- No, no, no, I understand.
And see, my uncle...
I was living with my aunt and uncle because... well, it's sort of a long story And you're certain that your aunt and uncle have relocated?
I'm certain.
Kathy, obviously he can't, I mean, there has to be some solution here.
Well, actually, I'm thinking of a place for, is it Enrique?
It's Rickie, but actually I was thinking that...
I could get a job or maybe even an apartment.
Rickie, I got to say, I'm not sure that's realistic.
The place I'm thinking of for you is called Pride House.
What kind of a place is that?
Well, a friend of a friend of mine runs it... and it's got a really warm atmosphere, has a super dedicated staff... and it's great, it's almost like a family.
- That sounds pretty good, doesn't it?
- Yes, I guess.
Let me make a few calls and I'll pull in a few favors... and we'll see what we can do.
Go to your next class and I'll let you know when we know something.
Good!
This sounds...
My goodness, I've got a class myself.
Are you okay?
You need another doughnut?
No, I'm fine, thanks.
Welcome.
Richard, I'm on hold here.
Listen, a place like Pride House has a waiting list, you know?
I mean, assuming he's qualified, even if I pull every string known to man... it's going to take a few weeks to get him in.
No, but, Kathy, that's...
What is he supposed to do tonight?
It's not a perfect system.
Yes, I'll hold.
No.
It isn't.
- So, Happy New Year.
- What?
Yes, right.
So, how's everything?
How's Delia Fisher?
- What do you want Krakow?
- Nothing, why?
Why would I want anything?
I don't want anything.
- I just need like a favor.
- Involving Delia Fisher?
Involving Jordan Catalano.
- I was put with him for tutoring.
- So?
So I'd just rather not tutor him, I mean... you have someone you're tutoring, so could you switch with me?
So you and Kyle are back together now?
No, no, it's just...
I can't discuss it, okay?
So, why can't you tutor Jordan Catalano?
I can't discuss it either.
Because it just makes me feel like a hypocrite or something, you know?
Yeah, I do actually.
"I love you beary much"?
Oh, my God!
Shut up!
Wait, wait, Cherski, wait.
I mean, just this whole situation... see it's like I can't even look at him, so...
I know.
It just really boils down to respect, you know...
I have zero respect for him, so for me to tutor someone that I don't respect... wouldn't that almost be like using him?
It is definitely wrong to use people.
- So you'll switch with me?
- No.
No, that won't solve it... that's like the cowards' way out.
I can live with that, because, you know, I kind of am a coward, so...
No.
No, you have to be honest... you have to tell him that it was a mistake... and that you can't pretend anymore and that whole using him thing... and that you know, you didn't want to hurt him!
I'm supposed to say all that to Jordan Catalano?
Hey, Cherski!
Cute bear Krakow!
What's the name?
So I basically have no real background in the type of stuff you're weak in... so you should probably just resign up and...
Where's my pen?
What's that bear?
That?
That's just this thing this girl gave me.
Yes?
I think I should tell you, even though I signed up to tutor people...
I may have to drop out of the program or whatever...
Do you have an eraser I could use for a second?
My eraser won't erase.
- Here you can keep it.
- Thanks.
- What?
- She would sleep with you.
What?
!
- She would sleep with you.
- Because I gave her my eraser?
No, because she would.
- Go get her number.
- What?
How am I supposed to get her number, I just ask her... just ask some girl I don't even know for her phone number... without warning?
So, anyway... the Odyssey is this real long book right, and...
I don't believe this.
I don't.
You do this?
This is how you live?
Yes.
- Hi.
What's so funny?
- Nothing.
You sort of had to be there.
I have to sharpen my pencil.
Look, if this is weird for you, being tutored...
I don't mind helping you a little longer.
It's not so weird.
So...
Good.
You could have sex with me though, if you really want to help.
Oh, God.
- Oh, my God.
- I guess that's a no.
I'll let you get back to your work.
Have a seat.
Enrique.
They came and got me out of class.
So did she reach them, or...
No.
I mean...
Mr. Katimski, I just want to thank you for taking the time out, because... that Pride place Ms. Krazy... whatever her name is...
It sounded good... and I would have never gone to guidance by myself, so thanks.
- Look, Rickie.
- Wait, you called me Rickie.
They don't, well, you're on the waiting list.
Which is good, which is very good.
The only thing is the immediate problem.
So, Mrs. Krzynowski has temporarily placed you in a facility.
- What do you mean, you mean...
- No, it's not forever.
But what?
Is it like...
Look, I don't...
Rickie...
- No, no, okay.
I know.
- I mean...
She wants to see you in her office.
She needs to fill out some forms.
Sure.
Enrique, wait.
I know this is going to work out.
Yeah, me, too.
Come on, stop it!
God, you are relentless!
I'm home!
I don't care what his theory is.
What?
Hang on a second.
Hi, it's Hallie Lowenthal.
Tell her hi.
Patty says hi.
- Yes, she says hi back.
- Great!
Fabulous.
- What?
- Nothing.
- No, I was just...
- Sorry.
So sorry.
- I should get off the phone.
- No, don't get off the phone.
Okay, I will talk to you in class!
- She just wanted to ask me something.
- No problem.
So you are considering going into business with Hallie or you aren't?
I'm not.
I told you that.
Okay, it was just a question, it wasn't a criticism.
You know, you never told me what your New Year's resolution was.
Exercise more.
Mine, too.
Hey, you.
Hey, I'm talking to you, where are you going?
Will somebody please get the door?
- I need to speak to...
- Danlelle, who Is It?
I can't tell yet.
Hi, I'm looking for Enrique Vasquez.
My name is Richard...
- Mr. Katimski!
- Katimski.
Why do I know that name?
Mom, he's my English teacher.
Enrique Vasquez, do you mean, Rickie?
- What happened to Rickie?
- So, Enrique is not here?
No, he isn't, why?
He was brought to a shelter last night... but I got a phone call from one of our counselors, this morning...
Aren't they going to be late, for school?
Girls, go to school.
Can I get you a cup of coffee, or something?
No coffee.
Don't you realize this boy was under your roof.
Now, how can you just let him go like that?
- Who are you?
- But Rickie told us...
I don't care what he told you!
Now why did you believe...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Forgive me.
I'm really sorry.
No, you're absolutely right!
- We should have called.
- Who are you?
I'm your daughters' English teacher.
I am very sorry.
I have never...
This is not how I normally behave.
No, no, it's okay, because I have felt so bad about this.
No, see I gave up coffee for New Year's, and I'm going through some... kind of withdrawal and...
Forgive me, I had no right to point a finger of blame at you... especially since I've...
Your daughter Angela, a very delightful person by the way... with a firm grasp of language... but she doesn't work up to her full potential.
Are you sure you don't want a cup of coffee?
The old temptress.
I have to tell him the complete truth.
I can't become the type of person that would use another person like that... because I could end up like you!
No offense.
None taken.
Hey, Kyle.
Cherski here has something to tell you.
Shut up!
Hey!
You must have lost this?
I found it hanging from a urinal.
Thanks.
Kyle, we really have to talk.
Listen, I rented this video, and I thought maybe we could... hang at your place tonight and watch it?
Kyle, there's something that I have to explain.
It's that movie where these two housewives on the run... in this convertible and they're babes, but they're really old babes?
- Kyle, look.
- Who else is in it?
- You know that guy...
- Brad Pitt?
Yeah!
He's hitchhiking, and they pick him up!
He's wearing a cowboy hat and no shirt!
And next thing you know, Brad Pitt and that wacky babe... are going at it in this cheap hotel all night long!
What did you want to explain?
Nothing!
- How about 7:30?
- That's fantastic!
God, I cannot believe how intense that was.
I know.
I mean, he seems like a sweet guy.
Absolutely.
I just hope we hear from him.
Rickie.
Well, look, he knows where we are if he needs us.
Listen, Patty... there's something I have to tell you.
It's been kind of weighing on me.
I haven't been completely honest... about something and I just can't...
Oh, God, just say it.
Just say it.
I want to open this restaurant.
See, I missed Angela's birth because I got stuck in that airport... and I missed college because I did.
And I missed Woodstock twice.
And I don't want to miss this.
I will be totally supportive.
Really?
But I thought, I mean, you mean that?
Yes!
God, yes!
I will be unbelievably supportive.
Wait, wait a second!
What did you think I was going to say?
Never mind!
That girl who's number you got for me?
She's junior, so I don't know if you still think I should call her...
I mean...
I cannot stop thinking about how you did that... how you just got up and went over there?
I mean, how did you do that?
- Maybe we better get down to work.
- Okay.
You can even start with the basics, you know?
Okay.
I mean, even if it seems like too basic?
Start with that.
And then after if you want...
I can teach you how to get someone's phone number.
Hello?
Mr. Katimski?
It's me, Enrique.
I'm sorry to bother you, but...
Enrique!
You're not, don't be silly.
Where are you?
I'm fine!
I'm really fine!
How are you?
Enrique, listen to me.
Do you need a place to stay?
Because I was at the Chases today, and they care about you.
- You can go back there.
- You were at the Chases?
Why?
Because I was worried about you!
I am worried about you!
But, but it's okay!
I'm fine, I'm really fine!
You don't have to worry.
And actually, I found this place to stay.
- What place?
Where?
- Just a place.
I can't stay at that shelter.
- I know, Enrique, listen.
Never mind, we can talk about it tomorrow.
You have a safe place?
To spend the night?
Yes.
Okay.
Take care?
- Could you please stop doing that?
- No.
So, what's going to happen to him?
The kid?
The kid will be just fine, if he lives through the night.
That guidance counselor promised me that she'd pull some strings... to get him in some group home... it should only take five or six weeks, it'll be fine!
It was question, not a criticism.
But you're thinking, why didn't I tell him that he could stay here tonight...
- You're thinking...
- No, I'm not.
Well, I am!
We all know what could happen if we did take him in, if it got out... you realize what people could make of it?
- I'd lose my job, be crucified.
- I didn't say anything.
What am I supposed to do?
Just decide like that, that I'm the solution to some kids life?
How egotistical is that?
God, I just hate myself, but I can't!
Don't hate yourself.
Hallie?
Sorry, I didn't see you.
Did I scare you?
I do have that affect on people.
You don't scare me.
So, Patty is really behind this now, she's very into it.
That's great!
So here's the deal.
I did a major schmooze job on the landlord, he said if we sign now... he'll waive the first two months, so, worst case we've thrown away... ten months rent, but at least we'll have a place to show investors.
I hope to God I haven't pressured you into this.
Are you crazy?
Of course you pressured me into it, no question.
No, be honest...
I mean, people only do what they want to do, I mean... you wouldn't be here if you didn't really want to be, right?
You know...
Brad had this theory about you... actually about me.
He had a theory?
Then he lost it?
No, he probably still has it, but... we broke up.
What?
When did this happen?
We just decided to not be engaged anymore.
Well, I mean, he decided.
I don't know, it's just, you know, it's the New Year... and you find yourself kind of taking stock or what have you... coming to certain realizations.
I'm really sorry.
So, what was this theory?
God, if I don't get over to that lawyer we won't even have a lease!
You won't regret this.
Your address was in the phonebook.
I'm sorry.
It just got so hard to be alone!
Come on.

Us, Manhattan boys, we jump off cliffs into the Harlem River, which is literally shitty, because half a million toilets flush into it every day.
Whoo-oo!
[Whistles]
Yeah!
Oooh!
Yeah!
Hey, y'all, I carried the clothes up, but I ain't carrying them down.
Peepee, this is you... all 33 pounds of you, gone with the wind.
Wow.
That's a long way down.
Devil's toe is no big deal.
We've all done it a million times.
I never done it.
You never did it?
Pedro, you never do nothing.
You know who was awesome on this rock?
Bobby.
That kids would do back flips off this rock.
Hey, Mickey.
What?
Don't talk about him like he's dead.
He's not dead.
There goes the circle line.
Check it out.
[Horn Blows]
Whoo!
Full moon!
Whoo!
Hey, yo!
Whoo!
Hey, circle this!
[Whistle]
Hey, I'm going.
Watch out, watch out...
I'm going to show you how to do it.
Ye-ea-ah!
That was a good jump.
Oh, he's nuts.
Hey, I'm going to walk down.
What you talking about?
You can't walk down.
There's no way to walk down.
I ain't jumping.
Pedro, your clothes are down there.
How you gonna get your clothes?
You going to walk around naked all day?
Pedro, if you don't jump, Mickey's going to tease you so bad--
You might as well just jump and get it over with.
Feel better.
What the hell, right?
Oh... shit...
Pedro!
Bad form.
Bad form.
Oh...
My God!
Oh, shit.
Is he all right?
Pedro, you all right?
You ready?
Yeah.
Listen, don't tell the other guys, but when we leave here, I got a surprise for you.
Tell me what it is.
It's a surprise.
Trust me, all right?
Ouch, don't mess around, man...
Alright, you ready?
Come on!
You ready?
- Let's jump.
- On three.
Ready?
Uh-huh.
1, 2,
3.
Come on.
Let's go.
What's up, Manny?
How you doing?
Fine.
Thank you, sir.
This is my friend Jim.
How you doing?
I can't believe I hit my head on that rock.
It's killing me.
Jim, um, this is Winkie.
- Hi.
- How you doing?
Good.
And this... this is Blinkie.
- Hi.
- Hi.
# I lost my heart #
# Under the bridge #
# That little girl... #
I've seen you play ball, Jim.
You're a very beautiful player.
Very zen.
# And now I moan #
# And now I holler #
# She'll never know #
# Just what I found #
# That blue-eyed girl # lt'll make you fuck like Superman.
# She said no more #
Faster than a speeding bullet...
# Became blue-eyed whore... #
More powerful than a locomotive...
# Down by the water #
# Down by the water... #
Able to, um...
I can't think of anything with a single bound.
# See her again #
# See her again... #
Do you have any protection?
Yeah.
This one's, uh, ribbed for extra pleasure.
So what are you waiting for?
What do you mean?
Take off your clothes.
Well, uh... could we shut off the lights first?
# Little fish, big fish #
# Swimming in the water #
# Come back here, man #
# Give me my daughter #
# Little fish, big fish #
# Swimming in the water ##
White ship disappears in the wave machine this morning.
Your eyes got shut with secret chains that pillow armies eventually set free... like soft horses through toy deserts.
I love this mansion, though it's too many windows... to open halfway each morning... to close halfway each night.
I looked at his body, and it was death for the first time.
His face was thin and wrinkled, almost apelike.
His hair, just gray patches on his scalp.
He looked 60 years old, and he was 16.
Couldn't believe how skinny he was... much skinnier than he was in the hospital.
It was like having the skeleton of someone you knew put right in front of you.
I felt dazed, like I'd just come out of a four-hour movie I didn't understand.
I kept thinking about his face... and death... what a cheat the whole thing was.
Hey, you guys remember that Halloween when Bobby filled that paper bag with dog shit, lit it on fire and put it outside Father Dunne's door, and we all hid behind the dumpster?
Yeah.
I could picture Father Dunne comming outside, stepping on that shit.
Picture him in the john-- scraping the shit off his shoe like this.
You think that'll keep him out of heaven?
Are you kidding?
Jesus Christ himself would have laughed at that.
It was hilarious!
What about the time at the formal when Bobby got caught in the bathroom with Mary Ann Dugan and McNulty came in and busted him?
He was, like, "Father, I swear.
We weren't doing anything."
Meanwhile she's got a giant wad of cum hanging off her face.
I tell you, that kid was definitely a pisser.
It was weird seeing him today, man.
He was all shriveled up and wrinkled.
He looked like my grandfather.
I'll tell you what, though.
That kid was in so much pain, it's better off he died.
How the hell would you know, Mickey?
Did you go and visit him?
Huh?
Any of you guys go and visit him?
All right.
Then shut the fuck up.
Hey, Jim.
Look at my brother's girlfriend in the park.
She's sitting there, eating a sandwich.
Next thing you know, she's shot in the head.
She's dead.
It's over.
What about little Teddy Rayhill?
Perfect example.
Remember that night he was up on the roof, and he was doing poppers, having a great time, laughing his ass off
He started walking backwards...
Boom!
He fell right off the goddamn roof.
It was meant to be, right?
Fuck that, you guys!
Bobby was the best fucking guy around, you know that?
What are you, a bunch of idiots?
You don't even understand, do you?
Jim, you all right?
Huh?
Listen, maybe you should talk to one of the priests.
I don't know.
Maybe...
Maybe they can help you out.
Help me out?
I wouldn't ask one of those cocksuckers for directions.
You know what?
You guys need to lighten the fuck up, all right?
Let bygones be fucking bygones.
Shitty fucking world.
Live life to the fucking fullest.
You know what I mean?
Shit happens, man.
Shit fucking happens.
[Thunder]
Come on.
Let's go.
Jim, come on.
You're growing up, and rain sort of remains on the branches of a tree that will someday rule the earth.
And that's good that there's rain.
Clears the month of your sorry rainbow expressions.
And it clears the streets of the silent armies so we can dance.
# Ted sniffing glue He was 12 years old #
# Fell from the roof on east 2-9 #
# Cathy was 11 when she pulled the plug # # 26 reds and a bottle of wine #
# Bobby had leukemia, 14 years old #
# He looked like 65 when he died #
# He was a friend of mine #
# Those are people who died, died #
# Those are people who died, died #
# Those are people who died, died #
# Those are people who died, died #
# They were all my friends #
# They just died #
# Those are people who died, died #
# Those are people who died, died #
# Those are people who died, died #
# Those are people who died, died #
# They were all my friends and they died ##
Did I ever tell you about the first time I did heroin?
I went down to Pedro's basement.
All sorts of characters were in the storage-room shooting gallery.
I was just going to sniff a bag, but a guy says,
"If you're going to sniff, might as well pop it, and if you're going to pop it, might as well mainline."
I was scared of needles, but I gave in.
It was like a long heat wave through my body.
Any ache or pain or sadness or guilty feeling was completely flushed out.
Look, Ma, I'm not in the mood for your dime-store psychology, all right?
Could you just please leave me alone?
I got a little sick, all right?
We're not going to live like this, Jim.
We're not going to live like this.
I'm warning you!
I'm telling you.
Oh, God, Mom.
You're always warning me, aren't you?
Blah, blah, blah.
You're always in my fucking ear.
Blah, blah, blah.
You don't know anything.
What are you talking about?
Go clean toilets or whatever the hell it is you do.
When you're done, clean this one.
Don't talk like that!
What's the matter with you?
Gee whiz, Ma, you know... we got to have these heart-to-heart talks more often.
They're really good for us.
I don't know you.
I don't believe this is you, Jim.
Please, Jim.
I don't know who you are.
Yeah, I know.
I was such a good little boy, right... with such potential, wasn't that it?
Is that what you're going to say?
Oh, Jim.
What's happening?
Jim, what's happening?
First, it's a Saturday-night thing, and you feel cool, like a gangster or a rock star.
It's just something to kill the boredom, you know?
They call it a chippie, a small habit.
It feels so good, you start doing it on Tuesdays, then Thursdays.
Then it's got you.
Every wise-ass punk on the block says it won't happen to them, but it does.
Go do it!
I ain't doing it.
I always do it!
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could you tell me the fastest way to the subway?
Yeah.
That's the "B" train.
Go to this corner and make a left.
It's right there.
What are you doing?
Let go!
Let go!
Let go of that!
Oh, my God!
What?
Oh!
- Help!
No!
No!
- What are you doing?
Let's go!
Come on!
I don't feel like going in today.
Father, is it all right if I don't go in today?
Why?
What are you scared of?
Nothing.
I just don't feel like it, that's all.
I imagine you have more to confess than anybody here.
Unburden yourself.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been about four months since my last confession.
Yes, my son?
Well, I don't know where to start, Father.
Have you taken the name of Jesus Christ in vain?
Yeah.
Yeah, I have.
Have you disrespected your mother and father?
Uh-huh.
Have you stolen or cheated your fellow man?
Yeah, but I'm not proud of it.
Have you had impure thoughts or engaged in impure deeds?
Oh, Father, you have no idea.
Is there something else that you want to tell me in your own words?
I've done all kinds of crazy shit.
Oh, excuse me, Father.
Fuck, I'm s...
Christ, I have a dirty mouth.
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry about that.
Will you just go on?
10 Hail Marys, five Our Fathers.
What do you mean?
And that's it?
That's my punishment?
You know something?
My friend Bobby, he was the best, and he's dead.
This sucks!
You know that?
This really sucks.
It's not fair, Father.
Your nose is running, your stomach cramps, your legs feel like they've played six straight games on top of each other, and the voice is always there in the back of your head...
"Just one more time.
then we'll stop."
Quick to the ball.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Good, Ignatius.
Good.
Good.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Right behind you.
Sir, all right if I use the bathroom, Coach?
Jim, you got a bladder like a woman.
Let's go.
Again.
There we go.
Right behind him.
Right behind him.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Two hands.
Jim?
I thought you were taking a piss.
Oh.
What are you doing in here every practice?
Have you been waiting for me, Jim?
Giving me some kind of a signal?
What are you talking about, Swifty?
Don't act surprised.
Do we understand each other?
It's not going to happen, Swifty.
Put the money away.
You want more?
Here.
Just let me do it.
Get the fuck out of my face!
Take it easy, Jim.
You can't blame me for trying.
I made a mistake, all right?
Let's just pretend it never happened.
Things will go back to exactly how they were before.
Okay?
Okay?
Here, keep the money.
Keep the money.
Just don't tell anybody, all right?
Good.
Tell anybody you want!
Nobody's going to believe a drughead like you, anyway.
You think we don't know what you've been doing?
Give me the fucking money and get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck-- Get the fuck out here!
Come on!
Get out of here!
And you want to stop.
You really do.
But it's like a dream.
You can't stop dreams.
They move in crazy pieces, any way they want to, and suddenly, you're capable of anything.
Ha ha ha!
No!
Wake up, Mr. Carroll!
It's later than you think.
Oh.
All right!
- I need a lift.
- All right.
What do you got?
Three different pills.
Which are the ups?
I never asked.
I thought one of youse would know.
Oh, great.
We look like pharmacists?
I don't know what to take.
What do we take?
Let me see.
The blacks and the reds are the ups.
I think the pink ones are the ups.
Why?
'Cuz I associate pink with lightness, you know?
The black ones seem like they'd knock you on your ass.
They might be faded seconals.
No, they're not faded.
They'd be sticky.
They're not.
That's bullshit.
- Fuck your mother.
- My what?
All right!
Calm down.
Don't ever talk about my mother.
Don't ever hit me like that again.
Come on!
Alright!
Give me your hat.
We got a game to play, alright?
Just give me something.
Hi, Neutron.
Let me ask him.
Neutron, you know which ones are the ups?
I think you should put that shit away before Swifty comes in here.
Why you acting like such a square ass?
Screw you, Mickey.
Screw you, too, Tough guy.
Man.
I'm just going to take the black.
You sure?
Mm-hmm.
You got a better idea?
Nope.
Your guess is as good as mine, Jimbo.
It's on today.
50 rebounds.
Good.
Come on.
Let's go.
I'm your friend now, right?
What, I got to smack you again, c'mon!
Yeah, take your little rat with you.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, what's up?
Why are you acting like that?
You know what's wrong.
Used to be about getting high and playing basketball.
Now it's just about getting high with you.
You're blowing it, Jim.
Oh, come on.
I don't need to hear this from you, Neutron.
Yeah, you do, Jim!
Listen, no, Jim!
I'm really proud of you, man.
Everything's cool.
You look great.
I'll see you in the NBA.

Did you find it?
No, Father.
It's clean.
There's no drugs in there.
Thank you, Officer.
I told you we didn't have nothing.
You boys think you're awfully smart, don't you?
Well, you're both suspended for a week!
Ooh...
And you'll never play basketball here again.
That you can count on.
You can't kick me off the team, Swifty.
Oh?
Why is that?
'Cause I quit the team... and the school and this whole faggot-ass scene, that's why.
I could second that motion.
Your resignations are accepted!
Neutron, you coming with us?
Huh?
Yeah.
That's what I figured.
Come on, man.
I'm fucking out of here.
Don't worry, Swifty.
I'm not going to rat you out.
And in the next life, Father,
I'm going to have the paddle!
Get out!
Thanks a lot, Neutron.
Thanks, man.
I can't believe this, you know?
I know.
What happened to the pills?
We got kicked out of the school, Mickey.
Who cares, man?
We lost the pills.
The cops took them--
We can't play ball anymore.
Jim, who cares about school, man?
We just lost $40 worth of pharmaceuticals.
I know what happened to them, too.
The cops, they take that all the time.
They either pop them themselves or they sell them.
What's my mom going to say, man?
When I go home?
She ain't gonna say nothing.
You just tell her you're going to school every day in the morning.
Let's get out of here, man...
Go get into something.
You never sold any pills at the schoolyard?
No.
So it's all a big conspiracy against you.
Right, Jim?
Yeah.
Maybe it is.
Maybe it's not.
You been missing these?
What are you going to tell me...
they're vitamins?
Oh, fuck you, Ma.
What?
!
Get out of my house!
Oh, is that what you want, Ma?
Get out!
You don't talk to me that way!
If that's what you want, I'm fucking out of here.
All right?
What are you doing?
I'm leaving!
What do you think?
I wan you to take all your shit!
I'll help you.
Here!
You want me to leave?
Yes.
Get out!
I'm out of here.
Get the fuck out of my way!
This garbage is going to kill you, Jim!
I'm gone!
Gonna to kill you!
Don't you understand?
I can't watch you kill yourself?
Ma, you're never going to fucking see me again, alright?
Just remember that.
Don't say that, Jim.
Don't say that!
It was a dream, not a nightmare... a beautiful dream I could never imagine in a thousand nods.
I saw this girl next to me who wasn't beautiful until she smiled,
and I felt that smile come at me and heat waves following, soaking through my body and out my fingertips in shafts of color.
And I knew somewhere in the world... somewhere...
that there was love for me.
We just got to raise enough cash to keep our heads straight.
Luckily, finding money in New York is like getting laid at the prom... easy.
- Fuck it, Pedro!
- What's the matter with you?
Jesus!
Watch the road.
You could kill us all, c'mon!
I get 1,500 bucks for this car.
If it's whacked up, it's worth nothing.
We should buy shit in bulk, man
We'll put it on the street and make real money.
That's 500 bucks a piece.
We'll be on for days, nights, weeks.
Yeah, man.
I'd love to go to Puerto Rico, soak up some rays, you know?
See my bitch?
That's what I'd like to do.
- What are you talking about?
- What bitch?
We haven't seen a picture or nothing.
She's 500 pounds, Jim.
She got a mustache thicker than her father.
No.
That's your mother, Mickey.
She does not exist.
Don't fool yourself.
Be careful.
I'm about to whack.
Oh, shit, man.
My brother's going to take care of us and this car.
Pedro, wake the fuck up!
Pedro, come on, man!
You're going to get us killed, what are you doing?
I got it, man.
You want me to drive?
Mickey, you better drive the car.
I'm serious, man.
Just don't blow my high.
If there's a scratch in the car, my brother'll kill me.
Yo, get out of the booth!
Get out the booth, huh?
Get out.
Fucking...
What's up?
What's up?
Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Where's the car?
It's good to see you, too.
It's over here.
It's nice.
It's smokin'.
You tell me that?
It's everything you wanted.
Get your hands off.
You guys look like shit.
Oh, my God.
They're taking the car.
Show me the sign, man!
Show me the freaking sign!
It's right there.
You see?
It says "tow-away." Huh?
You scumbags even read?
I should kick all your punk asses!
Goddamn it!
I can get you another car tonight.
Yeah?
John Halligan is waiting for this car.
I got him out of bed with his wife.
You know how this makes me fucking look?
Kenny, get off.
You're too stupid to be my brother!
You're too stupid!
You want a piece of me, Carroll?
Back off!
Back off!
- Kenny, no more!
- Mr. Tough Guy.
- Kenny, no more!
- Huh?
Tough guy?
Give me a sip of your soda.
You wipe off the bottle before you take a sip?
You don't even think twice about sharing works with Mickey.
You think you'll catch something from the bottle you're not catch from a needle?
You mistake me for somebody who gives a shit.
Headquarters...
home on and off to every down-and-out junkie and wino from 14th Street to the Bowery.
It's like a fucking all-star team.
Jimmy, the other day, my mother's been ragging on me,
"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
"You've tried every other way.
Go to church.
Put yourself in Christ's hands."
So I do it, man.
I figure, give it a shot.
I dig Jesus.
So, I go, man.
High mass...
a choir and everything.
The first thing I see on the right, the side altar, are those little candles in the red glass that we used when it was windy in the park to cook up.
And then, this altar boy, he's coming down the aisle with this 6-foot candle.
I envision this huge spoon above it, man, with, like, shopping bags full of dope inside of it.
And then the kicker comes, man.
The priest, he starts doing the thing with the incense.
You know, starts wafting out.
I'm in the back.
It finally hits me.
"Where do I know this smell from, man?
My room, man."
It's the smell exactly of really primo dope cooking up.
Yeah?
Exactly the same.
So what happened next?
At that point, I split.
I went home,
I went inside my closet,
I got my stash out of the inside pocket of my sharkskin easter suit, and I got stoned.
Ba bing... ba bang.
I love a ritual.
Oh, Mary, if you can hear me...
I need you to fill Jim's heart with love because he really needs it now.
Oh, God... please watch over my son.
He needs you now.
Just take care of him, okay?
I'll be okay.
I love you, Jim.
I love you.
Hey, you holding?
You straight, man?
Get out of here.
Come on.
No.
Hey, have you seen Falco?
Come on, man.
Are you holding anything?
Hey, Diane...
Come here, Diane.
- I'll take care of you, babe.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
How about some of this?
Ha ha!
I wouldn't do you for a bag, you fucking piece of shit.
Jim.
Jimmy.
You're looking good.
Who's your embalmer?
I want some of what you got.
Shh.
Check everything in this place.
Wow.
I always wanted to use these syrup pumps.
And these professional ice-cream scoopers.
Oh, my God.
Don't make me do it!
I'll do it!
I swear to God!
Jim, watch out.
Come on!
It's not opening.
They don't make them like this anymore.
You got to get it from the side.
I got it!
Oh, cool.
Change!
Shit!
Let's get out of here.
It's locked.
We got to go out the back.
Pedro, let's get out of here!
What am I, hallucinating here?
Pedro, you'll get us caught.
The cops are going to come.
Oh, you want to be tough, huh?
Go ahead... take another sip so I can blow your fucking head all over the counter!
Go ahead, Pedro!
Go ahead!
Come on, guys!
Let's go.
Put that gun away!
Don't fuck with me, motherfucker!
What the hell are you doing, Mickey?
What the hell did you do that for?
Let that little spic rot, man!
He'll get us caught.
Jim, the cops are coming.
Come on!
Jim!
Jim!
Pedro!
Pedro!
Jim!
Freeze!
Freeze!
On your stomach!
On your stomach!
I didn't do anything, I'm telling you!
This is it, man.
That Jew got to keep the money under his pillow.
Hey, Jim, I know you're still mad about Pedro.
I couldn't do nothing, man.
He was going to get us caught.
Definitely shouldn't have went that far.
What happened to you?
Your mother kick your ass?
Yeah, real funny.
Bring us a couple of Cokes, will you?
You all right?
Hey, bartender, move out of the way.
Jim, I'm getting sick.
I got to get some money to cop.
Jim.
You with me here?
What the hell are you wa...
Oh, shit.
That's Neutron.
That's the all-American high school game?
We could have played in that game.
Who gives a shit?
Come on.
I'm waiting to hear back on a scholarship from Saint John's...
I'm not sure about it, but hopefully it will work out.
Jim, I'm starting to jones.
Gotta get out there.
We need some money.
Jim, don't dwell on these dreams, man.
Will you come on?
Meet you outside, man.
I'm getting sick.
You want to meet me out there?
Is it okay if I say hi to my mom?
Hi, Mom.
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.
# You don't know it, but you're coming right along #
# Please be strong #
# You don't know it, but you're coming right along ##
Hey, you!
Stop!
You can't go in there!
Stop!
What do you want?
You realize what time it is?
Yeah.
Um... is Winkie and Blinkie here?
Who the hell are Winkie and Blinkie?
Hey, guys.
Lisa, Mel, you know this boy?
No, Daddy.
Come on.
All right.
Come on.
Get out of here.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Rubin.
He got past me.
- Don't let it happen again.
It won't happen again.
Get out of here!
What?
What?
Asshole.
Hey, fuck-up, get fucking up, man!
- What's your problem, man?
- What's YOUR problem, mam?
You sold my girlfriend some shit the other day.
You almost killed her.
What was it... rat poison?
It's not my fault your girl can't handle her drugs.
I want my fucking $20 back, man.
Look, there's no money-back guarantees.
I'm not selling refrigerators here.
Oh, yeah?
I'll cut you a dynamite deal on mexican shit.
Give me my $20, or we'll go outside.
If we go outside, one of us is going to get hurt.
I told you one of us would get hurt.
Is that right?
It's been hard...
the writing...
lately.
Terrible numbness, then suddenly it comes... in beautiful fragments or terrible dreams... like nods... so high.
Uh!
Reggie, is that you?
Who the fuck do you think it is?
Ohh...
Don't worry, you're not dead yet.
It's not bad.
Hey, give me that.
How come it's all wet?
Because you pissed on it.
I didn't say you could read this.
What, have you been digging through all my stuff?
I need...
I got to get out of here.
Where's my jacket?
You're welcome.
What the hell am I thanking you for?
Because you was frozen in the snow like a goddamn creamsicle.
Where is it?
What?
You know what the fuck I'm talking about, Reggie!
Where is it?
You mean this?
Huh?
Give it to me.
I'll cut your fucking throat, Reggie!
Give it to me, all right?
Just give it to me!
Oh, give it to me!
Give it to me!
I'm serious!
Give me it!
Give it to me!
Goddamn it!
I'll make you an incredible offer.
I'm going to save your life twice in one day, understand me?
You should have left me in the fucking snow, man.
Give me the money for my dope, too.
I'm not gonna suck your dick, all right?
Put that away.
Who the hell wants you to suck their dick?
Goddamn it!
Look at yourself!
Just look at yourself.
Oh, Reggie... it's okay.
Why are you doing this?
Because once upon a time, somebody helped me, and I always pay what I owe.
Reggie.
Reggie, I just need a taste.
I just need a little something, Reggie.
You don't understand.
It hurts, Reggie!
Ow!
Reggie, I got to go.
I got to go see my mom.
You got to let me get out of here, Reggie.
Reggie!
It hur...
It hurts.
Aah!
Shit!
Oh, boy...
# Touch the taste and taste the smell #
# Smell the scent, all the gifts you gave to me, baby #
# The food of your brain #
# The room is spinning round #
# I never come down #
# The room is spinning round #
# I never come down... #
Reggie.
you got to give me it.
You got to give me it, Reggie.
Please!
Oh!
Reggie, come on!
# I remember you, too #
# I blew my mind ##
Wake up.
Can't sleep all day.
Oh.
Thanks.
Jesus Christ.
What happened to you?
What does it look like?
Motherfucker shot me.
Woke my black ass up.
Shit.
Look, uh...
I'll be back in the morning, Jim.
You just stay cool.
You start to get panicky, write about me in that book of yours.
Actually, I was a little hurt I wasn't mentioned.
You really like my writing, huh, Reggie?
Damn, man, I told you four times already.
What do you want me to do?
Bend over and kiss your ass?
Hey, Reg, do me a favor.
While you're out, pick me up a bag.
# The room is spinning round #
# I may never come down #
I am alone.
Not just me.
We're alone... alone forever.
And who's at the end of that forever tunnel I run through, up Fifth with the wallpaper of skyscrapers?
I'm thinking, after all those beautiful trips, that this is one of those bad ones.
Diane?
Hey!
Jim.
Remember me?
Man, you look great.
Yeah, thanks.
Good to see somebody from the old neighborhood...
What do you want, Jim?
- You holding anything?
- No.
Just like a 5 or something?
Just to tide me over, you know?
Please, Diane?
Come on.
Yeah.
For an old friend?
Why not?
I've been looking all over for this.
Oh, you know what?
I only got a 20.
A 20 is good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
A 20 is great, yeah.
That would help me out a lot.
- You want a 20?
- Yeah.
Why don't you go buy yourself some pretzels, you asshole.
You bitch!
You're nothing but a whore!
I don't give a shit about your clothes!
You're still a whore to me!
Yeah?
Shut up.
Look at you.
Oh, are you desperate now, baby?
Who's a whore now?
Don't talk to me like that, you bitch!
Ha ha.
Who's laughing, stupid?
Don't play a game with me!
I know you!
Ah!
Shit.
Oh, man.
Shit.
Ha ha ha!
Mickey.
Mick, what's up, man?
Hey, what's up, man?
Did you get anything?
No, not a dime.
You score?
Yeah, I got something.
What'd you get?
About 35 bucks.
35?
Where'd you get it?
I robbed some fucking asshole on the "D" train.
Dude, 35 will keep us on for, like, two days.
Well, could we get some stuff, man?
I'm fucking... my head is...
I see some spics.
I think we can score.
You wanna check it out?
- Yeah, alright.
- Come on.
They're over here.
Why the fuck do we have to cop on the street all the time?
My fucking nuts are itching like crazy.
Think this is him?
Is your name Pino?
Listen... could we get us some dope?
The dude over there said you could help.
You want to cop some shit?
Let me see some cash.
I got it here.
Let me see.
Hey, no money without no taste.
You want a taste?
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Hurry, man.
Come on.
There's fucking cops all over.
That's good, man.
That's good.
All right, listen...
4 for 35.
4 for 35, man?
Come on, man.
$5.00 short.
What's the big deal?
Ta bien, chico...
Toma, toma.
- You got four?
- Yeah.
We should taste this.
Where are we going to cook it up?
I don't know about his guy.
No, he's cool.
Fuck, man!
What's the matter?
- Just taste it!
Come on.
- What do you mean?
I tasted it.
He beat us.
He fucking beat us.
I swear to fucking God...
Put that away!
I'm gonna kill this mother--!
- Come here, motherfucker!
- Put it away!
I'm going to fucking kill you, you motherfucker!
Motherfucker, you're fucking dead, you hear me?
Dude, don't make me do it.
Where's the money?
I want the money.
I want the money and the bags.
Where's the fucking money?
The fucking money!
I want it!
Aah!
No!
-Oh, shit!
- We fucking killed him!
What the fuck do you mean, we?
I didn't fucking touch him!
Don't put that shit on me!
He beat us, man!
He deserved it!
You went too far, Mickey!
Oh, shit!
Is he dead?
Of course he's fucking dead!
He fell six stories!
Jim, come on.
Come on!
Will you come one?
Jim, don't make me leave you here!
Oh, shit.
# Star #
# I'll reach you if I try #
# Show me the truth, yeah #
# Star #
# I'll reach you if I try #
# Show me the truth, yeah ##
Come on, get back up!
Come on!
Get off of me!
What are you doing?
Who is it?
Ma...
let me in.
Ma, let me in!
Please, Ma.
Ma?
Hey, Ma?
Are you in there, Ma?
Ma, is that you?
Yeah.
Ma?
Ma?
- Are you there?
- Yeah.
Hi.
Hi, Ma.
Hi.
Hi.
Listen, I need you to help me out, all right?
I need you to give me some money.
Okay?
I need you to give me, like, five doll...
Like, $20, something like that because I'm in some trouble.
Ma?
Do you hear me, Ma?
Yeah, I hear you.
I can't help you.
Okay, listen, what you got to do is give me some money, okay?
Jim, I can't do that.
Why not?
Mom, you know I'm not going to do anything with it.
I just need to go out of town for a little while 'cause I got into some trouble, and I need some help.
Okay?
So, you got to give me some money, Mom.
Can you hold my hand?
Yeah, I'll hold your hand.
Mom, can you give me some money, please?
Mom, can you give me some money, please?
Stop fucking around!
I can't.
Mom, give me some fucking money, please!
What are you doing?
I'm your son!
I don't have any.
Mom, don't fuck around like this!
Give me some money!
Mom!
Come on!
Let me in the fucking door!
Oh, God.
Oh, fuck.
Let me in.
I need some money.
I need some money real bad.
Ohh...
Oh, God.
Someone's breaking into my apartment.
They have a knife.
Oh!
Mom!
You don't understand, Mom.
You don't know what you're fucking doing to me.
Mom, I'm in pain.
How could you do this to your son, you bitch?
You fucking bitch!
Ah!
Oh, let me in!
I'll do anything!
I'll be a good boy!
I'll be a good boy, mom, if you let me in.
Get off me!
Get off!
No!
No!
You fuckers!
You're not going to do this!
Fuck you!
Ma!
Don't do this!
Ma!
Ma!
Ma!
I got six months in Riker's Island for assault, robbery, resisting arrest, and possession of narcotics.
I sweated out a horrible cure and stayed clean the whole stretch even though it's been easier to get good junk in here than it is on the street.
Shit, it's been hard, man.
All I've been doing is reading these diaries and wondering how the hell I'm still alive, and even if I care.
Suffice to say that I'm finished with the asshole bandits of shower-room rape, and suffice to say that those swine guards won't draw blood from my ankles again.
Suffice to say that I've been just thinking about dumb stuff like what a nice concept it is to have a godmother and a godfather, wondering who my godparents might be.
My mom won't visit me here, so I guess I'll just have to wait till I get home to ask.
Jim?
Who's there?
It's me.
Pedro?
What's up, man?
Nothing.
You know.
I...
I hear you come here.
I just came by to say hi.
I'm sorry about that night at the candy store and everything.
It's all right.
Reform school turned out to be real cool, so don't sweat it.
Did you hear about Mickey, that scumbag?
He went and threw some chump off a roof.
He's getting 5 to 15 years, man.
They tried him like an adult.
Shit.
I got a present for you, Jim.
A bag of the finest dope in Manhattan.
You know, me and you?
Like old times?
I can't.
Come on.
It would be dynamite.
I got this thing to do.
Why don't you come check it out?
No.
I'm going to go, then, you know?
You know how it is.
Take care of yourself, little man.
Know this.
There's different types of users of junk.
You got your rich dilettante square-ass who dabbles now and then and always has enough money to run off to the Riviera if he feels he's fucking around to the danger point.
Street junkies hate these pricks, but they're always suckers, and their money makes them tolerable.
Then you got your upper-middle-class
Westchester preppies... same as the others, basically.
What they're good for is opening their mommy and daddy's eyes to this social virus and putting pressure on the government to do something about it.
Then there's us street kids.
Start fucking around very young,
13 or so...
We think we all got it under control and won't get strung out.
This rarely works.
I'm living proof.
But in the end, you just got to see the junk as another 9-to-5 gig.
The hours are just a bit more inclined to shadows.

[Woman] Go fuck yourself, you son of a bitch bastard!
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done, you fuck!
Give us this day our daily bread, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Jesus, Jesus the Nazarene.
Go to hell.
Go to hell.
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Jim, you're not going to waste the whole day lying around?
Ma, I'm up.
The loony alarm went off.
Close the blinds.
Don't look at her.
Don't listen.
How could I not?
Jesus the Nazarene.
[Pffft]
Mary the whore.
Mary the hairdresser.
Our Father, Who art...
Hey, lady!
Shut up!
[Jim] When I was young, about 8 or so,
I tried making friends with God by inviting him to my house to watch the World Series.
He never showed.

Too bad, Father.
I was just starting to enjoy myself.
We can do it again tomorrow if you like, Mr. Carroll.
You O.K., Jim?
Does it hurt?
You want to rub it for him, Pedro?
Jim, give it a rest.
You'll never beat him.
The guy's a pervert.
Did you hear him?
"We can do it again tomorrow if you like."
Let's cut out of here.
Come on.
# I was born in a pool #
# They made my mother stand #
# I spat on that surgeon #
# And his trembling hand #
# When I felt the light #
# I was worse than bored #
# I stole a doctor's scalpel #
# And I slit the cord #
# I was a Catholic boy #
# I was redeemed through pain #
# Not through joy #
# I was two months early #
# They put me under glass #
# I screamed and cursed their children #
# When the nurses passed #
# I was convicted of theft #
# As I slid from the womb #
# They led me straight from my mother #
# To a cell in the tombs #
# I was a Catholic boy #
# Redeemed through pain #
# Not through joy #
# They starved me for weeks #
# They thought they'd teach me fear #
# I fed on cellmates' dreams #
# It gave me fine ideas #
# When they cut me loose #
# The time had served me well #
# I'd made allies in heaven #
# Comrades in hell #
# I was a Catholic child #
# The blood ran red #
# The blood ran wild ##
[Retching]
Why, you little prick!
This is my new shirt!
Guys, let's go.
I threw up on somebody.
I'll get you!
You little prick!
Your mother!
Bastard!
I'll fucking throw you in the river!
[Boat Horn Blows]
Hey!
Ha ha ha!
What about the four of us versus Wilt Chamberlain?
He was the greatest.
Four of us?
What will you do, Pedro, tie his shoes together when he ain't looking?
All right...
the three of us.
No problem.
You're kidding, right, Mickey?
No.
He can't cover all of us at the same time.
You guys don't miss open jumpers.
You know who will be there for the rebounds.
Rebounds?
That freak is 7 feet tall.
I can rebound with anybody.
You're sniffing too much of that shit.
Chamberlain would destroy all of us.
All we got to do is move the ball around.
There's no way we don't win.
Mickey, you could beat him yourself.
You don't need us.
Perfect example...
confidence.
I know I could beat him.
Holy shit.
Look at this place.
If our school was this nice,
I'd go more than once a week.
You?
We got a game today, gentlemen.
Who's ready to play some roundball?
I said, who's ready to play some ball?
You give me that laid-back,
"I'm doing my own thing, Jack" attitude out there today, and you're going to find yourself watching the game from the bench.
No smoking, Iggy...
stunts your growth.
You want to be big and strong like me, don't you?
Out.
No smoking, and no pulling your peckers before a game.
Swifty, do you mind?
I'm taking a dump.
Get out of here!
Something die in there?
When we play our game... so Pedro vomits on his head, right?
It goes all over his hair, trickles down his neck.
Some gets in his eye.
Don't lie about it, either.
What are you doing?
We're signing a ball for Bobby.
Can I sign?
Yeah.
"We're holding your spot for you, kid.
Swifty."
All right.
This one's for Bobby.
All right.
Who's better than we are?
- Nobody!
- Nobody!
Right!
Go ahead.
Do some warm-ups.
Pedro, you're in charge.
You're my eyes and ears.
Hey, Jim.
Yeah.
That's a nice thing you're doing for Bobby.
Oh, thanks.
Thanks.
You seen Neutron?
I think he's talking to a scout from Saint John's, as a matter of fact.
You want to play college ball, don't you?
Yeah.
Someday, I hope.
You know.
Yeah.
Scouts are sniffing you out already.
They like them young.
I'll tell you what.
You come by sometime, and we'll go over the schools together.
Yeah.
All right.
Yeah.
We'll get a pizza, and we'll make a night of it.
Um... actually, my nights are kind of busy right now.
Yeah.
Homework and all, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[Cheering]
We were the hottest Catholic high school team in New York City, on our way to the championship.
We felt like nothing could stop us.
[Swifty] Yeah!
Yeah!
Yes!
We're on our way.
We're on our way.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Hands up.
Show me some defense.
Show me some defense.
Good steal.
Put it in.
Yeah!
[Cheering]
All right.
All right.
Way to go.
Aw, geez.
All right, Neutron.
Yes!
Yes!
To the hole, Jim.
[Whistle Blows]
Whoa!
Whoa!
What's going on?
Break it up!
Come on.
Hit him!
Beat that motherfucker!
[Whistle Blows]
Break it up!
He fucking held me!
[Swifty] Whoa, whoa, whoa!
This dude blows the whistle...
Slow it down!
Slow it down!
[Whistle]
[Cheering]
[Clang]
You got to have presence on the court... presence like a cheetah rather than a chimp.
They both got it, but chimpy got to jump his nuts around to get it.
Shy cheetah just moves in total nonchalance a sec or two in his sexy, slow strut.
Me, I play like a cheetah.
[Cheering]
[Crowd] Let's go, Rangers!
Let's go, Rangers!
Let's go, Rangers!
[Cheering]
Yeah!
Ooh!
You got it!
It's ours.
It's ours.
Oh!
Yeah!
[Crowd] 9, 8, 7,
6, 5,
4, 3,
2, 1.
Yay, Jim!
Oh, shit.
That's my team!
That's my team!
[Crowd Cheering]
There's only two things Swifty forbids... using the word "motherfucker"
and stealing from the other team, as long as they're white.
How much for that group of winners?
It's $34.90.
$34.90?
Changed the prices or something?
No.
Uh...
I'm a little short.
Do me a favor.
Here.
Take my watch, and I'll come back later with the rest of the money.
No.
What do you mean, no?
I'm sorry, sir.
Those burgers are worth more than the watch is.
I'll be right back.
I told you one burger each, didn't I?
It takes at least eight of these to get filled up.
Come on, Swifty.
We're growing boys.
Growing boys?
We're hungry motherfuckers.
Funny, huh?
I'm not driving you guys home.
How's that for laughs?
[Knock On Window]
[No Audible Dialogue]
You ripped them off, didn't you?
We're even now.
Swifty, come on.
How are we going to get home?
Face the music, pricks.
What are we going to do?
They got the door blocked off.
You afraid of these pussies?
I ain't afraid of anybody.
What's the problem?
I'm going to ask you this once.
All right?
Where's the stuff you stole from me?
What are you talking about?
No.
You're not going to fuck with me, all right?
Somebody stole my father's ring from my locker.
You want me to cut you?
There's no problem here.
Hey, guys!
Get out of here!
You need a fucking army, huh?
Aah!
Come on!
Come on!
Yeah, Pedro.
Oh.
Nice.
That from Bobo?
Ha ha ha!
That's his father's ring.
[Slurring Words] Hey, fellas.
Any of you looking for a date?
Yeah.
Me, sweetheart.
Little horsy ride in Central Park, maybe candlelight dinner?
Why don't we skip right to dessert, huh, baby?
About $15?
I'll give you a quarter.
Let Pedro suck your tits.
You don't have to be rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
How about you, handsome, huh?
You got $15... for a little head?
Diane, do I look like I need to pay for it?
Yeah... you do.
If it's worth it.
Jimmy...
Jimmy, I know you want some, honey.
$15.
I'll do you so good you'll never forget it, baby.
Hey, hey!
Ooh!
That's a deal.
Bargain from there.
What do you say, guys?
You want to do it?
Yeah.
It's a deal.
All four of us.
Aw, shit.
This is all I got, Diane.
Here, have a pretzel.
Get out of here.
Beat it.
[Diane] Yeah, fuck you!
Fucking dopehead.
You see what that shit does to you?
Wow.
Speaking of dopeheads, is that Pedro's mother over there slinging her wares again?
It is!
Hey, Peepee, where you going?
Why do you have to be such an asshole?
Why is the little shoe crying anyway?
His mother's a sneaker.
His father's a loafer.
Somebody's got to be a heel.
Jim, where you going?
Hey, Jim!
Jim.
Hey.
Hey, man.
What's up?
You don't recognize me with my new hairdo?
It's nice.
It's nice.
I like it.
What's going on?
How are you?
Good.
Wow.
Look at that.
You like it?
When you get out of here, we'll all shave our heads.
It's a deal.
All right.
I got something for you here.
Yeah.
Everyone on the team.
Look right here... even Swifty signed it.
Thanks, man.
You remember when I dunked on that spade in Riverside Park?
You always had good ups.
Yeah.
Oh.
I got something to show you.
Hold on.
What?
Pedro got these out of some lady's purse.
She's doing it with a donkey.
Oh, Jesus.
Look at that schlong.
Look at that.
Oh, I beat your record.
How many times you choke it?
Seven times.
Bullshit.
Seven times.
Mom thinks I have a cold year-round because of all the tissues around the house.
You can keep those if you want.
They're pumping so much junk in me,
I can't even get a decent chubby.
I got an idea.
Come on.
Let's go.
Where we going?
I'm getting you out of here.
What are you, crazy, man?
I can't go anywhere.
Here you go.
I've known Bobby since I was 3.
He's my best friend.
He was the best player on our basketball team.
Two years ago, he got leukemia.
He keeps fighting it off.
I know Bobby's going to beat it.
He could beat anything.
[Jim] Rrr... watch!
Jim, you're going to kill me, man.
If you let go, I swear...
I swear I'll kill you, man.
Watch the bump!
What the hell happened to forty deuce?
Last time I was here, that theater was playing Sperminator II.
Oh, yeah.
I remember that.
No, man.
This whole block has been done over by all these new artists.
It's pretty cool, huh?
Yeah.
They should put your stuff up there.
Yeah.
Right.
Still scribbling stuff in that notebook of yours, ain't you?
Of course.
You bring anything for me?
What, like to read?
No, like to eat.
What do you think?
Yeah.
I mean, I got this, but it's not a big deal.
I don't even remember writing it, to tell you the truth.
Yeah, Yeah.
I'll be the judge of this.
"Little kids shoot marbles
"where branches break the sun
"into graceful shafts of light.
I just want to be pure."
I just want to be pure.
[Seductive Music Playing]
All right.
# What a life #
Nothing like the real thing to float your boat, huh, Bobby?
# What a life #
# Didn't know where, didn't know when... #
That's nice.
# Said that I'll go...
go learn #
# Put up my hand, wait my turn #
# But it never comes, I have to shout out #
# That's life #
# And that's what it's all about #
# So through the comfort and the strife #
# What a life... ##
Get me out of here, Jim.
What are you talking about, man?
This was a stupid idea.
I don't feel so good.
Well, can we wait till the end of the show?
Did you hear me?
Get me the hell out of here!
Hey, Bob, man...
I'm really sorry.
you know?
Next time, we'll go somewhere...
Ain't gonna be no next time, Jim.
I love it this way... my feet against the tar, which is soft from the spring heat, the slight breeze that runs across your entire body, especially your crotch.
You feel an incredible power being naked under a dome of stars while a giant city is dressed, dodging cars all around you five flights down.
I don't think of anything while I'm doing the actual tugging, least of all the heavy sex fantasies
I have to resort to indoors.
Just my own naked self and the stars breathing down, and it's beautiful.
Time sure flies when you're young and jerking off.
[Woman Reads With Difficulty] "Camp summer position.
Driver... taxi."
Hey, that might be good.
You could get your license this summer.
Oh, yeah, Mom.
That sounds really great.
Hey, get your own job, and if you don't get it this summer, you're coming to work with me at the hotel.
Mom, please.
Why are you so worried?
Do I even ask you for money?
No.
I'm not worried about the money.
I want you to have responsibility.
I don't want you running around the streets of New York.
Idle time is the devil's plaything.
The devil's plaything, huh?
Mm-hmm.
That might be a cool title for my first book.
What are you talking about?
What are you writing?
Devil's plaything.
Here.
Ooh.
Um...
Ma, I'm not really hungry this morning.
Come on.
You got to eat something.
I know.
Where you going?
I'm going to shoot some hoops.
Sometimes I feel like something's chasing me, like there's some whacko on a roof somewhere who could snuff me out at any moment.
Will I have time to finish the poems breaking loose in my head?
Hey, white boy, you ready for your beating?
Don't let your mouth get you into something your ass can't handle.
I'll shoot you for it.
So it's going to be like that, huh?
I... don't think so.
Yeah!
All right, so you made one.
Big deal.
You made one shot.
Make another.
# The days are muzzled in a vibe #
# I swing back from time to time #
# There's a Camaro, rusty red #
# That all my best friends drive in #
# Can you smell the summer air?
#
# Take me where they left the light on #
# Getting close, almost there #
# If that fuzzy silver badge #
# Don't greet us there #
# My head's dizzy, and I'm taking... ##
Yo, Jim!
What's the score?
Come on.
We got to go.
They don't keep score in this game.
Jim, come on.
We're losing the sun.
He's being a dick.
You want me to put a charge in his ass?
Look at right here.
What's this?
Jim's secret diary he's always writing in.
Bet you he wrote some shit about me.
Oh, right here.
"Spring...
Mickey."
Hey, there I am.
Jim says,
"Mickey takes out a bottle of carbonic cleaning fluid and suggests we do a little sniffing to get high."
Whoo!
"After four deep whiffs, we're sailing someplace else."
Mickey, what are you doing?
"Bells ringing through my ears, little lights flashing through my eyes."
Mickey, put that down, all right?
"I pictured myself
"paddling across a river with black water,
"only the canoe was going backwards instead of forwards,
"with clouds that had faces laughing spooky fun-house laughs..."
What is that shit?
Don't be a schmuck.
What are you talking about?
Don't you ever touch that again.
It's private.
What's your problem?
I'm...
I'm sorry.
He's writing about me, I can't read about it?
Jesus.
Hey, Jim, come on.
We're gone.
Yo, we got a cab!
Hey, cabby!
Hey, swami!
So, Shakespeare, you going to finish the game?
Reggie, you know this game never ends.
See you later, all right?
Every crowd has its little games to prove if you're a punk or not.
My cousin in Jersey plays chickie, which is two cars heading towards each other at about 80 miles per hour.
First driver to swerve out of the way is chicken.
In Brooklyn, they make you press a lit cigarette into your arm and have it burn all the way down to the filter without the slightest flinch.
Us Manhattan boys, we jump off cliffs into the Harlem River, which is literally shitty because half a million toilets flush into it every day.
Whoo-oo!
[Whistles]
Yeah!
Whoo!
Yeah!
I carried the clothes up, but I ain't carrying them down.
Peepee, this is you... all 33 pounds of you, gone with the wind.
Wow.
That's a long way down.
Devil's toe is no big deal.
We've all done it a million times.
I never done it.
You never did it?
Pedro, you never do nothing.
You know who was awesome on this rock?
Bobby.
He would do back flips off this rock.
Hey, Mickey.
What?
Don't talk about him like he's dead.
He's not dead.
There goes the circle line.
Check it out.
[Horn Blows]
Whoo!
Full moon!
Whoo!
Hey, yo!
Whoo!
Hey, circle this!
[Whistle]
Hey, I'm going.
I'm going to show you how to do it.
Ye-ea-ah!
[Men Shouting]
[Man] He's crazy!
That was a good jump.
Oh, he's nuts.
Hey, I'm going to walk down.
You can't walk down.
There's no way to walk down.
I ain't jumping.
Your clothes are down there.
You going to walk around naked?
Pedro, if you don't jump,
Mickey's going to tease you.
Jump and get it over with.
What the hell, right?
Oh... shit...
Pedro!
Bad form.
Bad form.
Oh!
My God!
Shit.
Is he all right?
Pedro, you all right?
You ready?
Yeah.
Listen, don't tell the other guys, but when we leave here, I got a surprise for you.
Tell me what it is.
It's a surprise.
Trust me, all right?
You ready?
Come on.
Let's jump.
On three.
Ready?
Uh-huh.
1, 2,
3.
Come on.
Let's go.
What's up, Manny?
How you doing?
Fine.
Thank you, sir.
This is my friend Jim.
How you doing?
I can't believe I hit my head on that rock.
It's killing me.
Jim, um, this is Winkie.
Hi.
How you doing?
Good.
And this... this is Blinkie.
Hi.
# I lost my heart #
# Under the bridge #
# That little girl... #
I've seen you play ball, Jim.
You're a very beautiful player.
Very zen.
# And now I moan #
# And now I holler #
# She'll never know #
# Just what I found #
# That blue-eyed girl # lt'll make you fuck like Superman.
# She said no more #
# She said no more #
Faster than a speeding bullet...
# That blue-eyed girl #
# Became blue-eyed whore... #
More powerful than a locomotive...
# Down by the water #
# Down by the water... #
Able to, um...
I can't think of anything with a single bound.
# Just like my daughter #
# See her again #
# See her again... #
Do you have any protection?
Yeah.
This one's, uh, ribbed for extra pleasure.
So what are you waiting for?
What do you mean?
Take off your clothes.
Well, uh... could we shut off the lights first?
# Little fish, big fish #
# Swimming in the water #
# Come back here, man #
# Give me my daughter #
# Little fish, big fish #
# Swimming in the water ##
White ship disappears in the wave machine this morning.
Your eyes got shut with secret chains that pillow armies eventually set free... like soft horses through toy deserts.
I love this mansion, though it's too many windows... to open halfway each morning... to close halfway each night.
I looked at his body, and it was death for the first time.
His face was thin and wrinkled, almost apelike, his hair just gray patches on his scalp.
He looked 60 years old, and he was 16.
Couldn't believe how skinny he was... much skinnier than he was in the hospital.
It was like having the skeleton of someone you knew put right in front of you.
I felt dazed, like I'd just come out of a four-hour movie I didn't understand.
I kept thinking about his face... and death... and what a cheat the whole thing was.
Remember that Halloween when Bobby filled that paper bag with dog shit, lit it on fire, and put it outside Father Dunne's door, and we all hid behind the dumpster?
Yeah.
I could picture Father Dunne stepping on that shit, picture him in the john scraping the shit off his shoe like this.
You think that'll keep him out of heaven?
Are you kidding?
Jesus Christ himself would have laughed at that.
It was hilarious.
What about the time at the formal when Bobby got caught in the bathroom with Mary Ann Dugan and McNulty busted him?
He was, like, "Father, I swear.
We weren't doing anything."
Meanwhile she's got a giant wad of cum hanging off her face.
I tell you, that kid was definitely a pisser.
It was weird seeing him today, man.
He was all shriveled up and wrinkled.
He looked like my grandfather.
I'll tell you what, though.
That kid was in so much pain, it's better off he died.
How the hell would you know, Mickey?
Did you go and visit him?
Huh?
Did any of you guys go and visit him?
All right.
Then shut the fuck up.
Look at my brother's girlfriend in the park.
She's eating a sandwich.
Next thing you know, she's shot.
She's dead.
It's over.
[Neutron] What about little Teddy Rayhill?
Perfect example.
Remember that night he was on the roof, doing poppers and having a great time?
He started walking backwards...
Boom!
He fell right off the goddamn roof.
It was meant to be, right?
Fuck that, you guys!
Bobby was the best fucking guy around, you know that?
What are you, a bunch of idiots?
You don't even understand, do you?
Jim, you all right?
Huh?
Listen, maybe you should talk to one of the priests.
I don't know.
Maybe...
Maybe they can help you out.
Help me out?
I wouldn't ask one of those cocksuckers for directions.
You know what?
You guys need to lighten the fuck up, all right?
Let bygones be fucking bygones.
Shitty fucking world.
[Crash]
Live life to the fucking fullest.
You know what I mean?
Shit happens, man.
Shit fucking happens.
[Thunder]
Come on.
Let's go.
Jim, come on.
You're growing up, and rain sort of remains on the branches of a tree that will someday rule the earth.
And that's good that there's rain.
Clears the month of your sorry rainbow expressions.
And it clears the streets of the silent armies so we can dance.
# Ted sniffing glue He was 12 years old #
# Fell from the roof on east 2-9 #
# Cathy was 11 when she pulled the plug # # 26 reds and a bottle of wine #
# Bobby had leukemia, 14 years old #
# He looked like 65 when he died #
# He was a friend of mine #
# Those are people who died, died #
# Those are people who died, died #
# Those are people who died, died #
# Those are people who died, died #
# They were all my friends #
# They just died #

Did I ever tell you about the first time I did heroin?
I went down to Pedro's basement.
All sorts of characters were in the storage-room shooting gallery.
I was just going to sniff a bag, but a guy says,
"If you're going to sniff,
"might as well pop it,
"and if you're going to pop it, might as well mainline."
I was scared of needles, but I gave in.
It was like a long heat wave through my body.
Any ache or pain or sadness or guilty feeling was completely flushed out.
Look, Ma, I'm not in the mood for your dime-store psychology, all right?
Could you just please leave me alone?
I got a little sick, all right?
We're not going to live like this, Jim.
I'm warning you!
I'm telling you.
Oh, God, Mom.
You're always warning me, aren't you?
Blah, blah, blah.
You're always in my fucking ear.
You don't know anything.
What are you talking about?
Go clean toilets or whatever the hell it is you do.
When you're done, clean this one.
Don't talk like that!
What's the matter with you?
Gee whiz, Ma, you know... we got to have these heart-to-heart talks more often.
They're really good for us.
I don't know you.
I don't believe this is you, Jim.
Please, Jim.
I don't know who you are.
Yeah, I know.
I was such a good little boy, right... with such potential, wasn't that it?
Is that what you're going to say?
[Retching]
Oh, Jim.
What's happening?
Jim, what's happening?
First, it's a Saturday-night thing, and you feel cool, like a gangster or a rock star.
It's just something to kill the boredom, you know?
They call it a chippie, a small habit.
It feels so good, you start doing it on Tuesdays, then Thursdays.
Then it's got you.
Every wise-ass punk on the block says it won't happen to them, but it does.
Go do it!
I ain't doing it.
I always do it!
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could you tell me the fastest way to the subway?
Yeah.
That's the "B" train.
Go to this corner and make a left.
It's right there.
What are you doing?
Let go!
Let go!
Let go of that!
Oh, my God!
What?
Oh!
Help!
No!
No!
What are you doing?
Let's go!
[Jim] Come on!
[Whispering] I don't feel like going in today.
Father, is it all right if I don't go in today?
Why?
What are you scared of?
Nothing.
I just don't feel like it, that's all.
I imagine you have more to confess than anybody here.
Unburden yourself.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been about four months since my last confession.
Yes, my son?
Well, I don't know where to start, Father.
Have you taken the name of Jesus Christ in vain?
Yeah.
Yeah, I have.
Have you disrespected your mother and father?
Uh-huh.
Have you stolen or cheated your fellow man?
Yeah, but I'm not proud of it.
Have you had impure thoughts or engaged in impure deeds?
Oh, Father, you have no idea.
Is there something else that you want to tell me in your own words?
I've done all kinds of crazy shit.
Oh, excuse me, Father.
Fuck, I'm s...
Christ, I have a dirty mouth.
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry about that.
Can I just go on?
10 Hail Marys, five Our Fathers.
What do you mean?
That's it?
That's my punishment?
You know something?
My friend Bobby, he was the best, and he's dead.
This sucks.
You know that?
This really sucks.
It's not fair, Father.
Your nose is running, your stomach cramps, your legs feel like they've played six straight games on top of each other, and the voice is always there in the back of your head...
"Just one more time.
then we'll stop."
Quick to the ball.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Good, Ignatius.
Quick to the ball.
All right if I use the bathroom, Coach?
Jim, you got a bladder like a woman.
Let's go.
Again.
Right behind him.
Right behind him.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Two hands.
Jim?
I thought you were taking a piss.
Oh.
What are you doing in here every practice?
Have you been waiting for me, Jim?
Giving me some kind of a signal?
What are you talking about, Swifty?
Don't act surprised.
Do we understand each other?
It's not going to happen, Swifty.
Put the money away.
You want more?
Here.
Just let me do it.
Get the fuck out of my face!
Take it easy, Jim.
You can't blame me for trying.
I made a mistake, all right?
Let's just pretend it never happened.
Things will go back to exactly how they were before.
O. K?
O.K., here.
Keep the money.
Keep the money.
Just don't tell anybody, all right?
Good.
Tell anybody you want!
Nobody's going to believe a drughead like you.
You think we don't know what you've been doing?
Give me the fucking money and get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck out!
Come on!
Get out of here!
And you want to stop.
You really do.
But it's like a dream.
You can't stop dreams.
They move in crazy pieces, any way they want to, and suddenly, you're capable of anything.
[Echoing Footsteps]
Ha ha ha!
[indistinct Slow-Motion Voice]
No!
Wake up, Mr. Carroll!
It's later than you think.
Oh.
All right!
I need a lift.
All right.
What do you got?
Three different pills.
Which are the ups?
I never asked.
I thought one of youse would know.
Oh, great.
We look like pharmacists?
I don't know what to take.
What do we take?
Let me see.
The blacks and the reds are the ups.
I think the pink ones are the ups.
Why?
I associate pink with lightness, you know?
The black ones seem like they'd knock you on your ass.
They might be faded seconals.
No, they're not faded.
They'd be sticky.
They're not.
That's bullshit.
Fuck your mother.
My what?
Your mother.
All right!
Calm down.
Don't ever talk about my mother.
Don't ever hit me like that again.
Come on.
Give me your hat.
We got a game to play.
Just give me something.
Hi, Neutron.
Let me ask him.
Neutron, you know which ones are the ups?
I think you should put that shit away before Swifty comes in here.
Why you acting like such a square ass?
Screw you, Mickey.
Screw you, too, Tough guy.
Man.
I'm just going to take the black.
You sure?
Mm-hmm.
You got a better idea?
Nope.
Your guess is as good as mine, Jimbo.
It's on today.
50 rebounds.
Good.
Come on.
Let's go.
I'm your friend now, right?
What, I got to smack you again?
Come on.
Yeah, take your little rat with you.
What's up, man?
What's up?
Why are you acting like that?
You know what's wrong.
Used to be about getting high and playing basketball.
Now it's just about getting high.
You're blowing it, Jim.
Oh, come on.
I don't need to hear this from you.
Yeah, you do.
I'm really proud of you.
Everything's cool.
You look great.
I'll see you in the NBA.

# Killer on the road #

Did you find it?
No, Father.
It's clean.
There's no drugs in there.
Thank you, Officer.
I told you we didn't have nothing.
You boys think you're awfully smart, don't you?
Well, you're both suspended for a week!
Ooh...
[Swifty] You'll never play basketball here again.
That you can count on.
You can't kick me off the team, Swifty.
Oh?
Why is that?
'Cause I quit the team... and the school and this whole faggot-ass scene, that's why.
I could second that motion.
Your resignations are accepted!
[Mickey] Neutron, you coming with us?
Huh?
Yeah.
That's what I figured.
Come on, man.
I'm fucking out of here.
Don't worry, Swifty.
I'm not going to rat you out.
And in the next life, Father,
I'm going to have the paddle.
Get out!
Thanks a lot, Neutron.
Thanks, man.
I can't believe this, you know?
I know.
What happened to the pills?
We got kicked out of school, Mickey.
Who cares, man?
We lost the pills.
We can't play ball anymore.
Jim, who cares about school, man?
We just lost $40 worth of pharmaceuticals.
I know what happened to them, too.
The cops, they take that all the time.
They either pop them themselves or they sell them.
What's my mom going to say, man?
She ain't gonna say nothing.
You just tell her you're going to school every day.
Let's get out of here, man...
Go get into something.
[Jim's Mother] You never sold any pills at the schoolyard?
No.
So it's all a big conspiracy against you.
Right, Jim?
Yeah.
Maybe it is.
Maybe it's not.
You been missing these?
What are you going to tell me...
they're vitamins?
Oh, fuck you, Ma.
What?
Get out of my house!
Oh, is that what you want, Ma?
Get out!
You don't talk to me that way!
If that's what you want,
I'm fucking out of here.
All right?
What are you doing?
I'm leaving!
What do you think?
Take all your shit!
I'll help you.
You want me to leave?
Yes.
Get out!
I'm out of here.
Out of my way!
This garbage is going to kill you, Jim!
I'm gone!
Going to kill you!
[Coughing]
Don't you understand
I can't watch you kill yourself?
Ma, you're never going to fucking see me again.
All right?
Just remember that.
Don't say that, Jim.
Don't say that!
[Trophy Clatters On Street]
It was a dream, not a nightmare... a beautiful dream I could never imagine in a thousand nods.
I saw this girl next to me who wasn't beautiful until she smiled, and I felt that smile come at me and heat waves following, soaking through my body and out my fingertips in shafts of color.
And I knew somewhere in the world... somewhere...
that there was love for me.
[Car Honks In Distance]
We just got to raise enough cash to keep our heads straight.
Luckily, finding money in New York is like getting laid at the prom... easy.
[Car Starts]
Fuck it!
Pedro!
What's the matter with you?
Jesus!
Watch the road!
You could kill us all.
I get 1,500 bucks for this car.
Whacked up, it's worth nothing.
We should buy shit in bulk.
We'll put it on the street and make real money.
That's 500 bucks apiece.
We'll be on for days, nights, weeks.
Yeah, man.
I'd love to go to Puerto Rico, soak up some rays, you know?
See my bitch?
That's what I'd like to do.
What are you talking about?
What bitch?
We haven't seen a picture or nothing.
She's 500 pounds, Jim.
She got a mustache thicker than her father.
No.
That's your mother, Mickey.
She does not exist.
Don't fool yourself.
Be careful.
I'm about to whack.
Oh, shit, man.
My brother's going to take care of us and this car.
Pedro, wake the fuck up!
Pedro, come on, man!
You're going to get us killed!
I got it, man.
You want me to drive?
Mickey, you better drive.
I'm serious, man.
Just don't blow my high.
If the car's scratched, my brother will kill me.
Yo, get out of the booth!
Get out the booth, huh?
Get out.
Fucking...
What's up?
Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Where's the car?
It's good to see you, too.
It's over here.
It's nice.
It's smokin'.
You tell me that?
It's everything you wanted.
Get your hands off.
You guys look like shit.
Oh, my God.
They're taking the car.
Show me the sign, man!
Show me the freaking sign!
It's right there.
You see?
It says "tow-away." Huh?
You scumbags even read?
I should kick all your punk asses!
Goddamn it!
I can get you another car tonight.
John Halligan is waiting for this car.
I got him out of bed with his wife.
You know how this makes me fucking look?
Kenny, get off.
Lay off!
You're too stupid to be my brother!
You're too stupid!
You want a piece of me, Carroll?
Back off!
Back off!
Kenny, no more!
Mr. Tough Guy.
Kenny, no more!
Huh?
Tough guy?
Tough guy?
[Bone Snapping]
Give me a sip of your soda.
You wipe off the bottle before you take a sip?
You don't even think twice about sharing works with Mickey.
You think you'll catch something from the bottle you won't catch from a needle?
You mistake me for somebody who gives a shit.
Headquarters...
home on and off to every down-and-out junkie and wino from 14th Street to the Bowery.
It's like a fucking all-star team.
Jimmy, the other day, my mother's been ragging on me,
"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
"You've tried every other way.
Go to church.
Put yourself in Christ's hands."
So I do it, man.
I figure, give it a shot.
I dig Jesus.
So, I go, man.
High mass...
a choir and everything.
The first thing I see on the right, the side altar, are those little candles in the red glass that we used when it was windy in the park to cook up.
And then, this altar boy, he's coming down the aisle with this 6-foot candle.
I envision this huge spoon above it, man, with, like, shopping bags full of dope inside of it.
And then the kicker comes, man.
The priest, he starts doing the thing with the incense.
You know, starts wafting out.
I'm in the back.
It finally hits me.
"Where do I know this smell from, man?
My room, man."
It's the smell exactly of really primo dope cooking up.
Oh, yeah?
Exactly the same.
So what happened next?
At that point, I split.
I went home,
I went inside my closet,
I got my stash out of the inside pocket of my sharkskin easter suit, and I got stoned.
Ba bing... ba bang.
I love a ritual.
[Jim's Mother] Oh, Mary, if you can hear me...
[Sniffling]
I need you to fill Jim's heart with love because he really needs it now.
Oh, God... please watch over my son.
He needs you now.
Just take care of him, O. K?
I'll be O.K.
[Sniffling]
I love you, Jim.
I love you.
Hey, you holding?
You straight, man?
Get out of here.
Come on.
No.
Hey, have you seen Falco?
Come on, man.
Are you holding anything?
Hey, Diane.
Come here, Diane.
I'll take care of you, babe.
Yeah?
Yeah.
How about some of this?
Ha ha!
I wouldn't do you for a bag, you fucking piece of shit.
Jim.
Jimmy.
Ha ha ha!
You're looking good.
Who's your embalmer?
I want some of what you got.
[Pushes Chair]
Shh.
Check everything in this place.
Wow.
I always wanted to use these syrup pumps.
And these professional ice-cream scoopers.
Oh, my God.
[Spraying Seltzer]
Don't make me do it!
I'll do it!
I swear to God!
Jim, watch out.
Come on!
[Mickey] It's not opening.
They don't make them like this anymore.
You got to get it from the side.
I got it!
Oh, cool.
Change!
Shit!
Let's get out of here.
It's locked.
We got to go out the back.
Pedro, let's get out of here!
What am I, hallucinating here?
Pedro, you'll get us caught.
The cops are going to come.
Oh, you want to be tough, huh?
Go ahead...
take another sip so I can blow your fucking head off!
[Sirens In Distance]
Go ahead, Pedro!
Come on, guys!
Put that gun away!
Don't fuck with me, motherfucker!
What the hell are you doing?
What the hell did you do that for?
Let that little spic rot, man!
He'll get us caught.
Jim, the cops are coming.
Come on!
[Pedro] Jim!
Jim!
[Sirens Outside]
Pedro!
Pedro!
Jim!
Freeze!
Freeze!
On your stomach!
On your stomach!
I didn't do anything, I'm telling you!
[Sirens]
[indistinct Dialogue On Television]
This is it, man.
That Jew got to keep the money under his pillow.
Hey, Jim, I know you're still mad about Pedro.
I couldn't do nothing, man.
He was going to get us caught.
Shouldn't have went that far.
What happened?
Your mother kick your ass?
Yeah, real funny.
Bring us a couple of Cokes, will you?
You all right?
Hey, bartender, move out of the way.
Jim, i'm getting sick.
I got to get some money to cop.
Jim.
You with me here?
What the hell are you wa...
Oh, shit.
That's Neutron.
The all-American high-school game?
We could have played in that game.
Who gives a shit?
Come on.
I'm waiting to hear back on a scholarship from Saint John's.
Jim, I'm starting to jones.
We need some money.
Jim, don't dwell on these dreams, man.
Will you come on?
Meet you outside, man.
I'm getting sick.
You want to meet me out there?
Can I say hi to my mom?
Hi, Mom.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
# You don't know it, but you're coming right along #
# Please be strong #
# You don't know it, but you're coming right along ##
Hey, you!
Stop!
You can't go in there!
[Man] What do you want?
You realize what time it is?
Yeah.
Um... is Winkie and Blinkie here?
Who the hell are Winkie and Blinkie?
Hey, guys.
Lisa, Mel, you know this boy?
[Together] No, Daddy.
Come on.
All right.
Come on.
Get out of here.
I'm sorry, Mr. Rubin.
He got past me.
Don't let it happen again.
Get out!
What?
What?
Asshole.
Hey, fuck-up, get fucking up, man!
What's your problem, man?
You sold my girlfriend some shit the other day.
You almost killed her.
What was it... rat poison?
She can't handle her drugs.
I want my fucking $20 back.
There's no money-back guarantees.
I'm not selling refrigerators.
Oh, yeah?
I'll cut you a dynamite deal on mexican shit.
Give me my $20, or we'll go outside.
If we go outside, one of us is going to get hurt.
I told you one of us would get hurt.
Is that right?
It's been hard...
the writing...
lately.
Terrible numbness, then suddenly it comes...
[Gunshot] in beautiful fragments or terrible dreams... like nods... so high.
Uh!
Reggie, is that you?
Who the fuck do you think it is?
Ohh... don't worry.
You're not dead yet.
Ohh...
Uhh... it's not bad.
Hey, give me that.
How come it's all wet?
Because you pissed on it.
I didn't say you could read this.
What, have you been digging through my stuff?
I need...
I got to get out of here.
Where's my jacket?
You're welcome.
What the hell am I thanking you for?
Because you was frozen in the snow like a goddamn creamsicle.
Where is it?
What?
You know what the fuck I'm talking about!
Where is it?
You mean this?
Huh?
Give it to me.
I'll cut your fucking throat, Reggie!
Give it to me, all right?
Give it to me!
Give it to me!
Give it to me!
I'm serious!
Give me it!
Give it to me!
[Toilet Flushes]
Goddamn it!
I'll make you an incredible offer.
I'm going to save your life twice in one day.
You should have left me in the fucking snow, man.
Give me the money for my dope, too.
I won't suck your dick, all right?
Put that away.
Who the hell wants you to suck their dick?
Goddamn it!
Look at yourself!
Just look at yourself.
Come on, man.
It's O.K.
Oh, Reggie... it's O.K.
Why are you doing this?
Because once upon a time, somebody helped me, and I always pay what I owe.
[Labored Breathing]
Reggie.
Reggie, I just need a taste.
I just need a little something, Reggie.
[Pulls Telephone Off Table]
You don't understand.
It hurts, Reggie!
Ow!
Reggie, I got to go.
I got to go see my mom.
You got to let me get out of here, Reggie.
Reggie!
It hur...
It hurts.
Aah!
Shit!
Oh, boy...
# Touch the taste and taste the smell #
# Smell the scent, all the gifts you gave to me, baby #
# The food of your brain #
# The room is spinning round #
# I never come down #
[Bang]
# The room is spinning round #
# I never come down... #
Reggie.
you got to give me it.
You got to give me it, Reggie.
Please!
Oh!
Reggie, come on!
[Sobbing And Moaning]
# I remember you, too #
# I blew my mind ##
Wake up.
Can't sleep all day.
Oh.
Thanks.
Uhh.
[Sigh]
Jesus Christ.
What happened to you?
What does it look like?
Motherfucker shot me.
Woke my black ass up.
Shit.
Look, uh...
I'll be back in the morning, Jim.
You just stay cool.
You start to get panicky, write about me in that book of yours.
Actually, I was a little hurt I wasn't mentioned.
You really like my writing, huh, Reggie?
Damn, man, I told you four times already.
You want me to kiss your ass?
Hey, Reg, do me a favor.
While you're out, pick me up a bag.
# The room is spinning round #
# I may never come down #
I am alone.
Not just me.
We're alone... alone forever.
And who's at the end of that forever tunnel I run through, up Fifth with the wallpaper of skyscrapers?
I'm thinking, after all those beautiful trips, that this is one of those bad ones.
Diane.
Hey.
Jim.
Remember me?
Man, you look great.
Yeah, thanks.
Good to see somebody from the old neighborhood.
What do you want, Jim?
You holding anything?
No.
Just like a 5 or something?
Just to tide me over, you know?
Please, Diane?
Come on.
Yeah.
For an old friend?
Why not?
I've been looking all over for this.
Oh, you know what?
I only got a 20.
A 20 is good.
Yeah?
A 20 would help a lot.
You want a 20?
Yeah.
- Go buy some pretzels, asshole.
- [Clink]
You bitch!
You're nothing but a whore!
I don't give a shit about your clothes!
You're still a whore to me!
Yeah?
Shut up.
Look at you.
Oh, are you desperate now, baby?
Who's a whore now?
Don't talk to me like that, you bitch!
Ha ha.
Who's laughing, stupid?
Don't play a game with me!
I know you!
Ah!
Shit.
Oh, man.
Shit.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Mickey.
Mick, what's up, man?
Hey, what's up, man?
Did you get anything?
No, not a dime.
You score?
Yeah, I got something.
What'd you get?
About 35 bucks.
35?
Where'd you get it?
I robbed some fucking asshole on the "D" train.
35 will keep us on for, like, two days.
Well, could we get some stuff, man?
I'm fucking...
my head is...
I see some spics.
I think we can score.
Come on.
They're over here.
Why the fuck do we have to cop on the street all the time?
My fucking nuts are itching like crazy.
Think this is him?
Is your name Pino?
Listen... could we get us some dope?
The dude over there said you could help.
You want to cop some shit?
Let me see some cash.
I got it here.
Let me see.
Hey, no money without no taste.
You want a taste?
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Hurry, man.
Come on.
There's fucking cops all over.
That's good, man.
That's good.
All right, listen...
4 for 35.
4 for 35, man?
Come on, man.
$5.00 short.
What's the big deal?
[Speaking Spanish]
You got four?
Yeah.
We should taste this.
Where are we going to cook it up?
I don't know about his guy.
No, he's cool.
Fuck, man!
What's the matter?
Just taste it!
Come on.
What do you mean?
I tasted it.
He beat us.
He fucking beat us.
I swear to fucking God...
Put that away!
I'm gonna kill this mother!
Put it away!
Come here, motherfucker!
[Gunshots]
[Mickey Yelling]
I'm going to fucking kill you, you motherfucker!
Motherfucker, you're dead!
You hear me?
Where the fuck are you going?
Dude, don't make me do it.
Where's the money?
[Speaking Spanish]
I want the money and the bags.
Where's the fucking money?
The fucking money!
I want it!
Aah!
No!
[Glass Breaks]
We fucking killed him!
What the fuck do you mean, we?
I didn't fucking touch him!
Don't put that shit on me!
He beat us, man!
He deserved it!
You went too far, Mickey!
Oh, shit!
Is he dead?
Of course!
He fell six stories!
Jim, come on.
Come on!
Don't make me leave you here!
[Sirens In Distance]
Oh, shit.
# Star #
# I'll reach you if I try #
# Show me the truth, yeah #
# Star #
# Reach you if I try #
# Show me the truth, yeah ##
[Shouting]
Come on, get back up!
Come on!
What the fuck?
[Talking Incoherently]
Get off of me!
What are you doing?
[Banging On Door]
Who is it?
Ma...
let me in.
Ma, let me in!
[Banging]
[Loud Banging]
Please, Ma.
[Jim Trying Doorknob]
[Banging]
Ma?
Hey, Ma?
Are you in there, Ma?
Ma, is that you?
Yeah.
Ma?
Ma?
Are you there?
Yeah.
Hi.
[Snorting]
Hi, Ma.
Hi.
Hi.
Listen, I need you to help me out, all right?
I need you to give me some money.
O. K?
I need you to give me, like, five doll...
Like, $20, something like that because I'm in some trouble.
[Snorts And Spits]
Ma?
Do you hear me, Ma?
Yeah, I hear you.
I can't help you.
O.K., listen.
What you got to do is give me some money, O. K?
Jim, I can't do that.
Why not?
Mom, you know I'm not going to do anything with it.
I just need to go out of town for a little while 'cause I got into some trouble, and I need some help.
You got to give me some money, Mom.
Can you hold my hand?
Yeah, I'll hold your hand.
Mom, can you give me some money, please?
Mom, can you give me some money, please?
Stop fucking around!
I can't.
Mom, give me some fucking money,
Please!
What are you doing?
I'm your son!
I don't have any.
Mom, don't fuck around like this!
Give me some money!
Mom!
Come on!
Let me in the fucking door!
[Sobbing]
Oh, God.
Oh, fuck.
Let me in.
I need some money.
I need some money real bad.
Ohh...
Oh, God.
Someone's breaking into my apartment.
They have a knife.
Oh!
Mom!
You don't understand, Mom.
You don't know what you're fucking doing to me.
Mom, I'm in pain.
How could you do this to your son, you bitch?
You fucking bitch!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Oh, let me in!
I'll do anything!
I'll be a good boy!
I'll be a good boy, mom, if you let me in.
Get off me!
Get off!
No!
No!
You fuckers!
You're not going to do this!
Fuck you!
Ma!
Don't do this!
Ma!
Ma!
Oh...
Ma!
[Jail Cell Door Closes And Locks]
I got six months in Riker's Island for assault, robbery, resisting arrest, and possession of narcotics.
I sweated out a horrible cure and stayed clean the whole stretch even though it's been easier to get good junk in here than it is on the street.
Shit, it's been hard, man.
All I've been doing is reading these diaries and wondering how the hell I'm still alive, and even if I care.
Suffice to say that I'm finished with the asshole bandits of shower-room rape, and suffice to say that those swine guards won't draw blood from my ankles again.
Suffice to say that I've been just thinking about dumb stuff like what a nice concept it is to have a godmother and a godfather, wondering who my godparents might be.
My mom won't visit me here, so I guess I'll just have to wait till I get home to ask.
Jim.
Who's there?
It's me.
Pedro?
What's up, man?
Nothing.
You know.
I...
I hear you come here.
I just came by to say hi.
I'm sorry about that night at the candy store and everything.
It's all right.
Reform school turned out to be real cool, so don't sweat it.
Did you hear about Mickey, that scumbag?
He went and threw some chump off a roof.
He's getting 5 to 15 years, man.
They tried him like an adult.
Shit.
I got a present for you, Jim.
A bag of the finest dope in Manhattan.
You know, me and you?
Like old times?
I can't.
Come on.
It would be dynamite.
I got this thing to do.
Why don't you come check it out?
No.
I'm going to go, then, you know?
You know how it is.
Take care of yourself, little man.
See you around, Jim.
Know this.
There's different types of users of junk.
You got your rich dilettante square-ass who dabbles now and then and always has enough money to run off to the Riviera if he feels he's fucking around to the danger point.
Street junkies hate these pricks, but they're always suckers, and their money makes them tolerable.
Then you got your upper-middle-class
Westchester preppies... same as the others, basically.
What they're good for is opening their mommy and daddy's eyes to this social virus and putting pressure on the government to do something about it.
Then there's us street kids.
Start fucking around very young, 13 or so...
We think we all got it under control and won't get strung out.
This rarely works.
I'm living proof.
But in the end, you just got to see the junk as another 9-to-5 gig.
The hours are just a bit more inclined to shadows.
[Applause]
[Bell Tolls]
[Bell Tolls]
Go fuck yourself, you son of a bitch.
Bastard!
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done, you fuck!
Give us this day our daily bread, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Jesus, Jesus the Nazarene.
Jesus, the nazarene.
Go to hell.
Go to hell.
Go to hell.
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Jim, you're not going to waste the whole day lying around, are you?
Ma, I'm up.
The loony alarm went off.
Well, close the blinds.
Don't look at her and don't listen to her.
How could I not?
Jesus the Nazarene.
Mary the whore.
Mary the hairdresser.
Mary the hairdresser.
Our Father, Who art...
Hey, lady!
Shut up!
[Jim] When I was young, about 8 or so,
I tried making friends with God- by inviting him to my house to watch the World Series.
He never showed.
[Wham]
[Wham]
[Wham]
[Wham]
[Wham]
[Wham]
[Wham]
[Wham]
[Wham]
[Wham]
[Wham]
[Wham]
[Bell Rings]
Too bad, Father.
I was just starting to enjoy myself.
We can do it again tomorrow if you like, Mr. Carroll.
You okay, Jim?
Does it hurt?
You want to rub it for him, Pedro?
Jim, give it a rest.
You'll never beat him.
The guy's a pervert.
Did you hear him?
"We can do it again tomorrow if you like, Mr. Carroll. "
Let's cut out of here.
Come on.
# I was born in a pool #
# They made my mother stand #
# I spat on that surgeon #
# And his trembling hand #
# When I felt the light #
# I was worse than bored #
# I stole a doctor's scalpel #
# And I slit the cord #
# I was a Catholic boy #
# I was redeemed through pain #
# Not through joy #
# I was two months early #
# They put me under glass #
# I screamed and cursed their children #
# When the nurses passed #
# I was convicted of theft #
# As I slid from the womb #
# They led me straight from my mother #
# To a cell in the tombs #
# I was a Catholic boy #
# Redeemed through pain #
# Not through joy #
# They starved me for weeks #
# They thought they'd teach me fear #
# I fed on cellmates' dreams #
# It gave me fine ideas #
# When they cut me loose #
# The time had served me well #
# I'd made allies in heaven #
# Comrades in hell #
# I was a Catholic child #
# The blood ran red #
# The blood ran wild ##
Why, you little prick!
This is my new...
Shit, guys, gotta get outta here.
I threw up on somebody.
I'll get ya!
You little prick!
I'll fucking throw you in the fucking river if i catch ya-
[Boat Horn Blows]
Hey!
What about the four of us versus Wilt Chamberlain?
He was the greatest of all time.
Four of us?
What are you gonna do, Pedro?
tie his shoes together when he ain't looking?
All right...
How'bout the three versus Wilt Chamberlain?
No problem.
You're kidding, right, Mickey?
No.
He can't cover all of us at the same time.
You guys don't miss open jumpers.
And you know who will be there for the rebounds.
Rebounds?
That freak is, like, 7 feet tall.
Jim, I can rebound with anybody.
You're sniffing too much of that shit, that's what you're doing.
Chamberlain would destroy all of us.
End of story.
Alright.
All we got to do is move the ball around.
There's no way we don't win.
Will you tell this kid?
Hey, Mickey, I think you could beat him yourself.
I don't think you need us.
Perfect example... confidence.
I know I could beat him.
Holy shit!
Look at this place.
I tell you what, if our school was this nice,
I'd go more than once a week.
You?
We got a game today, gentlemen.
Who's ready to play some roundball?
I said, who's ready to play some ball?
You give me that laid-back,
"I'm doing my own thing, Jack" attitude out there today, and you're going to find yourself watching the game from the bench.
No smoking, Iggy...
stunts your growth.
You want to be big and strong like me, don't you?
Out.
No smoking, and no pulling your peckers before a game.
Swifty, do you mind?
I'm taking a dump.
Get outta here!
Something die in there?
When we play our game...
- so Pedro vomits on his head, right?
It goes all over his hair, trickles down his neck.
Some gets in his eye.
He went nuts-
Don't lie about it, either.
What are you doing?
We're signing a ball for Bobby.
Can I sign?
Yeah.
"We're holding your spot for you, kid.
Swifty. "
All right.
This one's for Bobby.
All right.
Who's better than we are?
Nobody!
Alright!
Go ahead.
Do some warm-ups.
Pedro, you're in charge.
You're my eyes and ears.
- Hey, Jim?
- Yeah?
That's a nice thing you're doing for Bobby.
Oh, thanks.
Thanks.
You seen Neutron?
I think he's talking to a scout from Saint John's, as a matter of fact, upstairs.
You want to play college ball, don't you?
Yeah.
Someday, I hope.
You know.
Yeah.
Scouts are sniffing you out already.
They like them young.
I'll tell you what.
You come by sometime, and we'll go over the schools together.
Yeah.
All right.
Yeah.
We'll get a pizza, and we'll make a night of it.
Um... actually, my nights are kind of busy right now.
Yeah.
Homework and all, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[Cheering]
We were the hottest Catholic high school team in New York City, on our way to the championship.
We felt like nothing could stop us.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yes!
We're on our way.
We're on our way.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Hands up.
Show me some defense.
Show me some defense.
Good steal.
Put it in.
Put it in.
Yeah!
[Cheering]
All right.
All right.
Way to go.
Aw, geez.
All right, Neutron.
Yes!
Yes!
To the hole, Jim.
[Whistle Blows]
Whoa!
Whoa!
What's going on?
Break it up!
Come on.
Hit him!
Beat that motherfucker!
[Whistle Blows]
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- He fucking held me!
This dude blows the whistle...
Slow it down!
Slow it down!
[Whistle]
[Cheering]
You got to have presence on the court... presence like a cheetah rather than a chimp.
They both got it, but chimpy got to jump his nuts around all day to get it.
Shy cheetah just moves in total nonchalance a sec or two in his sexy, slow strut.
Me, I play like a cheetah.
[Cheering]
Let's go, Rangers- let's go!
Let's go, Rangers, let's go!
[Cheering]
Yeah!
Ooh!
You got it!
It's ours.
It's ours.
Oh!
Yeah!
[Crowd] 9, 8, 7,
6, 5,
4, 3,
2, 1!
Yay, Jim!
Oh, shit.
That's my team!
That's my team!
[Crowd Cheering]
There's only two things Swifty forbids... using the word "motherfucker"
and stealing from the other team, as long as they're white.
How much for that group of winners over there?
It's $34.90.
$34.90?
Changed the prices or something?
No.
Uh...
I'm a little short.
Do me a favor.
Here.
Take my watch, and I'll come back later with the rest of the money.
No.
What do you mean, no?
I'm sorry, sir.
Those burgers are worth more than the watch is.
I'll be right back.
I told you one burger each, didn't I?
It takes at least eight of these to get filled up.
Yeah.
C'mon, Swifty.
We're growing boys.
Growing boys?
We're hungry motherfuckers.
Funny, huh?
I'm not driving you guys home.
How's that for laughs?
[Knock On Window]
You ripped them off, didn't you?
We're even now.
Swifty, come on.
How are we going to get home?
Face the music, pricks.
What are we going to do?
They got the door blocked off.
You afraid of these pussies?
I ain't afraid of anybody.
What's the problem?
I'm going to ask you this once.
All right?
Where's the stuff you stole from me?
What are you talking about?
No, no, no.
You're not going to fuck with me, all right?
Now, somebody stole my father's ring from my locker, motherfucker.
You want me to cut you?
Is that what you want, there?
There's no problem here.
Hey, guys!
Let's get out of here, c'mon!
You need a fucking army, huh?
Come on!
Come on!
Oh.
Nice.
That from Bobo?
Ha ha ha!
That's his father's ring.
Hey, fellas.
Any of you looking for a date?
Yeah.
Me, sweetheart.
Little horsy ride in Central Park, maybe candlelight dinner?
Why don't we skip right to dessert, huh, baby?
About $15?
Fifteen bucks?
I'll give you a quarter.
Let Pedro suck your tits.
You don't have to be rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
How about you, handsome, huh?
You got $15... for a little head?
Diane, do I look like I need to pay for it?
Yeah... you do.
If it's worth it.
Jimmy...
Jimmy, I know you want some, honey.
$15.
I'll do you so good you'll never forget it, baby.
Hey, hey!
Ooh!
That's a deal.
Bargain from there.
What do you say, guys?
You want to do it?
All four of us?
- Yeah.
- It's a deal.
All four of us.
Aw, shit.
This is all I got, Diane.
Here, have a pretzel.
- Get out of here.
- Beat it.
Yeah, fuck you!
Fucking dopehead.
You see what that shit does to you?
Wow.
Speaking of dopeheads, is that Pedro's mother over there slinging her wares again?
It is!
Hey, Peepee, where you going?
Why do you have to be such an asshole all the time, huh?
Why is the little shoe crying anyway?
His mother's a sneaker.
His father's a loafer.
Somebody's got to be a heel.
Jim, where you going?
Hey, Jim!
Jim.
Hey.
Hey, man.
What's up?
You don't recognize me with my new hairdo?
It's nice.
It's nice.
I like it.
What's going on?
- How are you?
- Good.
Wow.
Look at that.
You like it?
Yeah, I'll tell you what.
When you get out of here, we'll all shave our heads and look like a gang of skinheads.
It's a deal.
All right.
I got something for you here.
Yeah.
Everyone on the team.
Look right here...
even Swifty signed it.
Thanks, man.
You remember when I dunked on that spade in Riverside Park?
You always had good ups.
Yeah.
Oh.
I got something to show you.
Hold on.
What?
Pedro got these out of some lady's purse.
- She's doing it with a donkey.
- Oh, Jesus!
Look at that schlong.
Look at that one.
Oh, I beat your record.
How many times you choke it?
Seven times.
Bullshit.
Seven times.
My mom thinks I have a cold year-round because of all the tissues around the house.
You can keep those if you want.
They're pumping so much junk in me,
I can't even get a decent chubby.
I got an idea.
Come on.
Let's go.
Where we going?
I'm getting you out of this place, man.
C'mon!
What are you, crazy, man?
I can't go anywhere.
Here you go.
I've known Bobby since I was 3.
He's my best friend.
He was the best player on our basketball team.
Two years ago, he got leukemia.
He keeps fighting it off.
I know Bobby's going to beat it.
He could beat anything.
Watch!
Jim, you're going to kill me, man.
If you let go, I swear...
I swear I'll kill you, man.
Watch the bump!
What the hell happened to forty deuce?
Last time I was here, that theater was playing Sperminator II.
Oh, yeah.
I remember that.
No, man.
This whole block has been done over by all these new artists.
It's pretty cool, huh?
Yeah.
They should put your stuff up there.
Yeah.
Right.
Still scribbling stuff in that notebook of yours, ain't you?
Of course.
You bring anything for me?
What, like to read?
No, like to eat.
What do you think?
Yeah.
I mean, I got this, but it's not a big deal.
I don't even remember writing it, to tell you the truth.
Yeah, Yeah.
I'll be the judge of this.
"Little kids shoot marbles
"where branches break the sun
"into graceful shafts of light.
I just want to be pure.
All right.
# What a life #
Nothing like the real thing to float your boat, huh, Bobby?
# What a life #
# Didn't know where, didn't know when... #
That's nice.
# Said that I'll go...
go learn #
# Put up my hand, wait my turn #
# But it never comes, I have to shout out #
# That's life #
# And that's what it's all about #
# So through the comfort and the strife #
# What a life... #
Get me out of here, Jim.
What are you talking about, man?
This was a stupid idea.
I don't feel so good.
Well, can we wait till the end of the show?
Did you hear what I said?
I said get me the hell out of here!
Hey, Bob, man...
I'm really sorry, you know?
Next time, we'll go somewhere...
Ain't gonna be no next time, Jim.
I love it this way... my feet against the tar, which is soft from the spring heat, the slight breeze that runs across your entire body, especially your crotch.
You feel an incredible power being naked under a dome of stars while a giant city is dressed, dodging cars all around you five flights down.
I don't think of anything while I'm doing the actual tugging, least of all the heavy sex fantasies I have to resort to indoors.
Just my own naked self and the stars breathing down, and it's beautiful.
Time sure flies when you're young and jerking off.
[Woman Reads With Difficulty] "Camp summer position.
Driver... taxi. "
Hey, that might be good.
You could get your license this summer.
Oh, yeah, Mom.
That sounds really great.
Hey, get your own job, and if you don't get it this summer, you're coming to work with me at the hotel.
Mom, please.
Why are you so worried about this?
Do I even ask you for money?
No.
I'm not worried about the money.
I want you to have responsibility.
I don't want you running around the streets of New York.
Idle time is the devil's plaything, Jim.
The devil's plaything, huh?
Mm-hmm.
That might be a cool title for my first book.
Thanks!
What are you talking about?
What are you writing?
Here.
Ooh.
Um...
Ma, I'm not really that hungry this morning, alright?
- Come on.
You got to eat something.
- I know...
Where you going?
I'm going to shoot some hoops.
Sometimes I feel like something's chasing me, like there's some whacko on a roof somewhere who could snuff me out at any moment.
And I feel this horrible fear.
Will I have time to finish- the poems breaking loose in my head?
Hey, white boy, you ready for your beating?
Don't let your mouth get you into something your ass can't handle.
I'll shoot you for it.
So it's going to be like that, huh?
I... don't think so.
Yeah!
All right, so you made one.
Big deal.
You made one shot.
Make another.
# The days are muzzled in a vibe #

# Take me where they left the light on #
# Getting close, almost there #
# If that fuzzy silver badge #
# Don't greet us there #
# My head's dizzy, and I'm taking... ##
Yo, Jim!
What's the score?
Come on.
We got to go.
They don't keep score in this game.
Jim, come on.
We're losing the sun.
He's being a dick.
You want me to put a charge in his ass?
Whatch this.
Oh, look it, right here...
Jim's secret diary he's always writing in.
Bet you he wrote some shit about me.
Oh, right here.
"Spring...
Mickey. "
Hey, there I am, Jim says.
"Mickey takes out a bottle of carbonic cleaning fluid and suggests we do a little sniffing to get high. "
Whoo!
"After four deep whiffs, we're sailing someplace else. "
Mickey, what are you doing?
"Bells ringing through my ears, little lights flashing through my eyes. "
Mickey, put that down, all right?
"I pictured myself
"paddling across a river with black water,
"only the canoe was going backwards instead of forwards,
"with clouds that had faces.
Laughing, spooky, fun-house laughs... "
- Give it back, alright?
- What is that shit?
Why do you have to be such a schmuck, Mickey?
What are you talking about?
Don't you ever touch that again.
It's private.
What's your problem?
I'm...
I'm sorry.
He's writing about me, I can't read about it?
Jesus!
Hey, Jim, come on.
We're gone.
Yo, we got a cab!
Hey, cabby!
Hey, swami!
So, Shakespeare, you going to finish the game?
C'mon, Reggie, you know this game never ends.
See you later, all right?
Every crowd has its little games to prove if you're a punk or not.
My cousin in Jersey plays chickie, which is two cars heading towards each other at about 80 miles per hour.
First driver to swerve out of the way is, of course, chicken.
In Brooklyn, they make you press a lit cigarette into your arm and have it burn all the way down to the filter without the slightest flinch.
Us, Manhattan boys, we jump off cliffs into the Harlem River, which is literally shitty, because half a million toilets flush into it every day.
Whoo-oo!
[Whistles]
Yeah!
Oooh!
Yeah!
Hey, y'all, I carried the clothes up, but I ain't carrying them down.
Peepee, this is you... all 33 pounds of you, gone with the wind.
Wow.
That's a long way down.
Devil's toe is no big deal.
We've all done it a million times.
I never done it.
You never did it?
Pedro, you never do nothing.
You know who was awesome on this rock?
Bobby.
That kids would do back flips off this rock.
Hey, Mickey.
What?
Don't talk about him like he's dead.
He's not dead.
There goes the circle line.
Check it out.
[Horn Blows]
Whoo!
Full moon!
Whoo!
Hey, yo!
Whoo!
Hey, circle this!
[Whistle]
Hey, I'm going.
Watch out, watch out...
I'm going to show you how to do it.
Ye-ea-ah!
That was a good jump.
Oh, he's nuts.
Hey, I'm going to walk down.
What you talking about?
You can't walk down.
There's no way to walk down.
I ain't jumping.
Pedro, your clothes are down there.
How you gonna get your clothes?
You going to walk around naked all day?
Pedro, if you don't jump, Mickey's going to tease you so bad-
You might as well just jump and get it over with.
Feel better.
What the hell, right?
Oh... shit...
Pedro!
Bad form.
Bad form.
Oh...
My God!
Oh, shit.
Is he all right?
Pedro, you all right?
You ready?
Yeah.
Listen, don't tell the other guys, but when we leave here, I got a surprise for you.
Tell me what it is.
It's a surprise.
Trust me, all right?
Ouch, don't mess around, man...
Alright, you ready?
Come on!
You ready?
- Let's jump.
- On three.
Ready?
Uh-huh.
1, 2,
3.
Come on.
Let's go.
What's up, Manny?
How you doing?
Fine.
Thank you, sir.
This is my friend Jim.
How you doing?
I can't believe I hit my head on that rock.
It's killing me.
Jim, um, this is Winkie.
- Hi.
- How you doing?
Good.
And this... this is Blinkie.
- Hi.
- Hi.
# I lost my heart #
# Under the bridge #

I've seen you play ball, Jim.
You're a very beautiful player.
Very zen.
# And now I moan #
# And now I holler #
# She'll never know #
# Just what I found #
# That blue-eyed girl #
It'll make you fuck like Superman.
# She said no more #

Able to, um...
I can't think of anything with a single bound.
# See her again #
# See her again... #
Do you have any protection?
Yeah.
This one's, uh, ribbed for extra pleasure.
So what are you waiting for?
What do you mean?
Take off your clothes.
Well, uh... could we shut off the lights first?

White ship disappears in the wave machine this morning.
Your eyes got shut with secret chains that pillow armies eventually set free... like soft horses through toy deserts.
I love this mansion, though it's too many windows... to open halfway each morning... to close halfway each night.
I looked at his body, and it was death for the first time.
His face was thin and wrinkled, almost apelike.
His hair, just gray patches on his scalp.
He looked 60 years old, and he was 16.
Couldn't believe how skinny he was... much skinnier than he was in the hospital.
It was like having the skeleton of someone you knew put right in front of you.
I felt dazed, like I'd just come out of a four-hour movie I didn't understand.
I kept thinking about his face... and death... what a cheat the whole thing was.
Hey, you guys remember that Halloween when Bobby filled that paper bag with dog shit, lit it on fire and put it outside Father Dunne's door, and we all hid behind the dumpster?
Yeah.
I could picture Father Dunne comming outside, stepping on that shit.
Picture him in the john- scraping the shit off his shoe like this.
You think that'll keep him out of heaven?
Are you kidding?
Jesus Christ himself would have laughed at that.
It was hilarious!
What about the time at the formal when Bobby got caught in the bathroom with Mary Ann Dugan and McNulty came in and busted him?
He was, like, "Father, I swear.
We weren't doing anything. "
Meanwhile she's got a giant wad of cum hanging off her face.
I tell you, that kid was definitely a pisser.
It was weird seeing him today, man.
He was all shriveled up and wrinkled.
He looked like my grandfather.
I'll tell you what, though.
That kid was in so much pain, it's better off he died.
How the hell would you know, Mickey?
Did you go and visit him?
Huh?
Any of you guys go and visit him?
All right.
Then shut the fuck up.
Hey, Jim.
Look at my brother's girlfriend in the park.
She's sitting there, eating a sandwich.
Next thing you know, she's shot in the head.
She's dead.
It's over.
What about little Teddy Rayhill?
Perfect example.
Remember that night he was up on the roof, and he was doing poppers, having a great time, laughing his ass off
He started walking backwards...
Boom!
He fell right off the goddamn roof.
It was meant to be, right?
Fuck that, you guys!
Bobby was the best fucking guy around, you know that?
What are you, a bunch of idiots?
You don't even understand, do you?
Jim, you all right?
Huh?
Listen, maybe you should talk to one of the priests.
I don't know.
Maybe...
Maybe they can help you out.
Help me out?
I wouldn't ask one of those cocksuckers for directions.
You know what?
You guys need to lighten the fuck up, all right?
Let bygones be fucking bygones.
Shitty fucking world.
Live life to the fucking fullest.
You know what I mean?
Shit happens, man.
Shit fucking happens.
[Thunder]
Come on.
Let's go.
Jim, come on.
You're growing up, and rain sort of remains on the branches of a tree that will someday rule the earth.
And that's good that there's rain.
Clears the month of your sorry rainbow expressions.
And it clears the streets of the silent armies so we can dance.

Did I ever tell you about the first time I did heroin?
I went down to Pedro's basement.
All sorts of characters were in the storage-room shooting gallery.
I was just going to sniff a bag, but a guy says,
"If you're going to sniff, might as well pop it, and if you're going to pop it, might as well mainline. "
I was scared of needles, but I gave in.
It was like a long heat wave through my body.
Any ache or pain or sadness or guilty feeling was completely flushed out.
Look, Ma, I'm not in the mood for your dime-store psychology, all right?
Could you just please leave me alone?
I got a little sick, all right?
We're not going to live like this, Jim.
We're not going to live like this.
I'm warning you!
I'm telling you.
Oh, God, Mom.
You're always warning me, aren't you?
Blah, blah, blah.
You're always in my fucking ear.
Blah, blah, blah.
You don't know anything.
What are you talking about?
Go clean toilets or whatever the hell it is you do.
When you're done, clean this one.
Don't talk like that!
What's the matter with you?
Gee whiz, Ma, you know... we got to have these heart-to-heart talks more often.
They're really good for us.
I don't know you.
I don't believe this is you, Jim.
Please, Jim.
I don't know who you are.
Yeah, I know.
I was such a good little boy, right... with such potential, wasn't that it?
Is that what you're going to say?
Oh, Jim.
What's happening?
Jim, what's happening?
First, it's a Saturday-night thing, and you feel cool, like a gangster or a rock star.
It's just something to kill the boredom, you know?
They call it a chippie, a small habit.
It feels so good, you start doing it on Tuesdays, then Thursdays.
Then it's got you.
Every wise-ass punk on the block says it won't happen to them, but it does.
Go do it!
I ain't doing it.
I always do it!
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could you tell me the fastest way to the subway?
Yeah.
That's the "B" train.
Go to this corner and make a left.
It's right there.
What are you doing?
Let go!
Let go!
Let go of that!
Oh, my God!
What?
Oh!
- Help!
No!
No!
- What are you doing?
Let's go!
Come on!
I don't feel like going in today.
Father, is it all right if I don't go in today?
Why?
What are you scared of?
Nothing.
I just don't feel like it, that's all.
I imagine you have more to confess than anybody here.
Unburden yourself.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been about four months since my last confession.
Yes, my son?
Well, I don't know where to start, Father.
Have you taken the name of Jesus Christ in vain?
Yeah.
Yeah, I have.
Have you disrespected your mother and father?
Uh-huh.
Have you stolen or cheated your fellow man?
Yeah, but I'm not proud of it.
Have you had impure thoughts or engaged in impure deeds?
Oh, Father, you have no idea.
Is there something else that you want to tell me in your own words?
I've done all kinds of crazy shit.
Oh, excuse me, Father.
Fuck, I'm s...
Christ, I have a dirty mouth.
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry about that.
Will you just go on?
10 Hail Marys, five Our Fathers.
What do you mean?
And that's it?
That's my punishment?
You know something?
My friend Bobby, he was the best, and he's dead.
This sucks!
You know that?
This really sucks.
It's not fair, Father.
Your nose is running, your stomach cramps, your legs feel like they've played six straight games on top of each other, and the voice is always there in the back of your head...
"Just one more time.
then we'll stop. "
Quick to the ball.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Good, Ignatius.
Good.
Good.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Right behind you.
Sir, all right if I use the bathroom, Coach?
Jim, you got a bladder like a woman.
Let's go.
Again.
There we go.
Right behind him.
Right behind him.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Two hands.
Jim?
I thought you were taking a piss.
Oh.
What are you doing in here every practice?
Have you been waiting for me, Jim?
Giving me some kind of a signal?
What are you talking about, Swifty?
Don't act surprised.
Do we understand each other?
It's not going to happen, Swifty.
Put the money away.
You want more?
Here.
Just let me do it.
Get the fuck out of my face!
Take it easy, Jim.
You can't blame me for trying.
I made a mistake, all right?
Let's just pretend it never happened.
Things will go back to exactly how they were before.
Okay?
Okay?
Here, keep the money.
Keep the money.
Just don't tell anybody, all right?
Good.
Tell anybody you want!
Nobody's going to believe a drughead like you, anyway.
You think we don't know what you've been doing?
Give me the fucking money and get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck- Get the fuck out here!
Come on!
Get out of here!
And you want to stop.
You really do.
But it's like a dream.
You can't stop dreams.
They move in crazy pieces, any way they want to, and suddenly, you're capable of anything.
Ha ha ha!
No!
Wake up, Mr. Carroll!
It's later than you think.
Oh.
All right!
- I need a lift.
- All right.
What do you got?
Three different pills.
Which are the ups?
I never asked.
I thought one of youse would know.
Oh, great.
We look like pharmacists?
I don't know what to take.
What do we take?
Let me see.
The blacks and the reds are the ups.
I think the pink ones are the ups.
Why?
'Cuz I associate pink with lightness, you know?
The black ones seem like they'd knock you on your ass.
They might be faded seconals.
No, they're not faded.
They'd be sticky.
They're not.
That's bullshit.
- Fuck your mother.
- My what?
All right!
Calm down.
Don't ever talk about my mother.
Don't ever hit me like that again.
Come on!
Alright!
Give me your hat.
We got a game to play, alright?
Just give me something.
Hi, Neutron.
Let me ask him.
Neutron, you know which ones are the ups?
I think you should put that shit away before Swifty comes in here.
Why you acting like such a square ass?
Screw you, Mickey.
Screw you, too, Tough guy.
Man.
I'm just going to take the black.
You sure?
Mm-hmm.
You got a better idea?
Nope.
Your guess is as good as mine, Jimbo.
It's on today.
50 rebounds.
Good.
Come on.
Let's go.
I'm your friend now, right?
What, I got to smack you again, c'mon!
Yeah, take your little rat with you.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, what's up?
Why are you acting like that?
You know what's wrong.
Used to be about getting high and playing basketball.
Now it's just about getting high with you.
You're blowing it, Jim.
Oh, come on.
I don't need to hear this from you, Neutron.
Yeah, you do, Jim!
Listen, no, Jim!
I'm really proud of you, man.
Everything's cool.
You look great.
I'll see you in the NBA.

Did you find it?
No, Father.
It's clean.
There's no drugs in there.
Thank you, Officer.
I told you we didn't have nothing.
You boys think you're awfully smart, don't you?
Well, you're both suspended for a week!
Ooh...
And you'll never play basketball here again.
That you can count on.
You can't kick me off the team, Swifty.
Oh?
Why is that?
'Cause I quit the team... and the school and this whole faggot-ass scene, that's why.
I could second that motion.
Your resignations are accepted!
Neutron, you coming with us?
Huh?
Yeah.
That's what I figured.
Come on, man.
I'm fucking out of here.
Don't worry, Swifty.
I'm not going to rat you out.
And in the next life, Father,
I'm going to have the paddle!
Get out!
Thanks a lot, Neutron.
Thanks, man.
I can't believe this, you know?
I know.
What happened to the pills?
We got kicked out of the school, Mickey.
Who cares, man?
We lost the pills.
The cops took them-
We can't play ball anymore.
Jim, who cares about school, man?
We just lost $40 worth of pharmaceuticals.
I know what happened to them, too.
The cops, they take that all the time.
They either pop them themselves or they sell them.
What's my mom going to say, man?
When I go home?
She ain't gonna say nothing.
You just tell her you're going to school every day in the morning.
Let's get out of here, man...
Go get into something.
You never sold any pills at the schoolyard?
No.
So it's all a big conspiracy against you.
Right, Jim?
Yeah.
Maybe it is.
Maybe it's not.
You been missing these?
What are you going to tell me...
they're vitamins?
Oh, fuck you, Ma.
What?
!
Get out of my house!
Oh, is that what you want, Ma?
Get out!
You don't talk to me that way!
If that's what you want, I'm fucking out of here.
All right?
What are you doing?
I'm leaving!
What do you think?
I wan you to take all your shit!
I'll help you.
Here!
You want me to leave?
Yes.
Get out!
I'm out of here.
Get the fuck out of my way!
This garbage is going to kill you, Jim!
I'm gone!
Gonna to kill you!
Don't you understand?
I can't watch you kill yourself?
Ma, you're never going to fucking see me again, alright?
Just remember that.
Don't say that, Jim.
Don't say that!
It was a dream, not a nightmare... a beautiful dream I could never imagine in a thousand nods.
I saw this girl next to me who wasn't beautiful until she smiled,
and I felt that smile come at me and heat waves following, soaking through my body and out my fingertips in shafts of color.
And I knew somewhere in the world... somewhere...
that there was love for me.
We just got to raise enough cash to keep our heads straight.
Luckily, finding money in New York is like getting laid at the prom... easy.
- Fuck it, Pedro!
- What's the matter with you?
Jesus!
Watch the road.
You could kill us all, c'mon!
I get 1,500 bucks for this car.
If it's whacked up, it's worth nothing.
We should buy shit in bulk, man
We'll put it on the street and make real money.
That's 500 bucks a piece.
We'll be on for days, nights, weeks.
Yeah, man.
I'd love to go to Puerto Rico, soak up some rays, you know?
See my bitch?
That's what I'd like to do.
- What are you talking about?
- What bitch?
We haven't seen a picture or nothing.
She's 500 pounds, Jim.
She got a mustache thicker than her father.
No.
That's your mother, Mickey.
She does not exist.
Don't fool yourself.
Be careful.
I'm about to whack.
Oh, shit, man.
My brother's going to take care of us and this car.
Pedro, wake the fuck up!
Pedro, come on, man!
You're going to get us killed, what are you doing?
I got it, man.
You want me to drive?
Mickey, you better drive the car.
I'm serious, man.
Just don't blow my high.
If there's a scratch in the car, my brother'll kill me.
Yo, get out of the booth!
Get out the booth, huh?
Get out.
Fucking...
What's up?
What's up?
Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Where's the car?
It's good to see you, too.
It's over here.
It's nice.
It's smokin'.
You tell me that?
It's everything you wanted.
Get your hands off.
You guys look like shit.
Oh, my God.
They're taking the car.
Show me the sign, man!
Show me the freaking sign!
It's right there.
You see?
It says "tow-away. " Huh?
You scumbags even read?
I should kick all your punk asses!
Goddamn it!
I can get you another car tonight.
Yeah?
John Halligan is waiting for this car.
I got him out of bed with his wife.
You know how this makes me fucking look?
Kenny, get off.
You're too stupid to be my brother!
You're too stupid!
You want a piece of me, Carroll?
Back off!
Back off!
- Kenny, no more!
- Mr. Tough Guy.
- Kenny, no more!
- Huh?
Tough guy?
Give me a sip of your soda.
You wipe off the bottle before you take a sip?
You don't even think twice about sharing works with Mickey.
You think you'll catch something from the bottle you're not catch from a needle?
You mistake me for somebody who gives a shit.
Headquarters...
home on and off to every down-and-out junkie and wino from 14th Street to the Bowery.
It's like a fucking all-star team.
Jimmy, the other day, my mother's been ragging on me,
"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
"You've tried every other way.
Go to church.
Put yourself in Christ's hands. "
So I do it, man.
I figure, give it a shot.
I dig Jesus.
So, I go, man.
High mass...
a choir and everything.
The first thing I see on the right, the side altar, are those little candles in the red glass that we used when it was windy in the park to cook up.
And then, this altar boy, he's coming down the aisle with this 6-foot candle.
I envision this huge spoon above it, man, with, like, shopping bags full of dope inside of it.
And then the kicker comes, man.
The priest, he starts doing the thing with the incense.
You know, starts wafting out.
I'm in the back.
It finally hits me.
"Where do I know this smell from, man?
My room, man. "
It's the smell exactly of really primo dope cooking up.
Yeah?
Exactly the same.
So what happened next?
At that point, I split.
I went home,
I went inside my closet,
I got my stash out of the inside pocket of my sharkskin easter suit, and I got stoned.
Ba bing... ba bang.
I love a ritual.
Oh, Mary, if you can hear me...
I need you to fill Jim's heart with love because he really needs it now.
Oh, God... please watch over my son.
He needs you now.
Just take care of him, okay?
I'll be okay.
I love you, Jim.
I love you.
Hey, you holding?
You straight, man?
Get out of here.
Come on.
No.
Hey, have you seen Falco?
Come on, man.
Are you holding anything?
Hey, Diane...
Come here, Diane.
- I'll take care of you, babe.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
How about some of this?
Ha ha!
I wouldn't do you for a bag, you fucking piece of shit.
Jim.
Jimmy.
You're looking good.
Who's your embalmer?
I want some of what you got.
Shh.
Check everything in this place.
Wow.
I always wanted to use these syrup pumps.
And these professional ice-cream scoopers.
Oh, my God.
Don't make me do it!
I'll do it!
I swear to God!
Jim, watch out.
Come on!
It's not opening.
They don't make them like this anymore.
You got to get it from the side.
I got it!
Oh, cool.
Change!
Shit!
Let's get out of here.
It's locked.
We got to go out the back.
Pedro, let's get out of here!
What am I, hallucinating here?
Pedro, you'll get us caught.
The cops are going to come.
Oh, you want to be tough, huh?
Go ahead... take another sip so I can blow your fucking head all over the counter!
Go ahead, Pedro!
Go ahead!
Come on, guys!
Let's go.
Put that gun away!
Don't fuck with me, motherfucker!
What the hell are you doing, Mickey?
What the hell did you do that for?
Let that little spic rot, man!
He'll get us caught.
Jim, the cops are coming.
Come on!
Jim!
Jim!
Pedro!
Pedro!
Jim!
Freeze!
Freeze!
On your stomach!
On your stomach!
I didn't do anything, I'm telling you!
This is it, man.
That Jew got to keep the money under his pillow.
Hey, Jim, I know you're still mad about Pedro.
I couldn't do nothing, man.
He was going to get us caught.
Definitely shouldn't have went that far.
What happened to you?
Your mother kick your ass?
Yeah, real funny.
Bring us a couple of Cokes, will you?
You all right?
Hey, bartender, move out of the way.
Jim, I'm getting sick.
I got to get some money to cop.
Jim.
You with me here?
What the hell are you wa...
Oh, shit.
That's Neutron.
That's the all-American high school game?
We could have played in that game.
Who gives a shit?
Come on.
I'm waiting to hear back on a scholarship from Saint John's...
I'm not sure about it, but hopefully it will work out.
Jim, I'm starting to jones.
Gotta get out there.
We need some money.
Jim, don't dwell on these dreams, man.
Will you come on?
Meet you outside, man.
I'm getting sick.
You want to meet me out there?
Is it okay if I say hi to my mom?
Hi, Mom.
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.
# You don't know it, but you're coming right along #
# Please be strong #
# You don't know it, but you're coming right along ##
Hey, you!
Stop!
You can't go in there!
Stop!
What do you want?
You realize what time it is?
Yeah.
Um... is Winkie and Blinkie here?
Who the hell are Winkie and Blinkie?
Hey, guys.
Lisa, Mel, you know this boy?
No, Daddy.
Come on.
All right.
Come on.
Get out of here.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Rubin.
He got past me.
- Don't let it happen again.
It won't happen again.
Get out of here!
What?
What?
Asshole.
Hey, fuck-up, get fucking up, man!
- What's your problem, man?
- What's YOUR problem, mam?
You sold my girlfriend some shit the other day.
You almost killed her.
What was it... rat poison?
It's not my fault your girl can't handle her drugs.
I want my fucking $20 back, man.
Look, there's no money-back guarantees.
I'm not selling refrigerators here.
Oh, yeah?
I'll cut you a dynamite deal on mexican shit.
Give me my $20, or we'll go outside.
If we go outside, one of us is going to get hurt.
I told you one of us would get hurt.
Is that right?
It's been hard...
the writing...
lately.
Terrible numbness, then suddenly it comes... in beautiful fragments or terrible dreams... like nods... so high.
Uh!
Reggie, is that you?
Who the fuck do you think it is?
Ohh...
Don't worry, you're not dead yet.
It's not bad.
Hey, give me that.
How come it's all wet?
Because you pissed on it.
I didn't say you could read this.
What, have you been digging through all my stuff?
I need...
I got to get out of here.
Where's my jacket?
You're welcome.
What the hell am I thanking you for?
Because you was frozen in the snow like a goddamn creamsicle.
Where is it?
What?
You know what the fuck I'm talking about, Reggie!
Where is it?
You mean this?
Huh?
Give it to me.
I'll cut your fucking throat, Reggie!
Give it to me, all right?
Just give it to me!
Oh, give it to me!
Give it to me!
I'm serious!
Give me it!
Give it to me!
Goddamn it!
I'll make you an incredible offer.
I'm going to save your life twice in one day, understand me?
You should have left me in the fucking snow, man.
Give me the money for my dope, too.
I'm not gonna suck your dick, all right?
Put that away.
Who the hell wants you to suck their dick?
Goddamn it!
Look at yourself!
Just look at yourself.
Oh, Reggie... it's okay.
Why are you doing this?
Because once upon a time, somebody helped me, and I always pay what I owe.
Reggie.
Reggie, I just need a taste.
I just need a little something, Reggie.
You don't understand.
It hurts, Reggie!
Ow!
Reggie, I got to go.
I got to go see my mom.
You got to let me get out of here, Reggie.
Reggie!
It hur...
It hurts.
Aah!
Shit!
Oh, boy...
# Touch the taste and taste the smell #
# Smell the scent, all the gifts you gave to me, baby #
# The food of your brain #
# The room is spinning round #
# I never come down #
# The room is spinning round #
# I never come down... #
Reggie.
you got to give me it.
You got to give me it, Reggie.
Please!
Oh!
Reggie, come on!
# I remember you, too #
# I blew my mind ##
Wake up.
Can't sleep all day.
Oh.
Thanks.
Jesus Christ.
What happened to you?
What does it look like?
Motherfucker shot me.
Woke my black ass up.
Shit.
Look, uh...
I'll be back in the morning, Jim.
You just stay cool.
You start to get panicky, write about me in that book of yours.
Actually, I was a little hurt I wasn't mentioned.
You really like my writing, huh, Reggie?
Damn, man, I told you four times already.
What do you want me to do?
Bend over and kiss your ass?
Hey, Reg, do me a favor.
While you're out, pick me up a bag.
# The room is spinning round #
# I may never come down #
I am alone.
Not just me.
We're alone... alone forever.
And who's at the end of that forever tunnel I run through, up Fifth with the wallpaper of skyscrapers?
I'm thinking, after all those beautiful trips, that this is one of those bad ones.
Diane?
Hey!
Jim.
Remember me?
Man, you look great.
Yeah, thanks.
Good to see somebody from the old neighborhood...
What do you want, Jim?
- You holding anything?
- No.
Just like a 5 or something?
Just to tide me over, you know?
Please, Diane?
Come on.
Yeah.
For an old friend?
Why not?
I've been looking all over for this.
Oh, you know what?
I only got a 20.
A 20 is good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
A 20 is great, yeah.
That would help me out a lot.
- You want a 20?
- Yeah.
Why don't you go buy yourself some pretzels, you asshole.
You bitch!
You're nothing but a whore!
I don't give a shit about your clothes!
You're still a whore to me!
Yeah?
Shut up.
Look at you.
Oh, are you desperate now, baby?
Who's a whore now?
Don't talk to me like that, you bitch!
Ha ha.
Who's laughing, stupid?
Don't play a game with me!
I know you!
Ah!
Shit.
Oh, man.
Shit.
Ha ha ha!
Mickey.
Mick, what's up, man?
Hey, what's up, man?
Did you get anything?
No, not a dime.
You score?
Yeah, I got something.
What'd you get?
About 35 bucks.
35?
Where'd you get it?
I robbed some fucking asshole on the "D" train.
Dude, 35 will keep us on for, like, two days.
Well, could we get some stuff, man?
I'm fucking... my head is...
I see some spics.
I think we can score.
You wanna check it out?
- Yeah, alright.
- Come on.
They're over here.
Why the fuck do we have to cop on the street all the time?
My fucking nuts are itching like crazy.
Think this is him?
Is your name Pino?
Listen... could we get us some dope?
The dude over there said you could help.
You want to cop some shit?
Let me see some cash.
I got it here.
Let me see.
Hey, no money without no taste.
You want a taste?
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Hurry, man.
Come on.
There's fucking cops all over.
That's good, man.
That's good.
All right, listen...
4 for 35.
4 for 35, man?
Come on, man.
$5.00 short.
What's the big deal?
Ta bien, chico...
Toma, toma.
- You got four?
- Yeah.
We should taste this.
Where are we going to cook it up?
I don't know about his guy.
No, he's cool.
Fuck, man!
What's the matter?
- Just taste it!
Come on.
- What do you mean?
I tasted it.
He beat us.
He fucking beat us.
I swear to fucking God...
Put that away!
I'm gonna kill this mother-!
- Come here, motherfucker!
- Put it away!
I'm going to fucking kill you, you motherfucker!
Motherfucker, you're fucking dead, you hear me?
Dude, don't make me do it.
Where's the money?
I want the money.
I want the money and the bags.
Where's the fucking money?
The fucking money!
I want it!
Aah!
No!
- Oh, shit!
- We fucking killed him!
What the fuck do you mean, we?
I didn't fucking touch him!
Don't put that shit on me!
He beat us, man!
He deserved it!
You went too far, Mickey!
Oh, shit!
Is he dead?
Of course he's fucking dead!
He fell six stories!
Jim, come on.
Come on!
Will you come one?
Jim, don't make me leave you here!
Oh, shit.
# Star #
# I'll reach you if I try #
# Show me the truth, yeah #
# Star #
# I'll reach you if I try #
# Show me the truth, yeah ##
Come on, get back up!
Come on!
Get off of me!
What are you doing?
Who is it?
Ma...
let me in.
Ma, let me in!
Please, Ma.
Ma?
Hey, Ma?
Are you in there, Ma?
Ma, is that you?
Yeah.
Ma?
Ma?
- Are you there?
- Yeah.
Hi.
Hi, Ma.
Hi.
Hi.
Listen, I need you to help me out, all right?
I need you to give me some money.
Okay?
I need you to give me, like, five doll...
Like, $20, something like that because I'm in some trouble.
Ma?
Do you hear me, Ma?
Yeah, I hear you.
I can't help you.
Okay, listen, what you got to do is give me some money, okay?
Jim, I can't do that.
Why not?
Mom, you know I'm not going to do anything with it.
I just need to go out of town for a little while 'cause I got into some trouble, and I need some help.
Okay?
So, you got to give me some money, Mom.
Can you hold my hand?
Yeah, I'll hold your hand.
Mom, can you give me some money, please?
Mom, can you give me some money, please?
Stop fucking around!
I can't.
Mom, give me some fucking money, please!
What are you doing?
I'm your son!
I don't have any.
Mom, don't fuck around like this!
Give me some money!
Mom!
Come on!
Let me in the fucking door!
Oh, God.
Oh, fuck.
Let me in.
I need some money.
I need some money real bad.
Ohh...
Oh, God.
Someone's breaking into my apartment.
They have a knife.
Oh!
Mom!
You don't understand, Mom.
You don't know what you're fucking doing to me.
Mom, I'm in pain.
How could you do this to your son, you bitch?
You fucking bitch!
Ah!
Oh, let me in!
I'll do anything!
I'll be a good boy!
I'll be a good boy, mom, if you let me in.
Get off me!
Get off!
No!
No!
You fuckers!
You're not going to do this!
Fuck you!
Ma!
Don't do this!
Ma!
Ma!
Ma!
I got six months in Riker's Island for assault, robbery, resisting arrest, and possession of narcotics.
I sweated out a horrible cure and stayed clean the whole stretch even though it's been easier to get good junk in here than it is on the street.
Shit, it's been hard, man.
All I've been doing is reading these diaries and wondering how the hell I'm still alive, and even if I care.
Suffice to say that I'm finished with the asshole bandits of shower-room rape, and suffice to say that those swine guards won't draw blood from my ankles again.
Suffice to say that I've been just thinking about dumb stuff like what a nice concept it is to have a godmother and a godfather, wondering who my godparents might be.
My mom won't visit me here, so I guess I'll just have to wait till I get home to ask.
Jim?
Who's there?
It's me.
Pedro?
What's up, man?
Nothing.
You know.
I...
I hear you come here.
I just came by to say hi.
I'm sorry about that night at the candy store and everything.
It's all right.
Reform school turned out to be real cool, so don't sweat it.
Did you hear about Mickey, that scumbag?
He went and threw some chump off a roof.
He's getting 5 to 15 years, man.
They tried him like an adult.
Shit.
I got a present for you, Jim.
A bag of the finest dope in Manhattan.
You know, me and you?
Like old times?
I can't.
Come on.
It would be dynamite.
I got this thing to do.
Why don't you come check it out?
No.
I'm going to go, then, you know?
You know how it is.
Take care of yourself, little man.
Know this.
There's different types of users of junk.
You got your rich dilettante square-ass who dabbles now and then and always has enough money to run off to the Riviera if he feels he's fucking around to the danger point.
Street junkies hate these pricks, but they're always suckers, and their money makes them tolerable.
Then you got your upper-middle-class
Westchester preppies... same as the others, basically.
What they're good for is opening their mommy and daddy's eyes to this social virus and putting pressure on the government to do something about it.
Then there's us street kids.
Start fucking around very young,
13 or so...
We think we all got it under control and won't get strung out.
This rarely works.
I'm living proof.
But in the end, you just got to see the junk as another 9-to-5 gig.
The hours are just a bit more inclined to shadows.
[ People Cheering ]
[ Cheering Continues ]
[ Crowd ] Reggie !
Reggie !
Reggie !
[ Announcer ] Reggie Jackson having an incredible night.
Two for two, with a walk, four runs batted in.
- And he's already hit two home runs tonight.
- Reggie !
Reggie !
- And just listen to that crowd.
- Reggie !
Reggie !
Reggie !
Reggie !
Reggie !
Come on, Reggie !
Hit another one !
Hit another home run !
Coop, he's already hit two.
[ Announcer ] lt's a fly ball to right, and deep !
That's going to be way back !
- And that's going to be gone !
- Yea !
- Reggie Jackson hits his third home run of the game !
- Yes !
Whoo !
All right !
- Good catch, Coop.
- l can't believe it.
I totally had it, but my glasses slipped.
Remer, someday I'm gonna become a big sports star, too.
Whatever you say, Coop.
You just watch me, dude.
You just watch me.
[ Narrator ] There was a time in America... when contests of athletic prowess... were a metaphor for the nobility of man.
Historic moments, forged by the love of the game, celebrated the human potential to achieve excellence.
But as time passed and the country neared the millennium, something went awry.
[ Announcer ] Manning rolls right.
He's got Plough at the ten.
The five-- Touchdown, Dallas !
[ Narrator ] The ideal of sportsmanship... began to take a back seat to excessive celebration.
The athletes caring less about executing the play... than planning the vulgar grandstanding... that inevitably followed even the most pedestrian of accomplishments.
The games themselves became subordinate... to the quest for money.
Stadiums and arenas... became nothing more than giant billboards... to promote commercial products.
- Players sold their services to the highest bidder, - [ Applause ] much like the hired guns of the Old West.
Thank you.
And after playing for New England,
San Diego, Houston, St. Louis, a year for the Toronto Argonauts, plus one season as a greeter at the Desert Inn,
- l'm happy to finally play here in the fine city of Miami.
- [ Applause ]
- [ People Murmuring ]
- Minnesota.
- Whatever.
Shit.
- [ Applause Continues ]
Soon it was commonplace for entire teams to change cities... in search of greater profits.
The Minneapolis Lakers moved to Los Angeles where there are no lakes.
The Oilers moved to Tennessee where there is no oil.
The Jazz moved to Salt Lake City where they don't allow music.
The Oakland Raiders moved to L.A. and then back to Oakland.
No one in Los Angeles seemed to notice.
The search for greener pastures went on unabated.
Continued expansion diluted the talent pool, forcing owners to recruit heavily...
- from prisons, mental institutions and Texas.
- [ Yelling ]
Fistfighting and brawling permeated every sport, overshadowing any athletic competition.
Oh !
As the problems mounted, the fans became less and less interested.
To reverse the trend, major sports started interleague play.
When that novelty wore off, they tried intersports play.
- [ Grunts ] - [ Fans Cheering ]
But no matter how far major sports went, it wasn't enough to bring the fans back.
The spirit of athletic competition, however, indeed was not dead.
Its seed merely lay dormant in the dreams of the young.
[ Coop ] You know, Remer, someday I'm gonna be a big sports star.
- [ Doorbell Rings ] - [ Urinating ]
- [ Doorbell Rings ] - [ Urinating ]
You know, Remer, someday I'm gonna own a big sports bar.
Hurry it up, Coop.
Hold on. I just gotta water the plants.
- ** [ Rock ] - [ Zips Fly ] I don't wanna go to a party with a bunch of losers from high school.
But this is Britney Kiser's house, and I really want to fuck her.
- Dr. Kiser.
- Dr. Kiser.
Coop and Remer.
We graduated with Britney.
- You graduated ?
- Of course we graduated, cock-
- Beer ?
** [ Continuing ]
Man, this place looks like a Dockers commercial.
- Oh, hey, Stef !
- Coop !
Remer !
- You want a beer ?
- Oh, my God !
You guys haven't changed since high school.
- Oh, cool.
- No, it isn't.
Cock.
- Hey, Skid Mark Steve !
Oh, cool.
- Hey, dude !
You still just hanging out playing Nintendo ?
Well, if you must know, I'm in my second year of med school... and I'm training for the Summer Games.
- What are you two up two ?
- Just hanging out.
Playing Nintendo.
Cock.
- Hmm.
- [ Man ] You looking forward to getting out of here ?
-Yeah, I'm all packed. lt should be fun.
-Hi, Britney.
Coop !
Remer !
I didn't think you guys would show up.
Well, we wouldn't miss your party.
No, I mean, I don't remember putting you on the guest list.
Huh.
Well, Ted told us about it.
Excuse me.
Ted, why would you tell those losers about my party ?
- [ Ted ] l-l-l-l--
- This party sucks.
Let's bail.
No, dude.
Let's go up to Britney's room.
- [ Water Running ]
- Remer !
Come in here.
Check it out.
Britney's underwear, dude.
Aw, dude.
Dude !
Dude !
Dude !
- [ Vibrating ] - l am so jealous of you.
Oh, God !
[ Moaning ]
- Excuse me.
- Britney.
What are you guys doing in my mom's room ?
Oh !
Oh !
Oh !
Oh !
- Get out of here !
- Uh- [ Vibrating Continues ]
- Oh, Jesus !
- Ah !
Ah !
Dude, we're never gonna get a chick like Britney Kiser, are we ?
Or any other chick.
But it's only 'cause we have no jobs.
Our rent check's three months overdue, and our gas is about to get shut off.
What do girls want anyway ?
Well, apparently, not total losers.
Well, we're pretty good at basketball.
As long as we don't have to run or jump or dribble.
You know what I mean ?
- That shit's overrated anyway.
- [ Ted ] Hey !
- You guys up for a little game ?
- Sure.
Well, let's make it interesting.
Say 20 bucks ?
How about 50 ?
- You're on.
- Let's go.
Here we go. [ Laughing ]
- We don't have 50 bucks.
- We don't have 20.
Look, it doesn't matter.
How good can they be ?
To the lane, baby !
That's pretty !
- Oh !
- Oh, shit !
Alley-oop !
Alley-oop !
Yeah !
Come on, ladies.
We playing or not ?
Yeah, but not that pussy ass two-on-two you guys play in the suburbs.
What, you guys got something better ?
Yeah, but it's this new game we-we picked up in the hood.
- So, what is it ?
- Okay.
Okay.
I shoot from wherever I want, right ?
And then you have to make that same shot or else you get a letter.
You mean like horse ?
- No, it's not like horse !
[ Scoffs ] - [ Scoffs ]
[ Both Scoffing ]
Duh. it's, uh-- lt's baseball rules.
Yeah.
A single's from the free throw line.
Right.
And a double's from the top of the key.
You can't shoot from the same place twice.
A triple's from back here, and a home run's from behind the meatballs.
- You miss, you get an out.
Ready ?
- Break !
- What ?
- We can explain it more slowly.
You're not big sports guys ?
- No, no.
- No, no, no.
We get it.
We get it, man.
Losers up first.
So, let me get this straight.
This is a single, right ?
Yeah, and a home run's behind the meatballs.
Take your shot, guy.
- You can't spit beer at me when I'm shooting.
- That's one out.
That's the way we play.
I can do whatever I want to make you miss your shot.
- He's right.
That's one out.
- One out ?
Give me the damn ball !
- l fucked your sister.
- Huh ?
- Coop lines up for a double.
- Okay, guys, second and third.
Coop's got a runner on third.
This could bring him home.
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.
Hoo-hoo--
- Yes!
Two outs !
- God, this is-
- Come on !
- Oh !
- [ Crowd Gasps ]
- Ted Nugent.
Oh !
Oh !
Tip-in.
Double play.
That's three outs.
- What ?
- We're up.
- That's a double play.
- That's nice.
Real nice.
- Bottom of the eighth.
This could almost seal it.
Oh, he made that look easy.
Aah !
Damn it !
Come on, man !
What--
Oh, one of Britney's mom's pubic hairs.
- [ Crowd Groaning ]
- Oh, God !
- Oh !
- Come on, man !
- Dude, we win the game !
- Dude, that was a sweet psych-out.
- Dude, here's another one.
- Oh, come here.
- [ Remer ] What the hell's up with that ?
We win, and they get the chicks.
That sucks, dude.
It's jobs.
We gotta get jobs.
Then we get the khakis.
Then we get the chicks.
Starting tomorrow, we gotta stop playing games.
Miss it.
Steve Perry.
Steve Perry.
- Ah !
- Yes !
Three outs. I'm up.
- lt's the bottom of the fifth.
- Joseph R. Cooper ?
That's a single.
Man on first.
- Are you Joe Cooper ?
- Cut the crap, Squeak.
You know who I am.
Gentlemen, this form authorizes me to enter onto your property... and terminate services forthwith until all delinquent payments have been generated.
- What ?
- Dude, he's here to shut off the gas.
Squeak, you work for the gas company now ?
- Gentlemen--
- Double !
Guy on second and third.
is your canine locked up and/or safely secured within your domicile ?
Uh, yeah.
He's at the vet getting his claws removed.
Then if you'll excuse me.
Dude, does it just suck being you ?
I'll show those guys what sucks.

- Oh, yeah, he misses.
- Aw, damn it.
- [ Remer ] You said no more Journey psych-outs.
[ Coop ] Dude, I'm running out of ideas.
- [ Barking, Growling ] - [ Screaming ]
- [ Barking, Screaming Continues ]
- That's why we have this little short shot.
- Short shot.
Kind of like a bunt.
- Exactly.
- Oh, yeah.
- lt doesn't put any runners on base.
- That's a sweet idea.
- You lied to me !
Again !
Oh, right.
The dog's vet appointment's tomorrow.
We put the cat in today.
Honest mistake, Squeak.
Sorry.
My name's not Squeak !
All right ?
It's Kenny !
All right, you little bitch.
Here.
Take a shot.
I don't wanna take a shot.
I wanna turn off your gas.
And don't call me bitch.
Okay.
Squeak.
Let's just shoot for it.
Shoot for it ?
What, are you insane ?
This is my job, you assholes.
Look, all you got to do is make a single from right here... and you can shut off our gas, and we'll never call you Squeak again.
- Or bitch.
- [ Both ] Or bitch.
- From right here ?
- [ Both ] Mm-hmm.
All right.
Check this shit out.
- Steve Perry.
- Huh ?
- Oh !
- [ Dog Whimpering ]
- [ Growling ]
- Tough break, Squeak.
- Now you gotta fetch the ball, bitch.
- [ Barking, Growling ]
- [ Cheering ]
- All right !
Come on, Squeak !
We can win the game with this one, baby.
Bring me home.
- Yes !
That's it !
We win the game !
- [ Cheering Continues ]
Dude, we got five runs that inning.
- This game's pretty badass.
- [ Man ] Another game ?
You're up.
Top of the first.
[ Coop ] Yo, Tyler.
- l hear your sister's going out with Squeak.
- What ?
Oh !
- Another psych-out.
- l'm not going out with his sister.
Dude, that's the defense.
You gotta psych 'em out.
We gotta say totally fucked-up shit to make sure the other guy misses.
Oh, right.
Okay.
Hey, wait a minute !
Why is me going out with his sister totally fucked up ?
Yo, Pierce. I hear your mom's going out with Squeak.
- Whoa !
- Oh, yes !
Two outs.
So, you're gonna own 1/12 of the rent, 1/12 of the water bill, 1/12 of the power bill, 1/12 of the cable bill--
- Dude, check it out.
- What's that ?
It's a BASEketball.
Whoa, dude.
You made a ball ?
Out of what ?
Dude, I can't believe those ass-wipes fired you... for not shutting off our gas for six weeks.
It was losing the truck that pissed them off the most.
Well, you can camp out here for a while.
Well, this is pretty sweet.
- Does this couch fold out to a bed ?
- Yeah, a totally great bed.
But that's Jenkins' bed.
Your bed's over here.
Dude, that is so fucking weak.
How am I supposed to get a chick in that ?
You couldn't get a chick if you had a $100 bill hanging out of your zipper.
- Yeah, I could.
- No, dude, you're a little bitch.
I am not !
I don't even know why I hang out with you guys.
- 'Cause you're a piece of shit.
- l am not a piece of shit.
- But you're a little bitch.
- Sure are.
- Goddamn it, man !
- But you're a little bitch.
- Sure are.
- Goddamn it, man !
I swear, you guys rip on me 13 or 14 more times, I'm outta here.
Well, whatever.
Dude, I gotta show you the scoreboard I made.
Your place is a shit-hole anyway.
Well, at least I'm on the team.
Yeah, they want me--
[ Screaming, Snarling ]
Joe Bryant, WlGM, at the scene where an unusual new driveway game... has captured the imagination of at least one neighborhood.
[ Announcer #2 ] An entire league has sprung up around this quirky--
[ Announcer #3 ] ...round-robins, starting with 12 teams in June, now down to just two, including, we're told, the inventors of the game, childhood friends-- lt's off the rim.
Could be a double play.
Maxwell tips.
Newman's try.
No !
Shirts have a shot at the conversion.
Remer !
Keeps it alive.
Last chance.
Coop.
Up !
- Good !
They make the conversion !
- [ Cheering ]
- And the home run counts !
- Yeah !
Yeah !
Yeah !
Yeah !
What a game !
The Shirts win the World Championship of BASEketball !
Yeah !
Gentlemen.
Gentlemen.
Gentlemen, I'm Ted Denslow.
- Ted Denslow, the billionaire ?
- Yes.
Anyway, I like your little game here.
How'd you like to go pro ?
[ Scoffs ] BASEketball ?
I got three words for you:
National BASEketball League.
- We're not interested.
- Now, wait a minute.
Hear me out.
Now, you kids with your loud music and your Dan Fogelberg, your Zima, hula hoops, and Pac-Man video games, don't you see ?
People today have attention spans... that can only be measured in nanoseconds.
[ Bird Tweeting ] I hear you.
- Just look at these people.
- [ All ] Whoa !
- Way to go, Coop.
- They feel a certain connection with you as players.
With BASEketball, we can start fresh, not allow teams to change cities... or players to be traded.
And everybody will get paid the same, just like when I was a kid, and players were treated like- lndentured servants ?
- Yes !
And the real beauty of this game... is anyone can play.
Any normal joe can be a sports hero.
Haven't you ever wanted to be a sports hero ?
Sure.
Once.
But that-- That was a long time ago.
Well, if I know anything about this country,
- America will go nuts for BASEketball.
- [ Yelling ]
America will go crazy for BASEketball.
- [ Yelling Continues ]
- Listen to that crowd.
- Listen to that crowd.
- [ Kid ] Call an ambulance !
* Ooh, ooh, ooh *
- * Ooh, ooh, ooh * - * l say she never cared *
* And that she never will *
* To do it all again * * l guess I'll have to wait until then * * lf l get drunk *
* Well, the better I'll understand my baby *
* You won't bother me no more *
* And if you're drinkin' well, you know that you're my friend, and I'll say * * l think I'll have myself a beer *
** [ Continues ]
[ Announcer #1 ] Ninth inning.
The Beers still behind by three runs... and now down to their last out.
And the pressure on these players has got to be enormous.
All right, you guys.
We've got one out left.
We're not beat yet.
We can still win this thing.
- Can we do it ?
- [ Together ] Yeah !
Yeah !
Go, Coop !
[ Announcer #2 ] What a game these fans are seeing.
That gentleman, of course, Beers owner Ted Denslow, the father of professional BASEketball, along with his lovely new wife, Yvette.
[ Crowd Clapping, Whistling ]
[ P.A. Announcer ] Now shooting, number 44, Coop "Airman" Cooper !
[ Crowd ] Coop !
Coop !
Coop !
[ Announcer #2 ] Coop is heading for the triple square.
Bob Costas, this has to be one of the most exciting BASEketball games... in recent memory.
Just five years ago, this game was played only on driveways.
[ Michaels ] And it's hard to believe just five years ago, those girls were only in grade school.
Coop !
Coop !
Coop !
[ Michaels ] So, Coop at the triple line.
Jansen sets up for the psych-out.
- Hey, Coop.
- Be right with you, Dirk.
- [ Michaels ] lt's good !
- [ Costas ] Nothing but net.
Coop triples again.
- He's hit for the cycle seven times tonight.
- He tricked me.
Yeah !
- [ Crowd Cheering ] - [ Slapping Sound ]
- Go, Coop !
- Yeah !
And listen to those foam heads doing the Beers chug.
Chug !
Chug !
Chug !
Chug !
Coop's on third, with two down.
And that brings up Squeak Scolari.
- l knew it was gonna come down to me.
- Relax, dude.
It's not just you.
We're a team.
And it all comes down to just one man.
- Oh, God !
- Listen to me, dude.
If I could have one guy out there, it'd be you.
Unfortunately, that one man is Squeak Scolari.
- Ah, shit !
- Pretend this is just another game.
The Denslow Cup is, of course, the biggest game of the season.
- Ah, Christ !
- Will you turn that shit off ?
- l'm so scared.
- Listen to me !
You make that shot, or I'm gonna shove your head so far up your fucking ass... you'll have to wear yourself as a hat !
And in the dugout, Doug Remer giving his teammate some last-minute encouragement.
[ Both Yelling ]
Now, go out there and make that shot !
Fuck !
[ Costas ] The talented Felon Girls... appearing in their third Denslow Cup game.
[ P.A. Announcer ] Now shooting, number 23,
Squeak "Little Bitch" Scolari !
* Let's go *
[ Michaels ] So Squeak Scolari walks out to take the last remaining single.
Come on, bitch !
Nice one, bitch !
Hey, Squeak.
Miss it.
Miss it.
- [ Cheering ] - [ Costas ] lt's good.
And the Beers stay alive in the ninth.
Dallas Felons owner, Baxter Cain, hoping for another Denslow Cup victory.
[ P.A. Announcer ] Now shooting, number 17,
Doug "Sir Swish" Remer !
[ Michaels ] Two on, two out.
Remer heads for the double line.
Remer, you better make sure your toe's not over the line.
Hey, Jansen, nice psych-out, dingleberry.
Yes !
[ Michaels ] lt's in.
It's now a two-run game.
Dirk Jansen apparently missing another psych-out.
And everyone here at Beers Garden is on their feet.
[ All Chanting ] Coop !
Coop !
Coop !
And, Al, at a time like this, you can't help thinking about guys like John Elway, guys who kept coming close and then finally got there.
- Ow !
- lf Coop can make this one,
- the Beers' long wait will be over.
- [ Choking ]
Hey, Coop, it looks like your boy Denslow's about to buy the farm.
- Aah !
- Ah !
- Oh !
- [ Costas ] He missed.
- Oh !
- He missed. I don't believe it.
- The Felons win their second consecutive Denslow Cup...
- No, no.
- on the strength of a Dirk Jansen psych-out.
- Aw !
- [ Crowd Booing ] - l got you, dude. I got you.
- You--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Relax.
Relax.
- Do the Happy Dance.
- We just lost the game.
Do the Happy Dance.
- Where's the singing ?
- Aw, I don't wanna sing.
Do the singing.
Come on.
Sing.
* Happy Dance Doin' the Happy Dance *
[ Crowd Continues Booing ]
Shit !
Denslow !
[ Michaels ] And these Beers fans have to be disappointed.
What an unfortunate thing to happen on Dozen Egg Night.
Oh !
Oh !
Oh !
Oh !
It's my husband.
Somebody help him.
Oh, God !
- lf there's anything you need--
- Oh, Teddy.
I can't believe it.
He just fell over.
- Oh !
- Mrs. Denslow ?
Mrs. Denslow !
- [ Blowing ]
- Oh !
I wish there was something I could do.
- Uhh !
- They stopped serving them after the seventh inning.
Somebody get this man a hot dog !
[ Groans ]
[ Man ] You're absolutely right, Jim.
Ted Denslow was a hero because his vision brought BASEketball... from neighborhood driveways into big arenas, but more importantly, into the hearts and TVs of America.
- lt's a very sad day.
- Yee-ha !
His untimely death casts an unbearable pall over an otherwise sweet victory.
- Hey, yeah !
- And all of our hearts...
- are with you and your family on this--
- Go, Dallas !
Dirk Jansen, winner of the Winter's Warm Douche M.V.P. trophy.
What's your take on this stunning upset ?
The whole key to this game was when I psyched out Coop.
No doubt about it.
And all you people watching-- l can't believe this guy.
He didn't psych me out.
If anyone should get the psych-out, it should be Denslow.
- Dude, weak.
- Coop, I know this is a dark time for you, but I'd like to get your thoughts on what happened today.
Well, Tim, today I lost the big game and a dear friend.
Um, I'm feeling pretty vulnerable right now.
I don't think I should be alone.
I really need people to talk-- lt certainly does seem to be raining shit on Joe Cooper right now.
On paper, the Beers had the far superior team.
With the outside shooting of Coop and the deadly accuracy of Doug Remer, what happened out there ?
Well, you know, it was a team effort, and I guess it took every player working together to lose this one.
Thanks, Doug.
And so--
- Hey !
You wanna do an interview with me ?
- No.
So another BASEketball championship is in the books.
Yet another opportunity lost for the Beers.
- [ Whirring ]
- Man, I gotta go.
Hey, Coop.
Coop !
What's going on ?
Coop !
Coop !
Hey, Coop !
This is Tim McCarver from Beers Garden...
- [ Screaming ] - where the Dallas Felons have defeated the Milwaukee Beers...
- in Denslow Cup iv by a score of 13 to 11.
- [ Belching Sound ]
- [ Woman ] Everybody in.
- [ Kids Chattering ]
One at a time.
- [ Laughing ]
- Aw, please.
Can we ?
There he is !
- Where ?
- Oh, man !
- Cool !
- Can we talk to him ?
- [ Screaming, Cheering ]
- Can we stay ?
- Please, Miss Reed.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Would you mind signing a couple of autographs for the kids ?
I think you're looking for the Dallas locker room. lt's over there.
I know, but it was so crowded.
I mean, um, they would really rather have your autograph.
- Really ?
- Anyway, would you mind signing these ?
Uh, sure.
Oh.
Uh, it's nice to meet you, Miss...
- Reed.
Jenna Reed.
- Joe Cooper.
Coop.
- l know.
- Are all these kids with you ?
Oh, yeah. I've been the director of the Dream Come True Foundation... since October.
Oh, the ones that grant wishes to sick and dying kids, right ?
Well, we prefer to think of them as health-challenged... and survival-impaired.
- You're a big fan of BASEketball ?
- No, not really.
I mean, the kids are big fans.
I try and keep them interested in things that are a little more permanent.
Permanent ?
You know how professional athletes come and go.
Not in BASEketball.
There's rules against it.
Well, hello.
Miss Reed, this is Remer.
Would you like a fresh pretzel ?
I baked it myself.
Oh.
Thank you.
- lt goes great with mustard.
- Okay.
Miss Reed.
Miss Reed.
Dude, you didn't make that pretzel, did you ?
- Of course not, but chicks like guys who can cook.
- What ?
See, it works.
She was checking out my ass.
- She wasn't checking out your ass.
- All set then ?
I better get these kids back.
Little Travis is getting impatient.
Hey, I love kids.
Which one's Travis ?
- Here.
Heads up, big guy.
- Uhh !
- Are you all right, Travis ?
- l think he's sleeping.
He needs a little work on the hands.
- He's blind, Doug.
- Ah !
[ Yelling, Sirens Blare ]
Felons Fans rejoiced in their team's Denslow Cup victory... with a huge celebration in downtown Dallas.
Final tally:
14 injured, three dead.
And on a sad note, the sports world was devastated tonight... by the passing of Ted Denslow.
By all accounts, the late Beers owner seemed to be the only one... surprised by his death.
And it appears time just finally ran out... for the old cocksucker.
Theodore Denslow, dead at 85.
His hairpiece was 24.
[ Denslow ] These chaps I wore in Rootin' Tootin' Rhythm...
[ Denslow ] These chaps I wore in Rootin' Tootin' Rhythm... I bequeath to my nephew Herman.
Hope he looks as snappy in them as I did.
And this poncho that kept me dry during the filming of--
Mrs. Denslow.
Baxter Cain.
- May I sit down ?
- Of course.
-My deepest sympathy on your great loss.
-Thank you, Mr. Cain.
My valuable hand-painted plate commemorating the pope's visit... to Dodger Stadium, I leave to my niece Susan.
- [ Woman ] Aw !
- Limited edition, signed in the mold,
- with a photocopied certificate of authenticity.
- Jenna.
- This six-shooter I wore--
- What are you doing here ?
Well, I'm not sure.
l-- l got this letter.
Yeah, yeah, me, too.
And the toothbrush used to clean the oats...
- Oh !
- [ Glass Shatters, People Gasp ]
- [ Woman ] Clumsy idiot !
- Where's the body ?
They buried him two days ago.
This is the will reading.
Oh.
Well, in that case-- These are for you, Jenna.
Now as a special fluke of charity, I bequeath these season tickets to the Dream Come True Foundation.
- [ People Gasping, Murmuring ]
- Thank you.
I had nothing but respect for your late husband.
Unfortunately, he was the one person who stood in the way... of making any kind of changes in BASEketball... that might increase the owners' profits.
I can't imagine what he had against making money.
- [ Denslow Continuing ] - l trust that quality isn't sexually transmitted.
- That's pretty sweet, huh ?
- Yeah.
The kids will be very excited.
- Especially little Joey.
- Joey ?
Well, he's such a big fan of yours.
He's going into the hospital next week, and he begged me to ask you if you'd come by for a visit.
But it's not a good idea.
- l'd love to come by.
- Hey, I'll come by. I like hospitals.
No, you don't.
You like Taco Bell.
I went to this hospital in France and got together with this chick.
- Dude, that was a hostel.
- Oh, yeah.
And finally, of course, my beloved Beers, I bequeath controlling interest to...
Joseph R. Cooper.
[ People Gasping, Murmuring ]
Yes !
We own the team !
I gave him the best three months of my life. [ Sobbing ]
- Sweet !
- [ Murmuring Continues ]
- Way to go, dude !
- And, Coop ?
Yes, Mr. Denslow ?
I know you have it in you to lead the Beers to victory this season... because if you don't, the team reverts to Yvette.
- [ Woman ] What ?
- Don't feel badly about losing the team.
I believe this is merely a temporary situation.
Thank you, Mr. Cain.
It's nice to have a strong, handsome man like you on my side.
Well, yes. I'd love to discuss this further with you.
Why don't you visit sometime ?
Maybe we could, uh... lay some carpet, if you know what I mean.
[ Denslow ] At this time, I'd like to ask everyone to leave the room... so I can have a private moment with Coop.
Now that we're alone, Coop, there's something I wanna tell you.
Remember when you had the crabs...
- [ People Gasping ] - and the only thing that made you feel better was this lotion ?
Well, I found another use for it.
It feels so good, it makes me wanna sing.
Just like that night we spent in the tattoo parlor in Chicago.
Come on, baby.
* l'm too sexy for my shirt *
- [ People Groaning ] - * Too sexy for my shirt *
* So sexy it hurts *
* And I'm too sexy for my car *
* Too sexy for my car Too sexy by far **
You gettin' this ?
[ Woman Moaning ]
[ Moaning, Banging ]
That's two rooms done.
Boy, those corners are tricky.
You've done a fine job, Yvette.
Now, as I was saying, I think I've come up with a plan... to make sure that Coop never wins that Denslow Cup.
Oh.
So then the team will be mine ?
- Yes.
- That's wonderful, Baxter.
Do you want me to move on to the conference room ?
No.
Not yet.
But you know, I think my lobby could use a good buffing, if you know what I mean.
Mmm. I know exactly what you mean.
Oh !
[ Muttering ]
Oh, God !
Oh !
Oh, I can't do this shit !
[ Michaels ] And the Beers coming up to bat... for the first time in this season opener against Miami, a game they have dedicated to Ted Denslow, a team wearing black in memory of the late Beers owner.
The Beers cheerleaders also mourning the loss.
* Glamour is a rocky road *
** [ Rock ]
[ Michaels ] Mmm !
Mmm !
Mmm !
[ Clears Throat ]
* Skin flicks, lipstick Baby scribbles in the mirror *
* Drama overdosage *
Dude, it's a whole different ball game now that you own the team.
Yeah. I was just thinking.
Denslow was right.
This season could be different.
We just gotta kick some ass.
We're playing to keep this team.
You up for it ?
Dude, I'm in, all or nothin'.
- * Glamour is a rocky road * [ Whistle Blows ]

- So Miami takes the field.
- And we're underway here tonight.
- [ Beeping ]
- Coop steps into the single square.
- [ Speaking Spanish ]
It's good.
And the Beers are off to a promising start tonight.
- [ Cheering ]
- And this game is made all the more special...
- by the fact it's Free Range Chicken Night.
- [ Clucking ]
The Beers up by two, but the Dealers are threatening here with one out.
And that brings up Enrique Hernandez.
[ Crowd ] Psych-out !
Psych-out !
- [ Chanting Continues ]
- Hernandez, look.
It's fat liposuctioned out of Marlon Brando's ass.
Uh, aw, no.
What am I doing here ?
Ah-
- Aw, it's all salty and warm.
Oh, why would I do this ?
This guy ate a lot of pork.
Aw !
- Muy bueno.
- [ Crowd Groans, Quiets ]
- Damn it !
- Dude, I thought it was a killer psych-out.
- Really ?
So sick.
- Shake it off.
Shake it off.
I got this guy.
- Yo, Gomez.
- [ Crowd ] Psych-out !
- Yo, Gomez.
- [ Crowd ] Psych-out !
- Got milk ?
- [ Gasping ]
Oh, yeah, you like that, don't you ?
[ Costas ] Coop tips, and it's good !
Double play.
Beers win.
[ Michaels ] And Remer still nailing down that psych-out.
[ Grunting ]
[ Clucking ]
Dude, we totally kicked ass.
Yeah, and this is just a start.
- Doug, could you sign my chicken ?
- Joe Cooper.
Baxter Cain.
Oh, Cain.
Yeah, Denslow told me about you.
I want to welcome you to our community of owners.
If there's anything that you need, don't hesitate to ask.
Thanks, dude.
Later.
We're going to be voting next week... on making some changes in BASEketball's rules.
- l want to tell the others that you're with us.
- Why ?
BASEketball's fine.
Of course, in some respects.
But until we allow teams to move cities and players to change teams... and take advantage of lucrative corporate tie-ins, you and your colleagues are going to have to continue working for--
- Chicken poo ?
- Ugh !
Feed.
Chicken feed.
Coop, the ball is in your court.
In order for those rules to change, every owner has to vote yes.
Denslow was already filthy rich.
He didn't need the changes.
- But you do.
- [ Cluck ]
Look, I appreciate what you're saying, but you're asking me to go against every reason we created this game.
Well, before you make any hasty decisions, discuss it with your teammate.
I don't have to.
We're best friends.
We think alike.
Look, I'm sorry, but if you want unanimous consent, you're gonna have to get it from one of the other owners.
- Are we gonna kick their ass ?
- Whoo !
Whoo !
Whoo !
- Yeah !
- Yeah !
- We're gonna take these mooks out or what ?
- Yeah !
Let me handle this one !
- ln the river, baby !
Come on !

- Yo, Coop !
Your mother's a terrible cook !
- [ Laughing ]
[ Laughing Continues ]

Let's play ball.
Hey, Watson, have you seen those beer commercials ?
[ Australian Accent ] How to speak San Franciscan.

Duh, guess I'll take my shot now.
Sure hope I make it so I can get home quick and smack my wife in the eye.

She will tell him about the interior woman, that one who added to herself makes two.
- [ Man Over P.A. ] Paging Dr. White.
- l didn't expect you'd come.
I thought I'd say hi to our little friend Joey.
Oh.
Well, he's sleeping, and I really wanted to finish this book.
- Well, maybe it'll make him feel better.
Joey ?
- Uh, well--
Joey ?
Look who's here.
My biological father ?
No, dude, it's me, Joe Cooper.
- Coop ?
Coop, is it really you ?
- Yeah, it's me.
Wow. I watched all your road games.
Your psych-outs were the best.
- Thanks, dude.
Right on.
- Coop, what's a "vajoina" ?
Uh, so, uh, what seems to be the problem with you, guy ?
I'm-- l'm going to die.
- Well, we're all gonna die.
- Yeah, but not this week.
Joey, what did I tell you about staying positive ?
Besides, your donor liver's due to arrive today.
Oh, hey, look what I brought you.
- Wow !
A La-Z-Boy !
- Yeah, I made it myself, you know.
If I had a nickel for every time this ball pulled me out of a tight spot, I'd have a shitload of nickels.
Gee, Coop, I wanna be just like you when I grow up.
Here's your decaf mocha, Jenna.
Just like you take it:
Nonfat milk, low fat whipped cream...
- and a little sprinkle of cinnamon.
- Thank you, Doug.
And I baked you fresh poppyseed muffins, too.
Oh.
Give me a break.
Poppyseed muffins.
I thought you had your electrolysis appointment this morning.
I did.
Here.
Look.
Check it out.
Hey, listen, partner, I talked to the people at the Dream Come True Foundation, and they want to make your last wish--
Your-
- Well, they want to make your dream come true, as long as it doesn't involve, like, a miracle cure or something like that.
Well, hell, the guys on death row only get a meal, right ?
Uh, so-- so, what's your dream ?
Well, I've always dreamed of big game hunting.
How about killing an endangered species, like a bald eagle or a giant panda ?
Joey, I don't think that's in the true spirit of the foundation.
Well, how about poisoning the reservoir ?
I know.
How about throwing flesh-eating fish into a public swimming pool ?
I know.
How about throwing flesh-eating fish into a public swimming pool ?
I don't think you're quite getting the point, dude.
Come on, Joey.
Search your heart.
What's the one thing that you want more than anything else in the world ?
Chelsea Clinton.
That's a pretty tall order, dude.
You'd have a better shot at Bill.
You have any backup dreams ?
Well, there is one other thing.
Could I just once-- Could I hang out with the team ?
Just spend a day with the Beers.
Could I, Coop ?
Oh, l-l don't know.
And Miss Reed, too.

You see, Joey, dreams really do come true.
- You're the best, Coop.
- Yeah.
Oh, man, it's late.
We've got a game tonight.
And you've got that big liver operation.
- Yeah, but--
- What, dude ?
You're gonna be fine.
I just know I could pull through if- lf what, dude ?
- Joey, just say it and Coop will do it.
Could you, Coop ?
Do you think you could hit a home run for me... in tonight's game ?
- Well, dude-- - lt's not like he's asking you to hit two home runs.
Two ?
Can you hit two home runs ?
Of course he could.
This is Coop Cooper you're talking about.
Hell, he could hit three home runs if he wanted to, huh, Coop ?
Three ?
All right.
Remer, can I talk to you over there real quick ?
Thanks.
Hey, you know, Joey, I've hit my fair share of home runs, too.
That's nice, but Coop's gonna hit three home runs for me.
- That's great, Joey.
- [ Banging ] I think Coop's the greatest guy in the whole wide world.
Yeah, he's a major dude, all right.
- There, I feel much better now.
- Aah !
- Mr. Squeak ?
- What ?
What grade are you in ?
Hey, anybody call a taxi ?
- l called a taxi.
- We gotta get going if I'm gonna hit those home runs.
Don't you worry.
From now on, everything's gonna be A-OK.
Gee, Coop, this is the best day of my entire life.
- Oh !
- [ Thud ]
Oh, my, what a story this is.
Little Joey Thomas undergoing a lifesaving operation tonight.
- [ Cheering ]
- The fans here, of course, all wearing yellow ribbons... in support of this brave little boy.
[ Michaels ] And his hero, Joe Cooper, promising to hit three home runs, a promise that could mean the difference between life and death...
- for this brave little boy.
- [ Belches ]
Hey, Pete, what's the matter with Coop tonight ?
I don't know, but he's one for 11 and he smells like Christian Slater.
[ Costas ] Coop in the home run circle, getting ready to take his shot.
It's up. lt's good !
- [ Cheering ]
- Coop sinks his second home run of the game.
[ Groaning ]
His blood sugar's way up since yesterday.
Has there been any change in his fluid intake ?
Sweet Jesus !
His sodium's level through the roof !
It's the strangest thing.
He's eight years old, and he smells like Robert Downey, Jr.
[ Costas ] Ninth inning.
Everyone's stomach in knots here, as Coop steps up for his last at bat.
- [ Crowd ] Coop !
Coop !
- One more chance for that third home run.
[ Groaning ]
Hey, she's here, man, that girl from the bar.
- That's a guy.
- What ?
- A guy ?
- Yeah, that's a dude.
You're just saying that 'cause you want her for yourself.
I'm saying that because she's a guy.
It's impossible.
Just look at her.
She's got the cutest little upturned nose, the softest lips, the sweetest Adam's apple.

Yeah. I think I can smell her perfume from here.

This obviously means a lot to him.

- [ Michaels ] lt's going, going--
Looks like Coop has made a dream come true...

Wow.
The Lord must really have it in for that little boy.
Oh, why ?
Why ?
Why ?
Come on, Coop.
It's over.
- Poor Joey.
Why ?
- l'm sorry, dude.
If you're looking for Joey Thomas, he's been moved next door.
- Oh.
- Hey !
Oh, my God !
Oh, why ?
Why ?
Why ?
Gentlemen, he's in this room.
Joey !
Joey !
I'm here for you, dude.
The operation went fine.
Just after your game, we thought he was suffocating.
He kept screaming, "Choke !
Choke !" and lost consciousness.
He'll be fine in the morning.
But don't stay too long.
He needs his sleep.
Joey, I'm sorry I missed that third home run.
- [ Squeaking Sound ]
- But remember how I said that dreams really do come true ?
- Well, they don't.
- Mm !
Coop, he's awake !
He's trying to tell you something.
- [ Muttering ]
- Wha-what is it, Joey ?
What ?
- Hey, he's turning blue.
- Oh, my God !
This poor kid's freezing.
He needs a blanket.
Where's a blanket ?
- Sir, sir, Can I borrow your blanket ?
- l'm here for you, Joey.
- Let me borrow your blanket !
- Aaaah !
Here you go, little buddy.
This should keep you warm.
- [ Beeping ]
- He's flatlining !
You killed him.
- Oh, my God !
- l didn't kill him.
Dude, you missed the third home run and you killed him.
- [ Groaning ]
- No !
No, I'm not gonna give up on this kid !
- [ Squeak ] Coop, calm down, man.
- Come on, Joey.
Come back to me.
- Coop, get a hold of yourself.
- Leave me alone !
- Live, damn it !
Live !
- What the hell are you doing ?
Where are those heart paddle things that George Clooney uses ?
- Not those.
- Dude, let's just bail.
- Give me these things.
- You're gonna kill him !
- Clear !
- Clear !
- [ Electrical Zapping ]
- No pulse, Coop.
- Crank up the voltage.
- Ten thousand volts.

- Fifteen thousand volts.
- No !
No !

[ Announcer ] Reggie Jackson having an incredible night.
- [ Crowd ] Reggie !
Reggie !
- Two for two, with a walk, four runs batted in.
And he's already hit two home runs tonight.
And you have to wonder just what Charlie Hough must be thinking, as Reggie steps into the box here in the eighth.
- [ Crowd ] Reggie !
Reggie !
- There's a fly ball- [ Zapping ] - [ Man ] ... nature's fury when man and beast collide... on the back roads and byways of America.

- Jenna.
- Hi.
Oh, I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
No, no, I was just fixing clam chowder.
Uh, come in.
Well, when you weren't at the hospital, I came right over.
Apparently, there was some sort of terrorist attack on the post-op ward.
- Terrorist ?
- Yeah.
Evidently, they were disguised as BASEketball players.
They went on some sort of rampage, and I was so worried about...
Joey.
Was he, uh-- ls he--
Oh, he's fine.
He came through the operation with flying colors.
With that new liver, he should be peeing like a champ in no time.
- That's kidneys, Coop.
- Oh.
Well, uh, have a seat.
I just wanted to stop by and thank you for all you've done for Joey.
Oh, it's nothing.
I'm sure he's going to remember this day for the rest of his life.
Yeah, I don't doubt that.
Oh !
What a great picture.
[ Laughs ]
Look at you guys.
You seem so happy.
Yeah, l-l guess we were.
We were just best friends playing ball in the driveway.
Next thing I know, I'm on ESPN and Wheaties boxes.
And I guess it's all pretty sweet.
But nowadays, since Denslow's been gone, I'm in charge of the team, and the whole league now.
-Sometimes I forget why I play the game.
-Why do you play it, Coop ?
- Mr. October.
- The guy in the Chippendales calendar ?
No, that was Dwayne Zackemore.
I mean...
whoever it was that month.
I'm talking about Reggie Jackson.
I saw him play in a World Series once.
He hit three home runs in one game.
I caught the third one in the stands.
I remember growing up, it meant so much to me.
All I ever dreamed of was to be that guy, have that one shining moment.
- Be a hero.
- You already are a hero, Coop.
You've won these kids' hearts, but--
- What ?
- Well, I'm just worried about getting attached-- l mean, the kids getting attached.
I don't want them to be hurt.
Jenna, I would never do anything to hurt these kids.
But what Joey really needs to know... is where are you going to be next year.
Right here.
And the next year, and the year after that.
Right up until Joey grows up... and gets a driver's license... and... starts going out with girls... and meets the right one... and forgets about BASEketball altogether.
[ Exhales ]
Goes home, does some push-ups, fucks the sleeve of his favorite jacket.
- What ?
- Huh ?
I'm-l'm just saying we'll be here for Joey. I promise.
Oh, Coop, I want to believe you. I want to believe you more than anything--
Coop, check out all this cool shit we got at the hospital !
- Ooh, hey, Jenna.
- Hey, Doug.
Wow.
You're looking a little flushed.
Do you have a temperature ?
- No. I'm-l'm fine.
- Open your blouse and say "Ahh."
- Remer !
- Doug, l-- l gotta go.
- No, Jenna--
- Yeah, I'm sorry. I gotta go.
Jenna-
- Aw !
Aw !
Thanks a lot, Dr. Dickhead.
You totally fucked me there.
Dude, relax.
It was just a joke.
- Dude, give it up.
She doesn't even like you.
- Oh, she has the hots for you ?
- Squeak has a better chance with her than you do.
- Hey, you think ?
- That's low, you son of a bitch.
- Why is that low ?
I know you're jealous right now, but you can't blame me because I have a sweet ass.
I can't help it.
[ inhales ] I'm doin' the Happy Dance.
Doin' the Happy Dance.
- Does this thing work ?
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
- Can you hear me in this ?
- Yeah, yeah.
Check it out.
- Asshole !
- [ Screaming, Crashing Sound ]
- You wanna get a sandwich ?
- Yeah, let's get a sandwich.
- Yeah, let's get a sandwich.
- Goddamn.
Oh.
[ Woman On Intercom ] Mr. Cain, Doug Remer is here to see you.
[ Cain ] Remer ?
I thought I asked him to come tomorrow.
Well, yes, sir, but he's here now in the trophy room.
- The trophy room ?
- Mr. Cain--
Mr. Cain.
Mr. Cain ?
Sweet.
[ Thumping, Crashing ]
- [ Gasping ]
- Mr. Remer.
Oh, hey.
Mr. Cain.
I see you've been admiring my museum.
- ls that really--
- Yes.
When I see something I want, I get it.
Remind me the next time you're here to show you the prize in the collection.
My autographed Ty Cobb bat.
I'm planning to expand the museum out here next year.
Killer setup, Mr. Cain.
- What do you pay in rent here ?
- Nothing. I own it.
Oh, that reminds me.
Can you break a 20 ?
- What, dollars ?
- l didn't think so.
Let me get straight to the point, Don.
- May I call you Don ?
- Yeah, I guess so.
Don, when I see one of BASEketball's hottest stars... with less than $20 in his pocket, driving an American car, sharing a small house with two other guys, you know what that says to me ?
- Homos ?
- No, no, no.
It says you're underappreciated.
- And underpaid !
- Oh, yeah, I mean, I guess we are underpaid.
I want to change all that.
Players of your caliber should be making the big bucks.
Don't you agree ?
Remer !
Remer !
-Try to stay with me on this, all right?
-All right.
Now, last week, I tried to get Coop to agree to certain rule changes... that would make you millions.
- Me ?
Millions ?
- Now listen carefully.
Do you think Shaq got rich playing in Orlando ?
Hardly.
He made his fortune moving to L.A.
You know how much he makes now ?
As much as he made playing in college ?
What ?
No !
Lots more-- big money.
- And you can too !
- Would I have to quit BASEketball ?
What ?
No !
I need you to get Coop to go along !
He'd have to quit BASEketball too ?
[ Elevator Bell Dings ]
- Did I just fart ?
- Uhh !
[ Screaming ]
[ Michaels ] Top of the seventh, and those cheers you're hearing... are from the nearly 15,000 on hand here for Anal Probe Night.
So, two outs, and Doug Remer heading for the triple square.
He's 0 for 12 so far tonight.
In fact, with the exception of Coop, the Beers are ice-cold.
[ Costas ] Oh, man, that doesn't even qualify as an air ball !
And the Beers are gone in the seventh.
The Aliens now coming up with the top of their order.
Which, if you're scoring at home, is the same three guys who came up last inning.
All right, what the hell's going on ?
You guys are lying down out there !
Oh, I get it.
You guys are pissed off.
Uh, why ?
Dude, you turned down Cain's offer without talkin' to us.
- Mm-hmm !
- Yeah.
All right, what do you want, dude ?
Dude, what do you think ?
We invented this game together, but you get to control everything.
- Listen, Cain has some pretty good ideas--
- Dude, Denslow gave me the team.
- l already told Cain no.
- Dude, I'm sure Denslow is happy in his little worm farm but--
- Dude, I'm not gonna do it.
- All right, dude, listen to me carefully.
Do you think Shaq got rich playing in Orlando ?
No, he got rich playing in college.
Everybody knows that.
Dude, it's not about the money.
It's about tradition.
Look, think about the greats who have played this game.
It's because of them.
It's because of us that I can't bow down to a guy like Cain.
That's easy for you to say, 'cause you got the team !
We got jack shit !
- Even Squeak is pissed off !
- Hell, I never really minded.
Shut up, bitch !
Dude, quit thinkin' about yourself for a change !
Dude, I'm not gonna cave in.
End of story, dude.
- Dude.
- Dude !
- Dude !
Dude !
Dude.
Well, I guess you've got a point there.
All right, maybe I was wrong.
From now on, we're full partners.
- Really ?
- And you guys-- you all own part of the team too.
Really ?
You'd be willing to do that for us ?
Yeah, and that's not all. I'm talkin' prime equity stock options, comprehensive health care, full dental, traveling H.M.O., and the first 20 weeks of psychiatric care free of charge- the way it should be !
- [ All Cheering ] Yeah !

[ Man On Tape ] There were four of them in the corral:
The once-proud beast, the broken girl, her mother, and finally, the man they called The Whisperer.
The woman stared hopefully... into the ancient cowboy's weathered face.

[ Michaels ] The Beers win their tenth consecutive game. I don't know--
Who's this bimbo Coop's got the hots for ?
Oh, that's Jenna Reed.
She's the director of some kids' charity, um--
Dream Come True Foundation.
Ah. I know six men on their board of directors.

Hey, Baxter ?
Who's Ty Cobb ?
- Oh, my God !
- Did I just fart ?
Ohh !
** [ Rock ]
[ Costas ] Ninth inning.
Beers just one out away from making the play-offs.
They'll have to get by Big Ed Tuttle and the L.A. Riots to ice this one.
That's him, Squeak.
That's Tuttle.
He's been talkin' some serious shit about you all night.
Yeah, he told everyone that he caught you... jacking off in the bathroom before the game.
He saw that ?
You oughta get this guy, Squeak.
Look at him, man.
He's huge !
You want me to psych him out ?
- Dude, he'll never expect it coming from you.
- Here, say this.
I'm not gonna remember all that !
-All right, here then.
-C'mon, this is for the play-offs, dude.
If you get this guy, we're in !
Don't worry, we've got your back !
- Hey, Tuttle !
- Yeah ?
- Your mother's deaf.
- My mother's dead, you little twerp.
I guess that's why she didn't move around a lot.
[ Groaning ]
[ Costas ] Unbelievable.

- Yes !
Sweet !
- The Beers have done it !
- Dude !
Sweet !
Yes !
- Ohh !
* Talkin' away, I don't know what's left to say * * l'll say it anyway *

* Take on me *
- * Take me on **
- Dude, he is pissed !
- l didn't go over the line on that, did I ?
- No, not at all.
Don't worry about it, dude.
Jenna !
Jenna !
Hey, you missed it.
We won !
We kicked ass !
Let 'em flow, baby.
We're in the play-offs !
Yeah, let the tears come.
You're gonna make me start crying now.
- No.
- l guess this really is emotional.
- Should we just cry ?
- l think we should.
No one's watching.
- We won the game, we've got friends, we've got everything !
- Will you stop that ?
I'm not crying because I'm happy.
I just got the news our funding's been cut.
They're gonna close the foundation !
- [ Squeak Screaming ]
- Can they do that ?
Oh, no.
Those poor kids.
We can't let this happen.
We gotta do something !
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to come here and ruin your big night.
I'm sorry !
No, Jenna.
Jenna, wait.
- Gentlemen !
- Mr. Cain !
I couldn't help but overhear your conversation with Miss Reed.
- Dude, what are you doing here ?
- l jet here, I jet there.
Anyway, I just wanted to assure you there's no reason... for your girlfriend's foundation to go into Chapter 11-- or for that matter, 12, 13 or 14.
Uh, but I think I may have a solution to her problem.
There.
It's a time-tested moneymaker.
Every athlete does it.
- You want me to have bigger titties ?
- What ?
No, no.
It's a clothing line-- a Beers clothing line.
No, dude, that's against the BASEketball bylaws.
Not if the proceeds go to charity.
Think about it.
Miss Reed's foundation will never have to worry about funding again.
Awesome, Dude !
I think we should definitely do it !
'Scuse us.
- [ Squeak Groaning ]
- Will you let me do the talking here ?
There's no way I'm doing any kind of deal with this piece of shit.
Wait, I thought it was we.
Remember, it's not just up to you anymore.
All right, we can come up with a better way to get money for Jenna.
Like, how ?
- See ?
Thought so.
Mr. Cain ?
- Hmm ?
As part owner of the Beers, I'd just like to say, where do I sign ?
Congratulations, Don.
This is gonna change your life.
I look out for my "wimmins" !
Before we discuss fabric or color,
- [ Squeak ] Freedom !
Freedom !
- we gotta decide where we can make this stuff cheap.
We'll do a big media blitz.
And don't worry about Coop.
He'll come around.

- Hi there, I'm Dan Patrick.
- And I'm Kenny Mayne.
With the first seven months of the BASEketball post-season out of the way, the play-off picture is now starting to emerge.
So with last night's victory over Boston, next week the Beers must beat Indianapolis... to advance to Charlotte-- that's in an effort to reduce their magic number to three.
Right, and the Beers can advance to the National Eastern Division North to play Tampa.
So, if the Beers beat Detroit and Denver beats Atlanta... in the American Southwestern Division East Northern, then Milwaukee goes to the Denslow Cup, unless Baltimore upsets Buffalo and Charlotte ties Toronto.
Then Oakland would play L.A. and Pittsburgh in a blind choice round-robin.
If no clear winner emerges from all this, the two-man sack race will be held...
- on consecutive Sundays till a champion is crowned.
- Right.

Ninth inning, Ferries up by one, Coop steps in.

He's helping me with my movie contract.
Oh, now you're such a big shot, you're gonna act in a Hollywood movie ?
- Fuckin' sellout.

[ Water Gurgling ]
- Dude, who is that ?
- Who's it look like ?
Victoria Silvstedt, Playmate of the Year.
Hello !
Victoria Silvstedt, Playmate of the Year !
- What's that ?
- lt's a commitment ring.
- What, for Jenna ?
- Yeah, I'm letting her know that I'm ready to consider... thinking about dating her exclusively.
Well, I'm giving Jenna a pre-commitment ring. lt's a promise to pledge... that we'll think about getting engaged just as soon as we're ready to make a commitment.
What the hell are you talking about ?
You don't care about Jenna !
You were just in a hot tub naked with Victoria Silvstedt, Playmate of the Year !
You know what ?
That hurts, man.
That really hurts.
My clothing line is single-handedly saving Jenna's foundation.
Oh, sorry, I forgot about how much Doug Remer cares about kids.
- Gentlemen !
- Mr. Cain !
Hate to interrupt your celebration, but I have something... you might be interested in.
Go ahead, don't be shy.
It concerns you.
Open it !
I think you'll find it interesting.
- What's that old saying, uh-- - "A penny saved is a penny earned" ?
- "Don't eat cheese before noon--"
- Shut up !
How about "One picture is worth a thousand words."
- Oh, that's a good one !
- [ Coop ] God, these are awful !
- What kind of lowlife scum would use children this way ?
- You would.
Me ?
Never !
Gentlemen, those are pictures of the Beers clothing line... being made in Calcutta.
- Oh, just great !
- Of course, if they ever get out, the Beers, and your girlfriend's little foundation, would be ruined.
- Yipes !
- But, rest assured, there's no reason to be panicked.
Those pictures never have to see the light of day, if-- lf what ?
If you two miss the next Beers game.
Dude, the next game is the Denslow Cup !
I can see you've been reading the papers.
Listen, boys, do as I say.
You play ball, and you'll be just fine.
I thought you said you didn't want us to play ball.
I want you to play ball...
with me.
You want us to play for Dallas ?
Uh, uh, uh !
Oh, I get it.
You don't want us to show up at the game at all !
Of course, you numbskulls !
It's called blackmail !
Good evening !
Goddamn it, Remer, I told you this was gonna happen, didn't I ?
If you would have agreed to Cain's changes it never would have gotten this far !
- Dude, because of you, Jenna's foundation is totally screwed !
- Me ?
- Oh, there you are !
- Jenna !
I saw the pictures !
This is awful !
It's gonna mean the end of the foundation. lt's not endowed like--
Well, like--
Jenna, I can explain.
- Yes, it was his fault.
- Me ?
-
This is your mess, Remer.
I shoulda kept the team to myself !
Dude, I don't know you anymore !
Enough !
Look at yourselves.
You're just typical men, with humongous... egos !
You're like every other pro athlete. I should have kept those kids away from you.
Their lives are ruined and all you can do is argue about who is the bigger penis ?
I mean, child.
Long wanger.
Oh !
Throbbing cock.
Aaah !
Oh, God, I don't even know what I mean anymore !
- Jenna, wait !
- You've gotta believe us, Jenna !
It was all Coop's fault !
- Dude, could I talk to you over here ?
- Mm-hmm.
You know something, Pig Fucker ?
Can I call you Pig Fucker ?
No, only my friends can call me Pig Fucker.
- Aaaah !
- [ Crash ]
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow !
You know what, Coop ?
You're not my best friend anymore.
- How do you like that ?
- l love it !
Good, I'm glad !
I'm sick of playing second fiddle to you, and you gettin' all the recognition.
I'm gettin' myself a new best friend.
- Wake up, bitch.
You're my new best friend.
- Really ?
What ?
Are we going to the zoo ?
Fine !
I don't need you.
I'll get myself a new best friend too !
So go ahead.
Go back to your fancy cars, and your big bank accounts, and your celebrity friends, and your beautiful women, and Victoria Silvstedt, Playmate of the Year.
Fuck !
* Your life is spinnin' out of control *
* Seems the whole world is out to get you *
* Everything is wrong Nothin' seems right *
* There's a sinking feeling inside *
* Even your best friend has turned his back *

[ Woman On Loudspeaker ] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Calcutta International Airport, where it is currently 95 degrees with a light drizzle.
We hope you enjoy your stay here in lovely Calcutta.
Taxi !
- Amoka, come on !
- Aw, c'mon !
Driver, I'm in a hurry !
- Look, just take me to 7-1-1-
- Aw !
- [ Bleats ]
Here you are, Beerswear Factory.
- Hey, you, is this-- - l'm sorry, no entrance--
- Who the hell are you ?
- l factory manager.
Who you ?
I Joe Cooper-- l mean, I'm Joe Cooper.
Wait, Mr. Cooper, you must put on hard hat !
Aw, this is awful.
Aw, this isn't good !
Do any authorities know about this ?
- Aw !
Aw !
- Wait, wait, please, Mr. Cooper !
Put that down !
[ Squealing, Screaming ]
[ Man ] A young man.
His whole life in front of him disappears.
A familiar story, yes.
But this is no ordinary Joe.
Joseph R. Cooper, perhaps the most loved sports figure in the country-- vanished.
According to Mrs. Elsie Melcher, a neighbor who asked not to be identified,
Joe Cooper left his house two weeks ago.
According to Angelique Bones, a nosy bitch who lives up the street, he took with him only a toothbrush, a wallet, a steamer trunk and a plane ticket to Calcutta.
Police theorize several possible scenarios of what happened... to the man affectionately known to the world as "Coop."
I don't know where the hell he is.
For all I care, he could be hanging by his neck in his fuckin' closet.
Scenario Number One:
He's hanging by his neck in his fucking closet.
The night before his disappearance, Coop's girlfriend had paid him a visit.
According to friends, they had quarreled.
If you're looking for Joe Cooper, I suggest you look wherever you find... the most heinous, blatant and vile exploitation of children on the planet.
Scenario Number Two:
Coop went to Disney World.
Here's a photograph of Joe Cooper taken just days before his disappearance.
Here's a computer-enhanced simulation of what he might look like today.
[ Michaels ] From Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on the shores of Lake Michigan, it's the Denslow Cup, where the defending champion Dallas Felons... meet their perennial challengers the Milwaukee Beers.
Hello, I'm Al Michaels along with Bob Costas inviting you... to join us here at Beers Garden for Denslow Cup V.
And we're in for a classic battle tonight.
You're absolutely right about that, Al.
We have over a hundred million people throughout the world tuned in to see this game.
Many of them, of course, with no understanding of the sport itself, but nonetheless fascinated by the flickering images and the bright, pretty colors.
High up in the stands, pyrotechnic expert Sergio "Lucky" Ferouch... is readying another spectacular, halftime fireworks display.
All right, you guys.
You ready to kick some ass ?
What's wrong, you guys ?
Why the long faces ?
We miss Coop.
Can't win without him.
We don't need Coop.
I'll lead you to victory !
We're supposed to be a team.
Without Coop it's not the same.
Look, even if Coop was to walk in here right now, it wouldn't change the outcome of this game one iota.
- We can win this thing !
Are you with me ?
- Yeah, yeah !
- That's the spirit.
Are you with me ?
- Yeah !
Yeah !
All right, Coop's here !
[ Michaels ] We're underway here for Denslow Cup V.
[ Costas ] A stunned crowd of over 18,000 witnessing the Beers... being thoroughly dominated by the Felons.
Come on, Beers !
Go, Coop !
Hey, guys, thought I told you we weren't gonna watch this game.
- [ All Groaning ]
- Oh, come on, Miss Reed.
It's the Denslow Cup !
These are not the kind of people to be looked up to or emulated.
[ Robert Stack ] The severed and mutilated head was postmarked Denver.
The owner still has not stepped forward.
Update:
The disappearance of the Milwaukee Beers BASEketball star.
When Joe Cooper discovered that the workers in the Beerswear Factory were youngsters, not even old enough for prostitution, he personally flew to Calcutta.
His new, all-adult workforce now makes a decent wage, enjoys full medical benefits and in-house child care.
All of us here are glad that such a terrific human being like Joe Cooper has returned.
If I were a woman, I'd sure like to be his girlfriend.
Walking in the park, hand in hand, wrapping my legs around him, cuddling in the spoon position, our hearts beating in unison, staring into his eyes over our morning coffee--
Uh, yes, yes, thank you.
- When we come back, our next unsolved mystery--
- Come on, kids.
- We're going to the game !
- [ All Squealing ] Yea !
[ Announcer ] Ladies and gentlemen, for your seventh-inning stretch entertainment,
- ** [ Calypso ] - the National BASEketball League is proud to present... a salute to our South Sea neighbors:
Viva Calypso !
We're up 16-nothing at the break.
Have the trucks pull up to the locker room.
We'll sort out the stuff when we get to Jacksonville.
Okay.
Hey, Baxter. I finally got all the chrome off this for you.
- Nice.
Very nice.
- You want me to start on this one ?
[ P.A. Announcer ] Ladies and gentlemen, please direct your attention now... to the Malaka-Laka Balance Board of Trust, symbol of brotherhood in many Polynesian countries.
Assuming the roles of the downtrodden but happy natives, with their good-luck pineapple, your Milwaukee Beers !
Thanks for flying back, Coop.
You really made a big difference in the score.
If I wouldn't have been cleaning up your mess, I wouldn't be jet-lagged and shitting curry !
Hey, guys, knock it off, all right ?
[ P.A. Announcer ] Representing their white colonial oppressors, the Dallas Felons !
And now, let's all join our Caribbean brothers... in the ceremonial South Sea handshake above the Lagoon of Peace.
- [ Coop ] All right, let go !
- [ Remer ] You let go !
Stop it.
Stop it !
- Guys, come on, man !
- Money-grubber !
- Powermonger !
- Cock !
[ Squeak ] Guys, stop it !
Whoa !
- [ Yelling ]
- Hey !
- You son of a bitch !
- You asshole !
- Die !
- Eat shit !
Hey !
Would you just stop it ?
Would you hold on a minute ?
Hey !
Would you just stop it ?
Would you hold on a minute ?
Look at you guys, fighting on the Malaka-Laka board !
You should be ashamed of yourselves !
Back in the driveway, we were nothing !
Now we've risen to the highest level, but you're throwin' it all away !
If you've forgotten what BASEketball means to America, you have only to look at this board-- the Malaka-Laka Balance Board of Trust.
Don't you see what we have here ?
A game where guys with bad backs and bad knees... can get together and compete on the same field... as guys that are all goosed up on steroids.
But more than anything, isn't this game about gettin' together with your friends and havin' a good time ?
I remember-- l remember a long time ago, I didn't have anybody.
You guys took me in.
I guess that's why it kills me to see you like this.
If we can't be friends, then the heart and soul are out of this game.
Certainly out of me !
I know I'll never get that back again.
We have sullied the waters of the Lagoon of Peace !
I'm begging you, for the love of our Caribbean brothers, dudes, stop this madness !
[ Yelling ]
- Hang on !
- Oh, my God !
Remember to hold your breath just before we hit !
Never let go !
Bob, this has to be the most spectacular extravaganza I have ever seen !
You can cram three seats into the space it takes for one wheelchair, not to mention the wasted space it takes for the oxygen bottle.
- Hell, those little shits never pay full price anyway !
- Baxter !
I just realized I can't stand you !
You can kiss these puppies good-bye !
[ Both Groaning ] Oh.
Shit, Coop.
I'm sorry.
I guess the money did go to my head.
No, l-- l'm sorry, Remer.
I think I've got a lot to learn about sharing.
Look at me. I've become everything I used to hate.
Maybe we-- we just grew up too fast.
My worst enemy turned out to be me.
- Dude.
- Dude.
- Dude.
- Dude.
Hey, Puck, I've got two over--
[ Buzzer Sounding ]
- All right, let's go win ourselves a championship !
- Yeah !
** [ Rock ]
* She was a little green *
* He was just a little mean *
* They were together all the time *
* So now no one can forget this thing that happens all the time *
* She would do anything *
- Yo, Darcy.
- Yeah ?
- Hey, that's my wife !
- Yeah, and this is me !
* They live together all the time *
* So now no one can forget this little thing *
* That's on her mind * * lt's a waste to wonder what's a heart these days * * lt takes a lot to get up and just leave those who-- **
** [ Continues ]
- Hey, Dirk !
- What is it ?
- l hear your sister's goin' out with Squeak !
- Aaah !
[ Michaels ] And Squeak Scolari crosses the plate again... as the Beers have come roaring back since the break.
Bob, this is more like the Beers team we've seen all season.
[ Costas ] Ninth inning, two outs.
Beers still down by two runs.
Felons on first and third.
The Beers have to stop Dallas here if they want to stay in this game.
And the always dangerous Grumsky coming up.
Get this guy, Coop.
He hasn't missed a shot all night.
I know, but I don't know what to say.
Nothing works on him.
- Hey !
Tell him he's fat !
- Dude, that's not cool.
- Yeah, it is.
- That's not cool.
- No, no, no.
Just do it really subtle.
- Subtle.
Hey, Grumsky, you losin' weight ?
Oh, big ass !
You're fuckin' fat.
You're goddamn fuckin' fat.
How'd you get so goddamn fuckin' fat ?
[ Costas ] The Beers hold them in the ninth on a clutch psych-out... by "Coop" Cooper.
[ Crowd Chanting ] Coop !
Coop !
Coop !
Coop !
Coop !
Coop !
[ Costas ] Bottom of the ninth.
Dallas, 16.
Milwaukee, 14.
Remer on second, Scolari on third.
Coop's coming up.
And so, it all comes down to this one shot.
Coop makes it, the Beers win the cup, and get to keep the team.
Or, he misses.
[ Chanting Continues ] Coop !
Coop !
Coop !
[ Pop ]
[ Ball Deflating ]
[ Michaels ] Oh, my God.
La-Z-Boy has popped !
The ball Coop has used every day of his career is gone, and a time-out has been called as the Beers star tries to regroup.
Excuse me, driver, do you think you could go any faster ?
Could I go any faster ?
- Yea !
- Hang on !
Yea !
Whoa !
[ Costas ] No doubt about it, Al.
The loss of this ball is going to affect the outcome of this game.
[ Tires Screeching ]
Ow !
Hey !
Come on, kids !
Thomas, where are you going ?
It's just one shot.
You can do it !
We can win this thing !
- Come on, Coop !
You can do it.
- Coop !
Stop !
Don't shoot !
- Wait !
- Joey !
Here.
I brought this for you.
I made it myself.
Just like you.
Dude, you made this ?
Well, Miss Reed helped me for most of it.
- But I finished it myself.
- Joey, this is great.
Coop, you know what Miss Reed told me tonight ?
She said she wants me to be a big sports star.
Just like Joe Cooper.
- [ Whistle Blowing ]
- Thanks, Dude.
Go get 'em, Coop !
Hey, Coop !
When's the last time you made a home run without La-Z-Boy ?
[ Costas ] Al, we have seen some classic Denslow Cup battles in the past, but I can't remember one that ever rivaled... the drama and excitement of this one.
It's off the rim !
Could be a double play.
Darcy tips.
Jantzen's try-- No.
Beers have a shot at the conversion.
Remer keeps it alive !
Last chance.
Coop up.
It's... good !
** [ Rock ]
Bob, in all my years of calling games, I don't think I've ever been this excited !
You're excited ?
Feel these nipples !
Update:
We still have no fucking clue where this guy is.
* l can wear anything and I can be anything *
* Tonight I don't wanna feel wonderful *
* Tonight I don't wanna feel bad *
* 'Cause tonight will be the night of my dreams *
* Tonight I don't wanna feel anything *
* And then things moved in took no time at all *
* Tonight I don't wanna feel wonderful **
- [ Moaning ]
- Hey, ho !
Hey !
Ho !
All right.
Coop, what ?
- What is it ?
- lt's Reggie.
Reggie Jackson.
Well, go.
Go ahead.
- Reggie.
- Coop.
Nice goin' out there.
Thanks, man.
But you know, I gotta tell you.
- lt's 'cause of you that I'm here.
- That's nice to know.
I brought this for you. I saw some kid try to leave the ballpark with it.
You gotta hang on to that.
I got the two home run balls I hit in the World Series.
Some wretched little shit got the third one.
That sucks, dude.
I gotta get my trophy.
Maybe we can have a hot dog sometime ?
All right, sounds good.
Hey, Coop !
I don't have your fuckin' ball !
Good luck next year.
Oh.
Thanks.
Hey, Baxter !
Got milk ?
- Oh, I'm sorry !
- [ Screaming, Gurgling ]
And so, on behalf of the National BASEketball League, we'd like to present to the Beers this year's Denslow Cup.
Congratulations !
Go ahead, take your victory lap.
As they skate off, all you can think about is a team that conquered adversity, a team that overcame the odds, a team that defied the critics, a team that blah, blah, blah, blah, a team that, uh--
[ Narrator ] And so, the ideal of sports once again blossomed from a tiny seed, nurtured, as always, by the dreams of the young.
Yeah !
I'm the King of the World !
Yeah !

Hey, lady!
Shut up!
When I was young, about 8 or so,
I tried making friends with God- by inviting him to my house to watch the World Series.
He never showed.
Too bad, Father.
I was just starting to enjoy myself.
We can do it again tomorrow if you like, Mr. Carroll.
You okay, Jim?
Does it hurt?
You want to rub it for him, Pedro?
Jim, give it a rest.
You'll never beat him.
The guy's a pervert.
Did you hear him?
"We can do it again tomorrow if you like, Mr. Carroll. "
Let's cut out of here.
Come on.
# I was born in a pool #
# They made my mother stand #
# I spat on that surgeon #
# And his trembling hand #
# When I felt the light #
# I was worse than bored #
# I stole a doctor's scalpel #
# And I slit the cord #
# I was a Catholic boy #
# I was redeemed through pain #
# Not through joy #
# I was two months early #
# They put me under glass #
# I screamed and cursed their children #
# When the nurses passed #
# I was convicted of theft #
# As I slid from the womb #
# They led me straight from my mother #
# To a cell in the tombs #
# I was a Catholic boy #
# Redeemed through pain #
# Not through joy #
# They starved me for weeks #
# They thought they'd teach me fear #
# I fed on cellmates' dreams #
# It gave me fine ideas #
# When they cut me loose #
# The time had served me well #
# I'd made allies in heaven #
# Comrades in hell #
# I was a Catholic child #
# The blood ran red #
# The blood ran wild ##
Why, you little prick!
This is my new...
Shit, guys, gotta get outta here.
I threw up on somebody.
I'll get ya!
You little prick!
I'll fucking throw you in the fucking river if i catch ya-
Hey!
What about the four of us versus Wilt Chamberlain?
He was the greatest of all time.
Four of us?
What are you gonna do, Pedro?
tie his shoes together when he ain't looking?
All right...
How'bout the three versus Wilt Chamberlain?
No problem.
You're kidding, right, Mickey?
No.
He can't cover all of us at the same time.
You guys don't miss open jumpers.
And you know who will be there for the rebounds.
Rebounds?
That freak is, like, 7 feet tall.
Jim, I can rebound with anybody.
You're sniffing too much of that shit, that's what you're doing.
Chamberlain would destroy all of us.
End of story.
Alright.
All we got to do is move the ball around.
There's no way we don't win.
Will you tell this kid?
Hey, Mickey, I think you could beat him yourself.
I don't think you need us.
Perfect example... confidence.
I know I could beat him.
Holy shit!
Look at this place.
I tell you what, if our school was this nice,
I'd go more than once a week.
You?
We got a game today, gentlemen.
Who's ready to play some roundball?
I said, who's ready to play some ball?
You give me that laid-back,
"I'm doing my own thing, Jack" attitude out there today, and you're going to find yourself watching the game from the bench.
No smoking, Iggy...
stunts your growth.
You want to be big and strong like me, don't you?
Out.
No smoking, and no pulling your peckers before a game.
Swifty, do you mind?
I'm taking a dump.
Get outta here!
Something die in there?
When we play our game so Pedro vomits on his head, right?
It goes all over his hair, trickles down his neck.
Some gets in his eye.
He went nuts-
Don't lie about it, either.
What are you doing?
We're signing a ball for Bobby.
Can I sign?
Yeah.
"We're holding your spot for you, kid.
Swifty. "
All right.
This one's for Bobby.
All right.
Who's better than we are?
Nobody!
Alright!
Go ahead.
Do some warm-ups.
Pedro, you're in charge.
You're my eyes and ears.
- Hey, Jim?
- Yeah?
That's a nice thing you're doing for Bobby.
Oh, thanks.
Thanks.
You seen Neutron?
I think he's talking to a scout from Saint John's, as a matter of fact, upstairs.
You want to play college ball, don't you?
Yeah.
Someday, I hope.
You know.
Yeah.
Scouts are sniffing you out already.
They like them young.
I'll tell you what.
You come by sometime, and we'll go over the schools together.
Yeah.
All right.
Yeah.
We'll get a pizza, and we'll make a night of it.
Um... actually, my nights are kind of busy right now.
Yeah.
Homework and all, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
We were the hottest Catholic high school team in New York City, on our way to the championship.
We felt like nothing could stop us.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yes!
We're on our way.
We're on our way.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Hands up.
Show me some defense.
Show me some defense.
Good steal.
Put it in.
Put it in.
Yeah!
All right.
All right.
Way to go.
Aw, geez.
All right, Neutron.
Yes!
Yes!
To the hole, Jim.
What's going on?
Break it up!
Come on.
Hit him!
Beat that motherfucker!
He fucking held me!
This dude blows the whistle...
Slow it down!
Slow it down!
You got to have presence on the court... presence like a cheetah rather than a chimp.
They both got it, but chimpy got to jump his nuts around all day to get it.
Shy cheetah just moves in total nonchalance a sec or two in his sexy, slow strut.
Me, I play like a cheetah.
Let's go, Rangers- let's go!
Let's go, Rangers, let's go!
Yeah!
Ooh!
You got it!
It's ours.
It's ours.
Yeah!
9, 8, 7,
6, 5,
4, 3,
2, 1!
Yay, Jim!
Oh, shit.
That's my team!
That's my team!
There's only two things Swifty forbids... using the word "motherfucker"
and stealing from the other team, as long as they're white.
How much for that group of winners over there?
It's $34.90.
$34.90?
Changed the prices or something?
No.
I'm a little short.
Do me a favor.
Here.
Take my watch, and I'll come back later with the rest of the money.
No.
What do you mean, no?
I'm sorry, sir.
Those burgers are worth more than the watch is.
I'll be right back.
I told you one burger each, didn't I?
It takes at least eight of these to get filled up.
Yeah.
C'mon, Swifty.
We're growing boys.
Growing boys?
We're hungry motherfuckers.
Funny, huh?
I'm not driving you guys home.
How's that for laughs?
You ripped them off, didn't you?
We're even now.
Swifty, come on.
How are we going to get home?
Face the music, pricks.
What are we going to do?
They got the door blocked off.
You afraid of these pussies?
I ain't afraid of anybody.
What's the problem?
I'm going to ask you this once.
All right?
Where's the stuff you stole from me?
What are you talking about?
No, no, no.
You're not going to fuck with me, all right?
Now, somebody stole my father's ring from my locker, motherfucker.
You want me to cut you?
Is that what you want, there?
There's no problem here.
Hey, guys!
Let's get out of here, c'mon!
You need a fucking army, huh?
Come on!
Come on!
Oh.
Nice.
That from Bobo?
That's his father's ring.
Hey, fellas.
Any of you looking for a date?
Yeah.
Me, sweetheart.
Little horsy ride in Central Park, maybe candlelight dinner?
Why don't we skip right to dessert, huh, baby?
About $15?
Fifteen bucks?
I'll give you a quarter.
Let Pedro suck your tits.
You don't have to be rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
How about you, handsome, huh?
You got $15... for a little head?
Diane, do I look like I need to pay for it?
Yeah... you do.
If it's worth it.
Jimmy...
Jimmy, I know you want some, honey.
$15.
I'll do you so good you'll never forget it, baby.
Hey, hey!
Ooh!
That's a deal.
Bargain from there.
What do you say, guys?
You want to do it?
All four of us?
- Yeah.
- It's a deal.
All four of us.
Aw, shit.
This is all I got, Diane.
Here, have a pretzel.
- Get out of here.
- Beat it.
Yeah, fuck you!
Fucking dopehead.
You see what that shit does to you?
Wow.
Speaking of dopeheads, is that Pedro's mother over there slinging her wares again?
It is!
Hey, Peepee, where you going?
Why do you have to be such an asshole all the time, huh?
Why is the little shoe crying anyway?
His mother's a sneaker.
His father's a loafer.
Somebody's got to be a heel.
Jim, where you going?
Hey, Jim!
Jim.
Hey.
Hey, man.
What's up?
You don't recognize me with my new hairdo?
It's nice.
It's nice.
I like it.
What's going on?
- How are you?
- Good.
Wow.
Look at that.
You like it?
Yeah, I'll tell you what.
When you get out of here, we'll all shave our heads and look like a gang of skinheads.
It's a deal.
All right.
I got something for you here.
Yeah.
Everyone on the team.
Look right here...
even Swifty signed it.
Thanks, man.
You remember when I dunked on that spade in Riverside Park?
You always had good ups.
Yeah.
Oh.
I got something to show you.
Hold on.
What?
Pedro got these out of some lady's purse.
- She's doing it with a donkey.
- Oh, Jesus!
Look at that schlong.
Look at that one.
Oh, I beat your record.
How many times you choke it?
Seven times.
Bullshit.
Seven times.
My mom thinks I have a cold year-round because of all the tissues around the house.
You can keep those if you want.
They're pumping so much junk in me,
I can't even get a decent chubby.
I got an idea.
Come on.
Let's go.
Where we going?
I'm getting you out of this place, man.
C'mon!
What are you, crazy, man?
I can't go anywhere.
Here you go.
I've known Bobby since I was 3.
He's my best friend.
He was the best player on our basketball team.
Two years ago, he got leukemia.
He keeps fighting it off.
I know Bobby's going to beat it.
He could beat anything.
Watch!
Jim, you're going to kill me, man.
If you let go, I swear...
I swear I'll kill you, man.
Watch the bump!
What the hell happened to forty deuce?
Last time I was here, that theater was playing Sperminator II.
Oh, yeah.
I remember that.
No, man.
This whole block has been done over by all these new artists.
It's pretty cool, huh?
Yeah.
They should put your stuff up there.
Yeah.
Right.
Still scribbling stuff in that notebook of yours, ain't you?
Of course.
You bring anything for me?
What, like to read?
No, like to eat.
What do you think?
Yeah.
I mean, I got this, but it's not a big deal.
I don't even remember writing it, to tell you the truth.
Yeah, Yeah.
I'll be the judge of this.
"Little kids shoot marbles
"where branches break the sun
"into graceful shafts of light.
I just want to be pure.
All right.
# What a life #
Nothing like the real thing to float your boat, huh, Bobby?
# What a life #
# Didn't know where, didn't know when... #
That's nice.
# Said that I'll go...
go learn #
# Put up my hand, wait my turn #
# But it never comes, I have to shout out #
# That's life #
# And that's what it's all about #
# So through the comfort and the strife #
# What a life... #
Get me out of here, Jim.
What are you talking about, man?
This was a stupid idea.
I don't feel so good.
Well, can we wait till the end of the show?
Did you hear what I said?
I said get me the hell out of here!
Hey, Bob, man...
I'm really sorry, you know?
Next time, we'll go somewhere...
Ain't gonna be no next time, Jim.
I love it this way... my feet against the tar, which is soft from the spring heat, the slight breeze that runs across your entire body, especially your crotch.
You feel an incredible power being naked under a dome of stars while a giant city is dressed, dodging cars all around you five flights down.
I don't think of anything while I'm doing the actual tugging, least of all the heavy sex fantasies I have to resort to indoors.
Just my own naked self and the stars breathing down, and it's beautiful.
Time sure flies when you're young and jerking off.
"Camp summer position.
Driver... taxi. "
Hey, that might be good.
You could get your license this summer.
Oh, yeah, Mom.
That sounds really great.
Hey, get your own job, and if you don't get it this summer, you're coming to work with me at the hotel.
Mom, please.
Why are you so worried about this?
Do I even ask you for money?
No.
I'm not worried about the money.
I want you to have responsibility.
I don't want you running around the streets of New York.
Idle time is the devil's plaything, Jim.
The devil's plaything, huh?
That might be a cool title for my first book.
Thanks!
What are you talking about?
What are you writing?
Here.
Ooh.
Um...
Ma, I'm not really that hungry this morning, alright?
- Come on.
You got to eat something.
- I know...
Where you going?
I'm going to shoot some hoops.
Sometimes I feel like something's chasing me, like there's some whacko on a roof somewhere who could snuff me out at any moment.
And I feel this horrible fear.
Will I have time to finish- the poems breaking loose in my head?
Hey, white boy, you ready for your beating?
Don't let your mouth get you into something your ass can't handle.
I'll shoot you for it.
So it's going to be like that, huh?
I... don't think so.
Yeah!
All right, so you made one.
Big deal.
You made one shot.
Make another.
# The days are muzzled in a vibe #
# I swing back from time to time #
# There's a Camaro, rusty red #
# That all my best friends drive in #
# Can you smell the summer air?
#
# Take me where they left the light on #
# Getting close, almost there #
# If that fuzzy silver badge #
# Don't greet us there #
# My head's dizzy, and I'm taking... ##
Yo, Jim!
What's the score?
Come on.
We got to go.
They don't keep score in this game.
Jim, come on.
We're losing the sun.
He's being a dick.
You want me to put a charge in his ass?
Whatch this.
Oh, look it, right here...
Jim's secret diary he's always writing in.
Bet you he wrote some shit about me.
Oh, right here.
"Spring...
Mickey. "
Hey, there I am, Jim says.
"Mickey takes out a bottle of carbonic cleaning fluid and suggests we do a little sniffing to get high. "
Whoo!
"After four deep whiffs, we're sailing someplace else. "
Mickey, what are you doing?
"Bells ringing through my ears, little lights flashing through my eyes. "
Mickey, put that down, all right?
"I pictured myself
"paddling across a river with black water,
"only the canoe was going backwards instead of forwards,
"with clouds that had faces.
Laughing, spooky, fun-house laughs... "
- Give it back, alright?
- What is that shit?
Why do you have to be such a schmuck, Mickey?
What are you talking about?
Don't you ever touch that again.
It's private.
What's your problem?
I'm...
I'm sorry.
He's writing about me, I can't read about it?
Jesus!
Hey, Jim, come on.
We're gone.
Yo, we got a cab!
Hey, cabby!
Hey, swami!
So, Shakespeare, you going to finish the game?
C'mon, Reggie, you know this game never ends.
See you later, all right?
Every crowd has its little games to prove if you're a punk or not.
My cousin in Jersey plays chickie, which is two cars heading towards each other at about 80 miles per hour.
First driver to swerve out of the way is, of course, chicken.
In Brooklyn, they make you press a lit cigarette into your arm and have it burn all the way down to the filter without the slightest flinch.
Us, Manhattan boys, we jump off cliffs into the Harlem River, which is literally shitty, because half a million toilets flush into it every day.
Whoo-oo!
Yeah!
Oooh!
Yeah!
Hey, y'all, I carried the clothes up, but I ain't carrying them down.
Peepee, this is you... all 33 pounds of you, gone with the wind.
Wow.
That's a long way down.
Devil's toe is no big deal.
We've all done it a million times.
I never done it.
You never did it?
Pedro, you never do nothing.
You know who was awesome on this rock?
Bobby.
That kids would do back flips off this rock.
Hey, Mickey.
What?
Don't talk about him like he's dead.
He's not dead.
There goes the circle line.
Check it out.
Whoo!
Full moon!
Whoo!
Hey, yo!
Whoo!
Hey, circle this!
Hey, I'm going.
Watch out, watch out...
I'm going to show you how to do it.
Ye-ea-ah!
That was a good jump.
Oh, he's nuts.
Hey, I'm going to walk down.
What you talking about?
You can't walk down.
There's no way to walk down.
I ain't jumping.
Pedro, your clothes are down there.
How you gonna get your clothes?
You going to walk around naked all day?
Pedro, if you don't jump, Mickey's going to tease you so bad-
You might as well just jump and get it over with.
Feel better.
What the hell, right?
shit...
Pedro!
Bad form.
Bad form.
Oh...
My God!
Oh, shit.
Is he all right?
Pedro, you all right?
You ready?
Yeah.
Listen, don't tell the other guys, but when we leave here, I got a surprise for you.
Tell me what it is.
It's a surprise.
Trust me, all right?
Ouch, don't mess around, man...
Alright, you ready?
Come on!
You ready?
- Let's jump.
- On three.
Ready?
1, 2,
3.
Come on.
Let's go.
What's up, Manny?
How you doing?
Fine.
Thank you, sir.
This is my friend Jim.
How you doing?
I can't believe I hit my head on that rock.
It's killing me.
Jim, um, this is Winkie.
- Hi.
- How you doing?
Good.
And this... this is Blinkie.
- Hi.
- Hi.
# I lost my heart #
# Under the bridge #
# That little girl... #
I've seen you play ball, Jim.
You're a very beautiful player.
Very zen.
# And now I moan #
# And now I holler #
# She'll never know #
# Just what I found #
# That blue-eyed girl #
It'll make you fuck like Superman.
# She said no more #
Faster than a speeding bullet...
# Became blue-eyed whore... #
More powerful than a locomotive...
# Down by the water #
# Down by the water... #
Able to, um...
I can't think of anything with a single bound.
# See her again #
# See her again... #
Do you have any protection?
Yeah.
This one's, uh, ribbed for extra pleasure.
So what are you waiting for?
What do you mean?
Take off your clothes.
Well... could we shut off the lights first?
# Little fish, big fish #
# Swimming in the water #
# Come back here, man #
# Give me my daughter #
# Little fish, big fish #
# Swimming in the water ##
White ship disappears in the wave machine this morning.
Your eyes got shut with secret chains that pillow armies eventually set free... like soft horses through toy deserts.
I love this mansion, though it's too many windows... to open halfway each morning... to close halfway each night.
I looked at his body, and it was death for the first time.
His face was thin and wrinkled, almost apelike.
His hair, just gray patches on his scalp.
He looked 60 years old, and he was 16.
Couldn't believe how skinny he was... much skinnier than he was in the hospital.
It was like having the skeleton of someone you knew put right in front of you.
I felt dazed, like I'd just come out of a four-hour movie I didn't understand.
I kept thinking about his face... and death... what a cheat the whole thing was.
Hey, you guys remember that Halloween when Bobby filled that paper bag with dog shit, lit it on fire and put it outside Father Dunne's door, and we all hid behind the dumpster?
Yeah.
I could picture Father Dunne comming outside, stepping on that shit.
Picture him in the john- scraping the shit off his shoe like this.
You think that'll keep him out of heaven?
Are you kidding?
Jesus Christ himself would have laughed at that.
It was hilarious!
What about the time at the formal when Bobby got caught in the bathroom with Mary Ann Dugan and McNulty came in and busted him?
He was, like, "Father, I swear.
We weren't doing anything. "
Meanwhile she's got a giant wad of cum hanging off her face.
I tell you, that kid was definitely a pisser.
It was weird seeing him today, man.
He was all shriveled up and wrinkled.
He looked like my grandfather.
I'll tell you what, though.
That kid was in so much pain, it's better off he died.
How the hell would you know, Mickey?
Did you go and visit him?
Any of you guys go and visit him?
All right.
Then shut the fuck up.
Hey, Jim.
Look at my brother's girlfriend in the park.
She's sitting there, eating a sandwich.
Next thing you know, she's shot in the head.
She's dead.
It's over.
What about little Teddy Rayhill?
Perfect example.
Remember that night he was up on the roof, and he was doing poppers, having a great time, laughing his ass off
He started walking backwards...
Boom!
He fell right off the goddamn roof.
It was meant to be, right?
Fuck that, you guys!
Bobby was the best fucking guy around, you know that?
What are you, a bunch of idiots?
You don't even understand, do you?
Jim, you all right?
Listen, maybe you should talk to one of the priests.
I don't know.
Maybe...
Maybe they can help you out.
Help me out?
I wouldn't ask one of those cocksuckers for directions.
You know what?
You guys need to lighten the fuck up, all right?
Let bygones be fucking bygones.
Shitty fucking world.
Live life to the fucking fullest.
You know what I mean?
Shit happens, man.
Shit fucking happens.
Come on.
Let's go.
Jim, come on.
You're growing up, and rain sort of remains on the branches of a tree that will someday rule the earth.
And that's good that there's rain.
Clears the month of your sorry rainbow expressions.
And it clears the streets of the silent armies so we can dance.
# Ted sniffing glue He was 12 years old #
# Fell from the roof on east 2-9 #
# Cathy was 11 when she pulled the plug # # 26 reds and a bottle of wine #
# Bobby had leukemia, 14 years old #
# He looked like 65 when he died #
# He was a friend of mine #
# Those are people who died, died #

# Those are people who died, died #

# They were all my friends and they died ##
Did I ever tell you about the first time I did heroin?
I went down to Pedro's basement.
All sorts of characters were in the storage-room shooting gallery.
I was just going to sniff a bag, but a guy says,
"If you're going to sniff, might as well pop it, and if you're going to pop it, might as well mainline. "
I was scared of needles, but I gave in.
It was like a long heat wave through my body.
Any ache or pain or sadness or guilty feeling was completely flushed out.
Look, Ma, I'm not in the mood for your dime-store psychology, all right?
Could you just please leave me alone?
I got a little sick, all right?
We're not going to live like this, Jim.
We're not going to live like this.
I'm warning you!
I'm telling you.
Oh, God, Mom.
You're always warning me, aren't you?
Blah, blah, blah.
You're always in my fucking ear.
Blah, blah, blah.
You don't know anything.
What are you talking about?
Go clean toilets or whatever the hell it is you do.
When you're done, clean this one.
Don't talk like that!
What's the matter with you?
Gee whiz, Ma, you know... we got to have these heart-to-heart talks more often.
They're really good for us.
I don't know you.
I don't believe this is you, Jim.
Please, Jim.
I don't know who you are.
Yeah, I know.
I was such a good little boy, right... with such potential, wasn't that it?
Is that what you're going to say?
Oh, Jim.
What's happening?
Jim, what's happening?
First, it's a Saturday-night thing, and you feel cool, like a gangster or a rock star.
It's just something to kill the boredom, you know?
They call it a chippie, a small habit.
It feels so good, you start doing it on Tuesdays, then Thursdays.
Then it's got you.
Every wise-ass punk on the block says it won't happen to them, but it does.
Go do it!
I ain't doing it.
I always do it!
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could you tell me the fastest way to the subway?
Yeah.
That's the "B" train.
Go to this corner and make a left.
It's right there.
What are you doing?
Let go!
Let go!
Let go of that!
Oh, my God!
What?
- Help!
No!
No!
- What are you doing?
Let's go!
Come on!
I don't feel like going in today.
Father, is it all right if I don't go in today?
Why?
What are you scared of?
Nothing.
I just don't feel like it, that's all.
I imagine you have more to confess than anybody here.
Unburden yourself.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been about four months since my last confession.
Yes, my son?
Well, I don't know where to start, Father.
Have you taken the name of Jesus Christ in vain?
Yeah.
Yeah, I have.
Have you disrespected your mother and father?
Have you stolen or cheated your fellow man?
Yeah, but I'm not proud of it.
Have you had impure thoughts or engaged in impure deeds?
Oh, Father, you have no idea.
Is there something else that you want to tell me in your own words?
I've done all kinds of crazy shit.
Oh, excuse me, Father.
Fuck, I'm s...
Christ, I have a dirty mouth.
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry about that.
Will you just go on?
10 Hail Marys, five Our Fathers.
What do you mean?
And that's it?
That's my punishment?
You know something?
My friend Bobby, he was the best, and he's dead.
This sucks!
You know that?
This really sucks.
It's not fair, Father.
Your nose is running, your stomach cramps, your legs feel like they've played six straight games on top of each other, and the voice is always there in the back of your head...
"Just one more time.
then we'll stop. "
Quick to the ball.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Good, Ignatius.
Good.
Good.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Right behind you.
Sir, all right if I use the bathroom, Coach?
Jim, you got a bladder like a woman.
Let's go.
Again.
There we go.
Right behind him.
Right behind him.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Two hands.
Jim?
I thought you were taking a piss.
What are you doing in here every practice?
Have you been waiting for me, Jim?
Giving me some kind of a signal?
What are you talking about, Swifty?
Don't act surprised.
Do we understand each other?
It's not going to happen, Swifty.
Put the money away.
You want more?
Here.
Just let me do it.
Get the fuck out of my face!
Take it easy, Jim.
You can't blame me for trying.
I made a mistake, all right?
Let's just pretend it never happened.
Things will go back to exactly how they were before.
Okay?
Okay?
Here, keep the money.
Keep the money.
Just don't tell anybody, all right?
Good.
Tell anybody you want!
Nobody's going to believe a drughead like you, anyway.
You think we don't know what you've been doing?
Give me the fucking money and get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck- Get the fuck out here!
Come on!
Get out of here!
And you want to stop.
You really do.
But it's like a dream.
You can't stop dreams.
They move in crazy pieces, any way they want to, and suddenly, you're capable of anything.
No!
Wake up, Mr. Carroll!
It's later than you think.
Oh.
All right!
- I need a lift.
- All right.
What do you got?
Three different pills.
Which are the ups?
I never asked.
I thought one of youse would know.
Oh, great.
We look like pharmacists?
I don't know what to take.
What do we take?
Let me see.
The blacks and the reds are the ups.
I think the pink ones are the ups.
Why?
'Cuz I associate pink with lightness, you know?
The black ones seem like they'd knock you on your ass.
They might be faded seconals.
No, they're not faded.
They'd be sticky.
They're not.
That's bullshit.
- Fuck your mother.
- My what?
All right!
Calm down.
Don't ever talk about my mother.
Don't ever hit me like that again.
Come on!
Alright!
Give me your hat.
We got a game to play, alright?
Just give me something.
Hi, Neutron.
Let me ask him.
Neutron, you know which ones are the ups?
I think you should put that shit away before Swifty comes in here.
Why you acting like such a square ass?
Screw you, Mickey.
Screw you, too, Tough guy.
Man.
I'm just going to take the black.
You sure?
You got a better idea?
Nope.
Your guess is as good as mine, Jimbo.
It's on today.
50 rebounds.
Good.
Come on.
Let's go.
I'm your friend now, right?
What, I got to smack you again, c'mon!
Yeah, take your little rat with you.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, what's up?
Why are you acting like that?
You know what's wrong.
Used to be about getting high and playing basketball.
Now it's just about getting high with you.
You're blowing it, Jim.
Oh, come on.
I don't need to hear this from you, Neutron.
Yeah, you do, Jim!
Listen, no, Jim!
I'm really proud of you, man.
Everything's cool.
You look great.
I'll see you in the NBA.

No, Father.
It's clean.
There's no drugs in there.
Thank you, Officer.
I told you we didn't have nothing.
You boys think you're awfully smart, don't you?
Well, you're both suspended for a week!
Ooh...
And you'll never play basketball here again.
That you can count on.
You can't kick me off the team, Swifty.
Oh?
Why is that?
'Cause I quit the team... and the school and this whole faggot-ass scene, that's why.
I could second that motion.
Your resignations are accepted!
Neutron, you coming with us?
Yeah.
That's what I figured.
Come on, man.
I'm fucking out of here.
Don't worry, Swifty.
I'm not going to rat you out.
And in the next life, Father,
I'm going to have the paddle!
Get out!
Thanks a lot, Neutron.
Thanks, man.
I can't believe this, you know?
I know.
What happened to the pills?
We got kicked out of the school, Mickey.
Who cares, man?
We lost the pills.
The cops took them-
We can't play ball anymore.
Jim, who cares about school, man?
We just lost $40 worth of pharmaceuticals.
I know what happened to them, too.
The cops, they take that all the time.
They either pop them themselves or they sell them.
What's my mom going to say, man?
When I go home?
She ain't gonna say nothing.
You just tell her you're going to school every day in the morning.
Let's get out of here, man...
Go get into something.
You never sold any pills at the schoolyard?
No.
So it's all a big conspiracy against you.
Right, Jim?
Yeah.
Maybe it is.
Maybe it's not.
You been missing these?
What are you going to tell me...
they're vitamins?
Oh, fuck you, Ma.
What?
!
Get out of my house!
Oh, is that what you want, Ma?
Get out!
You don't talk to me that way!
If that's what you want, I'm fucking out of here.
All right?
What are you doing?
I'm leaving!
What do you think?
I wan you to take all your shit!
I'll help you.
Here!
You want me to leave?
Yes.
Get out!
I'm out of here.
Get the fuck out of my way!
This garbage is going to kill you, Jim!
I'm gone!
Gonna to kill you!
Don't you understand?
I can't watch you kill yourself?
Ma, you're never going to fucking see me again, alright?
Just remember that.
Don't say that, Jim.
Don't say that!
It was a dream, not a nightmare... a beautiful dream I could never imagine in a thousand nods.
I saw this girl next to me who wasn't beautiful until she smiled,
and I felt that smile come at me and heat waves following, soaking through my body and out my fingertips in shafts of color.
And I knew somewhere in the world... somewhere...
that there was love for me.
We just got to raise enough cash to keep our heads straight.
Luckily, finding money in New York is like getting laid at the prom... easy.
- Fuck it, Pedro!
- What's the matter with you?
Jesus!
Watch the road.
You could kill us all, c'mon!
I get 1,500 bucks for this car.
If it's whacked up, it's worth nothing.
We should buy shit in bulk, man
We'll put it on the street and make real money.
That's 500 bucks a piece.
We'll be on for days, nights, weeks.
Yeah, man.
I'd love to go to Puerto Rico, soak up some rays, you know?
See my bitch?
That's what I'd like to do.
- What are you talking about?
- What bitch?
We haven't seen a picture or nothing.
She's 500 pounds, Jim.
She got a mustache thicker than her father.
No.
That's your mother, Mickey.
She does not exist.
Don't fool yourself.
Be careful.
I'm about to whack.
Oh, shit, man.
My brother's going to take care of us and this car.
Pedro, wake the fuck up!
Pedro, come on, man!
You're going to get us killed, what are you doing?
I got it, man.
You want me to drive?
Mickey, you better drive the car.
I'm serious, man.
Just don't blow my high.
If there's a scratch in the car, my brother'll kill me.
Yo, get out of the booth!
Get out the booth, huh?
Get out.
Fucking...
What's up?
What's up?
Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Where's the car?
It's good to see you, too.
It's over here.
It's nice.
It's smokin'.
You tell me that?
It's everything you wanted.
Get your hands off.
You guys look like shit.
Oh, my God.
They're taking the car.
Show me the sign, man!
Show me the freaking sign!
It's right there.
You see?
It says "tow-away."
You scumbags even read?
I should kick all your punk asses!
Goddamn it!
I can get you another car tonight.
Yeah?
John Halligan is waiting for this car.
I got him out of bed with his wife.
You know how this makes me fucking look?
Kenny, get off.
You're too stupid to be my brother!
You're too stupid!
You want a piece of me, Carroll?
Back off!
Back off!
- Kenny, no more!
- Mr. Tough Guy.
- Kenny, no more!
- Huh?
Tough guy?
Give me a sip of your soda.
You wipe off the bottle before you take a sip?
You don't even think twice about sharing works with Mickey.
You think you'll catch something from the bottle you're not catch from a needle?
You mistake me for somebody who gives a shit.
Headquarters...
home on and off to every down-and-out junkie and wino from 14th Street to the Bowery.
It's like a fucking all-star team.
Jimmy, the other day, my mother's been ragging on me,
"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
"You've tried every other way.
Go to church.
Put yourself in Christ's hands. "
So I do it, man.
I figure, give it a shot.
I dig Jesus.
So, I go, man.
High mass...
a choir and everything.
The first thing I see on the right, the side altar, are those little candles in the red glass that we used when it was windy in the park to cook up.
And then, this altar boy, he's coming down the aisle with this 6-foot candle.
I envision this huge spoon above it, man, with, like, shopping bags full of dope inside of it.
And then the kicker comes, man.
The priest, he starts doing the thing with the incense.
You know, starts wafting out.
I'm in the back.
It finally hits me.
"Where do I know this smell from, man?
My room, man. "
It's the smell exactly of really primo dope cooking up.
Yeah?
Exactly the same.
So what happened next?
At that point, I split.
I went home,
I went inside my closet,
I got my stash out of the inside pocket of my sharkskin easter suit, and I got stoned.
Ba bing... ba bang.
I love a ritual.
Oh, Mary, if you can hear me...
I need you to fill Jim's heart with love because he really needs it now.
Oh, God... please watch over my son.
He needs you now.
Just take care of him, okay?
I'll be okay.
I love you, Jim.
I love you.
Hey, you holding?
You straight, man?
Get out of here.
Come on.
No.
Hey, have you seen Falco?
Come on, man.
Are you holding anything?
Hey, Diane...
Come here, Diane.
- I'll take care of you, babe.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
How about some of this?
I wouldn't do you for a bag, you fucking piece of shit.
Jim.
Jimmy.
You're looking good.
Who's your embalmer?
I want some of what you got.
Check everything in this place.
Wow.
I always wanted to use these syrup pumps.
And these professional ice-cream scoopers.
Oh, my God.
Don't make me do it!
I'll do it!
I swear to God!
Jim, watch out.
Come on!
It's not opening.
They don't make them like this anymore.
You got to get it from the side.
I got it!
Oh, cool.
Change!
Shit!
Let's get out of here.
It's locked.
We got to go out the back.
Pedro, let's get out of here!
What am I, hallucinating here?
Pedro, you'll get us caught.
The cops are going to come.
Oh, you want to be tough, huh?
Go ahead... take another sip so I can blow your fucking head all over the counter!
Go ahead, Pedro!
Go ahead!
Come on, guys!
Let's go.
Put that gun away!
Don't fuck with me, motherfucker!
What the hell are you doing, Mickey?
What the hell did you do that for?
Let that little spic rot, man!
He'll get us caught.
Jim, the cops are coming.
Come on!
Jim!
Jim!
Pedro!
Pedro!
Jim!
Freeze!
Freeze!
On your stomach!
On your stomach!
I didn't do anything, I'm telling you!
This is it, man.
That Jew got to keep the money under his pillow.
Hey, Jim, I know you're still mad about Pedro.
I couldn't do nothing, man.
He was going to get us caught.
Definitely shouldn't have went that far.
What happened to you?
Your mother kick your ass?
Yeah, real funny.
Bring us a couple of Cokes, will you?
You all right?
Hey, bartender, move out of the way.
Jim, I'm getting sick.
I got to get some money to cop.
Jim.
You with me here?
What the hell are you wa...
Oh, shit.
That's Neutron.
That's the all-American high school game?
We could have played in that game.
Who gives a shit?
Come on.
I'm waiting to hear back on a scholarship from Saint John's...
I'm not sure about it, but hopefully it will work out.
Jim, I'm starting to jones.
Gotta get out there.
We need some money.
Jim, don't dwell on these dreams, man.
Will you come on?
Meet you outside, man.
I'm getting sick.
You want to meet me out there?
Is it okay if I say hi to my mom?
Hi, Mom.
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.
# You don't know it, but you're coming right along #
# Please be strong #
# You don't know it, but you're coming right along ##
Hey, you!
Stop!
You can't go in there!
Stop!
What do you want?
You realize what time it is?
Yeah.
Um... is Winkie and Blinkie here?
Who the hell are Winkie and Blinkie?
Hey, guys.
Lisa, Mel, you know this boy?
No, Daddy.
Come on.
All right.
Come on.
Get out of here.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Rubin.
He got past me.
- Don't let it happen again.
It won't happen again.
Get out of here!
What?
What?
Asshole.
Hey, fuck-up, get fucking up, man!
- What's your problem, man?
- What's YOUR problem, mam?
You sold my girlfriend some shit the other day.
You almost killed her.
What was it... rat poison?
It's not my fault your girl can't handle her drugs.
I want my fucking $20 back, man.
Look, there's no money-back guarantees.
I'm not selling refrigerators here.
Oh, yeah?
I'll cut you a dynamite deal on mexican shit.
Give me my $20, or we'll go outside.
If we go outside, one of us is going to get hurt.
I told you one of us would get hurt.
Is that right?
It's been hard...
the writing...
lately.
Terrible numbness, then suddenly it comes... in beautiful fragments or terrible dreams... like nods... so high.
Reggie, is that you?
Who the fuck do you think it is?
Don't worry, you're not dead yet.
It's not bad.
Hey, give me that.
How come it's all wet?
Because you pissed on it.
I didn't say you could read this.
What, have you been digging through all my stuff?
I need...
I got to get out of here.
Where's my jacket?
You're welcome.
What the hell am I thanking you for?
Because you was frozen in the snow like a goddamn creamsicle.
Where is it?
What?
You know what the fuck I'm talking about, Reggie!
Where is it?
You mean this?
Give it to me.
I'll cut your fucking throat, Reggie!
Give it to me, all right?
Just give it to me!
Oh, give it to me!
Give it to me!
I'm serious!
Give me it!
Give it to me!
Goddamn it!
I'll make you an incredible offer.
I'm going to save your life twice in one day, understand me?
You should have left me in the fucking snow, man.
Give me the money for my dope, too.
I'm not gonna suck your dick, all right?
Put that away.
Who the hell wants you to suck their dick?
Goddamn it!
Look at yourself!
Just look at yourself.
Oh, Reggie... it's okay.
Why are you doing this?
Because once upon a time, somebody helped me, and I always pay what I owe.
Reggie.
Reggie, I just need a taste.
I just need a little something, Reggie.
You don't understand.
It hurts, Reggie!
Reggie, I got to go.
I got to go see my mom.
You got to let me get out of here, Reggie.
Reggie!
It hur...
It hurts.
Shit!
Oh, boy...
# Touch the taste and taste the smell #
# Smell the scent, all the gifts you gave to me, baby #
# The food of your brain #
# The room is spinning round #
# I never come down #
# The room is spinning round #
# I never come down... #
Reggie.
you got to give me it.
You got to give me it, Reggie.
Please!
Reggie, come on!
# I remember you, too #
# I blew my mind ##
Wake up.
Can't sleep all day.
Oh.
Thanks.
Jesus Christ.
What happened to you?
What does it look like?
Motherfucker shot me.
Woke my black ass up.
Shit.
Look, uh...
I'll be back in the morning, Jim.
You just stay cool.
You start to get panicky, write about me in that book of yours.
Actually, I was a little hurt I wasn't mentioned.
You really like my writing, huh, Reggie?
Damn, man, I told you four times already.
What do you want me to do?
Bend over and kiss your ass?
Hey, Reg, do me a favor.
While you're out, pick me up a bag.
# The room is spinning round #
# I may never come down #
I am alone.
Not just me.
We're alone... alone forever.
And who's at the end of that forever tunnel I run through, up Fifth with the wallpaper of skyscrapers?
I'm thinking, after all those beautiful trips, that this is one of those bad ones.
Diane?
Hey!
Jim.
Remember me?
Man, you look great.
Yeah, thanks.
Good to see somebody from the old neighborhood...
What do you want, Jim?
- You holding anything?
- No.
Just like a 5 or something?
Just to tide me over, you know?
Please, Diane?
Come on.
Yeah.
For an old friend?
Why not?
I've been looking all over for this.
Oh, you know what?
I only got a 20.
A 20 is good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
A 20 is great, yeah.
That would help me out a lot.
- You want a 20?
- Yeah.
Why don't you go buy yourself some pretzels, you asshole.
You bitch!
You're nothing but a whore!
I don't give a shit about your clothes!
You're still a whore to me!
Yeah?
Shut up.
Look at you.
Oh, are you desperate now, baby?
Who's a whore now?
Don't talk to me like that, you bitch!
Who's laughing, stupid?
Don't play a game with me!
I know you!
Shit.
Oh, man.
Shit.
Mickey.
Mick, what's up, man?
Hey, what's up, man?
Did you get anything?
No, not a dime.
You score?
Yeah, I got something.
What'd you get?
About 35 bucks.
35?
Where'd you get it?
I robbed some fucking asshole on the "D" train.
Dude, 35 will keep us on for, like, two days.
Well, could we get some stuff, man?
I'm fucking... my head is...
I see some spics.
I think we can score.
You wanna check it out?
- Yeah, alright.
- Come on.
They're over here.
Why the fuck do we have to cop on the street all the time?
My fucking nuts are itching like crazy.
Think this is him?
Is your name Pino?
Listen... could we get us some dope?
The dude over there said you could help.
You want to cop some shit?
Let me see some cash.
I got it here.
Let me see.
Hey, no money without no taste.
You want a taste?
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Hurry, man.
Come on.
There's fucking cops all over.
That's good, man.
That's good.
All right, listen...
4 for 35.
4 for 35, man?
Come on, man.
$5.00 short.
What's the big deal?
Ta bien, chico...
Toma, toma.
- You got four?
- Yeah.
We should taste this.
Where are we going to cook it up?
I don't know about his guy.
No, he's cool.
Fuck, man!
What's the matter?
- Just taste it!
Come on.
- What do you mean?
I tasted it.
He beat us.
He fucking beat us.
I swear to fucking God...
Put that away!
I'm gonna kill this mother-!
- Come here, motherfucker!
- Put it away!
I'm going to fucking kill you, you motherfucker!
Motherfucker, you're fucking dead, you hear me?
Dude, don't make me do it.
Where's the money?
I want the money.
I want the money and the bags.
Where's the fucking money?
The fucking money!
I want it!
No!
- Oh, shit!
- We fucking killed him!
What the fuck do you mean, we?
I didn't fucking touch him!
Don't put that shit on me!
He beat us, man!
He deserved it!
You went too far, Mickey!
Oh, shit!
Is he dead?
Of course he's fucking dead!
He fell six stories!
Jim, come on.
Come on!
Will you come one?
Jim, don't make me leave you here!
Oh, shit.
# Star #
# I'll reach you if I try #
# Show me the truth, yeah #
# Star #
# I'll reach you if I try #
# Show me the truth, yeah ##
Come on, get back up!
Come on!
Get off of me!
What are you doing?
Who is it?
Ma...
let me in.
Ma, let me in!
Please, Ma.
Ma?
Hey, Ma?
Are you in there, Ma?
Ma, is that you?
Yeah.
Ma?
Ma?
- Are you there?
- Yeah.
Hi.
Hi, Ma.
Hi.
Hi.
Listen, I need you to help me out, all right?
I need you to give me some money.
Okay?
I need you to give me, like, five doll...
Like, $20, something like that because I'm in some trouble.
Ma?
Do you hear me, Ma?
Yeah, I hear you.
I can't help you.
Okay, listen, what you got to do is give me some money, okay?
Jim, I can't do that.
Why not?
Mom, you know I'm not going to do anything with it.
I just need to go out of town for a little while 'cause I got into some trouble, and I need some help.
Okay?
So, you got to give me some money, Mom.
Can you hold my hand?
Yeah, I'll hold your hand.
Mom, can you give me some money, please?
Mom, can you give me some money, please?
Stop fucking around!
I can't.
Mom, give me some fucking money, please!
What are you doing?
I'm your son!
I don't have any.
Mom, don't fuck around like this!
Give me some money!
Mom!
Come on!
Let me in the fucking door!
Oh, God.
Oh, fuck.
Let me in.
I need some money.
I need some money real bad.
Oh, God.
Someone's breaking into my apartment.
They have a knife.
Mom!
You don't understand, Mom.
You don't know what you're fucking doing to me.
Mom, I'm in pain.
How could you do this to your son, you bitch?
You fucking bitch!
Oh, let me in!
I'll do anything!
I'll be a good boy!
I'll be a good boy, mom, if you let me in.
Get off me!
Get off!
No!
No!
You fuckers!
You're not going to do this!
Fuck you!
Ma!
Don't do this!
Ma!
Ma!
Ma!
I got six months in Riker's Island for assault, robbery, resisting arrest, and possession of narcotics.
I sweated out a horrible cure and stayed clean the whole stretch even though it's been easier to get good junk in here than it is on the street.
Shit, it's been hard, man.
All I've been doing is reading these diaries and wondering how the hell I'm still alive, and even if I care.
Suffice to say that I'm finished with the asshole bandits of shower-room rape, and suffice to say that those swine guards won't draw blood from my ankles again.
Suffice to say that I've been just thinking about dumb stuff like what a nice concept it is to have a godmother and a godfather, wondering who my godparents might be.
My mom won't visit me here, so I guess I'll just have to wait till I get home to ask.
Jim?
Who's there?
It's me.
Pedro?
What's up, man?
Nothing.
You know.
I...
I hear you come here.
I just came by to say hi.
I'm sorry about that night at the candy store and everything.
It's all right.
Reform school turned out to be real cool, so don't sweat it.
Did you hear about Mickey, that scumbag?
He went and threw some chump off a roof.
He's getting 5 to 15 years, man.
They tried him like an adult.
Shit.
I got a present for you, Jim.
A bag of the finest dope in Manhattan.
You know, me and you?
Like old times?
I can't.
Come on.
It would be dynamite.
I got this thing to do.
Why don't you come check it out?
No.
I'm going to go, then, you know?
You know how it is.
Take care of yourself, little man.
Know this.
There's different types of users of junk.
You got your rich dilettante square-ass who dabbles now and then and always has enough money to run off to the Riviera if he feels he's fucking around to the danger point.
Street junkies hate these pricks, but they're always suckers, and their money makes them tolerable.
Then you got your upper-middle-class
Westchester preppies... same as the others, basically.
What they're good for is opening their mommy and daddy's eyes to this social virus and putting pressure on the government to do something about it.
Then there's us street kids.
Start fucking around very young,
13 or so...
We think we all got it under control and won't get strung out.
This rarely works.
I'm living proof.
But in the end, you just got to see the junk as another 9-to-5 gig.
The hours are just a bit more inclined to shadows.
Go fuck yourself, you son of a bitch.
Bastard!
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
Hallowed be thy name.
Thy Kingdom come.
Thy will be done, you fuck!
Give us this day our daily bread, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Jesus, Jesus the Nazarene.
Jesus, the Nazarene.
Go to hell.
Go to hell.
Go to hell.
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Jim, you're not going to waste the whole day lying around, are you?
Ma, I'm up.
The loony alarm went off.
Well, close the blinds.
Don't look at her and don't listen to her.
How could I not?
Jesus the Nazarene.
Mary the whore.
Mary the hairdresser.
Mary the hairdresser.
Our Father, Who art...
Hey, lady!
Shut up!
When I was young, about 8 or so,
I tried making friends with God... by inviting him to my house to watch the World Series.
He never showed.
Too bad, Father.
I was just starting to enjoy myself.
We can do it again tomorrow if you like, Mr. Carroll.
You okay, Jim?
Does it hurt?
You want to rub it for him, Pedro?
Jim, give it a rest.
You'll never beat him.
The guy's a pervert.
Did you hear him?
"We can do it again tomorrow if you like, Mr. Carroll."
Let's cut out of here.
Come on.
I was born in a pool
They made my mother stand
I spat on that surgeon
And his trembling hand
When I felt the light
I was worse than bored
I stole a doctor's scalpel
And I slit the cord
I was a Catholic boy
I was redeemed through pain
Not through joy
I was two months early
They put me under glass
I screamed and cursed their children
When the nurses passed
I was convicted of theft
As I slid from the womb
They led me straight from my mother
To a cell in the tombs
I was a Catholic boy
Redeemed through pain
Not through joy
They starved me for weeks
They thought they'd teach me fear
I fed on cellmates' dreams
It gave me fine ideas
When they cut me loose
The time had served me well
I'd made allies in heaven
Comrades in hell
I was a Catholic child
The blood ran red
The blood ran wild
Why, you little prick!
This is my new...
Shit, guys, gotta get outta here.
I threw up on somebody.
I'll get ya!
You little prick!
I'll fucking throw you in the fucking river if i catch ya...
Hey!
What about the four of us versus Wilt Chamberlain?
He was the greatest of all time.
Four of us?
What are you gonna do, Pedro?
tie his shoes together when he ain't looking?
All right...
How'bout the three versus Wilt Chamberlain?
No problem.
You're kidding, right, Mickey?
No.
He can't cover all of us at the same time.
You guys don't miss open jumpers.
And you know who will be there for the rebounds.
Rebounds?
That freak is, like, 7 feet tall.
Jim, I can rebound with anybody.
You're sniffing too much of that shit, that's what you're doing.
Chamberlain would destroy all of us.
End of story.
Alright.
All we got to do is move the ball around.
- There's no way we don't win.
- Will you tell this kid?
Hey, Mickey, I think you could beat him yourself.
I don't think you need us.
Perfect example... confidence.
I know I could beat him.
Holy shit!
Look at this place.
I tell you what, if our school was this nice,
I'd go more than once a week.
You?
We got a game today, gentlemen.
Who's ready to play some roundball?
I said, who's ready to play some ball?
You give me that laid-back,
"I'm doing my own thing, Jack" attitude out there today, and you're going to find yourself watching the game from the bench.
No smoking, Iggy...
stunts your growth.
You want to be big and strong like me, don't you?
Out.
No smoking, and no pulling your peckers before a game.
Swifty, do you mind?
I'm taking a dump.
Get outta here!
Something die in there?
When we play our game so Pedro vomits on his head, right?
It goes all over his hair, trickles down his neck.
Some gets in his eye.
He went nuts...
Don't lie about it, either.
What are you doing?
We're signing a ball for Bobby.
Can I sign?
Yeah.
"We're holding your spot for you, kid.
Swifty."
All right.
This one's for Bobby.
All right.
Who's better than we are?
Nobody!
Alright!
Go ahead.
Do some warm-ups.
Pedro, you're in charge.
You're my eyes and ears.
- Hey, Jim?
- Yeah?
That's a nice thing you're doing for Bobby.
Oh, thanks.
Thanks.
You seen Neutron?
I think he's talking to a scout from Saint John's, as a matter of fact, upstairs.
You want to play college ball, don't you?
Yeah.
Someday, I hope.
You know.
Yeah.
Scouts are sniffing you out already.
They like them young.
I'll tell you what.
You come by sometime, and we'll go over the schools together.
Yeah.
All right.
Yeah.
We'll get a pizza, and we'll make a night of it.
Um... actually, my nights are kind of busy right now.
Yeah.
Homework and all, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
We were the hottest Catholic high school team in New York City, on our way to the championship.
We felt like nothing could stop us.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yes!
We're on our way.
We're on our way.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Hands up.
Show me some defense.
Show me some defense.
Good steal.
Put it in.
Put it in.
Yeah!
All right.
All right.
Way to go.
Aw, geez.
All right, Neutron.
Yes!
Yes!
To the hole, Jim.
Whoa!
Whoa!
What's going on?
Break it up!
Come on.
Hit him!
Beat that motherfucker!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- He fucking held me!
This dude blows the whistle...
Slow it down!
Slow it down!
You got to have presence on the court... presence like a cheetah rather than a chimp.
They both got it, but chimpy got to jump his nuts around all day to get it.
Shy cheetah just moves in total nonchalance a sec or two in his sexy, slow strut.
Me, I play like a cheetah.
Let's go, Rangers... let's go!
Let's go, Rangers, let's go!
Yeah!
Ooh!
You got it!
It's ours.
It's ours.
Oh!
Yeah!
9, 8, 7,
6, 5,
4, 3,
2, 1!
Yay, Jim!
Oh, shit.
That's my team!
That's my team!
There's only two things Swifty forbids... using the word "motherfucker"
and stealing from the other team, as long as they're white.
How much for that group of winners over there?
It's $34.90.
$34.90?
Changed the prices or something?
No.
Uh...
I'm a little short.
Do me a favor.
Here.
Take my watch, and I'll come back later with the rest of the money.
No.
What do you mean, no?
I'm sorry, sir.
Those burgers are worth more than the watch is.
I'll be right back.
I told you one burger each, didn't I?
It takes at least eight of these to get filled up.
Yeah.
C'mon, Swifty.
We're growing boys.
Growing boys?
We're hungry motherfuckers.
Funny, huh?
I'm not driving you guys home.
How's that for laughs?
You ripped them off, didn't you?
We're even now.
Swifty, come on.
How are we going to get home?
Face the music, pricks.
What are we going to do?
They got the door blocked off.
You afraid of these pussies?
I ain't afraid of anybody.
What's the problem?
I'm going to ask you this once.
All right?
Where's the stuff you stole from me?
What are you talking about?
No, no, no.
You're not going to fuck with me, all right?
Now, somebody stole my father's ring from my locker, motherfucker.
You want me to cut you?
Is that what you want, there?
There's no problem here.
Hey, guys!
Let's get out of here, c'mon!
You need a fucking army, huh?
Come on!
Come on!
Oh.
Nice.
That from Bobo?
Ha ha ha!
That's his father's ring.
Hey, fellas.
Any of you looking for a date?
Yeah.
Me, sweetheart.
Little horsy ride in Central Park, maybe candlelight dinner?
Why don't we skip right to dessert, huh, baby?
About $15?
Fifteen bucks?
I'll give you a quarter.
Let Pedro suck your tits.
You don't have to be rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
How about you, handsome, huh?
You got $15... for a little head?
Diane, do I look like I need to pay for it?
Yeah... you do.
If it's worth it.
Jimmy...
Jimmy, I know you want some, honey.
$15.
I'll do you so good you'll never forget it, baby.
Hey, hey!
Ooh!
That's a deal.
Bargain from there.
What do you say, guys?
You want to do it?
All four of us?
- Yeah.
- It's a deal.
All four of us.
Aw, shit.
This is all I got, Diane.
Here, have a pretzel.
- Get out of here.
- Beat it.
Yeah, fuck you!
Fucking dopehead.
You see what that shit does to you?
Wow.
Speaking of dopeheads, is that Pedro's mother over there slinging her wares again?
It is!
Hey, Peepee, where you going?
Why do you have to be such an asshole all the time, huh?
Why is the little shoe crying anyway?
His mother's a sneaker.
His father's a loafer.
Somebody's got to be a heel.
Jim, where you going?
Hey, Jim!
Jim.
Hey.
Hey, man.
What's up?
You don't recognize me with my new hairdo?
It's nice.
It's nice.
I like it.
What's going on?
- How are you?
- Good.
Wow.
Look at that.
You like it?
Yeah, I'll tell you what.
When you get out of here, we'll all shave our heads and look like a gang of skinheads.
It's a deal.
All right.
I got something for you here.
Yeah.
Everyone on the team.
Look right here...
even Swifty signed it.
Thanks, man.
You remember when I dunked on that spade in Riverside Park?
You always had good ups.
Yeah.
Oh.
I got something to show you.
Hold on.
What?
Pedro got these out of some lady's purse.
- She's doing it with a donkey.
- Oh, Jesus!
Look at that schlong.
Look at that one.
Oh, I beat your record.
How many times you choke it?
Seven times.
Bullshit.
Seven times.
My mom thinks I have a cold year-round because of all the tissues around the house.
You can keep those if you want.
They're pumping so much junk in me,
I can't even get a decent chubby.
I got an idea.
Come on.
Let's go.
Where we going?
I'm getting you out of this place, man.
C'mon!
What are you, crazy, man?
I can't go anywhere.
Here you go.
I've known Bobby since I was 3.
He's my best friend.
He was the best player on our basketball team.
Two years ago, he got leukemia.
He keeps fighting it off.
I know Bobby's going to beat it.
He could beat anything.
Watch!
Jim, you're going to kill me, man.
If you let go, I swear...
I swear I'll kill you, man.
Watch the bump!
What the hell happened to forty deuce?
Last time I was here, that theater was playing Sperminator II.
Oh, yeah.
I remember that.
No, man.
This whole block has been done over by all these new artists.
It's pretty cool, huh?
Yeah.
They should put your stuff up there.
Yeah.
Right.
Still scribbling stuff in that notebook of yours, ain't you?
Of course.
You bring anything for me?
What, like to read?
No, like to eat.
What do you think?
Yeah.
I mean, I got this, but it's not a big deal.
I don't even remember writing it, to tell you the truth.
Yeah, Yeah.
I'll be the judge of this.
"Little kids shoot marbles
"where branches break the sun
"into graceful shafts of light.
I just want to be pure."
I just want to be pure.
All right.
What a life
Nothing like the real thing to float your boat, huh, Bobby?
What a life
Didn't know where, didn't know when...
That's nice.
Said that I'll go...
go learn
Put up my hand, wait my turn
But it never comes, I have to shout out
That's life
And that's what it's all about
So through the comfort and the strife
What a life...
Get me out of here, Jim.
What are you talking about, man?
This was a stupid idea.
I don't feel so good.
Well, can we wait till the end of the show?
Did you hear what I said?
I said get me the hell out of here!
Hey, Bob, man...
I'm really sorry, you know?
Next time, we'll go somewhere...
Ain't gonna be no next time, Jim.
I love it this way... my feet against the tar, which is soft from the spring heat, the slight breeze that runs across your entire body, especially your crotch.
You feel an incredible power being naked under a dome of stars while a giant city is dressed, dodging cars all around you five flights down.
I don't think of anything while I'm doing the actual tugging, least of all the heavy sex fantasies I have to resort to indoors.
Just my own naked self and the stars breathing down, and it's beautiful.
Time sure flies when you're young and jerking off.
"Camp summer position.
Driver... taxi."
Hey, that might be good.
You could get your license this summer.
Oh, yeah, Mom.
That sounds really great.
Hey, get your own job, and if you don't get it this summer, you're coming to work with me at the hotel.
Mom, please.
Why are you so worried about this?
Do I even ask you for money?
No.
I'm not worried about the money.
I want you to have responsibility.
I don't want you running around the streets of New York.
Idle time is the devil's plaything, Jim.
The devil's plaything, huh?
Mm-hmm.
That might be a cool title for my first book.
Thanks!
What are you talking about?
What are you writing?
Here.
Ooh.
Um...
Ma, I'm not really that hungry this morning, alright?
- Come on.
You got to eat something.
- I know...
Where you going?
I'm going to shoot some hoops.
Sometimes I feel like something's chasing me, like there's some whacko on a roof somewhere who could snuff me out at any moment.
And I feel this horrible fear.
Will I have time to finish... the poems breaking loose in my head?
Hey, white boy, you ready for your beating?
Don't let your mouth get you into something your ass can't handle.
I'll shoot you for it.
So it's going to be like that, huh?
I... don't think so.
Yeah!
All right, so you made one.
Big deal.
You made one shot.
Make another.
The days are muzzled in a vibe
I swing back from time to time
There's a Camaro, rusty red
That all my best friends drive in
Can you smell the summer air?
Take me where they left the light on
Getting close, almost there
If that fuzzy silver badge
Don't greet us there
My head's dizzy, and I'm taking...
Yo, Jim!
What's the score?
Come on.
We got to go.
They don't keep score in this game.
Jim, come on.
We're losing the sun.
He's being a dick.
You want me to put a charge in his ass?
Whatch this.
Oh, look it, right here...
Jim's secret diary he's always writing in.
Bet you he wrote some shit about me.
Oh, right here.
"Spring...
Mickey."
Hey, there I am, Jim says.
"Mickey takes out a bottle of carbonic cleaning fluid and suggests we do a little sniffing to get high."
Whoo!
"After four deep whiffs, we're sailing someplace else."
Mickey, what are you doing?
"Bells ringing through my ears, little lights flashing through my eyes."
Mickey, put that down, all right?
"I pictured myself
"paddling across a river with black water,
"only the canoe was going backwards instead of forwards,
"with clouds that had faces.
Laughing, spooky, fun-house laughs..."
- Give it back, alright?
- What is that shit?
Why do you have to be such a schmuck, Mickey?
What are you talking about?
Don't you ever touch that again.
It's private.
What's your problem?
I'm...
I'm sorry.
He's writing about me, I can't read about it?
Jesus!
Hey, Jim, come on.
We're gone.
Yo, we got a cab!
Hey, cabby!
Hey, swami!
So, Shakespeare, you going to finish the game?
C'mon, Reggie, you know this game never ends.
See you later, all right?
Every crowd has its little games to prove if you're a punk or not.
My cousin in Jersey plays chickie, which is two cars heading towards each other at about 80 miles per hour.
First driver to swerve out of the way is, of course, chicken.
In Brooklyn, they make you press a lit cigarette into your arm and have it burn all the way down to the filter without the slightest flinch.
Us, Manhattan boys, we jump off cliffs into the Harlem River, which is literally shitty, because half a million toilets flush into it every day.
Whoo-oo!
Yeah!
Oooh!
Yeah!
Hey, y'all, I carried the clothes up, but I ain't carrying them down.
Peepee, this is you... all 33 pounds of you, gone with the wind.
Wow.
That's a long way down.
Devil's toe is no big deal.
We've all done it a million times.
I never done it.
You never did it?
Pedro, you never do nothing.
You know who was awesome on this rock?
Bobby.
That kids would do back flips off this rock.
Hey, Mickey.
What?
Don't talk about him like he's dead.
He's not dead.
There goes the circle line.
Check it out.
Whoo!
Full moon!
Whoo!
Hey, yo!
Whoo!
Hey, circle this!
Hey, I'm going.
Watch out, watch out...
I'm going to show you how to do it.
Ye-ea-ah!
That was a good jump.
Oh, he's nuts.
Hey, I'm going to walk down.
What you talking about?
You can't walk down.
There's no way to walk down.
I ain't jumping.
Pedro, your clothes are down there.
How you gonna get your clothes?
You going to walk around naked all day?
Pedro, if you don't jump, Mickey's going to tease you so bad...
You might as well just jump and get it over with.
Feel better.
What the hell, right?
Oh... shit...
Pedro!
Bad form.
Bad form.
Oh...
My God!
Oh, shit.
Is he all right?
Pedro, you all right?
You ready?
Yeah.
Listen, don't tell the other guys, but when we leave here, I got a surprise for you.
Tell me what it is.
It's a surprise.
Trust me, all right?
Ouch, don't mess around, man...
Alright, you ready?
Come on!
You ready?
- Let's jump.
- On three.
Ready?
Uh-huh.
1, 2,
3.
Come on.
Let's go.
What's up, Manny?
How you doing?
Fine.
Thank you, sir.
This is my friend Jim.
How you doing?
I can't believe I hit my head on that rock.
It's killing me.
Jim, um, this is Winkie.
- Hi.
- How you doing?
Good.
And this... this is Blinkie.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I lost my heart
Under the bridge
That little girl...
I've seen you play ball, Jim.
You're a very beautiful player.
Very zen.
And now I moan
And now I holler
She'll never know
Just what I found
That blue-eyed girl
It'll make you fuck like Superman.
She said no more
Faster than a speeding bullet...
Became blue-eyed whore...
More powerful than a locomotive...
Down by the water
Down by the water...
Able to, um...
I can't think of anything with a single bound.
See her again
See her again...
Do you have any protection?
Yeah.
This one's, uh, ribbed for extra pleasure.
So what are you waiting for?
What do you mean?
Take off your clothes.
Well, uh... could we shut off the lights first?
Little fish, big fish
Swimming in the water
Come back here, man
Give me my daughter
Little fish, big fish
Swimming in the water
White ship disappears in the wave machine this morning.
Your eyes got shut with secret chains that pillow armies eventually set free... like soft horses through toy deserts.
I love this mansion, though it's too many windows... to open halfway each morning... to close halfway each night.
I looked at his body, and it was death for the first time.
His face was thin and wrinkled, almost apelike.
His hair, just gray patches on his scalp.
He looked 60 years old, and he was 16.
Couldn't believe how skinny he was... much skinnier than he was in the hospital.
It was like having the skeleton of someone you knew put right in front of you.
I felt dazed, like I'd just come out of a four-hour movie I didn't understand.
I kept thinking about his face... and death... what a cheat the whole thing was.
Hey, you guys remember that Halloween when Bobby filled that paper bag with dog shit, lit it on fire and put it outside Father Dunne's door, and we all hid behind the dumpster?
Yeah.
I could picture Father Dunne comming outside, stepping on that shit.
Picture him in the john... scraping the shit off his shoe like this.
You think that'll keep him out of heaven?
Are you kidding?
Jesus Christ himself would have laughed at that.
It was hilarious!
What about the time at the formal when Bobby got caught in the bathroom with Mary Ann Dugan and McNulty came in and busted him?
He was, like, "Father, I swear.
We weren't doing anything."
Meanwhile she's got a giant wad of cum hanging off her face.
I tell you, that kid was definitely a pisser.
It was weird seeing him today, man.
He was all shriveled up and wrinkled.
He looked like my grandfather.
I'll tell you what, though.
That kid was in so much pain, it's better off he died.
How the hell would you know, Mickey?
Did you go and visit him?
Huh?
Any of you guys go and visit him?
All right.
Then shut the fuck up.
Hey, Jim.
Look at my brother's girlfriend in the park.
She's sitting there, eating a sandwich.
Next thing you know, she's shot in the head.
She's dead.
It's over.
What about little Teddy Rayhill?
Perfect example.
Remember that night he was up on the roof, and he was doing poppers, having a great time, laughing his ass off
He started walking backwards...
Boom!
He fell right off the goddamn roof.
It was meant to be, right?
Fuck that, you guys!
Bobby was the best fucking guy around, you know that?
What are you, a bunch of idiots?
You don't even understand, do you?
Jim, you all right?
Huh?
Listen, maybe you should talk to one of the priests.
I don't know.
Maybe...
Maybe they can help you out.
Help me out?
I wouldn't ask one of those cocksuckers for directions.
You know what?
You guys need to lighten the fuck up, all right?
Let bygones be fucking bygones.
Shitty fucking world.
Live life to the fucking fullest.
You know what I mean?
Shit happens, man.
Shit fucking happens.
Come on.
Let's go.
Jim, come on.
You're growing up, and rain sort of remains on the branches of a tree that will someday rule the earth.
And that's good that there's rain.
Clears the month of your sorry rainbow expressions.
And it clears the streets of the silent armies so we can dance.
Ted sniffing glue He was 12 years old
Fell from the roof on east 2-9
Cathy was 11 when she pulled the plug 26 reds and a bottle of wine
Bobby had leukemia, 14 years old
He looked like 65 when he died
He was a friend of mine
Those are people who died, died
Those are people who died, died
Those are people who died, died
Those are people who died, died
They were all my friends
They just died
Those are people who died, died
Those are people who died, died
Those are people who died, died
Those are people who died, died
They were all my friends and they died
Did I ever tell you about the first time I did heroin?
I went down to Pedro's basement.
All sorts of characters were in the storage-room shooting gallery.
I was just going to sniff a bag, but a guy says,
"If you're going to sniff, might as well pop it, and if you're going to pop it, might as well mainline."
I was scared of needles, but I gave in.
It was like a long heat wave through my body.
Any ache or pain or sadness or guilty feeling was completely flushed out.
Look, Ma, I'm not in the mood for your dime-store psychology, all right?
Could you just please leave me alone?
I got a little sick, all right?
We're not going to live like this, Jim.
We're not going to live like this.
I'm warning you!
I'm telling you.
Oh, God, Mom.
You're always warning me, aren't you?
Blah, blah, blah.
You're always in my fucking ear.
Blah, blah, blah.
You don't know anything.
What are you talking about?
Go clean toilets or whatever the hell it is you do.
When you're done, clean this one.
Don't talk like that!
What's the matter with you?
Gee whiz, Ma, you know... we got to have these heart-to-heart talks more often.
They're really good for us.
I don't know you.
I don't believe this is you, Jim.
Please, Jim.
I don't know who you are.
Yeah, I know.
I was such a good little boy, right... with such potential, wasn't that it?
Is that what you're going to say?
Oh, Jim.
What's happening?
Jim, what's happening?
First, it's a Saturday-night thing, and you feel cool, like a gangster or a rock star.
It's just something to kill the boredom, you know?
They call it a chippie, a small habit.
It feels so good, you start doing it on Tuesdays, then Thursdays.
Then it's got you.
Every wise-ass punk on the block says it won't happen to them, but it does.
Go do it!
I ain't doing it.
I always do it!
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could you tell me the fastest way to the subway?
Yeah.
That's the "B" train.
Go to this corner and make a left.
It's right there.
What are you doing?
Let go!
Let go!
Let go of that!
Oh, my God!
What?
Oh!
- Help!
No!
No!
- What are you doing?
Let's go!
Come on!
I don't feel like going in today.
Father, is it all right if I don't go in today?
Why?
What are you scared of?
Nothing.
I just don't feel like it, that's all.
I imagine you have more to confess than anybody here.
Unburden yourself.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been about four months since my last confession.
Yes, my son?
Well, I don't know where to start, Father.
Have you taken the name of Jesus Christ in vain?
Yeah.
Yeah, I have.
Have you disrespected your mother and father?
Uh-huh.
Have you stolen or cheated your fellow man?
Yeah, but I'm not proud of it.
Have you had impure thoughts or engaged in impure deeds?
Oh, Father, you have no idea.
Is there something else that you want to tell me in your own words?
I've done all kinds of crazy shit.
Oh, excuse me, Father.
Fuck, I'm s...
Christ, I have a dirty mouth.
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry about that.
Will you just go on?
10 Hail Marys, five Our Fathers.
What do you mean?
And that's it?
That's my punishment?
You know something?
My friend Bobby, he was the best, and he's dead.
This sucks!
You know that?
This really sucks.
It's not fair, Father.
Your nose is running, your stomach cramps, your legs feel like they've played six straight games on top of each other, and the voice is always there in the back of your head...
"Just one more time.
then we'll stop."
Quick to the ball.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Good, Ignatius.
Good.
Good.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Right behind you.
Sir, all right if I use the bathroom, Coach?
Jim, you got a bladder like a woman.
Let's go.
Again.
There we go.
Right behind him.
Right behind him.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Two hands.
Jim?
I thought you were taking a piss.
Oh.
What are you doing in here every practice?
Have you been waiting for me, Jim?
Giving me some kind of a signal?
What are you talking about, Swifty?
Don't act surprised.
Do we understand each other?
It's not going to happen, Swifty.
Put the money away.
You want more?
Here.
Just let me do it.
Get the fuck out of my face!
Take it easy, Jim.
You can't blame me for trying.
I made a mistake, all right?
Let's just pretend it never happened.
Things will go back to exactly how they were before.
Okay?
Okay?
Here, keep the money.
Keep the money.
Just don't tell anybody, all right?
Good.
Tell anybody you want!
Nobody's going to believe a drughead like you, anyway.
You think we don't know what you've been doing?
Give me the fucking money and get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck...
Get the fuck out here!
Come on!
Get out of here!
And you want to stop.
You really do.
But it's like a dream.
You can't stop dreams.
They move in crazy pieces, any way they want to, and suddenly, you're capable of anything.
Ha ha ha!
No!
Wake up, Mr. Carroll!
It's later than you think.
Oh.
All right!
- I need a lift.
- All right.
What do you got?
Three different pills.
Which are the ups?
I never asked.
I thought one of youse would know.
Oh, great.
We look like pharmacists?
I don't know what to take.
What do we take?
Let me see.
The blacks and the reds are the ups.
I think the pink ones are the ups.
Why?
'Cuz I associate pink with lightness, you know?
The black ones seem like they'd knock you on your ass.
They might be faded seconals.
No, they're not faded.
They'd be sticky.
They're not.
That's bullshit.
- Fuck your mother.
- My what?
All right!
Calm down.
Don't ever talk about my mother.
Don't ever hit me like that again.
Come on!
Alright!
Give me your hat.
We got a game to play, alright?
Just give me something.
Hi, Neutron.
Let me ask him.
Neutron, you know which ones are the ups?
I think you should put that shit away before Swifty comes in here.
Why you acting like such a square ass?
Screw you, Mickey.
Screw you, too, Tough guy.
Man.
I'm just going to take the black.
You sure?
Mm-hmm.
You got a better idea?
Nope.
Your guess is as good as mine, Jimbo.
It's on today. 50 rebounds.
Good.
Come on.
Let's go.
I'm your friend now, right?
What, I got to smack you again, c'mon!
Yeah, take your little rat with you.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, what's up?
Why are you acting like that?
You know what's wrong.
Used to be about getting high and playing basketball.
Now it's just about getting high with you.
You're blowing it, Jim.
Oh, come on.
I don't need to hear this from you, Neutron.
Yeah, you do, Jim!
Listen, no, Jim!
I'm really proud of you, man.
Everything's cool.
You look great.
I'll see you in the NBA.
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone
In fact we're all alone
Riders on the storm
There's a killer on the road
His brain is squirming like a toad
Take a long holiday
Let your children play
If you give this man a ride
Sweet family will die
Killer on the road
Yeah
Did you find it?
No, Father.
It's clean.
There's no drugs in there.
Thank you, Officer.
I told you we didn't have nothing.
You boys think you're awfully smart, don't you?
Well, you're both suspended for a week!
Ooh...
And you'll never play basketball here again.
That you can count on.
You can't kick me off the team, Swifty.
Oh?
Why is that?
'Cause I quit the team... and the school and this whole faggot-ass scene, that's why.
I could second that motion.
Your resignations are accepted!
Neutron, you coming with us?
Huh?
Yeah.
That's what I figured.
Come on, man.
I'm fucking out of here.
Don't worry, Swifty.
I'm not going to rat you out.
And in the next life, Father,
I'm going to have the paddle!
Get out!
Thanks a lot, Neutron.
Thanks, man.
I can't believe this, you know?
I know.
What happened to the pills?
We got kicked out of the school, Mickey.
Who cares, man?
We lost the pills.
The cops took them...
We can't play ball anymore.
Jim, who cares about school, man?
We just lost $40 worth of pharmaceuticals.
I know what happened to them, too.
The cops, they take that all the time.
They either pop them themselves or they sell them.
What's my mom going to say, man?
When I go home?
She ain't gonna say nothing.
You just tell her you're going to school every day in the morning.
Let's get out of here, man...
Go get into something.
You never sold any pills at the schoolyard?
No.
So it's all a big conspiracy against you.
Right, Jim?
Yeah.
Maybe it is.
Maybe it's not.
You been missing these?
What are you going to tell me...
they're vitamins?
Oh, fuck you, Ma.
What?
!
Get out of my house!
Oh, is that what you want, Ma?
Get out!
You don't talk to me that way!
If that's what you want, I'm fucking out of here.
All right?
What are you doing?
I'm leaving!
What do you think?
I want you to take all your shit!
I'll help you.
Here!
You want me to leave?
Yes.
Get out!
I'm out of here.
Get the fuck out of my way!
This garbage is going to kill you, Jim!
I'm gone!
Gonna to kill you!
Don't you understand?
I can't watch you kill yourself?
Ma, you're never going to fucking see me again, alright?
Just remember that.
Don't say that, Jim.
Don't say that!
It was a dream, not a nightmare... a beautiful dream I could never imagine in a thousand nods.
I saw this girl next to me who wasn't beautiful until she smiled,
and I felt that smile come at me and heat waves following, soaking through my body and out my fingertips in shafts of color.
And I knew somewhere in the world... somewhere...
that there was love for me.
We just got to raise enough cash to keep our heads straight.
Luckily, finding money in New York is like getting laid at the prom... easy.
- Fuck it, Pedro!
- What's the matter with you?
Jesus!
Watch the road.
You could kill us all, c'mon!
I get 1,500 bucks for this car.
If it's whacked up, it's worth nothing.
We should buy shit in bulk, man
We'll put it on the street and make real money.
That's 500 bucks a piece.
We'll be on for days, nights, weeks.
Yeah, man.
I'd love to go to Puerto Rico, soak up some rays, you know?
See my bitch?
That's what I'd like to do.
- What are you talking about?
- What bitch?
We haven't seen a picture or nothing.
She's 500 pounds, Jim.
She got a mustache thicker than her father.
No.
That's your mother, Mickey.
She does not exist.
Don't fool yourself.
Be careful.
I'm about to whack.
Oh, shit, man.
My brother's going to take care of us and this car.
Pedro, wake the fuck up!
Pedro, come on, man!
You're going to get us killed, what are you doing?
I got it, man.
You want me to drive?
Mickey, you better drive the car.
I'm serious, man.
Just don't blow my high.
If there's a scratch in the car, my brother'll kill me.
Yo, get out of the booth!
Get out the booth, huh?
Get out.
Fucking...
What's up?
What's up?
Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Where's the car?
It's good to see you, too.
It's over here.
It's nice.
It's smokin'.
You tell me that?
It's everything you wanted.
Get your hands off.
You guys look like shit.
Oh, my God.
They're taking the car.
Show me the sign, man!
Show me the freaking sign!
It's right there.
You see?
It says "tow-away." Huh?
You scumbags even read?
I should kick all your punk asses!
Goddamn it!
I can get you another car tonight.
Yeah?
John Halligan is waiting for this car.
I got him out of bed with his wife.
You know how this makes me fucking look?
Kenny, get off.
You're too stupid to be my brother!
You're too stupid!
You want a piece of me, Carroll?
Back off!
Back off!
- Kenny, no more!
- Mr. Tough Guy.
- Kenny, no more!
- Huh?
Tough guy?
Give me a sip of your soda.
You wipe off the bottle before you take a sip?
You don't even think twice about sharing works with Mickey.
You think you'll catch something from the bottle you're not catch from a needle?
You mistake me for somebody who gives a shit.
Headquarters...
home on and off to every down-and-out junkie and wino from 14th Street to the Bowery.
It's like a fucking all-star team.
Jimmy, the other day, my mother's been ragging on me,
"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
"You've tried every other way.
Go to church.
Put yourself in Christ's hands."
So I do it, man.
I figure, give it a shot.
I dig Jesus.
So, I go, man.
High mass...
a choir and everything.
The first thing I see on the right, the side altar, are those little candles in the red glass that we used when it was windy in the park to cook up.
And then, this altar boy, he's coming down the aisle with this 6-foot candle.
I envision this huge spoon above it, man, with, like, shopping bags full of dope inside of it.
And then the kicker comes, man.
The priest, he starts doing the thing with the incense.
You know, starts wafting out.
I'm in the back.
It finally hits me.
"Where do I know this smell from, man?
My room, man."
It's the smell exactly of really primo dope cooking up.
Yeah?
Exactly the same.
So what happened next?
At that point, I split.
I went home,
I went inside my closet,
I got my stash out of the inside pocket of my sharkskin easter suit, and I got stoned.
Ba bing... ba bang.
I love a ritual.
Oh, Mary, if you can hear me...
I need you to fill Jim's heart with love because he really needs it now.
Oh, God... please watch over my son.
He needs you now.
Just take care of him, okay?
I'll be okay.
I love you, Jim.
I love you.
Hey, you holding?
You straight, man?
Get out of here.
Come on.
No.
Hey, have you seen Falco?
Come on, man.
Are you holding anything?
Hey, Diane...
Come here, Diane.
- I'll take care of you, babe.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
How about some of this?
Ha ha!
I wouldn't do you for a bag, you fucking piece of shit.
Jim.
Jimmy.
You're looking good.
Who's your embalmer?
I want some of what you got.
Shh.
Check everything in this place.
Wow.
I always wanted to use these syrup pumps.
And these professional ice-cream scoopers.
Oh, my God.
Don't make me do it!
I'll do it!
I swear to God!
Jim, watch out.
Come on!
It's not opening.
They don't make them like this anymore.
You got to get it from the side.
I got it!
Oh, cool.
Change!
Shit!
Let's get out of here.
It's locked.
We got to go out the back.
Pedro, let's get out of here!
What am I, hallucinating here?
Pedro, you'll get us caught.
The cops are going to come.
Oh, you want to be tough, huh?
Go ahead... take another sip so I can blow your fucking head all over the counter!
Go ahead, Pedro!
Go ahead!
Come on, guys!
Let's go.
Put that gun away!
Don't fuck with me, motherfucker!
What the hell are you doing, Mickey?
What the hell did you do that for?
Let that little spic rot, man!
He'll get us caught.
Jim, the cops are coming.
Come on!
Jim!
Jim!
Pedro!
Pedro!
Jim!
Freeze!
Freeze!
On your stomach!
On your stomach!
I didn't do anything, I'm telling you!
This is it, man.
That Jew got to keep the money under his pillow.
Hey, Jim, I know you're still mad about Pedro.
I couldn't do nothing, man.
He was going to get us caught.
Definitely shouldn't have went that far.
What happened to you?
Your mother kick your ass?
Yeah, real funny.
Bring us a couple of Cokes, will you?
You all right?
Hey, bartender, move out of the way.
Jim, I'm getting sick.
I got to get some money to cop.
Jim.
You with me here?
What the hell are you wa...
Oh, shit.
That's Neutron.
That's the all-American high school game?
We could have played in that game.
Who gives a shit?
Come on.
I'm waiting to hear back on a scholarship from Saint John's...
I'm not sure about it, but hopefully it will work out.
Jim, I'm starting to jones.
Gotta get out there.
We need some money.
Jim, don't dwell on these dreams, man.
Will you come on?
Meet you outside, man.
I'm getting sick.
You want to meet me out there?
Is it okay if I say hi to my mom?
Hi, Mom.
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.
You don't know it, but you're coming right along
Please be strong
You don't know it, but you're coming right along
Hey, you!
Stop!
You can't go in there!
Stop!
What do you want?
You realize what time it is?
Yeah.
Um... is Winkie and Blinkie here?
Who the hell are Winkie and Blinkie?
Hey, guys.
Lisa, Mel, you know this boy?
No, Daddy.
Come on.
All right.
Come on.
Get out of here.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Rubin.
He got past me.
- Don't let it happen again.
It won't happen again.
Get out of here!
What?
What?
Asshole.
Hey, fuck-up, get fucking up, man!
- What's your problem, man?
- What's YOUR problem, man?
You sold my girlfriend some shit the other day.
You almost killed her.
What was it... rat poison?
It's not my fault your girl can't handle her drugs.
I want my fucking $20 back, man.
Look, there's no money-back guarantees.
I'm not selling refrigerators here.
Oh, yeah?
I'll cut you a dynamite deal on mexican shit.
Give me my $20, or we'll go outside.
If we go outside, one of us is going to get hurt.
I told you one of us would get hurt.
Is that right?
It's been hard...
the writing...
lately.
Terrible numbness, then suddenly it comes... in beautiful fragments or terrible dreams... like nods... so high.
Uh!
Reggie, is that you?
Who the fuck do you think it is?
Ohh...
Don't worry, you're not dead yet.
It's not bad.
Hey, give me that.
How come it's all wet?
I didn't say you could read this.
What, have you been digging through all my stuff?
I need...
I got to get out of here.
Where's my jacket?
You're welcome.
What the hell am I thanking you for?
Because you was frozen in the snow like a goddamn creamsicle.
Where is it?
What?
You know what the fuck I'm talking about, Reggie!
Where is it?
You mean this?
Huh?
Give it to me.
I'll cut your fucking throat, Reggie!
Give it to me, all right?
Just give it to me!
Oh, give it to me!
Give it to me!
I'm serious!
Give me it!
Give it to me!
Goddamn it!
I'll make you an incredible offer.
I'm going to save your life twice in one day, understand me?
You should have left me in the fucking snow, man.
Give me the money for my dope, too.
I'm not gonna suck your dick, all right?
Put that away.
Who the hell wants you to suck their dick?
Goddamn it!
Look at yourself!
Just look at yourself.
Oh, Reggie... it's okay.
Why are you doing this?
Because once upon a time, somebody helped me, and I always pay what I owe.
Reggie.
Reggie, I just need a taste.
I just need a little something, Reggie.
You don't understand.
It hurts, Reggie!
Ow!
Reggie, I got to go.
I got to go see my mom.
You got to let me get out of here, Reggie.
Reggie!
It hur...
It hurts.
Aah!
Shit!
Oh, boy...
Touch the taste and taste the smell
Smell the scent, all the gifts you gave to me, baby
The food of your brain
The room is spinning round
I never come down
The room is spinning round
I never come down...
Reggie.
you got to give me it.
You got to give me it, Reggie.
Please!
Oh!
Reggie, come on!
I remember you, too
I blew my mind
Wake up.
Can't sleep all day.
Oh.
Thanks.
Jesus Christ.
What happened to you?
What does it look like?
Motherfucker shot me.
Woke my black ass up.
Shit.
Look, uh...
I'll be back in the morning, Jim.
You just stay cool.
You start to get panicky, write about me in that book of yours.
Actually, I was a little hurt I wasn't mentioned.
You really like my writing, huh, Reggie?
Damn, man, I told you four times already.
What do you want me to do?
Bend over and kiss your ass?
Hey, Reg, do me a favor.
While you're out, pick me up a bag.
The room is spinning round
I may never come down
I am alone.
Not just me.
We're alone... alone forever.
And who's at the end of that forever tunnel I run through, up Fifth with the wallpaper of skyscrapers?
I'm thinking, after all those beautiful trips, that this is one of those bad ones.
Diane?
Hey!
Jim.
Remember me?
Man, you look great.
Yeah, thanks.
Good to see somebody from the old neighborhood...
What do you want, Jim?
- You holding anything?
- No.
Just like a 5 or something?
Just to tide me over, you know?
Please, Diane?
Come on.
Yeah.
For an old friend?
Why not?
I've been looking all over for this.
Oh, you know what?
I only got a 20.
A 20 is good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
A 20 is great, yeah.
That would help me out a lot.
- You want a 20?
- Yeah.
Why don't you go buy yourself some pretzels, you asshole.
You bitch!
You're nothing but a whore!
I don't give a shit about your clothes!
You're still a whore to me!
Yeah?
Shut up.
Look at you.
Oh, are you desperate now, baby?
Who's a whore now?
Don't talk to me like that, you bitch!
Ha ha.
Who's laughing, stupid?
Don't play a game with me!
I know you!
Ah!
Shit.
Oh, man.
Shit.
Ha ha ha!
Mickey.
Mick, what's up, man?
Hey, what's up, man?
Did you get anything?
No, not a dime.
You score?
Yeah, I got something.
What'd you get?
About 35 bucks.
35?
Where'd you get it?
I robbed some fucking asshole on the "D" train.
Dude, 35 will keep us on for, like, two days.
Well, could we get some stuff, man?
I'm fucking... my head is...
I see some spics.
I think we can score.
You wanna check it out?
- Yeah, alright.
- Come on.
They're over here.
Why the fuck do we have to cop on the street all the time?
My fucking nuts are itching like crazy.
Think this is him?
Is your name Pino?
Listen... could we get us some dope?
The dude over there said you could help.
You want to cop some shit?
Let me see some cash.
I got it here.
Let me see.
Hey, no money without no taste.
You want a taste?
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Hurry, man.
Come on.
There's fucking cops all over.
That's good, man.
That's good.
All right, listen...
4 for 35.
4 for 35, man?
Come on, man.
$5.00 short.
What's the big deal?
Ta bien, chico...
Toma, toma.
- You got four?
- Yeah.
We should taste this.
Where are we going to cook it up?
I don't know about his guy.
No, he's cool.
Fuck, man!
What's the matter?
- Just taste it!
Come on.
- What do you mean?
I tasted it.
He beat us.
He fucking beat us.
I swear to fucking God...
Put that away!
I'm gonna kill this mother...!
- Come here, motherfucker!
- Put it away!
I'm going to fucking kill you, you motherfucker!
Motherfucker, you're fucking dead, you hear me?
Dude, don't make me do it.
Where's the money?
I want the money.
I want the money and the bags.
Where's the fucking money?
The fucking money!
I want it!
Aah!
No!
-Oh, shit!
- We fucking killed him!
What the fuck do you mean, we?
I didn't fucking touch him!
Don't put that shit on me!
He beat us, man!
He deserved it!
You went too far, Mickey!
Oh, shit!
Is he dead?
Of course he's fucking dead!
He fell six stories!
Jim, come on.
Come on!
Will you come one?
Jim, don't make me leave you here!
Oh, shit.
Star
I'll reach you if I try
Show me the truth, yeah
Star
I'll reach you if I try
Show me the truth, yeah
Come on, get back up!
Come on!
Get off of me!
What are you doing?
Who is it?
Ma...
let me in.
Ma, let me in!
Please, Ma.
Ma?
Hey, Ma?
Are you in there, Ma?
Ma, is that you?
Yeah.
Ma?
Ma?
- Are you there?
- Yeah.
Hi.
Hi, Ma.
Hi.
Hi.
Listen, I need you to help me out, all right?
I need you to give me some money.
Okay?
I need you to give me, like, five doll...
Like, $20, something like that because I'm in some trouble.
Ma?
Do you hear me, Ma?
Yeah, I hear you.
I can't help you.
Okay, listen, what you got to do is give me some money, okay?
Jim, I can't do that.
Why not?
Mom, you know I'm not going to do anything with it.
I just need to go out of town for a little while 'cause I got into some trouble, and I need some help.
Okay?
So, you got to give me some money, Mom.
Can you hold my hand?
Yeah, I'll hold your hand.
Mom, can you give me some money, please?
Mom, can you give me some money, please?
Stop fucking around!
I can't.
Mom, give me some fucking money, please!
What are you doing?
I'm your son!
I don't have any.
Mom, don't fuck around like this!
Give me some money!
Mom!
Come on!
Let me in the fucking door!
Oh, God.
Oh, fuck.
Let me in.
I need some money.
I need some money real bad.
Ohh...
Oh, God.
Someone's breaking into my apartment.
They have a knife.
Oh!
Mom!
You don't understand, Mom.
You don't know what you're fucking doing to me.
Mom, I'm in pain.
How could you do this to your son, you bitch?
You fucking bitch!
Ah!
Oh, let me in!
I'll do anything!
I'll be a good boy!
I'll be a good boy, mom, if you let me in.
Get off me!
Get off!
No!
No!
You fuckers!
You're not going to do this!
Fuck you!
Ma!
Don't do this!
Ma!
Ma!
Ma!
I got six months in Riker's Island for assault, robbery, resisting arrest, and possession of narcotics.
I sweated out a horrible cure and stayed clean the whole stretch even though it's been easier to get good junk in here than it is on the street.
Shit, it's been hard, man.
All I've been doing is reading these diaries and wondering how the hell I'm still alive, and even if I care.
Suffice to say that I'm finished with the asshole bandits of shower-room rape, and suffice to say that those swine guards won't draw blood from my ankles again.
Suffice to say that I've been just thinking about dumb stuff like what a nice concept it is to have a godmother and a godfather, wondering who my godparents might be.
My mom won't visit me here, so I guess I'll just have to wait till I get home to ask.
Jim?
Who's there?
It's me.
Pedro?
What's up, man?
Nothing.
You know.
I...
I hear you come here.
I just came by to say hi.
I'm sorry about that night at the candy store and everything.
It's all right.
Reform school turned out to be real cool, so don't sweat it.
Did you hear about Mickey, that scumbag?
He went and threw some chump off a roof.
He's getting 5 to 15 years, man.
They tried him like an adult.
Shit.
I got a present for you, Jim.
A bag of the finest dope in Manhattan.
You know, me and you?
Like old times?
I can't.
Come on.
It would be dynamite.
I got this thing to do.
Why don't you come check it out?
No.
I'm going to go, then, you know?
You know how it is.
Take care of yourself, little man.
Know this.
There's different types of users of junk.
You got your rich dilettante square-ass who dabbles now and then and always has enough money to run off to the Riviera if he feels he's fucking around to the danger point.
Street junkies hate these pricks, but they're always suckers, and their money makes them tolerable.
Then you got your upper-middle-class
Westchester preppies... same as the others, basically.
What they're good for is opening their mommy and daddy's eyes to this social virus and putting pressure on the government to do something about it.
Then there's us street kids.
Start fucking around very young,
13 or so...
We think we all got it under control and won't get strung out.
This rarely works.
I'm living proof.
But in the end, you just got to see the junk as another 9-to-5 gig.
The hours are just a bit more inclined to shadows.
Go fuck yourself, you son of a bitch.
Bastard!
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
Hallowed be thy name.
Thy Kingdom come.
Thy will be done, you fuck!
Give us this day our daily bread, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Jesus, Jesus the Nazarene.
Jesus, the Nazarene.
Go to hell.
Go to hell.
Go to hell.
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Jim, you're not going to waste the whole day lying around, are you?
Ma, I'm up.
The loony alarm went off.
Well, close the blinds.
Don't look at her and don't listen to her.
How could I not?
Jesus the Nazarene.
Mary the whore.
Mary the hairdresser.
Mary the hairdresser.
Our Father, Who art...
Hey, lady!
Shut up!
When I was young, about 8 or so,
I tried making friends with God... by inviting him to my house to watch the World Series.
He never showed.
Too bad, Father.
I was just starting to enjoy myself.
We can do it again tomorrow if you like, Mr. Carroll.
You okay, Jim?
Does it hurt?
You want to rub it for him, Pedro?
Jim, give it a rest.
You'll never beat him.
The guy's a pervert.
Did you hear him?
"We can do it again tomorrow if you like, Mr. Carroll."
Let's cut out of here.
Come on.
I was born in a pool
They made my mother stand
I spat on that surgeon
And his trembling hand
When I felt the light
I was worse than bored
I stole a doctor's scalpel
And I slit the cord
I was a Catholic boy
I was redeemed through pain
Not through joy
I was two months early
They put me under glass
I screamed and cursed their children
When the nurses passed
I was convicted of theft
As I slid from the womb
They led me straight from my mother
To a cell in the tombs
I was a Catholic boy
Redeemed through pain
Not through joy
They starved me for weeks
They thought they'd teach me fear
I fed on cellmates' dreams
It gave me fine ideas
When they cut me loose
The time had served me well
I'd made allies in heaven
Comrades in hell
I was a Catholic child
The blood ran red
The blood ran wild
Why, you little prick!
This is my new...
Shit, guys, gotta get outta here.
I threw up on somebody.
I'll get ya!
You little prick!
I'll fucking throw you in the fucking river if i catch ya...
Hey!
What about the four of us versus Wilt Chamberlain?
He was the greatest of all time.
Four of us?
What are you gonna do, Pedro?
tie his shoes together when he ain't looking?
All right...
How'bout the three versus Wilt Chamberlain?
No problem.
You're kidding, right, Mickey?
No.
He can't cover all of us at the same time.
You guys don't miss open jumpers.
And you know who will be there for the rebounds.
Rebounds?
That freak is, like, 7 feet tall.
Jim, I can rebound with anybody.
You're sniffing too much of that shit, that's what you're doing.
Chamberlain would destroy all of us.
End of story.
Alright.
All we got to do is move the ball around.
- There's no way we don't win.
- Will you tell this kid?
Hey, Mickey, I think you could beat him yourself.
I don't think you need us.
Perfect example... confidence.
I know I could beat him.
Holy shit!
Look at this place.
I tell you what, if our school was this nice,
I'd go more than once a week.
You?
We got a game today, gentlemen.
Who's ready to play some roundball?
I said, who's ready to play some ball?
You give me that laid-back,
"I'm doing my own thing, Jack" attitude out there today, and you're going to find yourself watching the game from the bench.
No smoking, Iggy...
stunts your growth.
You want to be big and strong like me, don't you?
Out.
No smoking, and no pulling your peckers before a game.
Swifty, do you mind?
I'm taking a dump.
Get outta here!
Something die in there?
When we play our game so Pedro vomits on his head, right?
It goes all over his hair, trickles down his neck.
Some gets in his eye.
He went nuts...
Don't lie about it, either.
What are you doing?
We're signing a ball for Bobby.
Can I sign?
Yeah.
"We're holding your spot for you, kid.
Swifty."
All right.
This one's for Bobby.
All right.
Who's better than we are?
Nobody!
Alright!
Go ahead.
Do some warm-ups.
Pedro, you're in charge.
You're my eyes and ears.
- Hey, Jim?
- Yeah?
That's a nice thing you're doing for Bobby.
Oh, thanks.
Thanks.
You seen Neutron?
I think he's talking to a scout from Saint John's, as a matter of fact, upstairs.
You want to play college ball, don't you?
Yeah.
Someday, I hope.
You know.
Yeah.
Scouts are sniffing you out already.
They like them young.
I'll tell you what.
You come by sometime, and we'll go over the schools together.
Yeah.
All right.
Yeah.
We'll get a pizza, and we'll make a night of it.
Um... actually, my nights are kind of busy right now.
Yeah.
Homework and all, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
We were the hottest Catholic high school team in New York City, on our way to the championship.
We felt like nothing could stop us.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yes!
We're on our way.
We're on our way.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Hands up.
Show me some defense.
Show me some defense.
Good steal.
Put it in.
Put it in.
Yeah!
All right.
All right.
Way to go.
Aw, geez.
All right, Neutron.
Yes!
Yes!
To the hole, Jim.
Whoa!
Whoa!
What's going on?
Break it up!
Come on.
Hit him!
Beat that motherfucker!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- He fucking held me!
This dude blows the whistle...
Slow it down!
Slow it down!
You got to have presence on the court... presence like a cheetah rather than a chimp.
They both got it, but chimpy got to jump his nuts around all day to get it.
Shy cheetah just moves in total nonchalance a sec or two in his sexy, slow strut.
Me, I play like a cheetah.
Let's go, Rangers... let's go!
Let's go, Rangers, let's go!
Yeah!
Ooh!
You got it!
It's ours.
It's ours.
Oh!
Yeah!
9, 8, 7,
6, 5,
4, 3,
2, 1!
Yay, Jim!
Oh, shit.
That's my team!
That's my team!
There's only two things Swifty forbids... using the word "motherfucker"
and stealing from the other team, as long as they're white.
How much for that group of winners over there?
It's $34.90.
$34.90?
Changed the prices or something?
No.
Uh...
I'm a little short.
Do me a favor.
Here.
Take my watch, and I'll come back later with the rest of the money.
No.
What do you mean, no?
I'm sorry, sir.
Those burgers are worth more than the watch is.
I'll be right back.
I told you one burger each, didn't I?
It takes at least eight of these to get filled up.
Yeah.
C'mon, Swifty.
We're growing boys.
Growing boys?
We're hungry motherfuckers.
Funny, huh?
I'm not driving you guys home.
How's that for laughs?
You ripped them off, didn't you?
We're even now.
Swifty, come on.
How are we going to get home?
Face the music, pricks.
What are we going to do?
They got the door blocked off.
You afraid of these pussies?
I ain't afraid of anybody.
What's the problem?
I'm going to ask you this once.
All right?
Where's the stuff you stole from me?
What are you talking about?
No, no, no.
You're not going to fuck with me, all right?
Now, somebody stole my father's ring from my locker, motherfucker.
You want me to cut you?
Is that what you want, there?
There's no problem here.
Hey, guys!
Let's get out of here, c'mon!
You need a fucking army, huh?
Come on!
Come on!
Oh.
Nice.
That from Bobo?
Ha ha ha!
That's his father's ring.
Hey, fellas.
Any of you looking for a date?
Yeah.
Me, sweetheart.
Little horsy ride in Central Park, maybe candlelight dinner?
Why don't we skip right to dessert, huh, baby?
About $15?
Fifteen bucks?
I'll give you a quarter.
Let Pedro suck your tits.
You don't have to be rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
How about you, handsome, huh?
You got $15... for a little head?
Diane, do I look like I need to pay for it?
Yeah... you do.
If it's worth it.
Jimmy...
Jimmy, I know you want some, honey.
$15.
I'll do you so good you'll never forget it, baby.
Hey, hey!
Ooh!
That's a deal.
Bargain from there.
What do you say, guys?
You want to do it?
All four of us?
- Yeah.
- It's a deal.
All four of us.
Aw, shit.
This is all I got, Diane.
Here, have a pretzel.
- Get out of here.
- Beat it.
Yeah, fuck you!
Fucking dopehead.
You see what that shit does to you?
Wow.
Speaking of dopeheads, is that Pedro's mother over there slinging her wares again?
It is!
Hey, Peepee, where you going?
Why do you have to be such an asshole all the time, huh?
Why is the little shoe crying anyway?
His mother's a sneaker.
His father's a loafer.
Somebody's got to be a heel.
Jim, where you going?
Hey, Jim!
Jim.
Hey.
Hey, man.
What's up?
You don't recognize me with my new hairdo?
It's nice.
It's nice.
I like it.
What's going on?
- How are you?
- Good.
Wow.
Look at that.
You like it?
Yeah, I'll tell you what.
When you get out of here, we'll all shave our heads and look like a gang of skinheads.
It's a deal.
All right.
I got something for you here.
Yeah.
Everyone on the team.
Look right here...
even Swifty signed it.
Thanks, man.
You remember when I dunked on that spade in Riverside Park?
You always had good ups.
Yeah.
Oh.
I got something to show you.
Hold on.
What?
Pedro got these out of some lady's purse.
- She's doing it with a donkey.
- Oh, Jesus!
Look at that schlong.
Look at that one.
Oh, I beat your record.
How many times you choke it?
Seven times.
Bullshit.
Seven times.
My mom thinks I have a cold year-round because of all the tissues around the house.
You can keep those if you want.
They're pumping so much junk in me,
I can't even get a decent chubby.
I got an idea.
Come on.
Let's go.
Where we going?
I'm getting you out of this place, man.
C'mon!
What are you, crazy, man?
I can't go anywhere.
Here you go.
I've known Bobby since I was 3.
He's my best friend.
He was the best player on our basketball team.
Two years ago, he got leukemia.
He keeps fighting it off.
I know Bobby's going to beat it.
He could beat anything.
Watch!
Jim, you're going to kill me, man.
If you let go, I swear...
I swear I'll kill you, man.
Watch the bump!
What the hell happened to forty deuce?
Last time I was here, that theater was playing Sperminator II.
Oh, yeah.
I remember that.
No, man.
This whole block has been done over by all these new artists.
It's pretty cool, huh?
Yeah.
They should put your stuff up there.
Yeah.
Right.
Still scribbling stuff in that notebook of yours, ain't you?
Of course.
You bring anything for me?
What, like to read?
No, like to eat.
What do you think?
Yeah.
I mean, I got this, but it's not a big deal.
I don't even remember writing it, to tell you the truth.
Yeah, Yeah.
I'll be the judge of this.
"Little kids shoot marbles
"where branches break the sun
"into graceful shafts of light.
I just want to be pure."
I just want to be pure.
All right.
What a life
Nothing like the real thing to float your boat, huh, Bobby?
What a life
Didn't know where, didn't know when...
That's nice.
Said that I'll go...
go learn
Put up my hand, wait my turn
But it never comes, I have to shout out
That's life
And that's what it's all about
So through the comfort and the strife
What a life...
Get me out of here, Jim.
What are you talking about, man?
This was a stupid idea.
I don't feel so good.
Well, can we wait till the end of the show?
Did you hear what I said?
I said get me the hell out of here!
Hey, Bob, man...
I'm really sorry, you know?
Next time, we'll go somewhere...
Ain't gonna be no next time, Jim.
I love it this way... my feet against the tar, which is soft from the spring heat, the slight breeze that runs across your entire body,
especially your crotch.
You feel an incredible power being naked under a dome of stars while a giant city is dressed, dodging cars all around you five flights down.
I don't think of anything while I'm doing the actual tugging, least of all the heavy sex fantasies I have to resort to indoors.
Just my own naked self and the stars breathing down, and it's beautiful.
Time sure flies when you're young and jerking off.
"Camp summer position.
Driver... taxi."
Hey, that might be good.
You could get your license this summer.
Oh, yeah, Mom.
That sounds really great.
Hey, get your own job, and if you don't get it this summer, you're coming to work with me at the hotel.
Mom, please.
Why are you so worried about this?
Do I even ask you for money?
No.
I'm not worried about the money.
I want you to have responsibility.
I don't want you running around the streets of New York.
Idle time is the devil's plaything, Jim.
The devil's plaything, huh?
Mm-hmm.
That might be a cool title for my first book.
Thanks!
What are you talking about?
What are you writing?
Here.
Ooh.
Um...
Ma, I'm not really that hungry this morning, alright?
- Come on.
You got to eat something.
- I know...
Where you going?
I'm going to shoot some hoops.
Sometimes I feel like something's chasing me, like there's some whacko on a roof somewhere who could snuff me out at any moment.
And I feel this horrible fear.
Will I have time to finish... the poems breaking loose in my head?
Hey, white boy, you ready for your beating?
Don't let your mouth get you into something your ass can't handle.
I'll shoot you for it.
So it's going to be like that, huh?
I... don't think so.
Yeah!
All right, so you made one.
Big deal.
You made one shot.
Make another.
The days are muzzled in a vibe
I swing back from time to time
There's a Camaro, rusty red
That all my best friends drive in
Can you smell the summer air?
Take me where they left the light on
Getting close, almost there
If that fuzzy silver badge
Don't greet us there
My head's dizzy, and I'm taking...
Yo, Jim!
What's the score?
Come on.
We got to go.
They don't keep score in this game.
Jim, come on.
We're losing the sun.
He's being a dick.
You want me to put a charge in his ass?
Whatch this.
Oh, look it, right here...
Jim's secret diary he's always writing in.
Bet you he wrote some shit about me.
Oh, right here.
"Spring...
Mickey."
Hey, there I am, Jim says.
"Mickey takes out a bottle of carbonic cleaning fluid and suggests we do a little sniffing to get high."
Whoo!
"After four deep whiffs, we're sailing someplace else."
Mickey, what are you doing?
"Bells ringing through my ears, little lights flashing through my eyes."
Mickey, put that down, all right?
"I pictured myself
"paddling across a river with black water,
"only the canoe was going backwards instead of forwards,
"with clouds that had faces.
Laughing, spooky, fun-house laughs..."
- Give it back, alright?
- What is that shit?
Why do you have to be such a schmuck, Mickey?
What are you talking about?
Don't you ever touch that again.
It's private.
What's your problem?
I'm...
I'm sorry.
He's writing about me, I can't read about it?
Jesus!
Hey, Jim, come on.
We're gone.
Yo, we got a cab!
Hey, cabby!
Hey, swami!
So, Shakespeare, you going to finish the game?
C'mon, Reggie, you know this game never ends.
See you later, all right?
Every crowd has its little games to prove if you're a punk or not.
My cousin in Jersey plays chickie, which is two cars heading towards each other at about 80 miles per hour.
First driver to swerve out of the way is, of course, chicken.
In Brooklyn, they make you press a lit cigarette into your arm and have it burn all the way down to the filter
without the slightest flinch.
Us, Manhattan boys, we jump off cliffs into the Harlem River, which is literally shitty, because half a million toilets flush into it every day.
Whoo-oo!
Yeah!
Oooh!
Yeah!
Hey, y'all, I carried the clothes up, but I ain't carrying them down.
Peepee, this is you... all 33 pounds of you, gone with the wind.
Wow.
That's a long way down.
Devil's toe is no big deal.
We've all done it a million times.
I never done it.
You never did it?
Pedro, you never do nothing.
You know who was awesome on this rock?
Bobby.
That kids would do back flips off this rock.
Hey, Mickey.
What?
Don't talk about him like he's dead.
He's not dead.
There goes the circle line.
Check it out.
Whoo!
Full moon!
Whoo!
Hey, yo!
Whoo!
Hey, circle this!
Hey, I'm going.
Watch out, watch out...
I'm going to show you how to do it.
Ye-ea-ah!
That was a good jump.
Oh, he's nuts.
Hey, I'm going to walk down.
What you talking about?
You can't walk down.
There's no way to walk down.
I ain't jumping.
Pedro, your clothes are down there.
How you gonna get your clothes?
You going to walk around naked all day?
Pedro, if you don't jump, Mickey's going to tease you so bad...
You might as well just jump and get it over with.
Feel better.
What the hell, right?
Oh... shit...
Pedro!
Bad form.
Bad form.
Oh...
My God!
Oh, shit.
Is he all right?
Pedro, you all right?
You ready?
Yeah.
Listen, don't tell the other guys, but when we leave here, I got a surprise for you.
Tell me what it is.
It's a surprise.
Trust me, all right?
Ouch, don't mess around, man...
Alright, you ready?
Come on!
You ready?
- Let's jump.
- On three.
Ready?
Uh-huh.
1, 2,
3.
Come on.
Let's go.
What's up, Manny?
How you doing?
Fine.
Thank you, sir.
This is my friend Jim.
How you doing?
I can't believe I hit my head on that rock.
It's killing me.
Jim, um, this is Winkie.
- Hi.
- How you doing?
Good.
And this... this is Blinkie.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I lost my heart
Under the bridge
That little girl...
I've seen you play ball, Jim.
You're a very beautiful player.
Very zen.
And now I moan
And now I holler
She'll never know
Just what I found
That blue-eyed girl
It'll make you fuck like Superman.
She said no more
Faster than a speeding bullet...
Became blue-eyed whore...
More powerful than a locomotive...
Down by the water
Down by the water...
Able to, um...
I can't think of anything with a single bound.
See her again
See her again...
Do you have any protection?
Yeah.
This one's, uh, ribbed for extra pleasure.
So what are you waiting for?
What do you mean?
Take off your clothes.
Well, uh... could we shut off the lights first?
Little fish, big fish
Swimming in the water
Come back here, man
Give me my daughter
Little fish, big fish
Swimming in the water
White ship disappears in the wave machine this morning.
Your eyes got shut with secret chains that pillow armies eventually set free... like soft horses through toy deserts.
I love this mansion, though it's too many windows... to open halfway each morning... to close halfway each night.
I looked at his body, and it was death for the first time.
His face was thin and wrinkled, almost apelike.
His hair, just gray patches on his scalp.
He looked 60 years old, and he was 16.
Couldn't believe how skinny he was... much skinnier than he was in the hospital.
It was like having the skeleton of someone you knew put right in front of you.
I felt dazed, like I'd just come out of a four-hour movie I didn't understand.
I kept thinking about his face... and death... what a cheat the whole thing was.
Hey, you guys remember that Halloween when Bobby filled that paper bag with dog shit, lit it on fire and put it outside Father Dunne's door, and we all hid behind the dumpster?
Yeah.
I could picture Father Dunne comming outside, stepping on that shit.
Picture him in the john... scraping the shit off his shoe like this.
You think that'll keep him out of heaven?
Are you kidding?
Jesus Christ himself would have laughed at that.
It was hilarious!
What about the time at the formal when Bobby got caught in the bathroom with Mary Ann Dugan and McNulty came in and busted him?
He was, like, "Father, I swear.
We weren't doing anything."
Meanwhile she's got a giant wad of cum hanging off her face.
I tell you, that kid was definitely a pisser.
It was weird seeing him today, man.
He was all shriveled up and wrinkled.
He looked like my grandfather.
I'll tell you what, though.
That kid was in so much pain,
it's better off he died.
How the hell would you know, Mickey?
Did you go and visit him?
Huh?
Any of you guys go and visit him?
All right.
Then shut the fuck up.
Hey, Jim.
Look at my brother's girlfriend in the park.
She's sitting there, eating a sandwich.
Next thing you know, she's shot in the head.
She's dead.
It's over.
What about little Teddy Rayhill?
Perfect example.
Remember that night he was up on the roof, and he was doing poppers, having a great time, laughing his ass off
He started walking backwards...
Boom!
He fell right off the goddamn roof.
It was meant to be, right?
Fuck that, you guys!
Bobby was the best fucking guy around, you know that?
What are you, a bunch of idiots?
You don't even understand, do you?
Jim, you all right?
Huh?
Listen, maybe you should talk to one of the priests.
I don't know.
Maybe...
Maybe they can help you out.
Help me out?
I wouldn't ask one of those cocksuckers for directions.
You know what?
You guys need to lighten the fuck up, all right?
Let bygones be fucking bygones.
Shitty fucking world.
Live life to the fucking fullest.
You know what I mean?
Shit happens, man.
Shit fucking happens.
Come on.
Let's go.
Jim, come on.
You're growing up, and rain sort of remains on the branches of a tree
that will someday rule the earth.
And that's good that there's rain.
Clears the month of your sorry rainbow expressions.
And it clears the streets of the silent armies so we can dance.
Ted sniffing glue He was 12 years old
Fell from the roof on east 2-9
Cathy was 11 when she pulled the plug 26 reds and a bottle of wine
Bobby had leukemia, 14 years old
He looked like 65 when he died
He was a friend of mine
Those are people who died, died
Those are people who died, died
Those are people who died, died
Those are people who died, died
They were all my friends
They just died
Those are people who died, died
Those are people who died, died
Those are people who died, died
Those are people who died, died
They were all my friends and they died
Did I ever tell you about the first time I did heroin?
I went down to Pedro's basement.
All sorts of characters were in the storage-room shooting gallery.
I was just going to sniff a bag, but a guy says,
"If you're going to sniff, might as well pop it, and if you're going to pop it, might as well mainline."
I was scared of needles,
but I gave in.
It was like a long heat wave through my body.
Any ache or pain or sadness or guilty feeling was completely flushed out.
Look, Ma, I'm not in the mood for your dime-store psychology, all right?
Could you just please leave me alone?
I got a little sick, all right?
We're not going to live like this, Jim.
We're not going to live like this.
I'm warning you!
I'm telling you.
Oh, God, Mom.
You're always warning me, aren't you?
Blah, blah, blah.
You're always in my fucking ear.
Blah, blah, blah.
You don't know anything.
What are you talking about?
Go clean toilets or whatever the hell it is you do.
When you're done, clean this one.
Don't talk like that!
What's the matter with you?
Gee whiz, Ma, you know... we got to have these heart-to-heart talks more often.
They're really good for us.
I don't know you.
I don't believe this is you, Jim.
Please, Jim.
I don't know who you are.
Yeah, I know.
I was such a good little boy, right... with such potential, wasn't that it?
Is that what you're going to say?
Oh, Jim.
What's happening?
Jim, what's happening?
First, it's a Saturday-night thing, and you feel cool, like a gangster or a rock star.
It's just something to kill the boredom, you know?
They call it a chippie, a small habit.
It feels so good, you start doing it on Tuesdays, then Thursdays.
Then it's got you.
Every wise-ass punk on the block says it won't happen to them,
but it does.
Go do it!
I ain't doing it.
I always do it!
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could you tell me the fastest way to the subway?
Yeah.
That's the "B" train.
Go to this corner and make a left.
It's right there.
What are you doing?
Let go!
Let go!
Let go of that!
Oh, my God!
What?
Oh!
- Help!
No!
No!
- What are you doing?
Let's go!
Come on!
I don't feel like going in today.
Father, is it all right if I don't go in today?
Why?
What are you scared of?
Nothing.
I just don't feel like it, that's all.
I imagine you have more to confess than anybody here.
Unburden yourself.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been about four months since my last confession.
Yes, my son?
Well, I don't know where to start, Father.
Have you taken the name of Jesus Christ in vain?
Yeah.
Yeah, I have.
Have you disrespected your mother and father?
Uh-huh.
Have you stolen or cheated your fellow man?
Yeah, but I'm not proud of it.
Have you had impure thoughts or engaged in impure deeds?
Oh, Father, you have no idea.
Is there something else that you want to tell me in your own words?
I've done all kinds of crazy shit.
Oh, excuse me, Father.
Fuck, I'm s...
Christ, I have a dirty mouth.
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry about that.
Will you just go on?
10 Hail Marys, five Our Fathers.
What do you mean?
And that's it?
That's my punishment?
You know something?
My friend Bobby, he was the best, and he's dead.
This sucks!
You know that?
This really sucks.
It's not fair, Father.
Your nose is running, your stomach cramps, your legs feel like they've played six straight games on top of each other, and the voice is always there in the back of your head...
"Just one more time.
then we'll stop."
Quick to the ball.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Good, Ignatius.
Good.
Good.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Right behind you.
Sir, all right if I use the bathroom, Coach?
Jim, you got a bladder like a woman.
Let's go.
Again.
There we go.
Right behind him.
Right behind him.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Two hands.
Jim?
I thought you were taking a piss.
Oh.
What are you doing in here every practice?
Have you been waiting for me, Jim?
Giving me some kind of a signal?
What are you talking about, Swifty?
Don't act surprised.
Do we understand each other?
It's not going to happen, Swifty.
Put the money away.
You want more?
Here.
Just let me do it.
Get the fuck out of my face!
Take it easy, Jim.
You can't blame me for trying.
I made a mistake, all right?
Let's just pretend it never happened.
Things will go back to exactly how they were before.
Okay?
Okay?
Here, keep the money.
Keep the money.
Just don't tell anybody, all right?
Good.
Tell anybody you want!
Nobody's going to believe a drughead like you, anyway.
You think we don't know what you've been doing?
Give me the fucking money and get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck...
Get the fuck out here!
Come on!
Get out of here!
And you want to stop.
You really do.
But it's like a dream.
You can't stop dreams.
They move in crazy pieces, any way they want to,
and suddenly, you're capable of anything.
Ha ha ha!
No!
Wake up, Mr. Carroll!
It's later than you think.
Oh.
All right!
- I need a lift.
- All right.
What do you got?
Three different pills.
Which are the ups?
I never asked.
I thought one of youse would know.
Oh, great.
We look like pharmacists?
I don't know what to take.
What do we take?
Let me see.
The blacks and the reds are the ups.
I think the pink ones are the ups.
Why?
'Cuz I associate pink with lightness, you know?
The black ones seem like they'd knock you on your ass.
They might be faded seconals.
No, they're not faded.
They'd be sticky.
They're not.
That's bullshit.
- Fuck your mother.
- My what?
All right!
Calm down.
Don't ever talk about my mother.
Don't ever hit me like that again.
Come on!
Alright!
Give me your hat.
We got a game to play, alright?
Just give me something.
Hi, Neutron.
Let me ask him.
Neutron, you know which ones are the ups?
I think you should put that shit away before Swifty comes in here.
Why you acting like such a square ass?
Screw you, Mickey.
Screw you, too, Tough guy.
Man.
I'm just going to take the black.
You sure?
Mm-hmm.
You got a better idea?
Nope.
Your guess is as good as mine, Jimbo.
It's on today. 50 rebounds.
Good.
Come on.
Let's go.
I'm your friend now, right?
What, I got to smack you again, c'mon!
Yeah, take your little rat with you.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, what's up?
Why are you acting like that?
You know what's wrong.
Used to be about getting high and playing basketball.
Now it's just about getting high with you.
You're blowing it, Jim.
Oh, come on.
I don't need to hear this from you, Neutron.
Yeah, you do, Jim!
Listen, no, Jim!
I'm really proud of you, man.
Everything's cool.
You look great.
I'll see you in the NBA.
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone
In fact we're all alone
Riders on the storm
There's a killer on the road
His brain is squirming like a toad
Take a long holiday
Let your children play
If you give this man a ride
Sweet family will die
Killer on the road
Yeah
Did you find it?
No, Father.
It's clean.
There's no drugs in there.
Thank you, Officer.
I told you we didn't have nothing.
You boys think you're awfully smart, don't you?
Well, you're both suspended for a week!
Ooh...
And you'll never play basketball here again.
That you can count on.
You can't kick me off the team, Swifty.
Oh?
Why is that?
'Cause I quit the team... and the school and this whole faggot-ass scene, that's why.
I could second that motion.
Your resignations are accepted!
Neutron, you coming with us?
Huh?
Yeah.
That's what I figured.
Come on, man.
I'm fucking out of here.
Don't worry, Swifty.
I'm not going to rat you out.
And in the next life, Father,
I'm going to have the paddle!
Get out!
Thanks a lot, Neutron.
Thanks, man.
I can't believe this, you know?
I know.
What happened to the pills?
We got kicked out of the school, Mickey.
Who cares, man?
We lost the pills.
The cops took them...
We can't play ball anymore.
Jim, who cares about school, man?
We just lost $40 worth of pharmaceuticals.
I know what happened to them, too.
The cops, they take that all the time.
They either pop them themselves or they sell them.
What's my mom going to say, man?
When I go home?
She ain't gonna say nothing.
You just tell her you're going to school every day in the morning.
Let's get out of here, man...
Go get into something.
You never sold any pills at the schoolyard?
No.
So it's all a big conspiracy against you.
Right, Jim?
Yeah.
Maybe it is.
Maybe it's not.
You been missing these?
What are you going to tell me...
they're vitamins?
Oh, fuck you, Ma.
What?
!
Get out of my house!
Oh, is that what you want, Ma?
Get out!
You don't talk to me that way!
If that's what you want, I'm fucking out of here.
All right?
What are you doing?
I'm leaving!
What do you think?
I want you to take all your shit!
I'll help you.
Here!
You want me to leave?
Yes.
Get out!
I'm out of here.
Get the fuck out of my way!
This garbage is going to kill you, Jim!
I'm gone!
Gonna to kill you!
Don't you understand?
I can't watch you kill yourself?
Ma, you're never going to fucking see me again, alright?
Just remember that.
Don't say that, Jim.
Don't say that!
It was a dream, not a nightmare... a beautiful dream I could never imagine
in a thousand nods.
I saw this girl next to me who wasn't beautiful until she smiled, and I felt that smile come at me and heat waves following, soaking through my body and out my fingertips
in shafts of color.
And I knew somewhere in the world... somewhere...
that there was love for me.
We just got to raise enough cash
to keep our heads straight.
Luckily, finding money in New York
is like getting laid at the prom... easy.
- Fuck it, Pedro!
- What's the matter with you?
Jesus!
Watch the road.
You could kill us all, c'mon!
I get 1,500 bucks for this car.
If it's whacked up, it's worth nothing.
We should buy shit in bulk, man
We'll put it on the street and make real money.
That's 500 bucks a piece.
We'll be on for days, nights, weeks.
Yeah, man.
I'd love to go to Puerto Rico, soak up some rays, you know?
See my bitch?
That's what I'd like to do.
- What are you talking about?
- What bitch?
We haven't seen a picture or nothing.
She's 500 pounds, Jim.
She got a mustache thicker than her father.
No.
That's your mother, Mickey.
She does not exist.
Don't fool yourself.
Be careful.
I'm about to whack.
Oh, shit, man.
My brother's going to take care of us and this car.
Pedro, wake the fuck up!
Pedro, come on, man!
You're going to get us killed, what are you doing?
I got it, man.
You want me to drive?
Mickey, you better drive the car.
I'm serious, man.
Just don't blow my high.
If there's a scratch in the car, my brother'll kill me.
Yo, get out of the booth!
Get out the booth, huh?
Get out.
Fucking...
What's up?
What's up?
Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Where's the car?
It's good to see you, too.
It's over here.
It's nice.
It's smokin'.
You tell me that?
It's everything you wanted.
Get your hands off.
You guys look like shit.
Oh, my God.
They're taking the car.
Show me the sign, man!
Show me the freaking sign!
It's right there.
You see?
It says "tow-away." Huh?
You scumbags even read?
I should kick all your punk asses!
Goddamn it!
I can get you another car tonight.
Yeah?
John Halligan is waiting for this car.
I got him out of bed with his wife.
You know how this makes me fucking look?
Kenny, get off.
You're too stupid to be my brother!
You're too stupid!
You want a piece of me, Carroll?
Back off!
Back off!
- Kenny, no more!
- Mr. Tough Guy.
- Kenny, no more!
- Huh?
Tough guy?
Give me a sip of your soda.
You wipe off the bottle before you take a sip?
You don't even think twice about sharing works with Mickey.
You think you'll catch something from the bottle you're not catch from a needle?
You mistake me for somebody who gives a shit.
Headquarters...
home on and off to every down-and-out junkie and wino from 14th Street to the Bowery.
It's like a fucking all-star team.
Jimmy, the other day, my mother's been ragging on me,
"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
"You've tried every other way.
Go to church.
Put yourself in Christ's hands."
So I do it, man.
I figure, give it a shot.
I dig Jesus.
So, I go, man.
High mass...
a choir and everything.
The first thing I see on the right, the side altar, are those little candles in the red glass that we used when it was windy in the park to cook up.
And then, this altar boy, he's coming down the aisle with this 6-foot candle.
I envision this huge spoon above it, man, with, like, shopping bags full of dope inside of it.
And then the kicker comes, man.
The priest, he starts doing the thing with the incense.
You know, starts wafting out.
I'm in the back.
It finally hits me.
"Where do I know this smell from, man?
My room, man."
It's the smell exactly of really primo dope cooking up.
Yeah?
Exactly the same.
So what happened next?
At that point, I split.
I went home,
I went inside my closet,
I got my stash out of the inside pocket of my sharkskin easter suit, and I got stoned.
Ba bing... ba bang.
I love a ritual.
Oh, Mary, if you can hear me...
I need you to fill Jim's heart with love
because he really needs it now.
Oh, God... please watch over my son.
He needs you now.
Just take care of him, okay?
I'll be okay.
I love you, Jim.
I love you.
Hey, you holding?
You straight, man?
Get out of here.
Come on.
No.
Hey, have you seen Falco?
Come on, man.
Are you holding anything?
Hey, Diane...
Come here, Diane.
- I'll take care of you, babe.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
How about some of this?
Ha ha!
I wouldn't do you for a bag, you fucking piece of shit.
Jim.
Jimmy.
You're looking good.
Who's your embalmer?
I want some of what you got.
Shh.
Check everything in this place.
Wow.
I always wanted to use these syrup pumps.
And these professional ice-cream scoopers.
Oh, my God.
Don't make me do it!
I'll do it!
I swear to God!
Jim, watch out.
Come on!
It's not opening.
They don't make them like this anymore.
You got to get it from the side.
I got it!
Oh, cool.
Change!
Shit!
Let's get out of here.
It's locked.
We got to go out the back.
Pedro, let's get out of here!
What am I, hallucinating here?
Pedro, you'll get us caught.
The cops are going to come.
Oh, you want to be tough, huh?
Go ahead... take another sip so I can blow your fucking head all over the counter!
Go ahead, Pedro!
Go ahead!
Come on, guys!
Let's go.
Put that gun away!
Don't fuck with me, motherfucker!
What the hell are you doing, Mickey?
What the hell did you do that for?
Let that little spic rot, man!
He'll get us caught.
Jim, the cops are coming.
Come on!
Jim!
Jim!
Pedro!
Pedro!
Jim!
Freeze!
Freeze!
On your stomach!
On your stomach!
I didn't do anything, I'm telling you!
This is it, man.
That Jew got to keep the money under his pillow.
Hey, Jim, I know you're still mad about Pedro.
I couldn't do nothing, man.
He was going to get us caught.
Definitely shouldn't have went that far.
What happened to you?
Your mother kick your ass?
Yeah, real funny.
Bring us a couple of Cokes, will you?
You all right?
Hey, bartender, move out of the way.
Jim, I'm getting sick.
I got to get some money to cop.
Jim.
You with me here?
What the hell are you wa...
Oh, shit.
That's Neutron.
That's the all-American high school game?
We could have played in that game.
Who gives a shit?
Come on.
I'm waiting to hear back on a scholarship from Saint John's...
I'm not sure about it, but hopefully it will work out.
Jim, I'm starting to jones.
Gotta get out there.
We need some money.
Jim, don't dwell on these dreams, man.
Will you come on?
Meet you outside, man.
I'm getting sick.
You want to meet me out there?
Is it okay if I say hi to my mom?
Hi, Mom.
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.
You don't know it, but you're coming right along
Please be strong
You don't know it, but you're coming right along
Hey, you!
Stop!
You can't go in there!
Stop!
What do you want?
You realize what time it is?
Yeah.
Um... is Winkie and Blinkie here?
Who the hell are Winkie and Blinkie?
Hey, guys.
Lisa, Mel, you know this boy?
No, Daddy.
Come on.
All right.
Come on.
Get out of here.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Rubin.
He got past me.
- Don't let it happen again.
It won't happen again.
Get out of here!
What?
What?
Asshole.
Hey, fuck-up, get fucking up, man!
- What's your problem, man?
- What's YOUR problem, man?
You sold my girlfriend some shit the other day.
You almost killed her.
What was it... rat poison?
It's not my fault your girl can't handle her drugs.
I want my fucking $20 back, man.
Look, there's no money-back guarantees.
I'm not selling refrigerators here.
Oh, yeah?
I'll cut you a dynamite deal on mexican shit.
Give me my $20, or we'll go outside.
If we go outside, one of us is going to get hurt.
I told you one of us would get hurt.
Is that right?
It's been hard...
the writing...
lately.
Terrible numbness, then suddenly it comes... in beautiful fragments or terrible dreams... like nods... so high.
Uh!
Reggie, is that you?
Who the fuck do you think it is?
Ohh...
Don't worry,
you're not dead yet.
It's not bad.
Hey, give me that.
How come it's all wet?
I didn't say you could read this.
What, have you been digging through all my stuff?
I need...
I got to get out of here.
Where's my jacket?
You're welcome.
What the hell am I thanking you for?
Because you was frozen in the snow like a goddamn creamsicle.
Where is it?
What?
You know what the fuck I'm talking about, Reggie!
Where is it?
You mean this?
Huh?
Give it to me.
I'll cut your fucking throat, Reggie!
Give it to me, all right?
Just give it to me!
Oh, give it to me!
Give it to me!
I'm serious!
Give me it!
Give it to me!
Goddamn it!
I'll make you an incredible offer.
I'm going to save your life twice in one day, understand me?
You should have left me in the fucking snow, man.
Give me the money for my dope, too.
I'm not gonna suck your dick, all right?
Put that away.
Who the hell wants you to suck their dick?
Goddamn it!
Look at yourself!
Just look at yourself.
Oh, Reggie... it's okay.
Why are you doing this?
Because once upon a time, somebody helped me, and I always pay what I owe.
Reggie.
Reggie, I just need a taste.
I just need a little something, Reggie.
You don't understand.
It hurts, Reggie!
Ow!
Reggie, I got to go.
I got to go see my mom.
You got to let me get out of here, Reggie.
Reggie!
It hur...
It hurts.
Aah!
Shit!
Oh, boy...
Touch the taste and taste the smell
Smell the scent, all the gifts you gave to me, baby
The food of your brain
The room is spinning round
I never come down
The room is spinning round
I never come down...
Reggie.
you got to give me it.
You got to give me it, Reggie.
Please!
Oh!
Reggie, come on!
I remember you, too
I blew my mind
Wake up.
Can't sleep all day.
Oh.
Thanks.
Jesus Christ.
What happened to you?
What does it look like?
Motherfucker shot me.
Woke my black ass up.
Shit.
Look, uh...
I'll be back in the morning, Jim.
You just stay cool.
You start to get panicky, write about me in that book of yours.
Actually, I was a little hurt I wasn't mentioned.
You really like my writing, huh, Reggie?
Damn, man, I told you four times already.
What do you want me to do?
Bend over and kiss your ass?
Hey, Reg, do me a favor.
While you're out, pick me up a bag.
The room is spinning round
I may never come down
I am alone.
Not just me.
We're alone... alone forever.
And who's at the end of that forever tunnel I run through, up Fifth with the wallpaper of skyscrapers?
I'm thinking, after all those beautiful trips, that this is one of those bad ones.
Diane?
Hey!
Jim.
Remember me?
Man, you look great.
Yeah, thanks.
Good to see somebody from the old neighborhood...
What do you want, Jim?
- You holding anything?
- No.
Just like a 5 or something?
Just to tide me over, you know?
Please, Diane?
Come on.
Yeah.
For an old friend?
Why not?
I've been looking all over for this.
Oh, you know what?
I only got a 20.
A 20 is good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
A 20 is great, yeah.
That would help me out a lot.
- You want a 20?
- Yeah.
Why don't you go buy yourself some pretzels, you asshole.
You bitch!
You're nothing but a whore!
I don't give a shit about your clothes!
You're still a whore to me!
Yeah?
Shut up.
Look at you.
Oh, are you desperate now, baby?
Who's a whore now?
Don't talk to me like that, you bitch!
Ha ha.
Who's laughing, stupid?
Don't play a game with me!
I know you!
Ah!
Shit.
Oh, man.
Shit.
Ha ha ha!
Mickey.
Mick, what's up, man?
Hey, what's up, man?
Did you get anything?
No, not a dime.
You score?
Yeah, I got something.
What'd you get?
About 35 bucks.
35?
Where'd you get it?
I robbed some fucking asshole on the "D" train.
Dude, 35 will keep us on for, like, two days.
Well, could we get some stuff, man?
I'm fucking... my head is...
I see some spics.
I think we can score.
You wanna check it out?
- Yeah, alright.
- Come on.
They're over here.
Why the fuck do we have to cop on the street all the time?
My fucking nuts are itching like crazy.
Think this is him?
Is your name Pino?
Listen... could we get us some dope?
The dude over there said you could help.
You want to cop some shit?
Let me see some cash.
I got it here.
Let me see.
Hey, no money without no taste.
You want a taste?
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Hurry, man.
Come on.
There's fucking cops all over.
That's good, man.
That's good.
All right, listen...
4 for 35.
4 for 35, man?
Come on, man.
$5.00 short.
What's the big deal?
Ta bien, chico...
Toma, toma.
- You got four?
- Yeah.
We should taste this.
Where are we going to cook it up?
I don't know about his guy.
No, he's cool.
Fuck, man!
What's the matter?
- Just taste it!
Come on.
- What do you mean?
I tasted it.
He beat us.
He fucking beat us.
I swear to fucking God...
Put that away!
I'm gonna kill this mother...!
- Come here, motherfucker!
- Put it away!
I'm going to fucking kill you, you motherfucker!
Motherfucker, you're fucking dead, you hear me?
Dude, don't make me do it.
Where's the money?
I want the money.
I want the money and the bags.
Where's the fucking money?
The fucking money!
I want it!
Aah!
No!
-Oh, shit!
- We fucking killed him!
What the fuck do you mean, we?
I didn't fucking touch him!
Don't put that shit on me!
He beat us, man!
He deserved it!
You went too far, Mickey!
Oh, shit!
Is he dead?
Of course he's fucking dead!
He fell six stories!
Jim, come on.
Come on!
Will you come one?
Jim, don't make me leave you here!
Oh, shit.
Star
I'll reach you if I try
Show me the truth, yeah
Star
I'll reach you if I try
Show me the truth, yeah
Come on, get back up!
Come on!
Get off of me!
What are you doing?
Who is it?
Ma...
let me in.
Ma, let me in!
Please, Ma.
Ma?
Hey, Ma?
Are you in there, Ma?
Ma, is that you?
Yeah.
Ma?
Ma?
- Are you there?
- Yeah.
Hi.
Hi, Ma.
Hi.
Hi.
Listen, I need you to help me out, all right?
I need you to give me some money.
Okay?
I need you to give me, like, five doll...
Like, $20, something like that because I'm in some trouble.
Ma?
Do you hear me, Ma?
Yeah, I hear you.
I can't help you.
Okay, listen, what you got to do is give me some money, okay?
Jim, I can't do that.
Why not?
Mom, you know I'm not going to do anything with it.
I just need to go out of town for a little while 'cause I got into some trouble, and I need some help.
Okay?
So, you got to give me some money, Mom.
Can you hold my hand?
Yeah, I'll hold your hand.
Mom, can you give me some money, please?
Mom, can you give me some money, please?
Stop fucking around!
I can't.
Mom, give me some fucking money, please!
What are you doing?
I'm your son!
I don't have any.
Mom, don't fuck around like this!
Give me some money!
Mom!
Come on!
Let me in the fucking door!
Oh, God.
Oh, fuck.
Let me in.
I need some money.
I need some money real bad.
Ohh...
Oh, God.
Someone's breaking into my apartment.
They have a knife.
Oh!
Mom!
You don't understand, Mom.
You don't know what you're fucking doing to me.
Mom, I'm in pain.
How could you do this to your son, you bitch?
You fucking bitch!
Ah!
Oh, let me in!
I'll do anything!
I'll be a good boy!
I'll be a good boy, mom, if you let me in.
Get off me!
Get off!
No!
No!
You fuckers!
You're not going to do this!
Fuck you!
Ma!
Don't do this!
Ma!
Ma!
Ma!
I got six months in Riker's Island for assault, robbery, resisting arrest, and possession of narcotics.
I sweated out a horrible cure and stayed clean the whole stretch even though it's been easier to get good junk in here than it is on the street.
Shit, it's been hard, man.
All I've been doing is reading these diaries and wondering how the hell I'm still alive, and even if I care.
Suffice to say that I'm finished with the asshole bandits of shower-room rape, and suffice to say that those swine guards won't draw blood from my ankles again.
Suffice to say that I've been just thinking about dumb stuff like what a nice concept it is to have a godmother and a godfather, wondering who my godparents might be.
My mom won't visit me here, so I guess I'll just have to wait till I get home to ask.
Jim?
Who's there?
It's me.
Pedro?
What's up, man?
Nothing.
You know.
I...
I hear you come here.
I just came by to say hi.
I'm sorry about that night at the candy store and everything.
It's all right.
Reform school turned out to be real cool, so don't sweat it.
Did you hear about Mickey, that scumbag?
He went and threw some chump off a roof.
He's getting 5 to 15 years, man.
They tried him like an adult.
Shit.
I got a present for you, Jim.
A bag of the finest dope in Manhattan.
You know, me and you?
Like old times?
I can't.
Come on.
It would be dynamite.
I got this thing to do.
Why don't you come check it out?
No.
I'm going to go, then, you know?
You know how it is.
Take care of yourself, little man.
Know this.
There's different types of users of junk.
You got your rich dilettante square-ass who dabbles now and then and always has enough money to run off to the Riviera if he feels he's fucking around to the danger point.
Street junkies hate these pricks, but they're always suckers, and their money makes them tolerable.
Then you got your upper-middle-class
Westchester preppies... same as the others, basically.
What they're good for is opening their mommy and daddy's eyes to this social virus and putting pressure on the government to do something about it.
Then there's us street kids.
Start fucking around very young,
13 or so...
We think we all got it under control and won't get strung out.
This rarely works.
I'm living proof.
But in the end, you just got to see the junk as another 9-to-5 gig.
The hours are just a bit more inclined to shadows.
Go fuck yourself, you son of a bitch.
Bastard!
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done, you fuck!
Give us this day our daily bread, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Jesus, Jesus the Nazarene.
Jesus, the nazarene.
Go to hell.
Go to hell.
Go to hell.
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Jim, you're not going to waste the whole day lying around, are you?
Ma, I'm up.
The loony alarm went off.
Well, close the blinds.
Don't look at her and don't listen to her.
How could I not?
Jesus the Nazarene.
Mary the whore.
Mary the hairdresser.
Mary the hairdresser.
Our Father, Who art...
Hey, lady!
Shut up!
When I was young, about 8 or so,
I tried making friends with God- by inviting him to my house to watch the World Series.
He never showed.
Too bad, Father.
I was just starting to enjoy myself.
We can do it again tomorrow if you like, Mr. Carroll.
You okay, Jim?
Does it hurt?
You want to rub it for him, Pedro?
Jim, give it a rest.
You'll never beat him.
The guy's a pervert.
Did you hear him?
"We can do it again tomorrow if you like, Mr. Carroll. "
Let's cut out of here.
Come on.
# I was born in a pool #
# They made my mother stand #
# I spat on that surgeon #
# And his trembling hand #
# When I felt the light #
# I was worse than bored #
# I stole a doctor's scalpel #
# And I slit the cord #
# I was a Catholic boy #
# I was redeemed through pain #
# Not through joy #
# I was two months early #
# They put me under glass #
# I screamed and cursed their children #
# When the nurses passed #
# I was convicted of theft #
# As I slid from the womb #
# They led me straight from my mother #
# To a cell in the tombs #
# I was a Catholic boy #
# Redeemed through pain #
# Not through joy #
# They starved me for weeks #
# They thought they'd teach me fear #
# I fed on cellmates' dreams #
# It gave me fine ideas #
# When they cut me loose #
# The time had served me well #
# I'd made allies in heaven #
# Comrades in hell #
# I was a Catholic child #
# The blood ran red #
# The blood ran wild ##
Why, you little prick!
This is my new...
Shit, guys, gotta get outta here.
I threw up on somebody.
I'll get ya!
You little prick!
I'll fucking throw you in the fucking river if i catch ya-
Hey!
What about the four of us versus Wilt Chamberlain?
He was the greatest of all time.
Four of us?
What are you gonna do, Pedro?
tie his shoes together when he ain't looking?
All right...
How'bout the three versus Wilt Chamberlain?
No problem.
You're kidding, right, Mickey?
No.
He can't cover all of us at the same time.
You guys don't miss open jumpers.
And you know who will be there for the rebounds.
Rebounds?
That freak is, like, 7 feet tall.
Jim, I can rebound with anybody.
You're sniffing too much of that shit, that's what you're doing.
Chamberlain would destroy all of us.
End of story.
Alright.
All we got to do is move the ball around.
There's no way we don't win.
Will you tell this kid?
Hey, Mickey, I think you could beat him yourself.
I don't think you need us.
Perfect example... confidence.
I know I could beat him.
Holy shit!
Look at this place.
I tell you what, if our school was this nice,
I'd go more than once a week.
You?
We got a game today, gentlemen.
Who's ready to play some roundball?
I said, who's ready to play some ball?
You give me that laid-back,
"I'm doing my own thing, Jack" attitude out there today, and you're going to find yourself watching the game from the bench.
No smoking, Iggy...
stunts your growth.
You want to be big and strong like me, don't you?
Out.
No smoking, and no pulling your peckers before a game.
Swifty, do you mind?
I'm taking a dump.
Get outta here!
Something die in there?
When we play our game...
- so Pedro vomits on his head, right?
It goes all over his hair, trickles down his neck.
Some gets in his eye.
He went nuts-
Don't lie about it, either.
What are you doing?
We're signing a ball for Bobby.
Can I sign?
Yeah.
"We're holding your spot for you, kid.
Swifty. "
All right.
This one's for Bobby.
All right.
Who's better than we are?
Nobody!
Alright!
Go ahead.
Do some warm-ups.
Pedro, you're in charge.
You're my eyes and ears.
- Hey, Jim?
- Yeah?
That's a nice thing you're doing for Bobby.
Oh, thanks.
Thanks.
You seen Neutron?
I think he's talking to a scout from Saint John's, as a matter of fact, upstairs.
You want to play college ball, don't you?
Yeah.
Someday, I hope.
You know.
Yeah.
Scouts are sniffing you out already.
They like them young.
I'll tell you what.
You come by sometime, and we'll go over the schools together.
Yeah.
All right.
Yeah.
We'll get a pizza, and we'll make a night of it.
Um... actually, my nights are kind of busy right now.
Yeah.
Homework and all, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
We were the hottest Catholic high school team in New York City, on our way to the championship.
We felt like nothing could stop us.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yes!
We're on our way.
We're on our way.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Hands up.
Show me some defense.
Show me some defense.
Good steal.
Put it in.
Put it in.
Yeah!
All right.
All right.
Way to go.
Aw, geez.
All right, Neutron.
Yes!
Yes!
To the hole, Jim.
What's going on?
Break it up!
Come on.
Hit him!
Beat that motherfucker!
He fucking held me!
This dude blows the whistle...
Slow it down!
Slow it down!
You got to have presence on the court... presence like a cheetah rather than a chimp.
They both got it, but chimpy got to jump his nuts around all day to get it.
Shy cheetah just moves in total nonchalance a sec or two in his sexy, slow strut.
Me, I play like a cheetah.
Let's go, Rangers- let's go!
Let's go, Rangers, let's go!
Yeah!
Ooh!
You got it!
It's ours.
It's ours.
Yeah!
9, 8, 7,
6, 5,
4, 3,
2, 1!
Yay, Jim!
Oh, shit.
That's my team!
That's my team!
There's only two things Swifty forbids... using the word "motherfucker"
and stealing from the other team, as long as they're white.
How much for that group of winners over there?
It's $34.90.
$34.90?
Changed the prices or something?
No.
I'm a little short.
Do me a favor.
Here.
Take my watch, and I'll come back later with the rest of the money.
No.
What do you mean, no?
I'm sorry, sir.
Those burgers are worth more than the watch is.
I'll be right back.
I told you one burger each, didn't I?
It takes at least eight of these to get filled up.
Yeah.
C'mon, Swifty.
We're growing boys.
Growing boys?
We're hungry motherfuckers.
Funny, huh?
I'm not driving you guys home.
How's that for laughs?
You ripped them off, didn't you?
We're even now.
Swifty, come on.
How are we going to get home?
Face the music, pricks.
What are we going to do?
They got the door blocked off.
You afraid of these pussies?
I ain't afraid of anybody.
What's the problem?
I'm going to ask you this once.
All right?
Where's the stuff you stole from me?
What are you talking about?
No, no, no.
You're not going to fuck with me, all right?
Now, somebody stole my father's ring from my locker, motherfucker.
You want me to cut you?
Is that what you want, there?
There's no problem here.
Hey, guys!
Let's get out of here, c'mon!
You need a fucking army, huh?
Come on!
Come on!
Oh.
Nice.
That from Bobo?
That's his father's ring.
Hey, fellas.
Any of you looking for a date?
Yeah.
Me, sweetheart.
Little horsy ride in Central Park, maybe candlelight dinner?
Why don't we skip right to dessert, huh, baby?
About $15?
Fifteen bucks?
I'll give you a quarter.
Let Pedro suck your tits.
You don't have to be rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
How about you, handsome, huh?
You got $15... for a little head?
Diane, do I look like I need to pay for it?
Yeah... you do.
If it's worth it.
Jimmy...
Jimmy, I know you want some, honey.
$15.
I'll do you so good you'll never forget it, baby.
Hey, hey!
Ooh!
That's a deal.
Bargain from there.
What do you say, guys?
You want to do it?
All four of us?
- Yeah.
- It's a deal.
All four of us.
Aw, shit.
This is all I got, Diane.
Here, have a pretzel.
- Get out of here.
- Beat it.
Yeah, fuck you!
Fucking dopehead.
You see what that shit does to you?
Wow.
Speaking of dopeheads, is that Pedro's mother over there slinging her wares again?
It is!
Hey, Peepee, where you going?
Why do you have to be such an asshole all the time, huh?
Why is the little shoe crying anyway?
His mother's a sneaker.
His father's a loafer.
Somebody's got to be a heel.
Jim, where you going?
Hey, Jim!
Jim.
Hey.
Hey, man.
What's up?
You don't recognize me with my new hairdo?
It's nice.
It's nice.
I like it.
What's going on?
- How are you?
- Good.
Wow.
Look at that.
You like it?
Yeah, I'll tell you what.
When you get out of here, we'll all shave our heads and look like a gang of skinheads.
It's a deal.
All right.
I got something for you here.
Yeah.
Everyone on the team.
Look right here...
even Swifty signed it.
Thanks, man.
You remember when I dunked on that spade in Riverside Park?
You always had good ups.
Yeah.
Oh.
I got something to show you.
Hold on.
What?
Pedro got these out of some lady's purse.
- She's doing it with a donkey.
- Oh, Jesus!
Look at that schlong.
Look at that one.
Oh, I beat your record.
How many times you choke it?
Seven times.
Bullshit.
Seven times.
My mom thinks I have a cold year-round because of all the tissues around the house.
You can keep those if you want.
They're pumping so much junk in me,
I can't even get a decent chubby.
I got an idea.
Come on.
Let's go.
Where we going?
I'm getting you out of this place, man.
C'mon!
What are you, crazy, man?
I can't go anywhere.
Here you go.
I've known Bobby since I was 3.
He's my best friend.
He was the best player on our basketball team.
Two years ago, he got leukemia.
He keeps fighting it off.
I know Bobby's going to beat it.
He could beat anything.
Watch!
Jim, you're going to kill me, man.
If you let go, I swear...
I swear I'll kill you, man.
Watch the bump!
What the hell happened to forty deuce?
Last time I was here, that theater was playing Sperminator II.
Oh, yeah.
I remember that.
No, man.
This whole block has been done over by all these new artists.
It's pretty cool, huh?
Yeah.
They should put your stuff up there.
Yeah.
Right.
Still scribbling stuff in that notebook of yours, ain't you?
Of course.
You bring anything for me?
What, like to read?
No, like to eat.
What do you think?
Yeah.
I mean, I got this, but it's not a big deal.
I don't even remember writing it, to tell you the truth.
Yeah, Yeah.
I'll be the judge of this.
"Little kids shoot marbles
"where branches break the sun
"into graceful shafts of light.
I just want to be pure.
All right.
# What a life #
Nothing like the real thing to float your boat, huh, Bobby?
# What a life #
# Didn't know where, didn't know when... #
That's nice.
# Said that I'll go...
go learn #
# Put up my hand, wait my turn #
# But it never comes, I have to shout out #
# That's life #
# And that's what it's all about #
# So through the comfort and the strife #
# What a life... #
Get me out of here, Jim.
What are you talking about, man?
This was a stupid idea.
I don't feel so good.
Well, can we wait till the end of the show?
Did you hear what I said?
I said get me the hell out of here!
Hey, Bob, man...
I'm really sorry, you know?
Next time, we'll go somewhere...
Ain't gonna be no next time, Jim.
I love it this way... my feet against the tar, which is soft from the spring heat, the slight breeze that runs across your entire body, especially your crotch.
You feel an incredible power being naked under a dome of stars while a giant city is dressed, dodging cars all around you five flights down.
I don't think of anything while I'm doing the actual tugging, least of all the heavy sex fantasies I have to resort to indoors.
Just my own naked self and the stars breathing down, and it's beautiful.
Time sure flies when you're young and jerking off.
"Camp summer position.
Driver... taxi. "
Hey, that might be good.
You could get your license this summer.
Oh, yeah, Mom.
That sounds really great.
Hey, get your own job, and if you don't get it this summer, you're coming to work with me at the hotel.
Mom, please.
Why are you so worried about this?
Do I even ask you for money?
No.
I'm not worried about the money.
I want you to have responsibility.
I don't want you running around the streets of New York.
Idle time is the devil's plaything, Jim.
The devil's plaything, huh?
That might be a cool title for my first book.
Thanks!
What are you talking about?
What are you writing?
Here.
Ooh.
Um...
Ma, I'm not really that hungry this morning, alright?
- Come on.
You got to eat something.
- I know...
Where you going?
I'm going to shoot some hoops.
Sometimes I feel like something's chasing me, like there's some whacko on a roof somewhere who could snuff me out at any moment.
And I feel this horrible fear.
Will I have time to finish- the poems breaking loose in my head?
Hey, white boy, you ready for your beating?
Don't let your mouth get you into something your ass can't handle.
I'll shoot you for it.
So it's going to be like that, huh?
I... don't think so.
Yeah!
All right, so you made one.
Big deal.
You made one shot.
Make another.
# The days are muzzled in a vibe #
# I swing back from time to time #
# There's a Camaro, rusty red #
# That all my best friends drive in #
# Can you smell the summer air?
#
# Take me where they left the light on #
# Getting close, almost there #
# If that fuzzy silver badge #
# Don't greet us there #
# My head's dizzy, and I'm taking... ##
Yo, Jim!
What's the score?
Come on.
We got to go.
They don't keep score in this game.
Jim, come on.
We're losing the sun.
He's being a dick.
You want me to put a charge in his ass?
Whatch this.
Oh, look it, right here...
Jim's secret diary he's always writing in.
Bet you he wrote some shit about me.
Oh, right here.
"Spring...
Mickey. "
Hey, there I am, Jim says.
"Mickey takes out a bottle of carbonic cleaning fluid and suggests we do a little sniffing to get high. "
Whoo!
"After four deep whiffs, we're sailing someplace else. "
Mickey, what are you doing?
"Bells ringing through my ears, little lights flashing through my eyes. "
Mickey, put that down, all right?
"I pictured myself
"paddling across a river with black water,
"only the canoe was going backwards instead of forwards,
"with clouds that had faces.
Laughing, spooky, fun-house laughs... "
- Give it back, alright?
- What is that shit?
Why do you have to be such a schmuck, Mickey?
What are you talking about?
Don't you ever touch that again.
It's private.
What's your problem?
I'm...
I'm sorry.
He's writing about me, I can't read about it?
Jesus!
Hey, Jim, come on.
We're gone.
Yo, we got a cab!
Hey, cabby!
Hey, swami!
So, Shakespeare, you going to finish the game?
C'mon, Reggie, you know this game never ends.
See you later, all right?
Every crowd has its little games to prove if you're a punk or not.
My cousin in Jersey plays chickie, which is two cars heading towards each other at about 80 miles per hour.
First driver to swerve out of the way is, of course, chicken.
In Brooklyn, they make you press a lit cigarette into your arm and have it burn all the way down to the filter without the slightest flinch.
Us, Manhattan boys, we jump off cliffs into the Harlem River, which is literally shitty, because half a million toilets flush into it every day.
Whoo-oo!
Yeah!
Oooh!
Yeah!
Hey, y'all, I carried the clothes up, but I ain't carrying them down.
Peepee, this is you... all 33 pounds of you, gone with the wind.
Wow.
That's a long way down.
Devil's toe is no big deal.
We've all done it a million times.
I never done it.
You never did it?
Pedro, you never do nothing.
You know who was awesome on this rock?
Bobby.
That kids would do back flips off this rock.
Hey, Mickey.
What?
Don't talk about him like he's dead.
He's not dead.
There goes the circle line.
Check it out.
Whoo!
Full moon!
Whoo!
Hey, yo!
Whoo!
Hey, circle this!
Hey, I'm going.
Watch out, watch out...
I'm going to show you how to do it.
Ye-ea-ah!
That was a good jump.
Oh, he's nuts.
Hey, I'm going to walk down.
What you talking about?
You can't walk down.
There's no way to walk down.
I ain't jumping.
Pedro, your clothes are down there.
How you gonna get your clothes?
You going to walk around naked all day?
Pedro, if you don't jump, Mickey's going to tease you so bad-
You might as well just jump and get it over with.
Feel better.
What the hell, right?
shit...
Pedro!
Bad form.
Bad form.
Oh...
My God!
Oh, shit.
Is he all right?
Pedro, you all right?
You ready?
Yeah.
Listen, don't tell the other guys, but when we leave here, I got a surprise for you.
Tell me what it is.
It's a surprise.
Trust me, all right?
Ouch, don't mess around, man...
Alright, you ready?
Come on!
You ready?
- Let's jump.
- On three.
Ready?
1, 2,
3.
Come on.
Let's go.
What's up, Manny?
How you doing?
Fine.
Thank you, sir.
This is my friend Jim.
How you doing?
I can't believe I hit my head on that rock.
It's killing me.
Jim, um, this is Winkie.
- Hi.
- How you doing?
Good.
And this... this is Blinkie.
- Hi.
- Hi.
# I lost my heart #
# Under the bridge #
# That little girl... #
I've seen you play ball, Jim.
You're a very beautiful player.
Very zen.
# And now I moan #
# And now I holler #
# She'll never know #
# Just what I found #
# That blue-eyed girl #
It'll make you fuck like Superman.
# She said no more #
Faster than a speeding bullet...
# Became blue-eyed whore... #
More powerful than a locomotive...
# Down by the water #
# Down by the water... #
Able to, um...
I can't think of anything with a single bound.
# See her again #
# See her again... #
Do you have any protection?
Yeah.
This one's, uh, ribbed for extra pleasure.
So what are you waiting for?
What do you mean?
Take off your clothes.
Well... could we shut off the lights first?
# Little fish, big fish #
# Swimming in the water #
# Come back here, man #
# Give me my daughter #
# Little fish, big fish #
# Swimming in the water ##
White ship disappears in the wave machine this morning.
Your eyes got shut with secret chains that pillow armies eventually set free... like soft horses through toy deserts.
I love this mansion, though it's too many windows... to open halfway each morning... to close halfway each night.
I looked at his body, and it was death for the first time.
His face was thin and wrinkled, almost apelike.
His hair, just gray patches on his scalp.
He looked 60 years old, and he was 16.
Couldn't believe how skinny he was... much skinnier than he was in the hospital.
It was like having the skeleton of someone you knew put right in front of you.
I felt dazed, like I'd just come out of a four-hour movie I didn't understand.
I kept thinking about his face... and death... what a cheat the whole thing was.
Hey, you guys remember that Halloween when Bobby filled that paper bag with dog shit, lit it on fire and put it outside Father Dunne's door, and we all hid behind the dumpster?
Yeah.
I could picture Father Dunne comming outside, stepping on that shit.
Picture him in the john- scraping the shit off his shoe like this.
You think that'll keep him out of heaven?
Are you kidding?
Jesus Christ himself would have laughed at that.
It was hilarious!
What about the time at the formal when Bobby got caught in the bathroom with Mary Ann Dugan and McNulty came in and busted him?
He was, like, "Father, I swear.
We weren't doing anything. "
Meanwhile she's got a giant wad of cum hanging off her face.
I tell you, that kid was definitely a pisser.
It was weird seeing him today, man.
He was all shriveled up and wrinkled.
He looked like my grandfather.
I'll tell you what, though.
That kid was in so much pain, it's better off he died.
How the hell would you know, Mickey?
Did you go and visit him?
Any of you guys go and visit him?
All right.
Then shut the fuck up.
Hey, Jim.
Look at my brother's girlfriend in the park.
She's sitting there, eating a sandwich.
Next thing you know, she's shot in the head.
She's dead.
It's over.
What about little Teddy Rayhill?
Perfect example.
Remember that night he was up on the roof, and he was doing poppers, having a great time, laughing his ass off
He started walking backwards...
Boom!
He fell right off the goddamn roof.
It was meant to be, right?
Fuck that, you guys!
Bobby was the best fucking guy around, you know that?
What are you, a bunch of idiots?
You don't even understand, do you?
Jim, you all right?
Listen, maybe you should talk to one of the priests.
I don't know.
Maybe...
Maybe they can help you out.
Help me out?
I wouldn't ask one of those cocksuckers for directions.
You know what?
You guys need to lighten the fuck up, all right?
Let bygones be fucking bygones.
Shitty fucking world.
Live life to the fucking fullest.
You know what I mean?
Shit happens, man.
Shit fucking happens.
Come on.
Let's go.
Jim, come on.
You're growing up, and rain sort of remains on the branches of a tree that will someday rule the earth.
And that's good that there's rain.
Clears the month of your sorry rainbow expressions.
And it clears the streets of the silent armies so we can dance.

Did I ever tell you about the first time I did heroin?
I went down to Pedro's basement.
All sorts of characters were in the storage-room shooting gallery.
I was just going to sniff a bag, but a guy says,
"If you're going to sniff, might as well pop it, and if you're going to pop it, might as well mainline. "
I was scared of needles, but I gave in.
It was like a long heat wave through my body.
Any ache or pain or sadness or guilty feeling was completely flushed out.
Look, Ma, I'm not in the mood for your dime-store psychology, all right?
Could you just please leave me alone?
I got a little sick, all right?
We're not going to live like this, Jim.
We're not going to live like this.
I'm warning you!
I'm telling you.
Oh, God, Mom.
You're always warning me, aren't you?
Blah, blah, blah.
You're always in my fucking ear.
Blah, blah, blah.
You don't know anything.
What are you talking about?
Go clean toilets or whatever the hell it is you do.
When you're done, clean this one.
Don't talk like that!
What's the matter with you?
Gee whiz, Ma, you know... we got to have these heart-to-heart talks more often.
They're really good for us.
I don't know you.
I don't believe this is you, Jim.
Please, Jim.
I don't know who you are.
Yeah, I know.
I was such a good little boy, right... with such potential, wasn't that it?
Is that what you're going to say?
Oh, Jim.
What's happening?
Jim, what's happening?
First, it's a Saturday-night thing, and you feel cool, like a gangster or a rock star.
It's just something to kill the boredom, you know?
They call it a chippie, a small habit.
It feels so good, you start doing it on Tuesdays, then Thursdays.
Then it's got you.
Every wise-ass punk on the block says it won't happen to them, but it does.
Go do it!
I ain't doing it.
I always do it!
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could you tell me the fastest way to the subway?
Yeah.
That's the "B" train.
Go to this corner and make a left.
It's right there.
What are you doing?
Let go!
Let go!
Let go of that!
Oh, my God!
What?
- Help!
No!
No!
- What are you doing?
Let's go!
Come on!
I don't feel like going in today.
Father, is it all right if I don't go in today?
Why?
What are you scared of?
Nothing.
I just don't feel like it, that's all.
I imagine you have more to confess than anybody here.
Unburden yourself.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been about four months since my last confession.
Yes, my son?
Well, I don't know where to start, Father.
Have you taken the name of Jesus Christ in vain?
Yeah.
Yeah, I have.
Have you disrespected your mother and father?
Have you stolen or cheated your fellow man?
Yeah, but I'm not proud of it.
Have you had impure thoughts or engaged in impure deeds?
Oh, Father, you have no idea.
Is there something else that you want to tell me in your own words?
I've done all kinds of crazy shit.
Oh, excuse me, Father.
Fuck, I'm s...
Christ, I have a dirty mouth.
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry about that.
Will you just go on?
10 Hail Marys, five Our Fathers.
What do you mean?
And that's it?
That's my punishment?
You know something?
My friend Bobby, he was the best, and he's dead.
This sucks!
You know that?
This really sucks.
It's not fair, Father.
Your nose is running, your stomach cramps, your legs feel like they've played six straight games on top of each other, and the voice is always there in the back of your head...
"Just one more time.
then we'll stop. "
Quick to the ball.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Good, Ignatius.
Good.
Good.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Right behind you.
Sir, all right if I use the bathroom, Coach?
Jim, you got a bladder like a woman.
Let's go.
Again.
There we go.
Right behind him.
Right behind him.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Two hands.
Jim?
I thought you were taking a piss.
What are you doing in here every practice?
Have you been waiting for me, Jim?
Giving me some kind of a signal?
What are you talking about, Swifty?
Don't act surprised.
Do we understand each other?
It's not going to happen, Swifty.
Put the money away.
You want more?
Here.
Just let me do it.
Get the fuck out of my face!
Take it easy, Jim.
You can't blame me for trying.
I made a mistake, all right?
Let's just pretend it never happened.
Things will go back to exactly how they were before.
Okay?
Okay?
Here, keep the money.
Keep the money.
Just don't tell anybody, all right?
Good.
Tell anybody you want!
Nobody's going to believe a drughead like you, anyway.
You think we don't know what you've been doing?
Give me the fucking money and get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck- Get the fuck out here!
Come on!
Get out of here!
And you want to stop.
You really do.
But it's like a dream.
You can't stop dreams.
They move in crazy pieces, any way they want to, and suddenly, you're capable of anything.
No!
Wake up, Mr. Carroll!
It's later than you think.
Oh.
All right!
- I need a lift.
- All right.
What do you got?
Three different pills.
Which are the ups?
I never asked.
I thought one of youse would know.
Oh, great.
We look like pharmacists?
I don't know what to take.
What do we take?
Let me see.
The blacks and the reds are the ups.
I think the pink ones are the ups.
Why?
'Cuz I associate pink with lightness, you know?
The black ones seem like they'd knock you on your ass.
They might be faded seconals.
No, they're not faded.
They'd be sticky.
They're not.
That's bullshit.
- Fuck your mother.
- My what?
All right!
Calm down.
Don't ever talk about my mother.
Don't ever hit me like that again.
Come on!
Alright!
Give me your hat.
We got a game to play, alright?
Just give me something.
Hi, Neutron.
Let me ask him.
Neutron, you know which ones are the ups?
I think you should put that shit away before Swifty comes in here.
Why you acting like such a square ass?
Screw you, Mickey.
Screw you, too, Tough guy.
Man.
I'm just going to take the black.
You sure?
You got a better idea?
Nope.
Your guess is as good as mine, Jimbo.
It's on today.
50 rebounds.
Good.
Come on.
Let's go.
I'm your friend now, right?
What, I got to smack you again, c'mon!
Yeah, take your little rat with you.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, what's up?
Why are you acting like that?
You know what's wrong.
Used to be about getting high and playing basketball.
Now it's just about getting high with you.
You're blowing it, Jim.
Oh, come on.
I don't need to hear this from you, Neutron.
Yeah, you do, Jim!
Listen, no, Jim!
I'm really proud of you, man.
Everything's cool.
You look great.
I'll see you in the NBA.
# Riders on the storm #
# Riders on the storm #
# Into this house we're born #
# Into this world we're thrown #
# Like a dog without a bone #
# In fact we're all alone #
# Riders on the storm #
# There's a killer on the road #
# His brain is squirming like a toad #
# Take a long holiday #
# Let your children play #
# If you give this man a ride #
# Sweet family will die #
# Killer on the road #
# Yeah ##
Did you find it?
No, Father.
It's clean.
There's no drugs in there.
Thank you, Officer.
I told you we didn't have nothing.
You boys think you're awfully smart, don't you?
Well, you're both suspended for a week!
Ooh...
And you'll never play basketball here again.
That you can count on.
You can't kick me off the team, Swifty.
Oh?
Why is that?
'Cause I quit the team... and the school and this whole faggot-ass scene, that's why.
I could second that motion.
Your resignations are accepted!
Neutron, you coming with us?
Yeah.
That's what I figured.
Come on, man.
I'm fucking out of here.
Don't worry, Swifty.
I'm not going to rat you out.
And in the next life, Father,
I'm going to have the paddle!
Get out!
Thanks a lot, Neutron.
Thanks, man.
I can't believe this, you know?
I know.
What happened to the pills?
We got kicked out of the school, Mickey.
Who cares, man?
We lost the pills.
The cops took them-
We can't play ball anymore.
Jim, who cares about school, man?
We just lost $40 worth of pharmaceuticals.
I know what happened to them, too.
The cops, they take that all the time.
They either pop them themselves or they sell them.
What's my mom going to say, man?
When I go home?
She ain't gonna say nothing.
You just tell her you're going to school every day in the morning.
Let's get out of here, man...
Go get into something.
You never sold any pills at the schoolyard?
No.
So it's all a big conspiracy against you.
Right, Jim?
Yeah.
Maybe it is.
Maybe it's not.
You been missing these?
What are you going to tell me...
they're vitamins?
Oh, fuck you, Ma.
What?
!
Get out of my house!
Oh, is that what you want, Ma?
Get out!
You don't talk to me that way!
If that's what you want, I'm fucking out of here.
All right?
What are you doing?
I'm leaving!
What do you think?
I wan you to take all your shit!
I'll help you.
Here!
You want me to leave?
Yes.
Get out!
I'm out of here.
Get the fuck out of my way!
This garbage is going to kill you, Jim!
I'm gone!
Gonna to kill you!
Don't you understand?
I can't watch you kill yourself?
Ma, you're never going to fucking see me again, alright?
Just remember that.
Don't say that, Jim.
Don't say that!
It was a dream, not a nightmare... a beautiful dream I could never imagine in a thousand nods.
I saw this girl next to me who wasn't beautiful until she smiled,
and I felt that smile come at me and heat waves following, soaking through my body and out my fingertips in shafts of color.
And I knew somewhere in the world... somewhere...
that there was love for me.
We just got to raise enough cash to keep our heads straight.
Luckily, finding money in New York is like getting laid at the prom... easy.
- Fuck it, Pedro!
- What's the matter with you?
Jesus!
Watch the road.
You could kill us all, c'mon!
I get 1,500 bucks for this car.
If it's whacked up, it's worth nothing.
We should buy shit in bulk, man
We'll put it on the street and make real money.
That's 500 bucks a piece.
We'll be on for days, nights, weeks.
Yeah, man.
I'd love to go to Puerto Rico, soak up some rays, you know?
See my bitch?
That's what I'd like to do.
- What are you talking about?
- What bitch?
We haven't seen a picture or nothing.
She's 500 pounds, Jim.
She got a mustache thicker than her father.
No.
That's your mother, Mickey.
She does not exist.
Don't fool yourself.
Be careful.
I'm about to whack.
Oh, shit, man.
My brother's going to take care of us and this car.
Pedro, wake the fuck up!
Pedro, come on, man!
You're going to get us killed, what are you doing?
I got it, man.
You want me to drive?
Mickey, you better drive the car.
I'm serious, man.
Just don't blow my high.
If there's a scratch in the car, my brother'll kill me.
Yo, get out of the booth!
Get out the booth, huh?
Get out.
Fucking...
What's up?
What's up?
Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Where's the car?
It's good to see you, too.
It's over here.
It's nice.
It's smokin'.
You tell me that?
It's everything you wanted.
Get your hands off.
You guys look like shit.
Oh, my God.
They're taking the car.
Show me the sign, man!
Show me the freaking sign!
It's right there.
You see?
It says "tow-away."
You scumbags even read?
I should kick all your punk asses!
Goddamn it!
I can get you another car tonight.
Yeah?
John Halligan is waiting for this car.
I got him out of bed with his wife.
You know how this makes me fucking look?
Kenny, get off.
You're too stupid to be my brother!
You're too stupid!
You want a piece of me, Carroll?
Back off!
Back off!
- Kenny, no more!
- Mr. Tough Guy.
- Kenny, no more!
- Huh?
Tough guy?
Give me a sip of your soda.
You wipe off the bottle before you take a sip?
You don't even think twice about sharing works with Mickey.
You think you'll catch something from the bottle you're not catch from a needle?
You mistake me for somebody who gives a shit.
Headquarters...
home on and off to every down-and-out junkie and wino from 14th Street to the Bowery.
It's like a fucking all-star team.
Jimmy, the other day, my mother's been ragging on me,
"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
"You've tried every other way.
Go to church.
Put yourself in Christ's hands. "
So I do it, man.
I figure, give it a shot.
I dig Jesus.
So, I go, man.
High mass...
a choir and everything.
The first thing I see on the right, the side altar, are those little candles in the red glass that we used when it was windy in the park to cook up.
And then, this altar boy, he's coming down the aisle with this 6-foot candle.
I envision this huge spoon above it, man, with, like, shopping bags full of dope inside of it.
And then the kicker comes, man.
The priest, he starts doing the thing with the incense.
You know, starts wafting out.
I'm in the back.
It finally hits me.
"Where do I know this smell from, man?
My room, man. "
It's the smell exactly of really primo dope cooking up.
Yeah?
Exactly the same.
So what happened next?
At that point, I split.
I went home,
I went inside my closet,
I got my stash out of the inside pocket of my sharkskin easter suit, and I got stoned.
Ba bing... ba bang.
I love a ritual.
Oh, Mary, if you can hear me...
I need you to fill Jim's heart with love because he really needs it now.
Oh, God... please watch over my son.
He needs you now.
Just take care of him, okay?
I'll be okay.
I love you, Jim.
I love you.
Hey, you holding?
You straight, man?
Get out of here.
Come on.
No.
Hey, have you seen Falco?
Come on, man.
Are you holding anything?
Hey, Diane...
Come here, Diane.
- I'll take care of you, babe.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
How about some of this?
I wouldn't do you for a bag, you fucking piece of shit.
Jim.
Jimmy.
You're looking good.
Who's your embalmer?
I want some of what you got.
Check everything in this place.
Wow.
I always wanted to use these syrup pumps.
And these professional ice-cream scoopers.
Oh, my God.
Don't make me do it!
I'll do it!
I swear to God!
Jim, watch out.
Come on!
It's not opening.
They don't make them like this anymore.
You got to get it from the side.
I got it!
Oh, cool.
Change!
Shit!
Let's get out of here.
It's locked.
We got to go out the back.
Pedro, let's get out of here!
What am I, hallucinating here?
Pedro, you'll get us caught.
The cops are going to come.
Oh, you want to be tough, huh?
Go ahead... take another sip so I can blow your fucking head all over the counter!
Go ahead, Pedro!
Go ahead!
Come on, guys!
Let's go.
Put that gun away!
Don't fuck with me, motherfucker!
What the hell are you doing, Mickey?
What the hell did you do that for?
Let that little spic rot, man!
He'll get us caught.
Jim, the cops are coming.
Come on!
Jim!
Jim!
Pedro!
Pedro!
Jim!
Freeze!
Freeze!
On your stomach!
On your stomach!
I didn't do anything, I'm telling you!
This is it, man.
That Jew got to keep the money under his pillow.
Hey, Jim, I know you're still mad about Pedro.
I couldn't do nothing, man.
He was going to get us caught.
Definitely shouldn't have went that far.
What happened to you?
Your mother kick your ass?
Yeah, real funny.
Bring us a couple of Cokes, will you?
You all right?
Hey, bartender, move out of the way.
Jim, I'm getting sick.
I got to get some money to cop.
Jim.
You with me here?
What the hell are you wa...
Oh, shit.
That's Neutron.
That's the all-American high school game?
We could have played in that game.
Who gives a shit?
Come on.
I'm waiting to hear back on a scholarship from Saint John's...
I'm not sure about it, but hopefully it will work out.
Jim, I'm starting to jones.
Gotta get out there.
We need some money.
Jim, don't dwell on these dreams, man.
Will you come on?
Meet you outside, man.
I'm getting sick.
You want to meet me out there?
Is it okay if I say hi to my mom?
Hi, Mom.
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.
# You don't know it, but you're coming right along #
# Please be strong #
# You don't know it, but you're coming right along ##
Hey, you!
Stop!
You can't go in there!
Stop!
What do you want?
You realize what time it is?
Yeah.
Um... is Winkie and Blinkie here?
Who the hell are Winkie and Blinkie?
Hey, guys.
Lisa, Mel, you know this boy?
No, Daddy.
Come on.
All right.
Come on.
Get out of here.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Rubin.
He got past me.
- Don't let it happen again.
It won't happen again.
Get out of here!
What?
What?
Asshole.
Hey, fuck-up, get fucking up, man!
- What's your problem, man?
- What's YOUR problem, mam?
You sold my girlfriend some shit the other day.
You almost killed her.
What was it... rat poison?
It's not my fault your girl can't handle her drugs.
I want my fucking $20 back, man.
Look, there's no money-back guarantees.
I'm not selling refrigerators here.
Oh, yeah?
I'll cut you a dynamite deal on mexican shit.
Give me my $20, or we'll go outside.
If we go outside, one of us is going to get hurt.
I told you one of us would get hurt.
Is that right?
It's been hard...
the writing...
lately.
Terrible numbness, then suddenly it comes... in beautiful fragments or terrible dreams... like nods... so high.
Reggie, is that you?
Who the fuck do you think it is?
Don't worry, you're not dead yet.
It's not bad.
Hey, give me that.
How come it's all wet?
Because you pissed on it.
I didn't say you could read this.
What, have you been digging through all my stuff?
I need...
I got to get out of here.
Where's my jacket?
You're welcome.
What the hell am I thanking you for?
Because you was frozen in the snow like a goddamn creamsicle.
Where is it?
What?
You know what the fuck I'm talking about, Reggie!
Where is it?
You mean this?
Give it to me.
I'll cut your fucking throat, Reggie!
Give it to me, all right?
Just give it to me!
Oh, give it to me!
Give it to me!
I'm serious!
Give me it!
Give it to me!
Goddamn it!
I'll make you an incredible offer.
I'm going to save your life twice in one day, understand me?
You should have left me in the fucking snow, man.
Give me the money for my dope, too.
I'm not gonna suck your dick, all right?
Put that away.
Who the hell wants you to suck their dick?
Goddamn it!
Look at yourself!
Just look at yourself.
Oh, Reggie... it's okay.
Why are you doing this?
Because once upon a time, somebody helped me, and I always pay what I owe.
Reggie.
Reggie, I just need a taste.
I just need a little something, Reggie.
You don't understand.
It hurts, Reggie!
Reggie, I got to go.
I got to go see my mom.
You got to let me get out of here, Reggie.
Reggie!
It hur...
It hurts.
Shit!
Oh, boy...
# Touch the taste and taste the smell #
# Smell the scent, all the gifts you gave to me, baby #
# The food of your brain #
# The room is spinning round #
# I never come down #
# The room is spinning round #
# I never come down... #
Reggie.
you got to give me it.
You got to give me it, Reggie.
Please!
Reggie, come on!
# I remember you, too #
# I blew my mind ##
Wake up.
Can't sleep all day.
Oh.
Thanks.
Jesus Christ.
What happened to you?
What does it look like?
Motherfucker shot me.
Woke my black ass up.
Shit.
Look, uh...
I'll be back in the morning, Jim.
You just stay cool.
You start to get panicky, write about me in that book of yours.
Actually, I was a little hurt I wasn't mentioned.
You really like my writing, huh, Reggie?
Damn, man, I told you four times already.
What do you want me to do?
Bend over and kiss your ass?
Hey, Reg, do me a favor.
While you're out, pick me up a bag.
# The room is spinning round #
# I may never come down #
I am alone.
Not just me.
We're alone... alone forever.
And who's at the end of that forever tunnel I run through, up Fifth with the wallpaper of skyscrapers?
I'm thinking, after all those beautiful trips, that this is one of those bad ones.
Diane?
Hey!
Jim.
Remember me?
Man, you look great.
Yeah, thanks.
Good to see somebody from the old neighborhood...
What do you want, Jim?
- You holding anything?
- No.
Just like a 5 or something?
Just to tide me over, you know?
Please, Diane?
Come on.
Yeah.
For an old friend?
Why not?
I've been looking all over for this.
Oh, you know what?
I only got a 20.
A 20 is good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
A 20 is great, yeah.
That would help me out a lot.
- You want a 20?
- Yeah.
Why don't you go buy yourself some pretzels, you asshole.
You bitch!
You're nothing but a whore!
I don't give a shit about your clothes!
You're still a whore to me!
Yeah?
Shut up.
Look at you.
Oh, are you desperate now, baby?
Who's a whore now?
Don't talk to me like that, you bitch!
Who's laughing, stupid?
Don't play a game with me!
I know you!
Shit.
Oh, man.
Shit.
Mickey.
Mick, what's up, man?
Hey, what's up, man?
Did you get anything?
No, not a dime.
You score?
Yeah, I got something.
What'd you get?
About 35 bucks.
35?
Where'd you get it?
I robbed some fucking asshole on the "D" train.
Dude, 35 will keep us on for, like, two days.
Well, could we get some stuff, man?
I'm fucking... my head is...
I see some spics.
I think we can score.
You wanna check it out?
- Yeah, alright.
- Come on.
They're over here.
Why the fuck do we have to cop on the street all the time?
My fucking nuts are itching like crazy.
Think this is him?
Is your name Pino?
Listen... could we get us some dope?
The dude over there said you could help.
You want to cop some shit?
Let me see some cash.
I got it here.
Let me see.
Hey, no money without no taste.
You want a taste?
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Hurry, man.
Come on.
There's fucking cops all over.
That's good, man.
That's good.
All right, listen...
4 for 35.
4 for 35, man?
Come on, man.
$5.00 short.
What's the big deal?
Ta bien, chico...
Toma, toma.
- You got four?
- Yeah.
We should taste this.
Where are we going to cook it up?
I don't know about his guy.
No, he's cool.
Fuck, man!
What's the matter?
- Just taste it!
Come on.
- What do you mean?
I tasted it.
He beat us.
He fucking beat us.
I swear to fucking God...
Put that away!
I'm gonna kill this mother-!
- Come here, motherfucker!
- Put it away!
I'm going to fucking kill you, you motherfucker!
Motherfucker, you're fucking dead, you hear me?
Dude, don't make me do it.
Where's the money?
I want the money.
I want the money and the bags.
Where's the fucking money?
The fucking money!
I want it!
No!
- Oh, shit!
- We fucking killed him!
What the fuck do you mean, we?
I didn't fucking touch him!
Don't put that shit on me!
He beat us, man!
He deserved it!
You went too far, Mickey!
Oh, shit!
Is he dead?
Of course he's fucking dead!
He fell six stories!
Jim, come on.
Come on!
Will you come one?
Jim, don't make me leave you here!
Oh, shit.
# Star #
# I'll reach you if I try #
# Show me the truth, yeah #
# Star #
# I'll reach you if I try #
# Show me the truth, yeah ##
Come on, get back up!
Come on!
Get off of me!
What are you doing?
Who is it?
Ma...
let me in.
Ma, let me in!
Please, Ma.
Ma?
Hey, Ma?
Are you in there, Ma?
Ma, is that you?
Yeah.
Ma?
Ma?
- Are you there?
- Yeah.
Hi.
Hi, Ma.
Hi.
Hi.
Listen, I need you to help me out, all right?
I need you to give me some money.
Okay?
I need you to give me, like, five doll...
Like, $20, something like that because I'm in some trouble.
Ma?
Do you hear me, Ma?
Yeah, I hear you.
I can't help you.
Okay, listen, what you got to do is give me some money, okay?
Jim, I can't do that.
Why not?
Mom, you know I'm not going to do anything with it.
I just need to go out of town for a little while 'cause I got into some trouble, and I need some help.
Okay?
So, you got to give me some money, Mom.
Can you hold my hand?
Yeah, I'll hold your hand.
Mom, can you give me some money, please?
Mom, can you give me some money, please?
Stop fucking around!
I can't.
Mom, give me some fucking money, please!
What are you doing?
I'm your son!
I don't have any.
Mom, don't fuck around like this!
Give me some money!
Mom!
Come on!
Let me in the fucking door!
Oh, God.
Oh, fuck.
Let me in.
I need some money.
I need some money real bad.
Oh, God.
Someone's breaking into my apartment.
They have a knife.
Mom!
You don't understand, Mom.
You don't know what you're fucking doing to me.
Mom, I'm in pain.
How could you do this to your son, you bitch?
You fucking bitch!
Oh, let me in!
I'll do anything!
I'll be a good boy!
I'll be a good boy, mom, if you let me in.
Get off me!
Get off!
No!
No!
You fuckers!
You're not going to do this!
Fuck you!
Ma!
Don't do this!
Ma!
Ma!
Ma!
I got six months in Riker's Island for assault, robbery, resisting arrest, and possession of narcotics.
I sweated out a horrible cure and stayed clean the whole stretch even though it's been easier to get good junk in here than it is on the street.
Shit, it's been hard, man.
All I've been doing is reading these diaries and wondering how the hell I'm still alive, and even if I care.
Suffice to say that I'm finished with the asshole bandits of shower-room rape, and suffice to say that those swine guards won't draw blood from my ankles again.
Suffice to say that I've been just thinking about dumb stuff like what a nice concept it is to have a godmother and a godfather, wondering who my godparents might be.
My mom won't visit me here, so I guess I'll just have to wait till I get home to ask.
Jim?
Who's there?
It's me.
Pedro?
What's up, man?
Nothing.
You know.
I...
I hear you come here.
I just came by to say hi.
I'm sorry about that night at the candy store and everything.
It's all right.
Reform school turned out to be real cool, so don't sweat it.
Did you hear about Mickey, that scumbag?
He went and threw some chump off a roof.
He's getting 5 to 15 years, man.
They tried him like an adult.
Shit.
I got a present for you, Jim.
A bag of the finest dope in Manhattan.
You know, me and you?
Like old times?
I can't.
Come on.
It would be dynamite.
I got this thing to do.
Why don't you come check it out?
No.
I'm going to go, then, you know?
You know how it is.
Take care of yourself, little man.
Know this.
There's different types of users of junk.
You got your rich dilettante square-ass who dabbles now and then and always has enough money to run off to the Riviera if he feels he's fucking around to the danger point.
Street junkies hate these pricks, but they're always suckers, and their money makes them tolerable.
Then you got your upper-middle-class
Westchester preppies... same as the others, basically.
What they're good for is opening their mommy and daddy's eyes to this social virus and putting pressure on the government to do something about it.
Then there's us street kids.
Start fucking around very young,
13 or so...
We think we all got it under control and won't get strung out.
This rarely works.
I'm living proof.
But in the end, you just got to see the junk as another 9-to-5 gig.
The hours are just a bit more inclined to shadows.

[Woman] Go fuck yourself, you son of a bitch bastard!
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done, you fuck!
Give us this day our daily bread, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Jesus, Jesus the Nazarene.
Go to hell.
Go to hell.
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Jim, you're not going to waste the whole day lying around?
Ma, I'm up.
The loony alarm went off.
Close the blinds.
Don't look at her.
Don't listen.
How could I not?
Jesus the Nazarene.
[Pffft]
Mary the whore.
Mary the hairdresser.
Our Father, Who art...
Hey, lady!
Shut up!
[Jim] When I was young, about 8 or so,
I tried making friends with God by inviting him to my house to watch the World Series.
He never showed.

[Bell Rings]
Too bad, Father.
I was just starting to enjoy myself.
We can do it again tomorrow if you like, Mr. Carroll.
You O.K., Jim?
Does it hurt?
You want to rub it for him, Pedro?
Jim, give it a rest.
You'll never beat him.
The guy's a pervert.
Did you hear him?
"We can do it again tomorrow if you like."
Let's cut out of here.
Come on.
# I was born in a pool #
# They made my mother stand #
# I spat on that surgeon #
# And his trembling hand #
# When I felt the light #
# I was worse than bored #
# I stole a doctor's scalpel #
# And I slit the cord #
# I was a Catholic boy #
# I was redeemed through pain #
# Not through joy #
# I was two months early #
# They put me under glass #
# I screamed and cursed their children #
# When the nurses passed #
# I was convicted of theft #
# As I slid from the womb #
# They led me straight from my mother #
# To a cell in the tombs #
# I was a Catholic boy #
# Redeemed through pain #
# Not through joy #
# They starved me for weeks #
# They thought they'd teach me fear #
# I fed on cellmates' dreams #
# It gave me fine ideas #
# When they cut me loose #
# The time had served me well #
# I'd made allies in heaven #
# Comrades in hell #
# I was a Catholic child #
# The blood ran red #
# The blood ran wild ##
[Retching]
Why, you little prick!
This is my new shirt!
Guys, let's go.
I threw up on somebody.
I'll get you!
You little prick!
Your mother!
Bastard!
I'll fucking throw you in the river!
[Boat Horn Blows]
Hey!
Ha ha ha!
What about the four of us versus Wilt Chamberlain?
He was the greatest.
Four of us?
What will you do, Pedro, tie his shoes together when he ain't looking?
All right...
the three of us.
No problem.
You're kidding, right, Mickey?
No.
He can't cover all of us at the same time.
You guys don't miss open jumpers.
You know who will be there for the rebounds.
Rebounds?
That freak is 7 feet tall.
I can rebound with anybody.
You're sniffing too much of that shit.
Chamberlain would destroy all of us.
All we got to do is move the ball around.
There's no way we don't win.
Mickey, you could beat him yourself.
You don't need us.
Perfect example...
confidence.
I know I could beat him.
Holy shit.
Look at this place.
If our school was this nice,
I'd go more than once a week.
You?
We got a game today, gentlemen.
Who's ready to play some roundball?
I said, who's ready to play some ball?
You give me that laid-back,
"I'm doing my own thing, Jack" attitude out there today, and you're going to find yourself watching the game from the bench.
No smoking, Iggy...
stunts your growth.
You want to be big and strong like me, don't you?
Out.
No smoking, and no pulling your peckers before a game.
Swifty, do you mind?
I'm taking a dump.
Get out of here!
Something die in there?
When we play our game... so Pedro vomits on his head, right?
It goes all over his hair, trickles down his neck.
Some gets in his eye.
Don't lie about it, either.
What are you doing?
We're signing a ball for Bobby.
Can I sign?
Yeah.
"We're holding your spot for you, kid.
Swifty."
All right.
This one's for Bobby.
All right.
Who's better than we are?
- Nobody!
- Nobody!
Right!
Go ahead.
Do some warm-ups.
Pedro, you're in charge.
You're my eyes and ears.
Hey, Jim.
Yeah.
That's a nice thing you're doing for Bobby.
Oh, thanks.
Thanks.
You seen Neutron?
I think he's talking to a scout from Saint John's, as a matter of fact.
You want to play college ball, don't you?
Yeah.
Someday, I hope.
You know.
Yeah.
Scouts are sniffing you out already.
They like them young.
I'll tell you what.
You come by sometime, and we'll go over the schools together.
Yeah.
All right.
Yeah.
We'll get a pizza, and we'll make a night of it.
Um... actually, my nights are kind of busy right now.
Yeah.
Homework and all, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[Cheering]
We were the hottest Catholic high school team in New York City, on our way to the championship.
We felt like nothing could stop us.
[Swifty] Yeah!
Yeah!
Yes!
We're on our way.
We're on our way.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Hands up.
Show me some defense.
Show me some defense.
Good steal.
Put it in.
Yeah!
[Cheering]
All right.
All right.
Way to go.
Aw, geez.
All right, Neutron.
Yes!
Yes!
To the hole, Jim.
[Whistle Blows]
Whoa!
Whoa!
What's going on?
Break it up!
Come on.
Hit him!
Beat that motherfucker!
[Whistle Blows]
Break it up!
He fucking held me!
[Swifty] Whoa, whoa, whoa!
This dude blows the whistle...
Slow it down!
Slow it down!
[Whistle]
[Cheering]
[Clang]
You got to have presence on the court... presence like a cheetah rather than a chimp.
They both got it, but chimpy got to jump his nuts around to get it.
Shy cheetah just moves in total nonchalance a sec or two in his sexy, slow strut.
Me, I play like a cheetah.
[Cheering]
[Crowd] Let's go, Rangers!
Let's go, Rangers!
Let's go, Rangers!
[Cheering]
Yeah!
Ooh!
You got it!
It's ours.
It's ours.
Oh!
Yeah!
[Crowd] 9, 8, 7,
6, 5,
4, 3,
2, 1.
Yay, Jim!
Oh, shit.
That's my team!
That's my team!
[Crowd Cheering]
There's only two things Swifty forbids... using the word "motherfucker"
and stealing from the other team, as long as they're white.
How much for that group of winners?
It's $34.90.
$34.90?
Changed the prices or something?
No.
Uh...
I'm a little short.
Do me a favor.
Here.
Take my watch, and I'll come back later with the rest of the money.
No.
What do you mean, no?
I'm sorry, sir.
Those burgers are worth more than the watch is.
I'll be right back.
I told you one burger each, didn't I?
It takes at least eight of these to get filled up.
Come on, Swifty.
We're growing boys.
Growing boys?
We're hungry motherfuckers.
Funny, huh?
I'm not driving you guys home.
How's that for laughs?
[Knock On Window]
[No Audible Dialogue]
You ripped them off, didn't you?
We're even now.
Swifty, come on.
How are we going to get home?
Face the music, pricks.
What are we going to do?
They got the door blocked off.
You afraid of these pussies?
I ain't afraid of anybody.
What's the problem?
I'm going to ask you this once.
All right?
Where's the stuff you stole from me?
What are you talking about?
No.
You're not going to fuck with me, all right?
Somebody stole my father's ring from my locker.
You want me to cut you?
There's no problem here.
Hey, guys!
Get out of here!
You need a fucking army, huh?
Aah!
Come on!
Come on!
Yeah, Pedro.
Oh.
Nice.
That from Bobo?
Ha ha ha!
That's his father's ring.
[Slurring Words] Hey, fellas.
Any of you looking for a date?
Yeah.
Me, sweetheart.
Little horsy ride in Central Park, maybe candlelight dinner?
Why don't we skip right to dessert, huh, baby?
About $15?
I'll give you a quarter.
Let Pedro suck your tits.
You don't have to be rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
How about you, handsome, huh?
You got $15... for a little head?
Diane, do I look like I need to pay for it?
Yeah... you do.
If it's worth it.
Jimmy...
Jimmy, I know you want some, honey.
$15.
I'll do you so good you'll never forget it, baby.
Hey, hey!
Ooh!
That's a deal.
Bargain from there.
What do you say, guys?
You want to do it?
Yeah.
It's a deal.
All four of us.
Aw, shit.
This is all I got, Diane.
Here, have a pretzel.
Get out of here.
Beat it.
[Diane] Yeah, fuck you!
Fucking dopehead.
You see what that shit does to you?
Wow.
Speaking of dopeheads, is that Pedro's mother over there slinging her wares again?
It is!
Hey, Peepee, where you going?
Why do you have to be such an asshole?
Why is the little shoe crying anyway?
His mother's a sneaker.
His father's a loafer.
Somebody's got to be a heel.
Jim, where you going?
Hey, Jim!
Jim.
Hey.
Hey, man.
What's up?
You don't recognize me with my new hairdo?
It's nice.
It's nice.
I like it.
What's going on?
How are you?
Good.
Wow.
Look at that.
You like it?
When you get out of here, we'll all shave our heads.
It's a deal.
All right.
I got something for you here.
Yeah.
Everyone on the team.
Look right here... even Swifty signed it.
Thanks, man.
You remember when I dunked on that spade in Riverside Park?
You always had good ups.
Yeah.
Oh.
I got something to show you.
Hold on.
What?
Pedro got these out of some lady's purse.
She's doing it with a donkey.
Oh, Jesus.
Look at that schlong.
Look at that.
Oh, I beat your record.
How many times you choke it?
Seven times.
Bullshit.
Seven times.
Mom thinks I have a cold year-round because of all the tissues around the house.
You can keep those if you want.
They're pumping so much junk in me,
I can't even get a decent chubby.
I got an idea.
Come on.
Let's go.
Where we going?
I'm getting you out of here.
What are you, crazy, man?
I can't go anywhere.
Here you go.
I've known Bobby since I was 3.
He's my best friend.
He was the best player on our basketball team.
Two years ago, he got leukemia.
He keeps fighting it off.
I know Bobby's going to beat it.
He could beat anything.
[Jim] Rrr... watch!
Jim, you're going to kill me, man.
If you let go, I swear...
I swear I'll kill you, man.
Watch the bump!
What the hell happened to forty deuce?
Last time I was here, that theater was playing Sperminator II.
Oh, yeah.
I remember that.
No, man.
This whole block has been done over by all these new artists.
It's pretty cool, huh?
Yeah.
They should put your stuff up there.
Yeah.
Right.
Still scribbling stuff in that notebook of yours, ain't you?
Of course.
You bring anything for me?
What, like to read?
No, like to eat.
What do you think?
Yeah.
I mean, I got this, but it's not a big deal.
I don't even remember writing it, to tell you the truth.
Yeah, Yeah.
I'll be the judge of this.
"Little kids shoot marbles
"where branches break the sun
"into graceful shafts of light.
I just want to be pure."
I just want to be pure.
[Seductive Music Playing]
All right.
# What a life #
Nothing like the real thing to float your boat, huh, Bobby?
# What a life #
# Didn't know where, didn't know when... #
That's nice.
# Said that I'll go...
go learn #
# Put up my hand, wait my turn #
# But it never comes, I have to shout out #
# That's life #
# And that's what it's all about #
# So through the comfort and the strife #
# What a life... ##
Get me out of here, Jim.
What are you talking about, man?
This was a stupid idea.
I don't feel so good.
Well, can we wait till the end of the show?
Did you hear me?
Get me the hell out of here!
Hey, Bob, man...
I'm really sorry.
you know?
Next time, we'll go somewhere...
Ain't gonna be no next time, Jim.
I love it this way... my feet against the tar, which is soft from the spring heat, the slight breeze that runs across your entire body, especially your crotch.
You feel an incredible power being naked under a dome of stars while a giant city is dressed, dodging cars all around you five flights down.
I don't think of anything while I'm doing the actual tugging, least of all the heavy sex fantasies
I have to resort to indoors.
Just my own naked self and the stars breathing down, and it's beautiful.
Time sure flies when you're young and jerking off.
[Woman Reads With Difficulty] "Camp summer position.
Driver... taxi."
Hey, that might be good.
You could get your license this summer.
Oh, yeah, Mom.
That sounds really great.
Hey, get your own job, and if you don't get it this summer, you're coming to work with me at the hotel.
Mom, please.
Why are you so worried?
Do I even ask you for money?
No.
I'm not worried about the money.
I want you to have responsibility.
I don't want you running around the streets of New York.
Idle time is the devil's plaything.
The devil's plaything, huh?
Mm-hmm.
That might be a cool title for my first book.
What are you talking about?
What are you writing?
Devil's plaything.
Here.
Ooh.
Um...
Ma, I'm not really hungry this morning.
Come on.
You got to eat something.
I know.
Where you going?
I'm going to shoot some hoops.
Sometimes I feel like something's chasing me, like there's some whacko on a roof somewhere who could snuff me out at any moment.
Will I have time to finish the poems breaking loose in my head?
Hey, white boy, you ready for your beating?
Don't let your mouth get you into something your ass can't handle.
I'll shoot you for it.
So it's going to be like that, huh?
I... don't think so.
Yeah!
All right, so you made one.
Big deal.
You made one shot.
Make another.
# The days are muzzled in a vibe #
# I swing back from time to time #
# There's a Camaro, rusty red #
# That all my best friends drive in #
# Can you smell the summer air?
#
# Take me where they left the light on #
# Getting close, almost there #
# If that fuzzy silver badge #
# Don't greet us there #
# My head's dizzy, and I'm taking... ##
Yo, Jim!
What's the score?
Come on.
We got to go.
They don't keep score in this game.
Jim, come on.
We're losing the sun.
He's being a dick.
You want me to put a charge in his ass?
Look at right here.
What's this?
Jim's secret diary he's always writing in.
Bet you he wrote some shit about me.
Oh, right here.
"Spring...
Mickey."
Hey, there I am.
Jim says,
"Mickey takes out a bottle of carbonic cleaning fluid and suggests we do a little sniffing to get high."
Whoo!
"After four deep whiffs, we're sailing someplace else."
Mickey, what are you doing?
"Bells ringing through my ears, little lights flashing through my eyes."
Mickey, put that down, all right?
"I pictured myself
"paddling across a river with black water,
"only the canoe was going backwards instead of forwards,
"with clouds that had faces laughing spooky fun-house laughs..."
What is that shit?
Don't be a schmuck.
What are you talking about?
Don't you ever touch that again.
It's private.
What's your problem?
I'm...
I'm sorry.
He's writing about me, I can't read about it?
Jesus.
Hey, Jim, come on.
We're gone.
Yo, we got a cab!
Hey, cabby!
Hey, swami!
So, Shakespeare, you going to finish the game?
Reggie, you know this game never ends.
See you later, all right?
Every crowd has its little games to prove if you're a punk or not.
My cousin in Jersey plays chickie, which is two cars heading towards each other at about 80 miles per hour.
First driver to swerve out of the way is chicken.
In Brooklyn, they make you press a lit cigarette into your arm and have it burn all the way down to the filter without the slightest flinch.
Us Manhattan boys, we jump off cliffs into the Harlem River, which is literally shitty because half a million toilets flush into it every day.
Whoo-oo!
[Whistles]
Yeah!
Whoo!
Yeah!
I carried the clothes up, but I ain't carrying them down.
Peepee, this is you... all 33 pounds of you, gone with the wind.
Wow.
That's a long way down.
Devil's toe is no big deal.
We've all done it a million times.
I never done it.
You never did it?
Pedro, you never do nothing.
You know who was awesome on this rock?
Bobby.
He would do back flips off this rock.
Hey, Mickey.
What?
Don't talk about him like he's dead.
He's not dead.
There goes the circle line.
Check it out.
[Horn Blows]
Whoo!
Full moon!
Whoo!
Hey, yo!
Whoo!
Hey, circle this!
[Whistle]
Hey, I'm going.
I'm going to show you how to do it.
Ye-ea-ah!
[Men Shouting]
[Man] He's crazy!
That was a good jump.
Oh, he's nuts.
Hey, I'm going to walk down.
You can't walk down.
There's no way to walk down.
I ain't jumping.
Your clothes are down there.
You going to walk around naked?
Pedro, if you don't jump,
Mickey's going to tease you.
Jump and get it over with.
What the hell, right?
Oh... shit...
Pedro!
Bad form.
Bad form.
Oh!
My God!
Shit.
Is he all right?
Pedro, you all right?
You ready?
Yeah.
Listen, don't tell the other guys, but when we leave here, I got a surprise for you.
Tell me what it is.
It's a surprise.
Trust me, all right?
You ready?
Come on.
Let's jump.
On three.
Ready?
Uh-huh.
1, 2,
3.
Come on.
Let's go.
What's up, Manny?
How you doing?
Fine.
Thank you, sir.
This is my friend Jim.
How you doing?
I can't believe I hit my head on that rock.
It's killing me.
Jim, um, this is Winkie.
Hi.
How you doing?
Good.
And this... this is Blinkie.
Hi.
# I lost my heart #
# Under the bridge #
# That little girl... #
I've seen you play ball, Jim.
You're a very beautiful player.
Very zen.
# And now I moan #
# And now I holler #
# She'll never know #
# Just what I found #
# That blue-eyed girl # lt'll make you fuck like Superman.
# She said no more #
# She said no more #
Faster than a speeding bullet...
# That blue-eyed girl #
# Became blue-eyed whore... #
More powerful than a locomotive...
# Down by the water #
# Down by the water... #
Able to, um...
I can't think of anything with a single bound.
# Just like my daughter #
# See her again #
# See her again... #
Do you have any protection?
Yeah.
This one's, uh, ribbed for extra pleasure.
So what are you waiting for?
What do you mean?
Take off your clothes.
Well, uh... could we shut off the lights first?
# Little fish, big fish #

White ship disappears in the wave machine this morning.
Your eyes got shut with secret chains that pillow armies eventually set free... like soft horses through toy deserts.
I love this mansion, though it's too many windows... to open halfway each morning... to close halfway each night.
I looked at his body, and it was death for the first time.
His face was thin and wrinkled, almost apelike, his hair just gray patches on his scalp.
He looked 60 years old, and he was 16.
Couldn't believe how skinny he was... much skinnier than he was in the hospital.
It was like having the skeleton of someone you knew put right in front of you.
I felt dazed, like I'd just come out of a four-hour movie I didn't understand.
I kept thinking about his face... and death... and what a cheat the whole thing was.
Remember that Halloween when Bobby filled that paper bag with dog shit, lit it on fire, and put it outside Father Dunne's door, and we all hid behind the dumpster?
Yeah.
I could picture Father Dunne stepping on that shit, picture him in the john scraping the shit off his shoe like this.
You think that'll keep him out of heaven?
Are you kidding?
Jesus Christ himself would have laughed at that.
It was hilarious.
What about the time at the formal when Bobby got caught in the bathroom with Mary Ann Dugan and McNulty busted him?
He was, like, "Father, I swear.
We weren't doing anything."
Meanwhile she's got a giant wad of cum hanging off her face.
I tell you, that kid was definitely a pisser.
It was weird seeing him today, man.
He was all shriveled up and wrinkled.
He looked like my grandfather.
I'll tell you what, though.
That kid was in so much pain, it's better off he died.
How the hell would you know, Mickey?
Did you go and visit him?
Huh?
Did any of you guys go and visit him?
All right.
Then shut the fuck up.
Look at my brother's girlfriend in the park.
She's eating a sandwich.
Next thing you know, she's shot.
She's dead.
It's over.
[Neutron] What about little Teddy Rayhill?
Perfect example.
Remember that night he was on the roof, doing poppers and having a great time?
He started walking backwards...
Boom!
He fell right off the goddamn roof.
It was meant to be, right?
Fuck that, you guys!
Bobby was the best fucking guy around, you know that?
What are you, a bunch of idiots?
You don't even understand, do you?
Jim, you all right?
Huh?
Listen, maybe you should talk to one of the priests.
I don't know.
Maybe...
Maybe they can help you out.
Help me out?
I wouldn't ask one of those cocksuckers for directions.
You know what?
You guys need to lighten the fuck up, all right?
Let bygones be fucking bygones.
Shitty fucking world.
[Crash]
Live life to the fucking fullest.
You know what I mean?
Shit happens, man.
Shit fucking happens.
[Thunder]
Come on.
Let's go.
Jim, come on.
You're growing up, and rain sort of remains on the branches of a tree that will someday rule the earth.
And that's good that there's rain.
Clears the month of your sorry rainbow expressions.
And it clears the streets of the silent armies so we can dance.

Did I ever tell you about the first time I did heroin?
I went down to Pedro's basement.
All sorts of characters were in the storage-room shooting gallery.
I was just going to sniff a bag, but a guy says,
"If you're going to sniff,
"might as well pop it,
"and if you're going to pop it, might as well mainline."
I was scared of needles, but I gave in.
It was like a long heat wave through my body.
Any ache or pain or sadness or guilty feeling was completely flushed out.
Look, Ma, I'm not in the mood for your dime-store psychology, all right?
Could you just please leave me alone?
I got a little sick, all right?
We're not going to live like this, Jim.
I'm warning you!
I'm telling you.
Oh, God, Mom.
You're always warning me, aren't you?
Blah, blah, blah.
You're always in my fucking ear.
You don't know anything.
What are you talking about?
Go clean toilets or whatever the hell it is you do.
When you're done, clean this one.
Don't talk like that!
What's the matter with you?
Gee whiz, Ma, you know... we got to have these heart-to-heart talks more often.
They're really good for us.
I don't know you.
I don't believe this is you, Jim.
Please, Jim.
I don't know who you are.
Yeah, I know.
I was such a good little boy, right... with such potential, wasn't that it?
Is that what you're going to say?
[Retching]
Oh, Jim.
What's happening?
Jim, what's happening?
First, it's a Saturday-night thing, and you feel cool, like a gangster or a rock star.
It's just something to kill the boredom, you know?
They call it a chippie, a small habit.
It feels so good, you start doing it on Tuesdays, then Thursdays.
Then it's got you.
Every wise-ass punk on the block says it won't happen to them, but it does.
Go do it!
I ain't doing it.
I always do it!
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could you tell me the fastest way to the subway?
Yeah.
That's the "B" train.
Go to this corner and make a left.
It's right there.
What are you doing?
Let go!
Let go!
Let go of that!
Oh, my God!
What?
Oh!
Help!
No!
No!
What are you doing?
Let's go!
[Jim] Come on!
[Whispering] I don't feel like going in today.
Father, is it all right if I don't go in today?
Why?
What are you scared of?
Nothing.
I just don't feel like it, that's all.
I imagine you have more to confess than anybody here.
Unburden yourself.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been about four months since my last confession.
Yes, my son?
Well, I don't know where to start, Father.
Have you taken the name of Jesus Christ in vain?
Yeah.
Yeah, I have.
Have you disrespected your mother and father?
Uh-huh.
Have you stolen or cheated your fellow man?
Yeah, but I'm not proud of it.
Have you had impure thoughts or engaged in impure deeds?
Oh, Father, you have no idea.
Is there something else that you want to tell me in your own words?
I've done all kinds of crazy shit.
Oh, excuse me, Father.
Fuck, I'm s...
Christ, I have a dirty mouth.
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry about that.
Can I just go on?
10 Hail Marys, five Our Fathers.
What do you mean?
That's it?
That's my punishment?
You know something?
My friend Bobby, he was the best, and he's dead.
This sucks.
You know that?
This really sucks.
It's not fair, Father.
Your nose is running, your stomach cramps, your legs feel like they've played six straight games on top of each other, and the voice is always there in the back of your head...
"Just one more time.
then we'll stop."
Quick to the ball.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Good, Ignatius.
Quick to the ball.
All right if I use the bathroom, Coach?
Jim, you got a bladder like a woman.
Let's go.
Again.
Right behind him.
Right behind him.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Two hands.
Jim?
I thought you were taking a piss.
Oh.
What are you doing in here every practice?
Have you been waiting for me, Jim?
Giving me some kind of a signal?
What are you talking about, Swifty?
Don't act surprised.
Do we understand each other?
It's not going to happen, Swifty.
Put the money away.
You want more?
Here.
Just let me do it.
Get the fuck out of my face!
Take it easy, Jim.
You can't blame me for trying.
I made a mistake, all right?
Let's just pretend it never happened.
Things will go back to exactly how they were before.
O. K?
O.K., here.
Keep the money.
Keep the money.
Just don't tell anybody, all right?
Good.
Tell anybody you want!
Nobody's going to believe a drughead like you.
You think we don't know what you've been doing?
Give me the fucking money and get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck out!
Come on!
Get out of here!
And you want to stop.
You really do.
But it's like a dream.
You can't stop dreams.
They move in crazy pieces, any way they want to, and suddenly, you're capable of anything.
[Echoing Footsteps]
Ha ha ha!
[indistinct Slow-Motion Voice]
No!
Wake up, Mr. Carroll!
It's later than you think.
Oh.
All right!
I need a lift.
All right.
What do you got?
Three different pills.
Which are the ups?
I never asked.
I thought one of youse would know.
Oh, great.
We look like pharmacists?
I don't know what to take.
What do we take?
Let me see.
The blacks and the reds are the ups.
I think the pink ones are the ups.
Why?
I associate pink with lightness, you know?
The black ones seem like they'd knock you on your ass.
They might be faded seconals.
No, they're not faded.
They'd be sticky.
They're not.
That's bullshit.
Fuck your mother.
My what?
Your mother.
All right!
Calm down.
Don't ever talk about my mother.
Don't ever hit me like that again.
Come on.
Give me your hat.
We got a game to play.
Just give me something.
Hi, Neutron.
Let me ask him.
Neutron, you know which ones are the ups?
I think you should put that shit away before Swifty comes in here.
Why you acting like such a square ass?
Screw you, Mickey.
Screw you, too, Tough guy.
Man.
I'm just going to take the black.
You sure?
Mm-hmm.
You got a better idea?
Nope.
Your guess is as good as mine, Jimbo.
It's on today.
50 rebounds.
Good.
Come on.
Let's go.
I'm your friend now, right?
What, I got to smack you again?
Come on.
Yeah, take your little rat with you.
What's up, man?
What's up?
Why are you acting like that?
You know what's wrong.
Used to be about getting high and playing basketball.
Now it's just about getting high.
You're blowing it, Jim.
Oh, come on.
I don't need to hear this from you.
Yeah, you do.
I'm really proud of you.
Everything's cool.
You look great.
I'll see you in the NBA.

Did you find it?
No, Father.
It's clean.
There's no drugs in there.
Thank you, Officer.
I told you we didn't have nothing.
You boys think you're awfully smart, don't you?
Well, you're both suspended for a week!
Ooh...
[Swifty] You'll never play basketball here again.
That you can count on.
You can't kick me off the team, Swifty.
Oh?
Why is that?
'Cause I quit the team... and the school and this whole faggot-ass scene, that's why.
I could second that motion.
Your resignations are accepted!
[Mickey] Neutron, you coming with us?
Huh?
Yeah.
That's what I figured.
Come on, man.
I'm fucking out of here.
Don't worry, Swifty.
I'm not going to rat you out.
And in the next life, Father,
I'm going to have the paddle.
Get out!
Thanks a lot, Neutron.
Thanks, man.
I can't believe this, you know?
I know.
What happened to the pills?
We got kicked out of school, Mickey.
Who cares, man?
We lost the pills.
We can't play ball anymore.
Jim, who cares about school, man?
We just lost $40 worth of pharmaceuticals.
I know what happened to them, too.
The cops, they take that all the time.
They either pop them themselves or they sell them.
What's my mom going to say, man?
She ain't gonna say nothing.
You just tell her you're going to school every day.
Let's get out of here, man...
Go get into something.
[Jim's Mother] You never sold any pills at the schoolyard?
No.
So it's all a big conspiracy against you.
Right, Jim?
Yeah.
Maybe it is.
Maybe it's not.
You been missing these?
What are you going to tell me...
they're vitamins?
Oh, fuck you, Ma.
What?
Get out of my house!
Oh, is that what you want, Ma?
Get out!
You don't talk to me that way!
If that's what you want,
I'm fucking out of here.
All right?
What are you doing?
I'm leaving!
What do you think?
Take all your shit!
I'll help you.
You want me to leave?
Yes.
Get out!
I'm out of here.
Out of my way!
This garbage is going to kill you, Jim!
I'm gone!
Going to kill you!
[Coughing]
Don't you understand
I can't watch you kill yourself?
Ma, you're never going to fucking see me again.
All right?
Just remember that.
Don't say that, Jim.
Don't say that!
[Trophy Clatters On Street]
It was a dream, not a nightmare... a beautiful dream I could never imagine in a thousand nods.
I saw this girl next to me who wasn't beautiful until she smiled, and I felt that smile come at me and heat waves following, soaking through my body and out my fingertips in shafts of color.
And I knew somewhere in the world... somewhere...
that there was love for me.
[Car Honks In Distance]
We just got to raise enough cash to keep our heads straight.
Luckily, finding money in New York is like getting laid at the prom... easy.
[Car Starts]
Fuck it!
Pedro!
What's the matter with you?
Jesus!
Watch the road!
You could kill us all.
I get 1,500 bucks for this car.
Whacked up, it's worth nothing.
We should buy shit in bulk.
We'll put it on the street and make real money.
That's 500 bucks apiece.
We'll be on for days, nights, weeks.
Yeah, man.
I'd love to go to Puerto Rico, soak up some rays, you know?
See my bitch?
That's what I'd like to do.
What are you talking about?
What bitch?
We haven't seen a picture or nothing.
She's 500 pounds, Jim.
She got a mustache thicker than her father.
No.
That's your mother, Mickey.
She does not exist.
Don't fool yourself.
Be careful.
I'm about to whack.
Oh, shit, man.
My brother's going to take care of us and this car.
Pedro, wake the fuck up!
Pedro, come on, man!
You're going to get us killed!
I got it, man.
You want me to drive?
Mickey, you better drive.
I'm serious, man.
Just don't blow my high.
If the car's scratched, my brother will kill me.
Yo, get out of the booth!
Get out the booth, huh?
Get out.
Fucking...
What's up?
Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Where's the car?
It's good to see you, too.
It's over here.
It's nice.
It's smokin'.
You tell me that?
It's everything you wanted.
Get your hands off.
You guys look like shit.
Oh, my God.
They're taking the car.
Show me the sign, man!
Show me the freaking sign!
It's right there.
You see?
It says "tow-away." Huh?
You scumbags even read?
I should kick all your punk asses!
Goddamn it!
I can get you another car tonight.
John Halligan is waiting for this car.
I got him out of bed with his wife.
You know how this makes me fucking look?
Kenny, get off.
Lay off!
You're too stupid to be my brother!
You're too stupid!
You want a piece of me, Carroll?
Back off!
Back off!
Kenny, no more!
Mr. Tough Guy.
Kenny, no more!
Huh?
Tough guy?
Tough guy?
[Bone Snapping]
Give me a sip of your soda.
You wipe off the bottle before you take a sip?
You don't even think twice about sharing works with Mickey.
You think you'll catch something from the bottle you won't catch from a needle?
You mistake me for somebody who gives a shit.
Headquarters...
home on and off to every down-and-out junkie and wino from 14th Street to the Bowery.
It's like a fucking all-star team.
Jimmy, the other day, my mother's been ragging on me,
"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
"You've tried every other way.
Go to church.
Put yourself in Christ's hands."
So I do it, man.
I figure, give it a shot.
I dig Jesus.
So, I go, man.
High mass...
a choir and everything.
The first thing I see on the right, the side altar, are those little candles in the red glass that we used when it was windy in the park to cook up.
And then, this altar boy, he's coming down the aisle with this 6-foot candle.
I envision this huge spoon above it, man, with, like, shopping bags full of dope inside of it.
And then the kicker comes, man.
The priest, he starts doing the thing with the incense.
You know, starts wafting out.
I'm in the back.
It finally hits me.
"Where do I know this smell from, man?
My room, man."
It's the smell exactly of really primo dope cooking up.
Oh, yeah?
Exactly the same.
So what happened next?
At that point, I split.
I went home,
I went inside my closet,
I got my stash out of the inside pocket of my sharkskin easter suit, and I got stoned.
Ba bing... ba bang.
I love a ritual.
[Jim's Mother] Oh, Mary, if you can hear me...
[Sniffling]
I need you to fill Jim's heart with love because he really needs it now.
Oh, God... please watch over my son.
He needs you now.
Just take care of him, O. K?
I'll be O.K.
[Sniffling]
I love you, Jim.
I love you.
Hey, you holding?
You straight, man?
Get out of here.
Come on.
No.
Hey, have you seen Falco?
Come on, man.
Are you holding anything?
Hey, Diane.
Come here, Diane.
I'll take care of you, babe.
Yeah?
Yeah.
How about some of this?
Ha ha!
I wouldn't do you for a bag, you fucking piece of shit.
Jim.
Jimmy.
Ha ha ha!
You're looking good.
Who's your embalmer?
I want some of what you got.
[Pushes Chair]
Shh.
Check everything in this place.
Wow.
I always wanted to use these syrup pumps.
And these professional ice-cream scoopers.
Oh, my God.
[Spraying Seltzer]
Don't make me do it!
I'll do it!
I swear to God!
Jim, watch out.
Come on!
[Mickey] It's not opening.
They don't make them like this anymore.
You got to get it from the side.
I got it!
Oh, cool.
Change!
Shit!
Let's get out of here.
It's locked.
We got to go out the back.
Pedro, let's get out of here!
What am I, hallucinating here?
Pedro, you'll get us caught.
The cops are going to come.
Oh, you want to be tough, huh?
Go ahead...
take another sip so I can blow your fucking head off!
[Sirens In Distance]
Go ahead, Pedro!
Come on, guys!
Put that gun away!
Don't fuck with me, motherfucker!
What the hell are you doing?
What the hell did you do that for?
Let that little spic rot, man!
He'll get us caught.
Jim, the cops are coming.
Come on!
[Pedro] Jim!
Jim!
[Sirens Outside]
Pedro!
Pedro!
Jim!
Freeze!
Freeze!
On your stomach!
On your stomach!
I didn't do anything, I'm telling you!
[Sirens]
[indistinct Dialogue On Television]
This is it, man.
That Jew got to keep the money under his pillow.
Hey, Jim, I know you're still mad about Pedro.
I couldn't do nothing, man.
He was going to get us caught.
Shouldn't have went that far.
What happened?
Your mother kick your ass?
Yeah, real funny.
Bring us a couple of Cokes, will you?
You all right?
Hey, bartender, move out of the way.
Jim, i'm getting sick.
I got to get some money to cop.
Jim.
You with me here?
What the hell are you wa...
Oh, shit.
That's Neutron.
The all-American high-school game?
We could have played in that game.
Who gives a shit?
Come on.
I'm waiting to hear back on a scholarship from Saint John's.
Jim, I'm starting to jones.
We need some money.
Jim, don't dwell on these dreams, man.
Will you come on?
Meet you outside, man.
I'm getting sick.
You want to meet me out there?
Can I say hi to my mom?
Hi, Mom.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
# You don't know it, but you're coming right along #
# Please be strong #
# You don't know it, but you're coming right along ##
Hey, you!
Stop!
You can't go in there!
[Man] What do you want?
You realize what time it is?
Yeah.
Um... is Winkie and Blinkie here?
Who the hell are Winkie and Blinkie?
Hey, guys.
Lisa, Mel, you know this boy?
[Together] No, Daddy.
Come on.
All right.
Come on.
Get out of here.
I'm sorry, Mr. Rubin.
He got past me.
Don't let it happen again.
Get out!
What?
What?
Asshole.
Hey, fuck-up, get fucking up, man!
What's your problem, man?
You sold my girlfriend some shit the other day.
You almost killed her.
What was it... rat poison?
She can't handle her drugs.
I want my fucking $20 back.
There's no money-back guarantees.
I'm not selling refrigerators.
Oh, yeah?
I'll cut you a dynamite deal on mexican shit.
Give me my $20, or we'll go outside.
If we go outside, one of us is going to get hurt.
I told you one of us would get hurt.
Is that right?
It's been hard...
the writing...
lately.
Terrible numbness, then suddenly it comes...
[Gunshot] in beautiful fragments or terrible dreams... like nods... so high.
Uh!
Reggie, is that you?
Who the fuck do you think it is?
Ohh... don't worry.
You're not dead yet.
Ohh...
Uhh... it's not bad.
Hey, give me that.
How come it's all wet?
Because you pissed on it.
I didn't say you could read this.
What, have you been digging through my stuff?
I need...
I got to get out of here.
Where's my jacket?
You're welcome.
What the hell am I thanking you for?
Because you was frozen in the snow like a goddamn creamsicle.
Where is it?
What?
You know what the fuck I'm talking about!
Where is it?
You mean this?
Huh?
Give it to me.
I'll cut your fucking throat, Reggie!
Give it to me, all right?
Give it to me!
Give it to me!
Give it to me!
I'm serious!
Give me it!
Give it to me!
[Toilet Flushes]
Goddamn it!
I'll make you an incredible offer.
I'm going to save your life twice in one day.
You should have left me in the fucking snow, man.
Give me the money for my dope, too.
I won't suck your dick, all right?
Put that away.
Who the hell wants you to suck their dick?
Goddamn it!
Look at yourself!
Just look at yourself.
Come on, man.
It's O.K.
Oh, Reggie... it's O.K.
Why are you doing this?
Because once upon a time, somebody helped me, and I always pay what I owe.
[Labored Breathing]
Reggie.
Reggie, I just need a taste.
I just need a little something, Reggie.
[Pulls Telephone Off Table]
You don't understand.
It hurts, Reggie!
Ow!
Reggie, I got to go.
I got to go see my mom.
You got to let me get out of here, Reggie.
Reggie!
It hur...
It hurts.
Aah!
Shit!
Oh, boy...
# Touch the taste and taste the smell #
# Smell the scent, all the gifts you gave to me, baby #
# The food of your brain #
# The room is spinning round #
# I never come down #
[Bang]
# The room is spinning round #
# I never come down... #
Reggie.
you got to give me it.
You got to give me it, Reggie.
Please!
Oh!
Reggie, come on!
[Sobbing And Moaning]
# I remember you, too #
# I blew my mind ##
Wake up.
Can't sleep all day.
Oh.
Thanks.
Uhh.
[Sigh]
Jesus Christ.
What happened to you?
What does it look like?
Motherfucker shot me.
Woke my black ass up.
Shit.
Look, uh...
I'll be back in the morning, Jim.
You just stay cool.
You start to get panicky, write about me in that book of yours.
Actually, I was a little hurt I wasn't mentioned.
You really like my writing, huh, Reggie?
Damn, man, I told you four times already.
You want me to kiss your ass?
Hey, Reg, do me a favor.
While you're out, pick me up a bag.
# The room is spinning round #
# I may never come down #
I am alone.
Not just me.
We're alone... alone forever.
And who's at the end of that forever tunnel I run through, up Fifth with the wallpaper of skyscrapers?
I'm thinking, after all those beautiful trips, that this is one of those bad ones.
Diane.
Hey.
Jim.
Remember me?
Man, you look great.
Yeah, thanks.
Good to see somebody from the old neighborhood.
What do you want, Jim?
You holding anything?
No.
Just like a 5 or something?
Just to tide me over, you know?
Please, Diane?
Come on.
Yeah.
For an old friend?
Why not?
I've been looking all over for this.
Oh, you know what?
I only got a 20.
A 20 is good.
Yeah?
A 20 would help a lot.
You want a 20?
Yeah.
- Go buy some pretzels, asshole.
- [Clink]
You bitch!
You're nothing but a whore!
I don't give a shit about your clothes!
You're still a whore to me!
Yeah?
Shut up.
Look at you.
Oh, are you desperate now, baby?
Who's a whore now?
Don't talk to me like that, you bitch!
Ha ha.
Who's laughing, stupid?
Don't play a game with me!
I know you!
Ah!
Shit.
Oh, man.
Shit.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Mickey.
Mick, what's up, man?
Hey, what's up, man?
Did you get anything?
No, not a dime.
You score?
Yeah, I got something.
What'd you get?
About 35 bucks.
35?
Where'd you get it?
I robbed some fucking asshole on the "D" train.
35 will keep us on for, like, two days.
Well, could we get some stuff, man?
I'm fucking...
my head is...
I see some spics.
I think we can score.
Come on.
They're over here.
Why the fuck do we have to cop on the street all the time?
My fucking nuts are itching like crazy.
Think this is him?
Is your name Pino?
Listen... could we get us some dope?
The dude over there said you could help.
You want to cop some shit?
Let me see some cash.
I got it here.
Let me see.
Hey, no money without no taste.
You want a taste?
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Hurry, man.
Come on.
There's fucking cops all over.
That's good, man.
That's good.
All right, listen...
4 for 35.
4 for 35, man?
Come on, man.
$5.00 short.
What's the big deal?
[Speaking Spanish]
You got four?
Yeah.
We should taste this.
Where are we going to cook it up?
I don't know about his guy.
No, he's cool.
Fuck, man!
What's the matter?
Just taste it!
Come on.
What do you mean?
I tasted it.
He beat us.
He fucking beat us.
I swear to fucking God...
Put that away!
I'm gonna kill this mother!
Put it away!
Come here, motherfucker!
[Gunshots]
[Mickey Yelling]
I'm going to fucking kill you, you motherfucker!
Motherfucker, you're dead!
You hear me?
Where the fuck are you going?
Dude, don't make me do it.
Where's the money?
[Speaking Spanish]
I want the money and the bags.
Where's the fucking money?
The fucking money!
I want it!
Aah!
No!
[Glass Breaks]
We fucking killed him!
What the fuck do you mean, we?
I didn't fucking touch him!
Don't put that shit on me!
He beat us, man!
He deserved it!
You went too far, Mickey!
Oh, shit!
Is he dead?
Of course!
He fell six stories!
Jim, come on.
Come on!
Don't make me leave you here!
[Sirens In Distance]
Oh, shit.
# Star #
# I'll reach you if I try #
# Show me the truth, yeah #

# Reach you if I try #
# Show me the truth, yeah ##
[Shouting]
Come on, get back up!
Come on!
What the fuck?
[Talking Incoherently]
Get off of me!
What are you doing?
[Banging On Door]
Who is it?
Ma...
let me in.
Ma, let me in!
[Banging]
[Loud Banging]
Please, Ma.
[Jim Trying Doorknob]
[Banging]
Ma?
Hey, Ma?
Are you in there, Ma?
Ma, is that you?
Yeah.
Ma?
Ma?
Are you there?
Yeah.
Hi.
[Snorting]
Hi, Ma.
Hi.
Hi.
Listen, I need you to help me out, all right?
I need you to give me some money.
O. K?
I need you to give me, like, five doll...
Like, $20, something like that because I'm in some trouble.
[Snorts And Spits]
Ma?
Do you hear me, Ma?
Yeah, I hear you.
I can't help you.
O.K., listen.
What you got to do is give me some money, O. K?
Jim, I can't do that.
Why not?
Mom, you know I'm not going to do anything with it.
I just need to go out of town for a little while 'cause I got into some trouble, and I need some help.
You got to give me some money, Mom.
Can you hold my hand?
Yeah, I'll hold your hand.
Mom, can you give me some money, please?
Mom, can you give me some money, please?
Stop fucking around!
I can't.
Mom, give me some fucking money,
Please!
What are you doing?
I'm your son!
I don't have any.
Mom, don't fuck around like this!
Give me some money!
Mom!
Come on!
Let me in the fucking door!
[Sobbing]
Oh, God.
Oh, fuck.
Let me in.
I need some money.
I need some money real bad.
Ohh...
Oh, God.
Someone's breaking into my apartment.
They have a knife.
Oh!
Mom!
You don't understand, Mom.
You don't know what you're fucking doing to me.
Mom, I'm in pain.
How could you do this to your son, you bitch?
You fucking bitch!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Oh, let me in!
I'll do anything!
I'll be a good boy!
I'll be a good boy, mom, if you let me in.
Get off me!
Get off!
No!
No!
You fuckers!
You're not going to do this!
Fuck you!
Ma!
Don't do this!
Ma!
Ma!
Oh...
Ma!
[Jail Cell Door Closes And Locks]
I got six months in Riker's Island for assault, robbery, resisting arrest, and possession of narcotics.
I sweated out a horrible cure and stayed clean the whole stretch even though it's been easier to get good junk in here than it is on the street.
Shit, it's been hard, man.
All I've been doing is reading these diaries and wondering how the hell I'm still alive, and even if I care.
Suffice to say that I'm finished with the asshole bandits of shower-room rape, and suffice to say that those swine guards won't draw blood from my ankles again.
Suffice to say that I've been just thinking about dumb stuff like what a nice concept it is to have a godmother and a godfather, wondering who my godparents might be.
My mom won't visit me here, so I guess I'll just have to wait till I get home to ask.
Jim.
Who's there?
It's me.
Pedro?
What's up, man?
Nothing.
You know.
I...
I hear you come here.
I just came by to say hi.
I'm sorry about that night at the candy store and everything.
It's all right.
Reform school turned out to be real cool, so don't sweat it.
Did you hear about Mickey, that scumbag?
He went and threw some chump off a roof.
He's getting 5 to 15 years, man.
They tried him like an adult.
Shit.
I got a present for you, Jim.
A bag of the finest dope in Manhattan.
You know, me and you?
Like old times?
I can't.
Come on.
It would be dynamite.
I got this thing to do.
Why don't you come check it out?
No.
I'm going to go, then, you know?
You know how it is.
Take care of yourself, little man.
See you around, Jim.
Know this.
There's different types of users of junk.
You got your rich dilettante square-ass who dabbles now and then and always has enough money to run off to the Riviera if he feels he's fucking around to the danger point.
Street junkies hate these pricks, but they're always suckers, and their money makes them tolerable.
Then you got your upper-middle-class
Westchester preppies... same as the others, basically.
What they're good for is opening their mommy and daddy's eyes to this social virus and putting pressure on the government to do something about it.
Then there's us street kids.
Start fucking around very young, 13 or so...
We think we all got it under control and won't get strung out.
This rarely works.
I'm living proof.
But in the end, you just got to see the junk as another 9-to-5 gig.
The hours are just a bit more inclined to shadows.
[Applause]
[Bell Tolls]
[Bell Tolls]
[Bell Tolls]
Go fuck yourself, you son of a bitch.
Bastard!
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done, you fuck!
Give us this day our daily bread, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Jesus, Jesus the Nazarene.
Jesus, the nazarene.
Go to hell.
Go to hell.
Go to hell.
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Jim, you're not going to waste the whole day lying around, are you?
Ma, I'm up.
The loony alarm went off.
Well, close the blinds.
Don't look at her and don't listen to her.
How could I not?
Jesus the Nazarene.
Mary the whore.
Mary the hairdresser.
Mary the hairdresser.
Our Father, Who art...
Hey, lady!
Shut up!
[Jim] When I was young, about 8 or so,
I tried making friends with God-- by inviting him to my house to watch the World Series.
He never showed.

[Bell Rings]
Too bad, Father.
I was just starting to enjoy myself.
We can do it again tomorrow if you like, Mr. Carroll.
You okay, Jim?
Does it hurt?
You want to rub it for him, Pedro?
Jim, give it a rest.
You'll never beat him.
The guy's a pervert.
Did you hear him?
"We can do it again tomorrow if you like, Mr. Carroll."
Let's cut out of here.
Come on.
# I was born in a pool #
# They made my mother stand #
# I spat on that surgeon #
# And his trembling hand #
# When I felt the light #
# I was worse than bored #
# I stole a doctor's scalpel #
# And I slit the cord #
# I was a Catholic boy #
# I was redeemed through pain #
# Not through joy #
# I was two months early #
# They put me under glass #
# I screamed and cursed their children #
# When the nurses passed #
# I was convicted of theft #
# As I slid from the womb #
# They led me straight from my mother #
# To a cell in the tombs #
# I was a Catholic boy #
# Redeemed through pain #
# Not through joy #
# They starved me for weeks #
# They thought they'd teach me fear #
# I fed on cellmates' dreams #
# It gave me fine ideas #
# When they cut me loose #
# The time had served me well #
# I'd made allies in heaven #
# Comrades in hell #
# I was a Catholic child #
# The blood ran red #
# The blood ran wild ##
Why, you little prick!
This is my new...
Shit, guys, gotta get outta here.
I threw up on somebody.
I'll get ya!
You little prick!
I'll fucking throw you in the fucking river if i catch ya--
[Boat Horn Blows]
Hey!
What about the four of us versus Wilt Chamberlain?
He was the greatest of all time.
Four of us?
What are you gonna do, Pedro?
tie his shoes together when he ain't looking?
All right...
How'bout the three versus Wilt Chamberlain?
No problem.
You're kidding, right, Mickey?
No.
He can't cover all of us at the same time.
You guys don't miss open jumpers.
And you know who will be there for the rebounds.
Rebounds?
That freak is, like, 7 feet tall.
Jim, I can rebound with anybody.
You're sniffing too much of that shit, that's what you're doing.
Chamberlain would destroy all of us.
End of story.
Alright.
All we got to do is move the ball around.
There's no way we don't win.
Will you tell this kid?
Hey, Mickey, I think you could beat him yourself.
I don't think you need us.
Perfect example... confidence.
I know I could beat him.
Holy shit!
Look at this place.
I tell you what, if our school was this nice,
I'd go more than once a week.
You?
We got a game today, gentlemen.
Who's ready to play some roundball?
I said, who's ready to play some ball?
You give me that laid-back,
"I'm doing my own thing, Jack" attitude out there today, and you're going to find yourself watching the game from the bench.
No smoking, Iggy...
stunts your growth.
You want to be big and strong like me, don't you?
Out.
No smoking, and no pulling your peckers before a game.
Swifty, do you mind?
I'm taking a dump.
Get outta here!
Something die in there?
When we play our game...
-- so Pedro vomits on his head, right?
It goes all over his hair, trickles down his neck.
Some gets in his eye.
He went nuts--
Don't lie about it, either.
What are you doing?
We're signing a ball for Bobby.
Can I sign?
Yeah.
"We're holding your spot for you, kid.
Swifty."
All right.
This one's for Bobby.
All right.
Who's better than we are?
Nobody!
Alright!
Go ahead.
Do some warm-ups.
Pedro, you're in charge.
You're my eyes and ears.
- Hey, Jim?
- Yeah?
That's a nice thing you're doing for Bobby.
Oh, thanks.
Thanks.
You seen Neutron?
I think he's talking to a scout from Saint John's, as a matter of fact, upstairs.
You want to play college ball, don't you?
Yeah.
Someday, I hope.
You know.
Yeah.
Scouts are sniffing you out already.
They like them young.
I'll tell you what.
You come by sometime, and we'll go over the schools together.
Yeah.
All right.
Yeah.
We'll get a pizza, and we'll make a night of it.
Um... actually, my nights are kind of busy right now.
Yeah.
Homework and all, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[Cheering]
We were the hottest Catholic high school team in New York City, on our way to the championship.
We felt like nothing could stop us.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yes!
We're on our way.
We're on our way.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Hands up.
Show me some defense.
Show me some defense.
Good steal.
Put it in.
Put it in.
Yeah!
[Cheering]
All right.
All right.
Way to go.
Aw, geez.
All right, Neutron.
Yes!
Yes!
To the hole, Jim.
[Whistle Blows]
Whoa!
Whoa!
What's going on?
Break it up!
Come on.
Hit him!
Beat that motherfucker!
[Whistle Blows]
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- He fucking held me!
This dude blows the whistle...
Slow it down!
Slow it down!
[Whistle]
[Cheering]
You got to have presence on the court... presence like a cheetah rather than a chimp.
They both got it, but chimpy got to jump his nuts around all day to get it.
Shy cheetah just moves in total nonchalance a sec or two in his sexy, slow strut.
Me, I play like a cheetah.
[Cheering]
Let's go, Rangers-- let's go!
Let's go, Rangers, let's go!
[Cheering]
Yeah!
Ooh!
You got it!
It's ours.
It's ours.
Oh!
Yeah!
[Crowd] 9, 8, 7,
6, 5,
4, 3,
2, 1!
Yay, Jim!
Oh, shit.
That's my team!
That's my team!
[Crowd Cheering]
There's only two things Swifty forbids... using the word "motherfucker"
and stealing from the other team, as long as they're white.
How much for that group of winners over there?
It's $34.90.
$34.90?
Changed the prices or something?
No.
Uh...
I'm a little short.
Do me a favor.
Here.
Take my watch, and I'll come back later with the rest of the money.
No.
What do you mean, no?
I'm sorry, sir.
Those burgers are worth more than the watch is.
I'll be right back.
I told you one burger each, didn't I?
It takes at least eight of these to get filled up.
Yeah.
C'mon, Swifty.
We're growing boys.
Growing boys?
We're hungry motherfuckers.
Funny, huh?
I'm not driving you guys home.
How's that for laughs?
[Knock On Window]
You ripped them off, didn't you?
We're even now.
Swifty, come on.
How are we going to get home?
Face the music, pricks.
What are we going to do?
They got the door blocked off.
You afraid of these pussies?
I ain't afraid of anybody.
What's the problem?
I'm going to ask you this once.
All right?
Where's the stuff you stole from me?
What are you talking about?
No, no, no.
You're not going to fuck with me, all right?
Now, somebody stole my father's ring from my locker, motherfucker.
You want me to cut you?
Is that what you want, there?
There's no problem here.
Hey, guys!
Let's get out of here, c'mon!
You need a fucking army, huh?
Come on!
Come on!
Oh.
Nice.
That from Bobo?
Ha ha ha!
That's his father's ring.
Hey, fellas.
Any of you looking for a date?
Yeah.
Me, sweetheart.
Little horsy ride in Central Park, maybe candlelight dinner?
Why don't we skip right to dessert, huh, baby?
About $15?
Fifteen bucks?
I'll give you a quarter.
Let Pedro suck your tits.
You don't have to be rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
How about you, handsome, huh?
You got $15... for a little head?
Diane, do I look like I need to pay for it?
Yeah... you do.
If it's worth it.
Jimmy...
Jimmy, I know you want some, honey.
$15.
I'll do you so good you'll never forget it, baby.
Hey, hey!
Ooh!
That's a deal.
Bargain from there.
What do you say, guys?
You want to do it?
All four of us?
- Yeah.
- It's a deal.
All four of us.
Aw, shit.
This is all I got, Diane.
Here, have a pretzel.
- Get out of here.
- Beat it.
Yeah, fuck you!
Fucking dopehead.
You see what that shit does to you?
Wow.
Speaking of dopeheads, is that Pedro's mother over there slinging her wares again?
It is!
Hey, Peepee, where you going?
Why do you have to be such an asshole all the time, huh?
Why is the little shoe crying anyway?
His mother's a sneaker.
His father's a loafer.
Somebody's got to be a heel.
Jim, where you going?
Hey, Jim!
Jim.
Hey.
Hey, man.
What's up?
You don't recognize me with my new hairdo?
It's nice.
It's nice.
I like it.
What's going on?
- How are you?
- Good.
Wow.
Look at that.
You like it?
Yeah, I'll tell you what.
When you get out of here, we'll all shave our heads and look like a gang of skinheads.
It's a deal.
All right.
I got something for you here.
Yeah.
Everyone on the team.
Look right here...
even Swifty signed it.
Thanks, man.
You remember when I dunked on that spade in Riverside Park?
You always had good ups.
Yeah.
Oh.
I got something to show you.
Hold on.
What?
Pedro got these out of some lady's purse.
- She's doing it with a donkey.
- Oh, Jesus!
Look at that schlong.
Look at that one.
Oh, I beat your record.
How many times you choke it?
Seven times.
Bullshit.
Seven times.
My mom thinks I have a cold year-round because of all the tissues around the house.
You can keep those if you want.
They're pumping so much junk in me,
I can't even get a decent chubby.
I got an idea.
Come on.
Let's go.
Where we going?
I'm getting you out of this place, man.
C'mon!
What are you, crazy, man?
I can't go anywhere.
Here you go.
I've known Bobby since I was 3.
He's my best friend.
He was the best player on our basketball team.
Two years ago, he got leukemia.
He keeps fighting it off.
I know Bobby's going to beat it.
He could beat anything.
Watch!
Jim, you're going to kill me, man.
If you let go, I swear...
I swear I'll kill you, man.
Watch the bump!
What the hell happened to forty deuce?
Last time I was here, that theater was playing Sperminator II.
Oh, yeah.
I remember that.
No, man.
This whole block has been done over by all these new artists.
It's pretty cool, huh?
Yeah.
They should put your stuff up there.
Yeah.
Right.
Still scribbling stuff in that notebook of yours, ain't you?
Of course.
You bring anything for me?
What, like to read?
No, like to eat.
What do you think?
Yeah.
I mean, I got this, but it's not a big deal.
I don't even remember writing it, to tell you the truth.
Yeah, Yeah.
I'll be the judge of this.
"Little kids shoot marbles
"where branches break the sun
"into graceful shafts of light.
I just want to be pure.
All right.
# What a life #
Nothing like the real thing to float your boat, huh, Bobby?
# What a life #
# Didn't know where, didn't know when... #
That's nice.
# Said that I'll go...
go learn #
# Put up my hand, wait my turn #
# But it never comes, I have to shout out #
# That's life #
# And that's what it's all about #
# So through the comfort and the strife #
# What a life... #
Get me out of here, Jim.
What are you talking about, man?
This was a stupid idea.
I don't feel so good.
Well, can we wait till the end of the show?
Did you hear what I said?
I said get me the hell out of here!
Hey, Bob, man...
I'm really sorry, you know?
Next time, we'll go somewhere...
Ain't gonna be no next time, Jim.
I love it this way... my feet against the tar, which is soft from the spring heat, the slight breeze that runs across your entire body, especially your crotch.
You feel an incredible power being naked under a dome of stars while a giant city is dressed, dodging cars all around you five flights down.
I don't think of anything while I'm doing the actual tugging, least of all the heavy sex fantasies I have to resort to indoors.
Just my own naked self and the stars breathing down, and it's beautiful.
Time sure flies when you're young and jerking off.
[Woman Reads With Difficulty] "Camp summer position.
Driver... taxi."
Hey, that might be good.
You could get your license this summer.
Oh, yeah, Mom.
That sounds really great.
Hey, get your own job, and if you don't get it this summer, you're coming to work with me at the hotel.
Mom, please.
Why are you so worried about this?
Do I even ask you for money?
No.
I'm not worried about the money.
I want you to have responsibility.
I don't want you running around the streets of New York.
Idle time is the devil's plaything, Jim.
The devil's plaything, huh?
Mm-hmm.
That might be a cool title for my first book.
Thanks!
What are you talking about?
What are you writing?
Here.
Ooh.
Um...
Ma, I'm not really that hungry this morning, alright?
- Come on.
You got to eat something.
- I know...
Where you going?
I'm going to shoot some hoops.
Sometimes I feel like something's chasing me, like there's some whacko on a roof somewhere who could snuff me out at any moment.
And I feel this horrible fear.
Will I have time to finish-- the poems breaking loose in my head?
Hey, white boy, you ready for your beating?
Don't let your mouth get you into something your ass can't handle.
I'll shoot you for it.
So it's going to be like that, huh?
I... don't think so.
Yeah!
All right, so you made one.
Big deal.
You made one shot.
Make another.
# The days are muzzled in a vibe #
# I swing back from time to time #
# There's a Camaro, rusty red #
# That all my best friends drive in #
# Can you smell the summer air?
#
# Take me where they left the light on #
# Getting close, almost there #
# If that fuzzy silver badge #
# Don't greet us there #
# My head's dizzy, and I'm taking... ##
Yo, Jim!
What's the score?
Come on.
We got to go.
They don't keep score in this game.
Jim, come on.
We're losing the sun.
He's being a dick.
You want me to put a charge in his ass?
Whatch this.
Oh, look it, right here...
Jim's secret diary he's always writing in.
Bet you he wrote some shit about me.
Oh, right here.
"Spring...
Mickey."
Hey, there I am, Jim says.
"Mickey takes out a bottle of carbonic cleaning fluid and suggests we do a little sniffing to get high."
Whoo!
"After four deep whiffs, we're sailing someplace else."
Mickey, what are you doing?
"Bells ringing through my ears, little lights flashing through my eyes."
Mickey, put that down, all right?
"I pictured myself
"paddling across a river with black water,
"only the canoe was going backwards instead of forwards,
"with clouds that had faces.
Laughing, spooky, fun-house laughs..."
- Give it back, alright?
- What is that shit?
Why do you have to be such a schmuck, Mickey?
What are you talking about?
Don't you ever touch that again.
It's private.
What's your problem?
I'm...
I'm sorry.
He's writing about me, I can't read about it?
Jesus!
Hey, Jim, come on.
We're gone.
Yo, we got a cab!
Hey, cabby!
Hey, swami!
So, Shakespeare, you going to finish the game?
C'mon, Reggie, you know this game never ends.
See you later, all right?
Every crowd has its little games to prove if you're a punk or not.
My cousin in Jersey plays chickie, which is two cars heading towards each other at about 80 miles per hour.
First driver to swerve out of the way is, of course, chicken.
In Brooklyn, they make you press a lit cigarette into your arm and have it burn all the way down to the filter without the slightest flinch.
Us, Manhattan boys, we jump off cliffs into the Harlem River, which is literally shitty, because half a million toilets flush into it every day.
Whoo-oo!
[Whistles]
Yeah!
Oooh!
Yeah!
Hey, y'all, I carried the clothes up, but I ain't carrying them down.
Peepee, this is you... all 33 pounds of you, gone with the wind.
Wow.
That's a long way down.
Devil's toe is no big deal.
We've all done it a million times.
I never done it.
You never did it?
Pedro, you never do nothing.
You know who was awesome on this rock?
Bobby.
That kids would do back flips off this rock.
Hey, Mickey.
What?
Don't talk about him like he's dead.
He's not dead.
There goes the circle line.
Check it out.
[Horn Blows]
Whoo!
Full moon!
Whoo!
Hey, yo!
Whoo!
Hey, circle this!
[Whistle]
Hey, I'm going.
Watch out, watch out...
I'm going to show you how to do it.
Ye-ea-ah!
That was a good jump.
Oh, he's nuts.
Hey, I'm going to walk down.
What you talking about?
You can't walk down.
There's no way to walk down.
I ain't jumping.
Pedro, your clothes are down there.
How you gonna get your clothes?
You going to walk around naked all day?
Pedro, if you don't jump, Mickey's going to tease you so bad--
You might as well just jump and get it over with.
Feel better.
What the hell, right?
Oh... shit...
Pedro!
Bad form.
Bad form.
Oh...
My God!
Oh, shit.
Is he all right?
Pedro, you all right?
You ready?
Yeah.
Listen, don't tell the other guys, but when we leave here, I got a surprise for you.
Tell me what it is.
It's a surprise.
Trust me, all right?
Ouch, don't mess around, man...
Alright, you ready?
Come on!
You ready?
- Let's jump.
- On three.
Ready?
Uh-huh.
1, 2,
3.
Come on.
Let's go.
What's up, Manny?
How you doing?
Fine.
Thank you, sir.
This is my friend Jim.
How you doing?
I can't believe I hit my head on that rock.
It's killing me.
Jim, um, this is Winkie.
- Hi.
- How you doing?
Good.
And this... this is Blinkie.
- Hi.
- Hi.
# I lost my heart #
# Under the bridge #
# That little girl... #
I've seen you play ball, Jim.
You're a very beautiful player.
Very zen.
# And now I moan #
# And now I holler #
# She'll never know #
# Just what I found #
# That blue-eyed girl # lt'll make you fuck like Superman.
# She said no more #
Faster than a speeding bullet...
# Became blue-eyed whore... #
More powerful than a locomotive...
# Down by the water #
# Down by the water... #
Able to, um...
I can't think of anything with a single bound.
# See her again #
# See her again... #
Do you have any protection?
Yeah.
This one's, uh, ribbed for extra pleasure.
So what are you waiting for?
What do you mean?
Take off your clothes.
Well, uh... could we shut off the lights first?
# Little fish, big fish #
# Swimming in the water #
# Come back here, man #
# Give me my daughter #
# Little fish, big fish #
# Swimming in the water ##
White ship disappears in the wave machine this morning.
Your eyes got shut with secret chains that pillow armies eventually set free... like soft horses through toy deserts.
I love this mansion, though it's too many windows... to open halfway each morning... to close halfway each night.
I looked at his body, and it was death for the first time.
His face was thin and wrinkled, almost apelike.
His hair, just gray patches on his scalp.
He looked 60 years old, and he was 16.
Couldn't believe how skinny he was... much skinnier than he was in the hospital.
It was like having the skeleton of someone you knew put right in front of you.
I felt dazed, like I'd just come out of a four-hour movie I didn't understand.
I kept thinking about his face... and death... what a cheat the whole thing was.
Hey, you guys remember that Halloween when Bobby filled that paper bag with dog shit, lit it on fire and put it outside Father Dunne's door, and we all hid behind the dumpster?
Yeah.
I could picture Father Dunne comming outside, stepping on that shit.
Picture him in the john-- scraping the shit off his shoe like this.
You think that'll keep him out of heaven?
Are you kidding?
Jesus Christ himself would have laughed at that.
It was hilarious!
What about the time at the formal when Bobby got caught in the bathroom with Mary Ann Dugan and McNulty came in and busted him?
He was, like, "Father, I swear.
We weren't doing anything."
Meanwhile she's got a giant wad of cum hanging off her face.
I tell you, that kid was definitely a pisser.
It was weird seeing him today, man.
He was all shriveled up and wrinkled.
He looked like my grandfather.
I'll tell you what, though.
That kid was in so much pain, it's better off he died.
How the hell would you know, Mickey?
Did you go and visit him?
Huh?
Any of you guys go and visit him?
All right.
Then shut the fuck up.
Hey, Jim.
Look at my brother's girlfriend in the park.
She's sitting there, eating a sandwich.
Next thing you know, she's shot in the head.
She's dead.
It's over.
What about little Teddy Rayhill?
Perfect example.
Remember that night he was up on the roof, and he was doing poppers, having a great time, laughing his ass off
He started walking backwards...
Boom!
He fell right off the goddamn roof.
It was meant to be, right?
Fuck that, you guys!
Bobby was the best fucking guy around, you know that?
What are you, a bunch of idiots?
You don't even understand, do you?
Jim, you all right?
Huh?
Listen, maybe you should talk to one of the priests.
I don't know.
Maybe...
Maybe they can help you out.
Help me out?
I wouldn't ask one of those cocksuckers for directions.
You know what?
You guys need to lighten the fuck up, all right?
Let bygones be fucking bygones.
Shitty fucking world.
Live life to the fucking fullest.
You know what I mean?
Shit happens, man.
Shit fucking happens.
[Thunder]
Come on.
Let's go.
Jim, come on.
You're growing up, and rain sort of remains on the branches of a tree that will someday rule the earth.
And that's good that there's rain.
Clears the month of your sorry rainbow expressions.
And it clears the streets of the silent armies so we can dance.

Did I ever tell you about the first time I did heroin?
I went down to Pedro's basement.
All sorts of characters were in the storage-room shooting gallery.
I was just going to sniff a bag, but a guy says,
"If you're going to sniff, might as well pop it, and if you're going to pop it, might as well mainline."
I was scared of needles, but I gave in.
It was like a long heat wave through my body.
Any ache or pain or sadness or guilty feeling was completely flushed out.
Look, Ma, I'm not in the mood for your dime-store psychology, all right?
Could you just please leave me alone?
I got a little sick, all right?
We're not going to live like this, Jim.
We're not going to live like this.
I'm warning you!
I'm telling you.
Oh, God, Mom.
You're always warning me, aren't you?
Blah, blah, blah.
You're always in my fucking ear.
Blah, blah, blah.
You don't know anything.
What are you talking about?
Go clean toilets or whatever the hell it is you do.
When you're done, clean this one.
Don't talk like that!
What's the matter with you?
Gee whiz, Ma, you know... we got to have these heart-to-heart talks more often.
They're really good for us.
I don't know you.
I don't believe this is you, Jim.
Please, Jim.
I don't know who you are.
Yeah, I know.
I was such a good little boy, right... with such potential, wasn't that it?
Is that what you're going to say?
Oh, Jim.
What's happening?
Jim, what's happening?
First, it's a Saturday-night thing, and you feel cool, like a gangster or a rock star.
It's just something to kill the boredom, you know?
They call it a chippie, a small habit.
It feels so good, you start doing it on Tuesdays, then Thursdays.
Then it's got you.
Every wise-ass punk on the block says it won't happen to them, but it does.
Go do it!
I ain't doing it.
I always do it!
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could you tell me the fastest way to the subway?
Yeah.
That's the "B" train.
Go to this corner and make a left.
It's right there.
What are you doing?
Let go!
Let go!
Let go of that!
Oh, my God!
What?
Oh!
- Help!
No!
No!
- What are you doing?
Let's go!
Come on!
I don't feel like going in today.
Father, is it all right if I don't go in today?
Why?
What are you scared of?
Nothing.
I just don't feel like it, that's all.
I imagine you have more to confess than anybody here.
Unburden yourself.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been about four months since my last confession.
Yes, my son?
Well, I don't know where to start, Father.
Have you taken the name of Jesus Christ in vain?
Yeah.
Yeah, I have.
Have you disrespected your mother and father?
Uh-huh.
Have you stolen or cheated your fellow man?
Yeah, but I'm not proud of it.
Have you had impure thoughts or engaged in impure deeds?
Oh, Father, you have no idea.
Is there something else that you want to tell me in your own words?
I've done all kinds of crazy shit.
Oh, excuse me, Father.
Fuck, I'm s...
Christ, I have a dirty mouth.
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry about that.
Will you just go on?
10 Hail Marys, five Our Fathers.
What do you mean?
And that's it?
That's my punishment?
You know something?
My friend Bobby, he was the best, and he's dead.
This sucks!
You know that?
This really sucks.
It's not fair, Father.
Your nose is running, your stomach cramps, your legs feel like they've played six straight games on top of each other, and the voice is always there in the back of your head...
"Just one more time.
then we'll stop."
Quick to the ball.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Good, Ignatius.
Good.
Good.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Right behind you.
Sir, all right if I use the bathroom, Coach?
Jim, you got a bladder like a woman.
Let's go.
Again.
There we go.
Right behind him.
Right behind him.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Two hands.
Jim?
I thought you were taking a piss.
Oh.
What are you doing in here every practice?
Have you been waiting for me, Jim?
Giving me some kind of a signal?
What are you talking about, Swifty?
Don't act surprised.
Do we understand each other?
It's not going to happen, Swifty.
Put the money away.
You want more?
Here.
Just let me do it.
Get the fuck out of my face!
Take it easy, Jim.
You can't blame me for trying.
I made a mistake, all right?
Let's just pretend it never happened.
Things will go back to exactly how they were before.
Okay?
Okay?
Here, keep the money.
Keep the money.
Just don't tell anybody, all right?
Good.
Tell anybody you want!
Nobody's going to believe a drughead like you, anyway.
You think we don't know what you've been doing?
Give me the fucking money and get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck-- Get the fuck out here!
Come on!
Get out of here!
And you want to stop.
You really do.
But it's like a dream.
You can't stop dreams.
They move in crazy pieces, any way they want to, and suddenly, you're capable of anything.
Ha ha ha!
No!
Wake up, Mr. Carroll!
It's later than you think.
Oh.
All right!
- I need a lift.
- All right.
What do you got?
Three different pills.
Which are the ups?
I never asked.
I thought one of youse would know.
Oh, great.
We look like pharmacists?
I don't know what to take.
What do we take?
Let me see.
The blacks and the reds are the ups.
I think the pink ones are the ups.
Why?
'Cuz I associate pink with lightness, you know?
The black ones seem like they'd knock you on your ass.
They might be faded seconals.
No, they're not faded.
They'd be sticky.
They're not.
That's bullshit.
- Fuck your mother.
- My what?
All right!
Calm down.
Don't ever talk about my mother.
Don't ever hit me like that again.
Come on!
Alright!
Give me your hat.
We got a game to play, alright?
Just give me something.
Hi, Neutron.
Let me ask him.
Neutron, you know which ones are the ups?
I think you should put that shit away before Swifty comes in here.
Why you acting like such a square ass?
Screw you, Mickey.
Screw you, too, Tough guy.
Man.
I'm just going to take the black.
You sure?
Mm-hmm.
You got a better idea?
Nope.
Your guess is as good as mine, Jimbo.
It's on today.
50 rebounds.
Good.
Come on.
Let's go.
I'm your friend now, right?
What, I got to smack you again, c'mon!
Yeah, take your little rat with you.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, what's up?
Why are you acting like that?
You know what's wrong.
Used to be about getting high and playing basketball.
Now it's just about getting high with you.
You're blowing it, Jim.
Oh, come on.
I don't need to hear this from you, Neutron.
Yeah, you do, Jim!
Listen, no, Jim!
I'm really proud of you, man.
Everything's cool.
You look great.
I'll see you in the NBA.

Did you find it?
No, Father.
It's clean.
There's no drugs in there.
Thank you, Officer.
I told you we didn't have nothing.
You boys think you're awfully smart, don't you?
Well, you're both suspended for a week!
Ooh...
And you'll never play basketball here again.
That you can count on.
You can't kick me off the team, Swifty.
Oh?
Why is that?
'Cause I quit the team... and the school and this whole faggot-ass scene, that's why.
I could second that motion.
Your resignations are accepted!
Neutron, you coming with us?
Huh?
Yeah.
That's what I figured.
Come on, man.
I'm fucking out of here.
Don't worry, Swifty.
I'm not going to rat you out.
And in the next life, Father,
I'm going to have the paddle!
Get out!
Thanks a lot, Neutron.
Thanks, man.
I can't believe this, you know?
I know.
What happened to the pills?
We got kicked out of the school, Mickey.
Who cares, man?
We lost the pills.
The cops took them--
We can't play ball anymore.
Jim, who cares about school, man?
We just lost $40 worth of pharmaceuticals.
I know what happened to them, too.
The cops, they take that all the time.
They either pop them themselves or they sell them.
What's my mom going to say, man?
When I go home?
She ain't gonna say nothing.
You just tell her you're going to school every day in the morning.
Let's get out of here, man...
Go get into something.
You never sold any pills at the schoolyard?
No.
So it's all a big conspiracy against you.
Right, Jim?
Yeah.
Maybe it is.
Maybe it's not.
You been missing these?
What are you going to tell me...
they're vitamins?
Oh, fuck you, Ma.
What?
!
Get out of my house!
Oh, is that what you want, Ma?
Get out!
You don't talk to me that way!
If that's what you want, I'm fucking out of here.
All right?
What are you doing?
I'm leaving!
What do you think?
I wan you to take all your shit!
I'll help you.
Here!
You want me to leave?
Yes.
Get out!
I'm out of here.
Get the fuck out of my way!
This garbage is going to kill you, Jim!
I'm gone!
Gonna to kill you!
Don't you understand?
I can't watch you kill yourself?
Ma, you're never going to fucking see me again, alright?
Just remember that.
Don't say that, Jim.
Don't say that!
It was a dream, not a nightmare... a beautiful dream I could never imagine in a thousand nods.
I saw this girl next to me who wasn't beautiful until she smiled,
and I felt that smile come at me and heat waves following, soaking through my body and out my fingertips in shafts of color.
And I knew somewhere in the world... somewhere...
that there was love for me.
We just got to raise enough cash to keep our heads straight.
Luckily, finding money in New York is like getting laid at the prom... easy.
- Fuck it, Pedro!
- What's the matter with you?
Jesus!
Watch the road.
You could kill us all, c'mon!
I get 1,500 bucks for this car.
If it's whacked up, it's worth nothing.
We should buy shit in bulk, man
We'll put it on the street and make real money.
That's 500 bucks a piece.
We'll be on for days, nights, weeks.
Yeah, man.
I'd love to go to Puerto Rico, soak up some rays, you know?
See my bitch?
That's what I'd like to do.
- What are you talking about?
- What bitch?
We haven't seen a picture or nothing.
She's 500 pounds, Jim.
She got a mustache thicker than her father.
No.
That's your mother, Mickey.
She does not exist.
Don't fool yourself.
Be careful.
I'm about to whack.
Oh, shit, man.
My brother's going to take care of us and this car.
Pedro, wake the fuck up!
Pedro, come on, man!
You're going to get us killed, what are you doing?
I got it, man.
You want me to drive?
Mickey, you better drive the car.
I'm serious, man.
Just don't blow my high.
If there's a scratch in the car, my brother'll kill me.
Yo, get out of the booth!
Get out the booth, huh?
Get out.
Fucking...
What's up?
What's up?
Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Where's the car?
It's good to see you, too.
It's over here.
It's nice.
It's smokin'.
You tell me that?
It's everything you wanted.
Get your hands off.
You guys look like shit.
Oh, my God.
They're taking the car.
Show me the sign, man!
Show me the freaking sign!
It's right there.
You see?
It says "tow-away." Huh?
You scumbags even read?
I should kick all your punk asses!
Goddamn it!
I can get you another car tonight.
Yeah?
John Halligan is waiting for this car.
I got him out of bed with his wife.
You know how this makes me fucking look?
Kenny, get off.
You're too stupid to be my brother!
You're too stupid!
You want a piece of me, Carroll?
Back off!
Back off!
- Kenny, no more!
- Mr. Tough Guy.
- Kenny, no more!
- Huh?
Tough guy?
Give me a sip of your soda.
You wipe off the bottle before you take a sip?
You don't even think twice about sharing works with Mickey.
You think you'll catch something from the bottle you're not catch from a needle?
You mistake me for somebody who gives a shit.
Headquarters...
home on and off to every down-and-out junkie and wino from 14th Street to the Bowery.
It's like a fucking all-star team.
Jimmy, the other day, my mother's been ragging on me,
"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
"You've tried every other way.
Go to church.
Put yourself in Christ's hands."
So I do it, man.
I figure, give it a shot.
I dig Jesus.
So, I go, man.
High mass...
a choir and everything.
The first thing I see on the right, the side altar, are those little candles in the red glass that we used when it was windy in the park to cook up.
And then, this altar boy, he's coming down the aisle with this 6-foot candle.
I envision this huge spoon above it, man, with, like, shopping bags full of dope inside of it.
And then the kicker comes, man.
The priest, he starts doing the thing with the incense.
You know, starts wafting out.
I'm in the back.
It finally hits me.
"Where do I know this smell from, man?
My room, man."
It's the smell exactly of really primo dope cooking up.
Yeah?
Exactly the same.
So what happened next?
At that point, I split.
I went home,
I went inside my closet,
I got my stash out of the inside pocket of my sharkskin easter suit, and I got stoned.
Ba bing... ba bang.
I love a ritual.
Oh, Mary, if you can hear me...
I need you to fill Jim's heart with love because he really needs it now.
Oh, God... please watch over my son.
He needs you now.
Just take care of him, okay?
I'll be okay.
I love you, Jim.
I love you.
Hey, you holding?
You straight, man?
Get out of here.
Come on.
No.
Hey, have you seen Falco?
Come on, man.
Are you holding anything?
Hey, Diane...
Come here, Diane.
- I'll take care of you, babe.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
How about some of this?
Ha ha!
I wouldn't do you for a bag, you fucking piece of shit.
Jim.
Jimmy.
You're looking good.
Who's your embalmer?
I want some of what you got.
Shh.
Check everything in this place.
Wow.
I always wanted to use these syrup pumps.
And these professional ice-cream scoopers.
Oh, my God.
Don't make me do it!
I'll do it!
I swear to God!
Jim, watch out.
Come on!
It's not opening.
They don't make them like this anymore.
You got to get it from the side.
I got it!
Oh, cool.
Change!
Shit!
Let's get out of here.
It's locked.
We got to go out the back.
Pedro, let's get out of here!
What am I, hallucinating here?
Pedro, you'll get us caught.
The cops are going to come.
Oh, you want to be tough, huh?
Go ahead... take another sip so I can blow your fucking head all over the counter!
Go ahead, Pedro!
Go ahead!
Come on, guys!
Let's go.
Put that gun away!
Don't fuck with me, motherfucker!
What the hell are you doing, Mickey?
What the hell did you do that for?
Let that little spic rot, man!
He'll get us caught.
Jim, the cops are coming.
Come on!
Jim!
Jim!
Pedro!
Pedro!
Jim!
Freeze!
Freeze!
On your stomach!
On your stomach!
I didn't do anything, I'm telling you!
This is it, man.
That Jew got to keep the money under his pillow.
Hey, Jim, I know you're still mad about Pedro.
I couldn't do nothing, man.
He was going to get us caught.
Definitely shouldn't have went that far.
What happened to you?
Your mother kick your ass?
Yeah, real funny.
Bring us a couple of Cokes, will you?
You all right?
Hey, bartender, move out of the way.
Jim, I'm getting sick.
I got to get some money to cop.
Jim.
You with me here?
What the hell are you wa...
Oh, shit.
That's Neutron.
That's the all-American high school game?
We could have played in that game.
Who gives a shit?
Come on.
I'm waiting to hear back on a scholarship from Saint John's...
I'm not sure about it, but hopefully it will work out.
Jim, I'm starting to jones.
Gotta get out there.
We need some money.
Jim, don't dwell on these dreams, man.
Will you come on?
Meet you outside, man.
I'm getting sick.
You want to meet me out there?
Is it okay if I say hi to my mom?
Hi, Mom.
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.
# You don't know it, but you're coming right along #
# Please be strong #
# You don't know it, but you're coming right along ##
Hey, you!
Stop!
You can't go in there!
Stop!
What do you want?
You realize what time it is?
Yeah.
Um... is Winkie and Blinkie here?
Who the hell are Winkie and Blinkie?
Hey, guys.
Lisa, Mel, you know this boy?
No, Daddy.
Come on.
All right.
Come on.
Get out of here.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Rubin.
He got past me.
- Don't let it happen again.
It won't happen again.
Get out of here!
What?
What?
Asshole.
Hey, fuck-up, get fucking up, man!
- What's your problem, man?
- What's YOUR problem, mam?
You sold my girlfriend some shit the other day.
You almost killed her.
What was it... rat poison?
It's not my fault your girl can't handle her drugs.
I want my fucking $20 back, man.
Look, there's no money-back guarantees.
I'm not selling refrigerators here.
Oh, yeah?
I'll cut you a dynamite deal on mexican shit.
Give me my $20, or we'll go outside.
If we go outside, one of us is going to get hurt.
I told you one of us would get hurt.
Is that right?
It's been hard...
the writing...
lately.
Terrible numbness, then suddenly it comes... in beautiful fragments or terrible dreams... like nods... so high.
Uh!
Reggie, is that you?
Who the fuck do you think it is?
Ohh...
Don't worry, you're not dead yet.
It's not bad.
Hey, give me that.
How come it's all wet?
Because you pissed on it.
I didn't say you could read this.
What, have you been digging through all my stuff?
I need...
I got to get out of here.
Where's my jacket?
You're welcome.
What the hell am I thanking you for?
Because you was frozen in the snow like a goddamn creamsicle.
Where is it?
What?
You know what the fuck I'm talking about, Reggie!
Where is it?
You mean this?
Huh?
Give it to me.
I'll cut your fucking throat, Reggie!
Give it to me, all right?
Just give it to me!
Oh, give it to me!
Give it to me!
I'm serious!
Give me it!
Give it to me!
Goddamn it!
I'll make you an incredible offer.
I'm going to save your life twice in one day, understand me?
You should have left me in the fucking snow, man.
Give me the money for my dope, too.
I'm not gonna suck your dick, all right?
Put that away.
Who the hell wants you to suck their dick?
Goddamn it!
Look at yourself!
Just look at yourself.
Oh, Reggie... it's okay.
Why are you doing this?
Because once upon a time, somebody helped me, and I always pay what I owe.
Reggie.
Reggie, I just need a taste.
I just need a little something, Reggie.
You don't understand.
It hurts, Reggie!
Ow!
Reggie, I got to go.
I got to go see my mom.
You got to let me get out of here, Reggie.
Reggie!
It hur...
It hurts.
Aah!
Shit!
Oh, boy...
# Touch the taste and taste the smell #
# Smell the scent, all the gifts you gave to me, baby #
# The food of your brain #
# The room is spinning round #
# I never come down #
# The room is spinning round #
# I never come down... #
Reggie.
you got to give me it.
You got to give me it, Reggie.
Please!
Oh!
Reggie, come on!
# I remember you, too #
# I blew my mind ##
Wake up.
Can't sleep all day.
Oh.
Thanks.
Jesus Christ.
What happened to you?
What does it look like?
Motherfucker shot me.
Woke my black ass up.
Shit.
Look, uh...
I'll be back in the morning, Jim.
You just stay cool.
You start to get panicky, write about me in that book of yours.
Actually, I was a little hurt I wasn't mentioned.
You really like my writing, huh, Reggie?
Damn, man, I told you four times already.
What do you want me to do?
Bend over and kiss your ass?
Hey, Reg, do me a favor.
While you're out, pick me up a bag.
# The room is spinning round #
# I may never come down #
I am alone.
Not just me.
We're alone... alone forever.
And who's at the end of that forever tunnel I run through, up Fifth with the wallpaper of skyscrapers?
I'm thinking, after all those beautiful trips, that this is one of those bad ones.
Diane?
Hey!
Jim.
Remember me?
Man, you look great.
Yeah, thanks.
Good to see somebody from the old neighborhood...
What do you want, Jim?
- You holding anything?
- No.
Just like a 5 or something?
Just to tide me over, you know?
Please, Diane?
Come on.
Yeah.
For an old friend?
Why not?
I've been looking all over for this.
Oh, you know what?
I only got a 20.
A 20 is good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
A 20 is great, yeah.
That would help me out a lot.
- You want a 20?
- Yeah.
Why don't you go buy yourself some pretzels, you asshole.
You bitch!
You're nothing but a whore!
I don't give a shit about your clothes!
You're still a whore to me!
Yeah?
Shut up.
Look at you.
Oh, are you desperate now, baby?
Who's a whore now?
Don't talk to me like that, you bitch!
Ha ha.
Who's laughing, stupid?
Don't play a game with me!
I know you!
Ah!
Shit.
Oh, man.
Shit.
Ha ha ha!
Mickey.
Mick, what's up, man?
Hey, what's up, man?
Did you get anything?
No, not a dime.
You score?
Yeah, I got something.
What'd you get?
About 35 bucks.
35?
Where'd you get it?
I robbed some fucking asshole on the "D" train.
Dude, 35 will keep us on for, like, two days.
Well, could we get some stuff, man?
I'm fucking... my head is...
I see some spics.
I think we can score.
You wanna check it out?
- Yeah, alright.
- Come on.
They're over here.
Why the fuck do we have to cop on the street all the time?
My fucking nuts are itching like crazy.
Think this is him?
Is your name Pino?
Listen... could we get us some dope?
The dude over there said you could help.
You want to cop some shit?
Let me see some cash.
I got it here.
Let me see.
Hey, no money without no taste.
You want a taste?
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Hurry, man.
Come on.
There's fucking cops all over.
That's good, man.
That's good.
All right, listen...
4 for 35.
4 for 35, man?
Come on, man.
$5.00 short.
What's the big deal?
Ta bien, chico...
Toma, toma.
- You got four?
- Yeah.
We should taste this.
Where are we going to cook it up?
I don't know about his guy.
No, he's cool.
Fuck, man!
What's the matter?
- Just taste it!
Come on.
- What do you mean?
I tasted it.
He beat us.
He fucking beat us.
I swear to fucking God...
Put that away!
I'm gonna kill this mother--!
- Come here, motherfucker!
- Put it away!
I'm going to fucking kill you, you motherfucker!
Motherfucker, you're fucking dead, you hear me?
Dude, don't make me do it.
Where's the money?
I want the money.
I want the money and the bags.
Where's the fucking money?
The fucking money!
I want it!
Aah!
No!
-Oh, shit!
- We fucking killed him!
What the fuck do you mean, we?
I didn't fucking touch him!
Don't put that shit on me!
He beat us, man!
He deserved it!
You went too far, Mickey!
Oh, shit!
Is he dead?
Of course he's fucking dead!
He fell six stories!
Jim, come on.
Come on!
Will you come one?
Jim, don't make me leave you here!
Oh, shit.
# Star #
# I'll reach you if I try #

# Star #
# I'll reach you if I try #
# Show me the truth, yeah ##
Come on, get back up!
Come on!
Get off of me!
What are you doing?
Who is it?
Ma...
let me in.
Ma, let me in!
Please, Ma.
Ma?
Hey, Ma?
Are you in there, Ma?
Ma, is that you?
Yeah.
Ma?
Ma?
- Are you there?
- Yeah.
Hi.
Hi, Ma.
Hi.
Hi.
Listen, I need you to help me out, all right?
I need you to give me some money.
Okay?
I need you to give me, like, five doll...
Like, $20, something like that because I'm in some trouble.
Ma?
Do you hear me, Ma?
Yeah, I hear you.
I can't help you.
Okay, listen, what you got to do is give me some money, okay?
Jim, I can't do that.
Why not?
Mom, you know I'm not going to do anything with it.
I just need to go out of town for a little while 'cause I got into some trouble, and I need some help.
Okay?
So, you got to give me some money, Mom.
Can you hold my hand?
Yeah, I'll hold your hand.
Mom, can you give me some money, please?
Mom, can you give me some money, please?
Stop fucking around!
I can't.
Mom, give me some fucking money, please!
What are you doing?
I'm your son!
I don't have any.
Mom, don't fuck around like this!
Give me some money!
Mom!
Come on!
Let me in the fucking door!
Oh, God.
Oh, fuck.
Let me in.
I need some money.
I need some money real bad.
Ohh...
Oh, God.
Someone's breaking into my apartment.
They have a knife.
Oh!
Mom!
You don't understand, Mom.
You don't know what you're fucking doing to me.
Mom, I'm in pain.
How could you do this to your son, you bitch?
You fucking bitch!
Ah!
Oh, let me in!
I'll do anything!
I'll be a good boy!
I'll be a good boy, mom, if you let me in.
Get off me!
Get off!
No!
No!
You fuckers!
You're not going to do this!
Fuck you!
Ma!
Don't do this!
Ma!
Ma!
Ma!
I got six months in Riker's Island for assault, robbery, resisting arrest, and possession of narcotics.
I sweated out a horrible cure and stayed clean the whole stretch even though it's been easier to get good junk in here than it is on the street.
Shit, it's been hard, man.
All I've been doing is reading these diaries and wondering how the hell I'm still alive, and even if I care.
Suffice to say that I'm finished with the asshole bandits of shower-room rape, and suffice to say that those swine guards won't draw blood from my ankles again.
Suffice to say that I've been just thinking about dumb stuff like what a nice concept it is to have a godmother and a godfather, wondering who my godparents might be.
My mom won't visit me here, so I guess I'll just have to wait till I get home to ask.
Jim?
Who's there?
It's me.
Pedro?
What's up, man?
Nothing.
You know.
I...
I hear you come here.
I just came by to say hi.
I'm sorry about that night at the candy store and everything.
It's all right.
Reform school turned out to be real cool, so don't sweat it.
Did you hear about Mickey, that scumbag?
He went and threw some chump off a roof.
He's getting 5 to 15 years, man.
They tried him like an adult.
Shit.
I got a present for you, Jim.
A bag of the finest dope in Manhattan.
You know, me and you?
Like old times?
I can't.
Come on.
It would be dynamite.
I got this thing to do.
Why don't you come check it out?
No.
I'm going to go, then, you know?
You know how it is.
Take care of yourself, little man.
Know this.
There's different types of users of junk.
You got your rich dilettante square-ass who dabbles now and then and always has enough money to run off to the Riviera if he feels he's fucking around to the danger point.
Street junkies hate these pricks, but they're always suckers, and their money makes them tolerable.
Then you got your upper-middle-class
Westchester preppies... same as the others, basically.
What they're good for is opening their mommy and daddy's eyes to this social virus and putting pressure on the government to do something about it.
Then there's us street kids.
Start fucking around very young,
13 or so...
We think we all got it under control and won't get strung out.
This rarely works.
I'm living proof.
But in the end, you just got to see the junk as another 9-to-5 gig.
The hours are just a bit more inclined to shadows.
[Bell Tolls]

Go fuck yourself, you son of a bitch.
Bastard!
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done, you fuck!
Give us this day our daily bread, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Jesus, Jesus the Nazarene.
Jesus, the nazarene.
Go to hell.
Go to hell.
Go to hell.
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Jim, you're not going to waste the whole day lying around, are you?
Ma, I'm up.
The loony alarm went off.
Well, close the blinds.
Don't look at her and don't listen to her.
How could I not?
Jesus the Nazarene.
Mary the whore.
Mary the hairdresser.
Mary the hairdresser.
Our Father, Who art...
Hey, lady!
Shut up!
[Jim] When I was young, about 8 or so,
I tried making friends with God-- by inviting him to my house to watch the World Series.
He never showed.

Too bad, Father.
I was just starting to enjoy myself.
We can do it again tomorrow if you like, Mr. Carroll.
You okay, Jim?
Does it hurt?
You want to rub it for him, Pedro?
Jim, give it a rest.
You'll never beat him.
The guy's a pervert.
Did you hear him?
"We can do it again tomorrow if you like, Mr. Carroll."
Let's cut out of here.
Come on.
# I was born in a pool #
# They made my mother stand #
# I spat on that surgeon #
# And his trembling hand #
# When I felt the light #
# I was worse than bored #
# I stole a doctor's scalpel #
# And I slit the cord #
# I was a Catholic boy #
# I was redeemed through pain #
# Not through joy #
# I was two months early #
# They put me under glass #
# I screamed and cursed their children #
# When the nurses passed #
# I was convicted of theft #
# As I slid from the womb #
# They led me straight from my mother #
# To a cell in the tombs #
# I was a Catholic boy #
# Redeemed through pain #
# Not through joy #
# They starved me for weeks #
# They thought they'd teach me fear #
# I fed on cellmates' dreams #
# It gave me fine ideas #
# When they cut me loose #
# The time had served me well #
# I'd made allies in heaven #
# Comrades in hell #
# I was a Catholic child #
# The blood ran red #
# The blood ran wild ##
Why, you little prick!
This is my new...
Shit, guys, gotta get outta here.
I threw up on somebody.
I'll get ya!
You little prick!
I'll fucking throw you in the fucking river if i catch ya--
[Boat Horn Blows]
Hey!
What about the four of us versus Wilt Chamberlain?
He was the greatest of all time.
Four of us?
What are you gonna do, Pedro?
tie his shoes together when he ain't looking?
All right...
How'bout the three versus Wilt Chamberlain?
No problem.
You're kidding, right, Mickey?
No.
He can't cover all of us at the same time.
You guys don't miss open jumpers.
And you know who will be there for the rebounds.
Rebounds?
That freak is, like, 7 feet tall.
Jim, I can rebound with anybody.
You're sniffing too much of that shit, that's what you're doing.
Chamberlain would destroy all of us.
End of story.
Alright.
All we got to do is move the ball around.
There's no way we don't win.
Will you tell this kid?
Hey, Mickey, I think you could beat him yourself.
I don't think you need us.
Perfect example... confidence.
I know I could beat him.
Holy shit!
Look at this place.
I tell you what, if our school was this nice,
I'd go more than once a week.
You?
We got a game today, gentlemen.
Who's ready to play some roundball?
I said, who's ready to play some ball?
You give me that laid-back,
"I'm doing my own thing, Jack" attitude out there today, and you're going to find yourself watching the game from the bench.
No smoking, Iggy...
stunts your growth.
You want to be big and strong like me, don't you?
Out.
No smoking, and no pulling your peckers before a game.
Swifty, do you mind?
I'm taking a dump.
Get outta here!
Something die in there?
When we play our game...
-- so Pedro vomits on his head, right?
It goes all over his hair, trickles down his neck.
Some gets in his eye.
He went nuts--
Don't lie about it, either.
What are you doing?
We're signing a ball for Bobby.
Can I sign?
Yeah.
"We're holding your spot for you, kid.
Swifty."
All right.
This one's for Bobby.
All right.
Who's better than we are?
Nobody!
Alright!
Go ahead.
Do some warm-ups.
Pedro, you're in charge.
You're my eyes and ears.
- Hey, Jim?
- Yeah?
That's a nice thing you're doing for Bobby.
Oh, thanks.
Thanks.
You seen Neutron?
I think he's talking to a scout from Saint John's, as a matter of fact, upstairs.
You want to play college ball, don't you?
Yeah.
Someday, I hope.
You know.
Yeah.
Scouts are sniffing you out already.
They like them young.
I'll tell you what.
You come by sometime, and we'll go over the schools together.
Yeah.
All right.
Yeah.
We'll get a pizza, and we'll make a night of it.
Um... actually, my nights are kind of busy right now.
Yeah.
Homework and all, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[Cheering]
We were the hottest Catholic high school team in New York City, on our way to the championship.
We felt like nothing could stop us.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yes!
We're on our way.
We're on our way.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Hands up.
Show me some defense.
Show me some defense.
Good steal.
Put it in.
Put it in.
Yeah!
[Cheering]
All right.
All right.
Way to go.
Aw, geez.
All right, Neutron.
Yes!
Yes!
To the hole, Jim.
[Whistle Blows]
Whoa!
Whoa!
What's going on?
Break it up!
Come on.
Hit him!
Beat that motherfucker!
[Whistle Blows]
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- He fucking held me!
This dude blows the whistle...
Slow it down!
Slow it down!
[Whistle]
[Cheering]
You got to have presence on the court... presence like a cheetah rather than a chimp.
They both got it, but chimpy got to jump his nuts around all day to get it.
Shy cheetah just moves in total nonchalance a sec or two in his sexy, slow strut.
Me, I play like a cheetah.
[Cheering]
Let's go, Rangers-- let's go!
Let's go, Rangers, let's go!
[Cheering]
Yeah!
Ooh!
You got it!
It's ours.
It's ours.
Oh!
Yeah!
[Crowd] 9, 8, 7,
6, 5,
4, 3,
2, 1!
Yay, Jim!
Oh, shit.
That's my team!
That's my team!
[Crowd Cheering]
There's only two things Swifty forbids... using the word "motherfucker"
and stealing from the other team, as long as they're white.
How much for that group of winners over there?
It's $34.90.
$34.90?
Changed the prices or something?
No.
Uh...
I'm a little short.
Do me a favor.
Here.
Take my watch, and I'll come back later with the rest of the money.
No.
What do you mean, no?
I'm sorry, sir.
Those burgers are worth more than the watch is.
I'll be right back.
I told you one burger each, didn't I?
It takes at least eight of these to get filled up.
Yeah.
C'mon, Swifty.
We're growing boys.
Growing boys?
We're hungry motherfuckers.
Funny, huh?
I'm not driving you guys home.
How's that for laughs?
[Knock On Window]
You ripped them off, didn't you?
We're even now.
Swifty, come on.
How are we going to get home?
Face the music, pricks.
What are we going to do?
They got the door blocked off.
You afraid of these pussies?
I ain't afraid of anybody.
What's the problem?
I'm going to ask you this once.
All right?
Where's the stuff you stole from me?
What are you talking about?
No, no, no.
You're not going to fuck with me, all right?
Now, somebody stole my father's ring from my locker, motherfucker.
You want me to cut you?
Is that what you want, there?
There's no problem here.
Hey, guys!
Let's get out of here, c'mon!
You need a fucking army, huh?
Come on!
Come on!
Oh.
Nice.
That from Bobo?
Ha ha ha!
That's his father's ring.
Hey, fellas.
Any of you looking for a date?
Yeah.
Me, sweetheart.
Little horsy ride in Central Park, maybe candlelight dinner?
Why don't we skip right to dessert, huh, baby?
About $15?
Fifteen bucks?
I'll give you a quarter.
Let Pedro suck your tits.
You don't have to be rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
How about you, handsome, huh?
You got $15... for a little head?
Diane, do I look like I need to pay for it?
Yeah... you do.
If it's worth it.
Jimmy...
Jimmy, I know you want some, honey.
$15.
I'll do you so good you'll never forget it, baby.
Hey, hey!
Ooh!
That's a deal.
Bargain from there.
What do you say, guys?
You want to do it?
All four of us?
- Yeah.
- It's a deal.
All four of us.
Aw, shit.
This is all I got, Diane.
Here, have a pretzel.
- Get out of here.
- Beat it.
Yeah, fuck you!
Fucking dopehead.
You see what that shit does to you?
Wow.
Speaking of dopeheads, is that Pedro's mother over there slinging her wares again?
It is!
Hey, Peepee, where you going?
Why do you have to be such an asshole all the time, huh?
Why is the little shoe crying anyway?
His mother's a sneaker.
His father's a loafer.
Somebody's got to be a heel.
Jim, where you going?
Hey, Jim!
Jim.
Hey.
Hey, man.
What's up?
You don't recognize me with my new hairdo?
It's nice.
It's nice.
I like it.
What's going on?
- How are you?
- Good.
Wow.
Look at that.
You like it?
Yeah, I'll tell you what.
When you get out of here, we'll all shave our heads and look like a gang of skinheads.
It's a deal.
All right.
I got something for you here.
Yeah.
Everyone on the team.
Look right here...
even Swifty signed it.
Thanks, man.
You remember when I dunked on that spade in Riverside Park?
You always had good ups.
Yeah.
Oh.
I got something to show you.
Hold on.
What?
Pedro got these out of some lady's purse.
- She's doing it with a donkey.
- Oh, Jesus!
Look at that schlong.
Look at that one.
Oh, I beat your record.
How many times you choke it?
Seven times.
Bullshit.
Seven times.
My mom thinks I have a cold year-round because of all the tissues around the house.
You can keep those if you want.
They're pumping so much junk in me,
I can't even get a decent chubby.
I got an idea.
Come on.
Let's go.
Where we going?
I'm getting you out of this place, man.
C'mon!
What are you, crazy, man?
I can't go anywhere.
Here you go.
I've known Bobby since I was 3.
He's my best friend.
He was the best player on our basketball team.
Two years ago, he got leukemia.
He keeps fighting it off.
I know Bobby's going to beat it.
He could beat anything.
Watch!
Jim, you're going to kill me, man.
If you let go, I swear...
I swear I'll kill you, man.
Watch the bump!
What the hell happened to forty deuce?
Last time I was here, that theater was playing Sperminator II.
Oh, yeah.
I remember that.
No, man.
This whole block has been done over by all these new artists.
It's pretty cool, huh?
Yeah.
They should put your stuff up there.
Yeah.
Right.
Still scribbling stuff in that notebook of yours, ain't you?
Of course.
You bring anything for me?
What, like to read?
No, like to eat.
What do you think?
Yeah.
I mean, I got this, but it's not a big deal.
I don't even remember writing it, to tell you the truth.
Yeah, Yeah.
I'll be the judge of this.
"Little kids shoot marbles
"where branches break the sun
"into graceful shafts of light.
I just want to be pure.
All right.
# What a life #
Nothing like the real thing to float your boat, huh, Bobby?
# What a life #
# Didn't know where, didn't know when... #
That's nice.
# Said that I'll go...
go learn #
# Put up my hand, wait my turn #
# But it never comes, I have to shout out #
# That's life #
# And that's what it's all about #
# So through the comfort and the strife #
# What a life... #
Get me out of here, Jim.
What are you talking about, man?
This was a stupid idea.
I don't feel so good.
Well, can we wait till the end of the show?
Did you hear what I said?
I said get me the hell out of here!
Hey, Bob, man...
I'm really sorry, you know?
Next time, we'll go somewhere...
Ain't gonna be no next time, Jim.
I love it this way... my feet against the tar, which is soft from the spring heat, the slight breeze that runs across your entire body, especially your crotch.
You feel an incredible power being naked under a dome of stars while a giant city is dressed, dodging cars all around you five flights down.
I don't think of anything while I'm doing the actual tugging, least of all the heavy sex fantasies I have to resort to indoors.
Just my own naked self and the stars breathing down, and it's beautiful.
Time sure flies when you're young and jerking off.
[Woman Reads With Difficulty] "Camp summer position.
Driver... taxi."
Hey, that might be good.
You could get your license this summer.
Oh, yeah, Mom.
That sounds really great.
Hey, get your own job, and if you don't get it this summer, you're coming to work with me at the hotel.
Mom, please.
Why are you so worried about this?
Do I even ask you for money?
No.
I'm not worried about the money.
I want you to have responsibility.
I don't want you running around the streets of New York.
Idle time is the devil's plaything, Jim.
The devil's plaything, huh?
Mm-hmm.
That might be a cool title for my first book.
Thanks!
What are you talking about?
What are you writing?
Here.
Ooh.
Um...
Ma, I'm not really that hungry this morning, alright?
- Come on.
You got to eat something.
- I know...
Where you going?
I'm going to shoot some hoops.
Sometimes I feel like something's chasing me, like there's some whacko on a roof somewhere who could snuff me out at any moment.
And I feel this horrible fear.
Will I have time to finish-- the poems breaking loose in my head?
Hey, white boy, you ready for your beating?
Don't let your mouth get you into something your ass can't handle.
I'll shoot you for it.
So it's going to be like that, huh?
I... don't think so.
Yeah!
All right, so you made one.
Big deal.
You made one shot.
Make another.
# The days are muzzled in a vibe #

# Take me where they left the light on #
# Getting close, almost there #
# If that fuzzy silver badge #
# Don't greet us there #
# My head's dizzy, and I'm taking... ##
Yo, Jim!
What's the score?
Come on.
We got to go.
They don't keep score in this game.
Jim, come on.
We're losing the sun.
He's being a dick.
You want me to put a charge in his ass?
Whatch this.
Oh, look it, right here...
Jim's secret diary he's always writing in.
Bet you he wrote some shit about me.
Oh, right here.
"Spring...
Mickey."
Hey, there I am, Jim says.
"Mickey takes out a bottle of carbonic cleaning fluid and suggests we do a little sniffing to get high."
Whoo!
"After four deep whiffs, we're sailing someplace else."
Mickey, what are you doing?
"Bells ringing through my ears, little lights flashing through my eyes."
Mickey, put that down, all right?
"I pictured myself
"paddling across a river with black water,
"only the canoe was going backwards instead of forwards,
"with clouds that had faces.
Laughing, spooky, fun-house laughs..."
- Give it back, alright?
- What is that shit?
Why do you have to be such a schmuck, Mickey?
What are you talking about?
Don't you ever touch that again.
It's private.
What's your problem?
I'm...
I'm sorry.
He's writing about me, I can't read about it?
Jesus!
Hey, Jim, come on.
We're gone.
Yo, we got a cab!
Hey, cabby!
Hey, swami!
So, Shakespeare, you going to finish the game?
C'mon, Reggie, you know this game never ends.
See you later, all right?
Every crowd has its little games to prove if you're a punk or not.
My cousin in Jersey plays chickie, which is two cars heading towards each other at about 80 miles per hour.
First driver to swerve out of the way is, of course, chicken.
In Brooklyn, they make you press a lit cigarette into your arm and have it burn all the way down to the filter without the slightest flinch.
Us, Manhattan boys, we jump off cliffs into the Harlem River, which is literally shitty, because half a million toilets flush into it every day.
Whoo-oo!
[Whistles]
Yeah!
Oooh!
Yeah!
Hey, y'all, I carried the clothes up, but I ain't carrying them down.
Peepee, this is you... all 33 pounds of you, gone with the wind.
Wow.
That's a long way down.
Devil's toe is no big deal.
We've all done it a million times.
I never done it.
You never did it?
Pedro, you never do nothing.
You know who was awesome on this rock?
Bobby.
That kids would do back flips off this rock.
Hey, Mickey.
What?
Don't talk about him like he's dead.
He's not dead.
There goes the circle line.
Check it out.
[Horn Blows]
Whoo!
Full moon!
Whoo!
Hey, yo!
Whoo!
Hey, circle this!
[Whistle]
Hey, I'm going.
Watch out, watch out...
I'm going to show you how to do it.
Ye-ea-ah!
That was a good jump.
Oh, he's nuts.
Hey, I'm going to walk down.
What you talking about?
You can't walk down.
There's no way to walk down.
I ain't jumping.
Pedro, your clothes are down there.
How you gonna get your clothes?
You going to walk around naked all day?
Pedro, if you don't jump, Mickey's going to tease you so bad--
You might as well just jump and get it over with.
Feel better.
What the hell, right?
Oh... shit...
Pedro!
Bad form.
Bad form.
Oh...
My God!
Oh, shit.
Is he all right?
Pedro, you all right?
You ready?
Yeah.
Listen, don't tell the other guys, but when we leave here, I got a surprise for you.
Tell me what it is.
It's a surprise.
Trust me, all right?
Ouch, don't mess around, man...
Alright, you ready?
Come on!
You ready?
- Let's jump.
- On three.
Ready?
Uh-huh.
1, 2,
3.
Come on.
Let's go.
What's up, Manny?
How you doing?
Fine.
Thank you, sir.
This is my friend Jim.
How you doing?
I can't believe I hit my head on that rock.
It's killing me.
Jim, um, this is Winkie.
- Hi.
- How you doing?
Good.
And this... this is Blinkie.
- Hi.
- Hi.
# I lost my heart #
# Under the bridge #

# And now I moan #
# And now I holler #
# She'll never know #
# Just what I found #
# That blue-eyed girl # lt'll make you fuck like Superman.
# She said no more #

I can't think of anything with a single bound.

# See her again... #
Do you have any protection?
Yeah.
This one's, uh, ribbed for extra pleasure.
So what are you waiting for?
What do you mean?
Take off your clothes.
Well, uh... could we shut off the lights first?

Your eyes got shut with secret chains that pillow armies eventually set free... like soft horses through toy deserts.
I love this mansion, though it's too many windows... to open halfway each morning... to close halfway each night.
I looked at his body, and it was death for the first time.
His face was thin and wrinkled, almost apelike.
His hair, just gray patches on his scalp.
He looked 60 years old, and he was 16.
Couldn't believe how skinny he was... much skinnier than he was in the hospital.
It was like having the skeleton of someone you knew put right in front of you.
I felt dazed, like I'd just come out of a four-hour movie I didn't understand.
I kept thinking about his face... and death... what a cheat the whole thing was.
Hey, you guys remember that Halloween when Bobby filled that paper bag with dog shit, lit it on fire and put it outside Father Dunne's door, and we all hid behind the dumpster?
Yeah.
I could picture Father Dunne comming outside, stepping on that shit.
Picture him in the john-- scraping the shit off his shoe like this.
You think that'll keep him out of heaven?
Are you kidding?
Jesus Christ himself would have laughed at that.
It was hilarious!
What about the time at the formal when Bobby got caught in the bathroom with Mary Ann Dugan and McNulty came in and busted him?
He was, like, "Father, I swear.
We weren't doing anything."
Meanwhile she's got a giant wad of cum hanging off her face.
I tell you, that kid was definitely a pisser.
It was weird seeing him today, man.
He was all shriveled up and wrinkled.
He looked like my grandfather.
I'll tell you what, though.
That kid was in so much pain, it's better off he died.
How the hell would you know, Mickey?
Did you go and visit him?
Huh?
Any of you guys go and visit him?
All right.
Then shut the fuck up.
Hey, Jim.
Look at my brother's girlfriend in the park.
She's sitting there, eating a sandwich.
Next thing you know, she's shot in the head.
She's dead.
It's over.
What about little Teddy Rayhill?
Perfect example.
Remember that night he was up on the roof, and he was doing poppers, having a great time, laughing his ass off
He started walking backwards...
Boom!
He fell right off the goddamn roof.
It was meant to be, right?
Fuck that, you guys!
Bobby was the best fucking guy around, you know that?
What are you, a bunch of idiots?
You don't even understand, do you?
Jim, you all right?
Huh?
Listen, maybe you should talk to one of the priests.
I don't know.
Maybe...
Maybe they can help you out.
Help me out?
I wouldn't ask one of those cocksuckers for directions.
You know what?
You guys need to lighten the fuck up, all right?
Let bygones be fucking bygones.
Shitty fucking world.
Live life to the fucking fullest.
You know what I mean?
Shit happens, man.
Shit fucking happens.
[Thunder]
Come on.
Let's go.
Jim, come on.
You're growing up, and rain sort of remains on the branches of a tree that will someday rule the earth.
And that's good that there's rain.
Clears the month of your sorry rainbow expressions.
And it clears the streets of the silent armies so we can dance.
# Ted sniffing glue He was 12 years old #
# Fell from the roof on east 2-9 #
# Cathy was 11 when she pulled the plug # # 26 reds and a bottle of wine #
# Bobby had leukemia, 14 years old #
# He looked like 65 when he died #
# He was a friend of mine #
# Those are people who died, died #
# Those are people who died, died #
# Those are people who died, died #
# Those are people who died, died #
# They were all my friends #
# They just died #
# Those are people who died, died #
# Those are people who died, died #
# Those are people who died, died #
# Those are people who died, died #
# They were all my friends and they died ##
Did I ever tell you about the first time I did heroin?
I went down to Pedro's basement.
All sorts of characters were in the storage-room shooting gallery.
I was just going to sniff a bag, but a guy says,
"If you're going to sniff, might as well pop it, and if you're going to pop it, might as well mainline."
I was scared of needles, but I gave in.
It was like a long heat wave through my body.
Any ache or pain or sadness or guilty feeling was completely flushed out.
Look, Ma, I'm not in the mood for your dime-store psychology, all right?
Could you just please leave me alone?
I got a little sick, all right?
We're not going to live like this, Jim.
We're not going to live like this.
I'm warning you!
I'm telling you.
Oh, God, Mom.
You're always warning me, aren't you?
Blah, blah, blah.
You're always in my fucking ear.
Blah, blah, blah.
You don't know anything.
What are you talking about?
Go clean toilets or whatever the hell it is you do.
When you're done, clean this one.
Don't talk like that!
What's the matter with you?
Gee whiz, Ma, you know... we got to have these heart-to-heart talks more often.
They're really good for us.
I don't know you.
I don't believe this is you, Jim.
Please, Jim.
I don't know who you are.
Yeah, I know.
I was such a good little boy, right... with such potential, wasn't that it?
Is that what you're going to say?
Oh, Jim.
What's happening?
Jim, what's happening?
First, it's a Saturday-night thing, and you feel cool, like a gangster or a rock star.
It's just something to kill the boredom, you know?
They call it a chippie, a small habit.
It feels so good, you start doing it on Tuesdays, then Thursdays.
Then it's got you.
Every wise-ass punk on the block says it won't happen to them, but it does.
Go do it!
I ain't doing it.
I always do it!
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could you tell me the fastest way to the subway?
Yeah.
That's the "B" train.
Go to this corner and make a left.
It's right there.
What are you doing?
Let go!
Let go!
Let go of that!
Oh, my God!
What?
Oh!
- Help!
No!
No!
- What are you doing?
Let's go!
Come on!
I don't feel like going in today.
Father, is it all right if I don't go in today?
Why?
What are you scared of?
Nothing.
I just don't feel like it, that's all.
I imagine you have more to confess than anybody here.
Unburden yourself.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been about four months since my last confession.
Yes, my son?
Well, I don't know where to start, Father.
Have you taken the name of Jesus Christ in vain?
Yeah.
Yeah, I have.
Have you disrespected your mother and father?
Uh-huh.
Have you stolen or cheated your fellow man?
Yeah, but I'm not proud of it.
Have you had impure thoughts or engaged in impure deeds?
Oh, Father, you have no idea.
Is there something else that you want to tell me in your own words?
I've done all kinds of crazy shit.
Oh, excuse me, Father.
Fuck, I'm s...
Christ, I have a dirty mouth.
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry about that.
Will you just go on?
10 Hail Marys, five Our Fathers.
What do you mean?
And that's it?
That's my punishment?
You know something?
My friend Bobby, he was the best, and he's dead.
This sucks!
You know that?
This really sucks.
It's not fair, Father.
Your nose is running, your stomach cramps, your legs feel like they've played six straight games on top of each other, and the voice is always there in the back of your head...
"Just one more time.
then we'll stop."
Quick to the ball.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Good, Ignatius.
Good.
Good.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Right behind you.
Sir, all right if I use the bathroom, Coach?
Jim, you got a bladder like a woman.
Let's go.
Again.
There we go.
Right behind him.
Right behind him.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Two hands.
Jim?
I thought you were taking a piss.
Oh.
What are you doing in here every practice?
Have you been waiting for me, Jim?
Giving me some kind of a signal?
What are you talking about, Swifty?
Don't act surprised.
Do we understand each other?
It's not going to happen, Swifty.
Put the money away.
You want more?
Here.
Just let me do it.
Get the fuck out of my face!
Take it easy, Jim.
You can't blame me for trying.
I made a mistake, all right?
Let's just pretend it never happened.
Things will go back to exactly how they were before.
Okay?
Okay?
Here, keep the money.
Keep the money.
Just don't tell anybody, all right?
Good.
Tell anybody you want!
Nobody's going to believe a drughead like you, anyway.
You think we don't know what you've been doing?
Give me the fucking money and get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck-- Get the fuck out here!
Come on!
Get out of here!
And you want to stop.
You really do.
But it's like a dream.
You can't stop dreams.
They move in crazy pieces, any way they want to, and suddenly, you're capable of anything.
Ha ha ha!
No!
Wake up, Mr. Carroll!
It's later than you think.
Oh.
All right!
- I need a lift.
- All right.
What do you got?
Three different pills.
Which are the ups?
I never asked.
I thought one of youse would know.
Oh, great.
We look like pharmacists?
I don't know what to take.
What do we take?
Let me see.
The blacks and the reds are the ups.
I think the pink ones are the ups.
Why?
'Cuz I associate pink with lightness, you know?
The black ones seem like they'd knock you on your ass.
They might be faded seconals.
No, they're not faded.
They'd be sticky.
They're not.
That's bullshit.
- Fuck your mother.
- My what?
All right!
Calm down.
Don't ever talk about my mother.
Don't ever hit me like that again.
Come on!
Alright!
Give me your hat.
We got a game to play, alright?
Just give me something.
Hi, Neutron.
Let me ask him.
Neutron, you know which ones are the ups?
I think you should put that shit away before Swifty comes in here.
Why you acting like such a square ass?
Screw you, Mickey.
Screw you, too, Tough guy.
Man.
I'm just going to take the black.
You sure?
Mm-hmm.
You got a better idea?
Nope.
Your guess is as good as mine, Jimbo.
It's on today.
50 rebounds.
Good.
Come on.
Let's go.
I'm your friend now, right?
What, I got to smack you again, c'mon!
Yeah, take your little rat with you.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, what's up?
Why are you acting like that?
You know what's wrong.
Used to be about getting high and playing basketball.
Now it's just about getting high with you.
You're blowing it, Jim.
Oh, come on.
I don't need to hear this from you, Neutron.
Yeah, you do, Jim!
Listen, no, Jim!
I'm really proud of you, man.
Everything's cool.
You look great.
I'll see you in the NBA.

Did you find it?
No, Father.
It's clean.
There's no drugs in there.
Thank you, Officer.
I told you we didn't have nothing.
You boys think you're awfully smart, don't you?
Well, you're both suspended for a week!
Ooh...
And you'll never play basketball here again.
That you can count on.
You can't kick me off the team, Swifty.
Oh?
Why is that?
'Cause I quit the team... and the school and this whole faggot-ass scene, that's why.
I could second that motion.
Your resignations are accepted!
Neutron, you coming with us?
Huh?
Yeah.
That's what I figured.
Come on, man.
I'm fucking out of here.
Don't worry, Swifty.
I'm not going to rat you out.
And in the next life, Father,
I'm going to have the paddle!
Get out!
Thanks a lot, Neutron.
Thanks, man.
I can't believe this, you know?
I know.
What happened to the pills?
We got kicked out of the school, Mickey.
Who cares, man?
We lost the pills.
The cops took them--
We can't play ball anymore.
Jim, who cares about school, man?
We just lost $40 worth of pharmaceuticals.
I know what happened to them, too.
The cops, they take that all the time.
They either pop them themselves or they sell them.
What's my mom going to say, man?
When I go home?
She ain't gonna say nothing.
You just tell her you're going to school every day in the morning.
Let's get out of here, man...
Go get into something.
You never sold any pills at the schoolyard?
No.
So it's all a big conspiracy against you.
Right, Jim?
Yeah.
Maybe it is.
Maybe it's not.
You been missing these?
What are you going to tell me...
they're vitamins?
Oh, fuck you, Ma.
What?
!
Get out of my house!
Oh, is that what you want, Ma?
Get out!
You don't talk to me that way!
If that's what you want, I'm fucking out of here.
All right?
What are you doing?
I'm leaving!
What do you think?
I wan you to take all your shit!
I'll help you.
Here!
You want me to leave?
Yes.
Get out!
I'm out of here.
Get the fuck out of my way!
This garbage is going to kill you, Jim!
I'm gone!
Gonna to kill you!
Don't you understand?
I can't watch you kill yourself?
Ma, you're never going to fucking see me again, alright?
Just remember that.
Don't say that, Jim.
Don't say that!
It was a dream, not a nightmare... a beautiful dream I could never imagine in a thousand nods.
I saw this girl next to me who wasn't beautiful until she smiled,
and I felt that smile come at me and heat waves following, soaking through my body and out my fingertips in shafts of color.
And I knew somewhere in the world... somewhere...
that there was love for me.
We just got to raise enough cash to keep our heads straight.
Luckily, finding money in New York is like getting laid at the prom... easy.
- Fuck it, Pedro!
- What's the matter with you?
Jesus!
Watch the road.
You could kill us all, c'mon!
I get 1,500 bucks for this car.
If it's whacked up, it's worth nothing.
We should buy shit in bulk, man
We'll put it on the street and make real money.
That's 500 bucks a piece.
We'll be on for days, nights, weeks.
Yeah, man.
I'd love to go to Puerto Rico, soak up some rays, you know?
See my bitch?
That's what I'd like to do.
- What are you talking about?
- What bitch?
We haven't seen a picture or nothing.
She's 500 pounds, Jim.
She got a mustache thicker than her father.
No.
That's your mother, Mickey.
She does not exist.
Don't fool yourself.
Be careful.
I'm about to whack.
Oh, shit, man.
My brother's going to take care of us and this car.
Pedro, wake the fuck up!
Pedro, come on, man!
You're going to get us killed, what are you doing?
I got it, man.
You want me to drive?
Mickey, you better drive the car.
I'm serious, man.
Just don't blow my high.
If there's a scratch in the car, my brother'll kill me.
Yo, get out of the booth!
Get out the booth, huh?
Get out.
Fucking...
What's up?
What's up?
Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Where's the car?
It's good to see you, too.
It's over here.
It's nice.
It's smokin'.
You tell me that?
It's everything you wanted.
Get your hands off.
You guys look like shit.
Oh, my God.
They're taking the car.
Show me the sign, man!
Show me the freaking sign!
It's right there.
You see?
It says "tow-away." Huh?
You scumbags even read?
I should kick all your punk asses!
Goddamn it!
I can get you another car tonight.
Yeah?
John Halligan is waiting for this car.
I got him out of bed with his wife.
You know how this makes me fucking look?
Kenny, get off.
You're too stupid to be my brother!
You're too stupid!
You want a piece of me, Carroll?
Back off!
Back off!
- Kenny, no more!
- Mr. Tough Guy.
- Kenny, no more!
- Huh?
Tough guy?
Give me a sip of your soda.
You wipe off the bottle before you take a sip?
You don't even think twice about sharing works with Mickey.
You think you'll catch something from the bottle you're not catch from a needle?
You mistake me for somebody who gives a shit.
Headquarters...
home on and off to every down-and-out junkie and wino from 14th Street to the Bowery.
It's like a fucking all-star team.
Jimmy, the other day, my mother's been ragging on me,
"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
"You've tried every other way.
Go to church.
Put yourself in Christ's hands."
So I do it, man.
I figure, give it a shot.
I dig Jesus.
So, I go, man.
High mass...
a choir and everything.
The first thing I see on the right, the side altar, are those little candles in the red glass that we used when it was windy in the park to cook up.
And then, this altar boy, he's coming down the aisle with this 6-foot candle.
I envision this huge spoon above it, man, with, like, shopping bags full of dope inside of it.
And then the kicker comes, man.
The priest, he starts doing the thing with the incense.
You know, starts wafting out.
I'm in the back.
It finally hits me.
"Where do I know this smell from, man?
My room, man."
It's the smell exactly of really primo dope cooking up.
Yeah?
Exactly the same.
So what happened next?
At that point, I split.
I went home,
I went inside my closet,
I got my stash out of the inside pocket of my sharkskin easter suit, and I got stoned.
Ba bing... ba bang.
I love a ritual.
Oh, Mary, if you can hear me...
I need you to fill Jim's heart with love because he really needs it now.
Oh, God... please watch over my son.
He needs you now.
Just take care of him, okay?
I'll be okay.
I love you, Jim.
I love you.
Hey, you holding?
You straight, man?
Get out of here.
Come on.
No.
Hey, have you seen Falco?
Come on, man.
Are you holding anything?
Hey, Diane...
Come here, Diane.
- I'll take care of you, babe.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
How about some of this?
Ha ha!
I wouldn't do you for a bag, you fucking piece of shit.
Jim.
Jimmy.
You're looking good.
Who's your embalmer?
I want some of what you got.
Shh.
Check everything in this place.
Wow.
I always wanted to use these syrup pumps.
And these professional ice-cream scoopers.
Oh, my God.
Don't make me do it!
I'll do it!
I swear to God!
Jim, watch out.
Come on!
It's not opening.
They don't make them like this anymore.
You got to get it from the side.
I got it!
Oh, cool.
Change!
Shit!
Let's get out of here.
It's locked.
We got to go out the back.
Pedro, let's get out of here!
What am I, hallucinating here?
Pedro, you'll get us caught.
The cops are going to come.
Oh, you want to be tough, huh?
Go ahead... take another sip so I can blow your fucking head all over the counter!
Go ahead, Pedro!
Go ahead!
Come on, guys!
Let's go.
Put that gun away!
Don't fuck with me, motherfucker!
What the hell are you doing, Mickey?
What the hell did you do that for?
Let that little spic rot, man!
He'll get us caught.
Jim, the cops are coming.
Come on!
Jim!
Jim!
Pedro!
Pedro!
Jim!
Freeze!
Freeze!
On your stomach!
On your stomach!
I didn't do anything, I'm telling you!
This is it, man.
That Jew got to keep the money under his pillow.
Hey, Jim, I know you're still mad about Pedro.
I couldn't do nothing, man.
He was going to get us caught.
Definitely shouldn't have went that far.
What happened to you?
Your mother kick your ass?
Yeah, real funny.
Bring us a couple of Cokes, will you?
You all right?
Hey, bartender, move out of the way.
Jim, I'm getting sick.
I got to get some money to cop.
Jim.
You with me here?
What the hell are you wa...
Oh, shit.
That's Neutron.
That's the all-American high school game?
We could have played in that game.
Who gives a shit?
Come on.
I'm waiting to hear back on a scholarship from Saint John's...
I'm not sure about it, but hopefully it will work out.
Jim, I'm starting to jones.
Gotta get out there.
We need some money.
Jim, don't dwell on these dreams, man.
Will you come on?
Meet you outside, man.
I'm getting sick.
You want to meet me out there?
Is it okay if I say hi to my mom?
Hi, Mom.
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.
# You don't know it, but you're coming right along #
# Please be strong #
# You don't know it, but you're coming right along ##
Hey, you!
Stop!
You can't go in there!
Stop!
What do you want?
You realize what time it is?
Yeah.
Um... is Winkie and Blinkie here?
Who the hell are Winkie and Blinkie?
Hey, guys.
Lisa, Mel, you know this boy?
No, Daddy.
Come on.
All right.
Come on.
Get out of here.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Rubin.
He got past me.
- Don't let it happen again.
It won't happen again.
Get out of here!
What?
What?
Asshole.
Hey, fuck-up, get fucking up, man!
- What's your problem, man?
- What's YOUR problem, mam?
You sold my girlfriend some shit the other day.
You almost killed her.
What was it... rat poison?
It's not my fault your girl can't handle her drugs.
I want my fucking $20 back, man.
Look, there's no money-back guarantees.
I'm not selling refrigerators here.
Oh, yeah?
I'll cut you a dynamite deal on mexican shit.
Give me my $20, or we'll go outside.
If we go outside, one of us is going to get hurt.
I told you one of us would get hurt.
Is that right?
It's been hard...
the writing...
lately.
Terrible numbness, then suddenly it comes... in beautiful fragments or terrible dreams... like nods... so high.
Uh!
Reggie, is that you?
Who the fuck do you think it is?
Ohh...
Don't worry, you're not dead yet.
It's not bad.
Hey, give me that.
How come it's all wet?
Because you pissed on it.
I didn't say you could read this.
What, have you been digging through all my stuff?
I need...
I got to get out of here.
Where's my jacket?
You're welcome.
What the hell am I thanking you for?
Because you was frozen in the snow like a goddamn creamsicle.
Where is it?
What?
You know what the fuck I'm talking about, Reggie!
Where is it?
You mean this?
Huh?
Give it to me.
I'll cut your fucking throat, Reggie!
Give it to me, all right?
Just give it to me!
Oh, give it to me!
Give it to me!
I'm serious!
Give me it!
Give it to me!
Goddamn it!
I'll make you an incredible offer.
I'm going to save your life twice in one day, understand me?
You should have left me in the fucking snow, man.
Give me the money for my dope, too.
I'm not gonna suck your dick, all right?
Put that away.
Who the hell wants you to suck their dick?
Goddamn it!
Look at yourself!
Just look at yourself.
Oh, Reggie... it's okay.
Why are you doing this?
Because once upon a time, somebody helped me, and I always pay what I owe.
Reggie.
Reggie, I just need a taste.
I just need a little something, Reggie.
You don't understand.
It hurts, Reggie!
Ow!
Reggie, I got to go.
I got to go see my mom.
You got to let me get out of here, Reggie.
Reggie!
It hur...
It hurts.
Aah!
Shit!
Oh, boy...
# Touch the taste and taste the smell #
# Smell the scent, all the gifts you gave to me, baby #
# The food of your brain #
# The room is spinning round #
# I never come down #
# The room is spinning round #
# I never come down... #
Reggie.
you got to give me it.
You got to give me it, Reggie.
Please!
Oh!
Reggie, come on!
# I remember you, too #
# I blew my mind ##
Wake up.
Can't sleep all day.
Oh.
Thanks.
Jesus Christ.
What happened to you?
What does it look like?
Motherfucker shot me.
Woke my black ass up.
Shit.
Look, uh...
I'll be back in the morning, Jim.
You just stay cool.
You start to get panicky, write about me in that book of yours.
Actually, I was a little hurt I wasn't mentioned.
You really like my writing, huh, Reggie?
Damn, man, I told you four times already.
What do you want me to do?
Bend over and kiss your ass?
Hey, Reg, do me a favor.
While you're out, pick me up a bag.
# The room is spinning round #
# I may never come down #
I am alone.
Not just me.
We're alone... alone forever.
And who's at the end of that forever tunnel I run through, up Fifth with the wallpaper of skyscrapers?
I'm thinking, after all those beautiful trips, that this is one of those bad ones.
Diane?
Hey!
Jim.
Remember me?
Man, you look great.
Yeah, thanks.
Good to see somebody from the old neighborhood...
What do you want, Jim?
- You holding anything?
- No.
Just like a 5 or something?
Just to tide me over, you know?
Please, Diane?
Come on.
Yeah.
For an old friend?
Why not?
I've been looking all over for this.
Oh, you know what?
I only got a 20.
A 20 is good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
A 20 is great, yeah.
That would help me out a lot.
- You want a 20?
- Yeah.
Why don't you go buy yourself some pretzels, you asshole.
You bitch!
You're nothing but a whore!
I don't give a shit about your clothes!
You're still a whore to me!
Yeah?
Shut up.
Look at you.
Oh, are you desperate now, baby?
Who's a whore now?
Don't talk to me like that, you bitch!
Ha ha.
Who's laughing, stupid?
Don't play a game with me!
I know you!
Ah!
Shit.
Oh, man.
Shit.
Ha ha ha!
Mickey.
Mick, what's up, man?
Hey, what's up, man?
Did you get anything?
No, not a dime.
You score?
Yeah, I got something.
What'd you get?
About 35 bucks.
35?
Where'd you get it?
I robbed some fucking asshole on the "D" train.
Dude, 35 will keep us on for, like, two days.
Well, could we get some stuff, man?
I'm fucking... my head is...
I see some spics.
I think we can score.
You wanna check it out?
- Yeah, alright.
- Come on.
They're over here.
Why the fuck do we have to cop on the street all the time?
My fucking nuts are itching like crazy.
Think this is him?
Is your name Pino?
Listen... could we get us some dope?
The dude over there said you could help.
You want to cop some shit?
Let me see some cash.
I got it here.
Let me see.
Hey, no money without no taste.
You want a taste?
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Hurry, man.
Come on.
There's fucking cops all over.
That's good, man.
That's good.
All right, listen...
4 for 35.
4 for 35, man?
Come on, man.
$5.00 short.
What's the big deal?
Ta bien, chico...
Toma, toma.
- You got four?
- Yeah.
We should taste this.
Where are we going to cook it up?
I don't know about his guy.
No, he's cool.
Fuck, man!
What's the matter?
- Just taste it!
Come on.
- What do you mean?
I tasted it.
He beat us.
He fucking beat us.
I swear to fucking God...
Put that away!
I'm gonna kill this mother--!
- Come here, motherfucker!
- Put it away!
I'm going to fucking kill you, you motherfucker!
Motherfucker, you're fucking dead, you hear me?
Dude, don't make me do it.
Where's the money?
I want the money.
I want the money and the bags.
Where's the fucking money?
The fucking money!
I want it!
Aah!
No!
-Oh, shit!
- We fucking killed him!
What the fuck do you mean, we?
I didn't fucking touch him!
Don't put that shit on me!
He beat us, man!
He deserved it!
You went too far, Mickey!
Oh, shit!
Is he dead?
Of course he's fucking dead!
He fell six stories!
Jim, come on.
Come on!
Will you come one?
Jim, don't make me leave you here!
Oh, shit.
# Star #
# I'll reach you if I try #
# Show me the truth, yeah #
# Star #
# I'll reach you if I try #
# Show me the truth, yeah ##
Come on, get back up!
Come on!
Get off of me!
What are you doing?
Who is it?
Ma...
let me in.
Ma, let me in!
Please, Ma.
Ma?
Hey, Ma?
Are you in there, Ma?
Ma, is that you?
Yeah.
Ma?
Ma?
- Are you there?
- Yeah.
Hi.
Hi, Ma.
Hi.
Hi.
Listen, I need you to help me out, all right?
I need you to give me some money.
Okay?
I need you to give me, like, five doll...
Like, $20, something like that because I'm in some trouble.
Ma?
Do you hear me, Ma?
Yeah, I hear you.
I can't help you.
Okay, listen, what you got to do is give me some money, okay?
Jim, I can't do that.
Why not?
Mom, you know I'm not going to do anything with it.
I just need to go out of town for a little while 'cause I got into some trouble, and I need some help.
Okay?
So, you got to give me some money, Mom.
Can you hold my hand?
Yeah, I'll hold your hand.
Mom, can you give me some money, please?
Mom, can you give me some money, please?
Stop fucking around!
I can't.
Mom, give me some fucking money, please!
What are you doing?
I'm your son!
I don't have any.
Mom, don't fuck around like this!
Give me some money!
Mom!
Come on!
Let me in the fucking door!
Oh, God.
Oh, fuck.
Let me in.
I need some money.
I need some money real bad.
Ohh...
Oh, God.
Someone's breaking into my apartment.
They have a knife.
Oh!
Mom!
You don't understand, Mom.
You don't know what you're fucking doing to me.
Mom, I'm in pain.
How could you do this to your son, you bitch?
You fucking bitch!
Ah!
Oh, let me in!
I'll do anything!
I'll be a good boy!
I'll be a good boy, mom, if you let me in.
Get off me!
Get off!
No!
No!
You fuckers!
You're not going to do this!
Fuck you!
Ma!
Don't do this!
Ma!
Ma!
Ma!
I got six months in Riker's Island for assault, robbery, resisting arrest, and possession of narcotics.
I sweated out a horrible cure and stayed clean the whole stretch even though it's been easier to get good junk in here than it is on the street.
Shit, it's been hard, man.
All I've been doing is reading these diaries and wondering how the hell I'm still alive, and even if I care.
Suffice to say that I'm finished with the asshole bandits of shower-room rape, and suffice to say that those swine guards won't draw blood from my ankles again.
Suffice to say that I've been just thinking about dumb stuff like what a nice concept it is to have a godmother and a godfather, wondering who my godparents might be.
My mom won't visit me here, so I guess I'll just have to wait till I get home to ask.
Jim?
Who's there?
It's me.
Pedro?
What's up, man?
Nothing.
You know.
I...
I hear you come here.
I just came by to say hi.
I'm sorry about that night at the candy store and everything.
It's all right.
Reform school turned out to be real cool, so don't sweat it.
Did you hear about Mickey, that scumbag?
He went and threw some chump off a roof.
He's getting 5 to 15 years, man.
They tried him like an adult.
Shit.
I got a present for you, Jim.
A bag of the finest dope in Manhattan.
You know, me and you?
Like old times?
I can't.
Come on.
It would be dynamite.
I got this thing to do.
Why don't you come check it out?
No.
I'm going to go, then, you know?
You know how it is.
Take care of yourself, little man.
Know this.
There's different types of users of junk.
You got your rich dilettante square-ass who dabbles now and then and always has enough money to run off to the Riviera if he feels he's fucking around to the danger point.
Street junkies hate these pricks, but they're always suckers, and their money makes them tolerable.
Then you got your upper-middle-class
Westchester preppies... same as the others, basically.
What they're good for is opening their mommy and daddy's eyes to this social virus and putting pressure on the government to do something about it.
Then there's us street kids.
Start fucking around very young,
13 or so...
We think we all got it under control and won't get strung out.
This rarely works.
I'm living proof.
But in the end, you just got to see the junk as another 9-to-5 gig.
The hours are just a bit more inclined to shadows.
Go fuck yourself, you son of a bitch.
Bastard!
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done, you fuck!
Give us this day our daily bread, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Jesus, Jesus the Nazarene.
Jesus, the nazarene.
Go to hell.
Go to hell.
Go to hell.
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!
Jim, you're not going to waste the whole day lying around, are you?
Ma, I'm up.
The loony alarm went off.
Well, close the blinds.
Don't look at her and don't listen to her.
How could I not?
Jesus the Nazarene.
Mary the whore.
Mary the hairdresser.
Mary the hairdresser.
Our Father, Who art...
Hey, lady!
Shut up!
When I was young, about 8 or so,
I tried making friends with God...
By inviting him to my house to watch the World Series.
He never showed.
Too bad, Father.
I was just starting to enjoy myself.
We can do it again tomorrow if you like, Mr. Carroll.
You okay, Jim?
Does it hurt?
You want to rub it for him, Pedro?
Jim, give it a rest.
You'll never beat him.
The guy's a pervert.
Did you hear him?
"We can do it again tomorrow if you like, Mr. Carroll."
Let's cut out of here.
Come on.
# I was born in a pool #
# They made my mother stand #
# I spat on that surgeon #
# And his trembling hand #
# When I felt the light #
# I was worse than bored #
# I stole a doctor's scalpel #
# And I slit the cord #
# I was a Catholic boy #
# I was redeemed through pain #
# Not through joy #
# I was two months early #
# They put me under glass #
# I screamed and cursed their children #
# When the nurses passed #
# I was convicted of theft #
# As I slid from the womb #
# They led me straight from my mother #
# To a cell in the tombs #
# I was a Catholic boy #
# Redeemed through pain #
# Not through joy #
# They starved me for weeks #
# They thought they'd teach me fear #
# I fed on cellmates' dreams #
# It gave me fine ideas #
# When they cut me loose #
# The time had served me well #
# I'd made allies in heaven #
# Comrades in hell #
# I was a Catholic child #
# The blood ran red #
# The blood ran wild # #
Why, you little prick!
This is my new...
Shit, guys, gotta get outta here.
I threw up on somebody.
I'll get ya!
You little prick!
I'll fucking throw you in the fucking river if I catch ya...
Hey!
What about the four of us versus Wilt Chamberlain?
He was the greatest of all time.
Four of us?
What are you gonna do, Pedro?
Tie his shoes together when he ain't looking?
All right...
How'bout the three versus Wilt Chamberlain?
No problem.
You're kidding, right, Mickey?
No.
He can't cover all of us at the same time.
You guys don't miss open jumpers.
And you know who will be there for the rebounds.
Rebounds?
That freak is, like, 7 feet tall.
Jim, I can rebound with anybody.
You're sniffing too much of that shit, that's what you're doing.
Chamberlain would destroy all of us.
End of story.
Alright.
All we got to do is move the ball around.
There's no way we don't win.
Will you tell this kid?
Hey, Mickey, I think you could beat him yourself.
I don't think you need us.
Perfect example... confidence.
I know I could beat him.
Holy shit!
Look at this place.
I tell you what, if our school was this nice,
I'd go more than once a week.
You?
We got a game today, gentlemen.
Who's ready to play some roundball?
I said, who's ready to play some ball?
You give me that laid-back,
"I'm doing my own thing, Jack" attitude out there today, and you're going to find yourself watching the game from the bench.
No smoking, Iggy...
stunts your growth.
You want to be big and strong like me, don't you?
Out.
No smoking, and no pulling your peckers before a game.
Swifty, do you mind?
I'm taking a dump.
Get outta here!
Something die in there?
When we play our game so Pedro vomits on his head, right?
It goes all over his hair, trickles down his neck.
Some gets in his eye.
He went nuts...
Don't lie about it, either.
What are you doing?
We're signing a ball for Bobby.
Can I sign?
Yeah.
"We're holding your spot for you, kid.
Swifty."
All right.
This one's for Bobby.
All right.
Who's better than we are?
Nobody!
Alright!
Go ahead.
Do some warm-ups.
Pedro, you're in charge.
You're my eyes and ears.
- Hey, Jim?
- Yeah?
That's a nice thing you're doing for Bobby.
Oh, thanks.
Thanks.
You seen Neutron?
I think he's talking to a scout from Saint John's, as a matter of fact, upstairs.
You want to play college ball, don't you?
Yeah.
Someday, I hope.
You know.
Yeah.
Scouts are sniffing you out already.
They like them young.
I'll tell you what.
You come by sometime, and we'll go over the schools together.
Yeah.
All right.
Yeah.
We'll get a pizza, and we'll make a night of it.
Um... actually, my nights are kind of busy right now.
Yeah.
Homework and all, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
We were the hottest Catholic high school team in New York City, on our way to the championship.
We felt like nothing could stop us.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yes!
We're on our way.
We're on our way.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Hands up.
Show me some defense.
Show me some defense.
Good steal.
Put it in.
Put it in.
Yeah!
All right.
All right.
Way to go.
Aw, geez.
All right, Neutron.
Yes!
Yes!
To the hole, Jim.
Whoa!
Whoa!
What's going on?
Break it up!
Come on.
Hit him!
Beat that motherfucker!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- He fucking held me!
This dude blows the whistle...
Slow it down!
Slow it down!
You got to have presence on the court... presence like a cheetah rather than a chimp.
They both got it, but chimpy got to jump his nuts around all day to get it.
Shy cheetah just moves in total nonchalance a sec or two in his sexy, slow strut.
Me, I play like a cheetah.
Let's go, Rangers...
Let's go!
Let's go, Rangers, let's go!
Yeah!
Ooh!
You got it!
It's ours.
It's ours.
Oh!
Yeah!
9, 8, 7,
6, 5,
4, 3,
2, 1!
Yay, Jim!
Oh, shit.
That's my team!
That's my team!
There's only two things Swifty forbids... using the word "motherfucker"
and stealing from the other team, as long as they're white.
How much for that group of winners over there?
It's $34.90.
$34.90?
Changed the prices or something?
No.
Uh...
I'm a little short.
Do me a favor.
Here.
Take my watch, and I'll come back later with the rest of the money.
No.
What do you mean, no?
I'm sorry, sir.
Those burgers are worth more than the watch is.
I'll be right back.
I told you one burger each, didn't I?
It takes at least eight of these to get filled up.
Yeah.
C'mon, Swifty.
We're growing boys.
Growing boys?
We're hungry motherfuckers.
Funny, huh?
I'm not driving you guys home.
How's that for laughs?
You ripped them off, didn't you?
We're even now.
Swifty, come on.
How are we going to get home?
Face the music, pricks.
What are we going to do?
They got the door blocked off.
You afraid of these pussies?
I ain't afraid of anybody.
What's the problem?
I'm going to ask you this once.
All right?
Where's the stuff you stole from me?
What are you talking about?
No, no, no.
You're not going to fuck with me, all right?
Now, somebody stole my father's ring from my locker, motherfucker.
You want me to cut you?
Is that what you want, there?
There's no problem here.
Hey, guys!
Let's get out of here, c'mon!
You need a fucking army, huh?
Come on!
Come on!
Oh.
Nice.
That from Bobo?
Ha ha ha!
That's his father's ring.
Hey, fellas.
Any of you looking for a date?
Yeah.
Me, sweetheart.
Little horsy ride in Central Park, maybe candlelight dinner?
Why don't we skip right to dessert, huh, baby?
About $15?
Fifteen bucks?
I'll give you a quarter.
Let Pedro suck your tits.
You don't have to be rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
How about you, handsome, huh?
You got $15... for a little head?
Diane, do I look like I need to pay for it?
Yeah... you do.
If it's worth it.
Jimmy...
Jimmy, I know you want some, honey.
$15.
I'll do you so good you'll never forget it, baby.
Hey, hey!
Ooh!
That's a deal.
Bargain from there.
What do you say, guys?
You want to do it?
All four of us?
- Yeah.
- It's a deal.
All four of us.
Aw, shit.
This is all I got, Diane.
Here, have a pretzel.
- Get out of here.
- Beat it.
Yeah, fuck you!
Fucking dopehead.
You see what that shit does to you?
Wow.
Speaking of dopeheads, is that Pedro's mother over there slinging her wares again?
It is!
Hey, Peepee, where you going?
Why do you have to be such an asshole all the time, huh?
Why is the little shoe crying anyway?
His mother's a sneaker.
His father's a loafer.
Somebody's got to be a heel.
Jim, where you going?
Hey, Jim!
Jim.
Hey.
Hey, man.
What's up?
You don't recognize me with my new hairdo?
It's nice.
It's nice.
I like it.
What's going on?
- How are you?
- Good.
Wow.
Look at that.
You like it?
Yeah, I'll tell you what.
When you get out of here, we'll all shave our heads and look like a gang of skinheads.
It's a deal.
All right.
I got something for you here.
Yeah.
Everyone on the team.
Look right here...
even Swifty signed it.
Thanks, man.
You remember when I dunked on that spade in Riverside Park?
You always had good ups.
Yeah.
Oh.
I got something to show you.
Hold on.
What?
Pedro got these out of some lady's purse.
- She's doing it with a donkey.
- Oh, Jesus!
Look at that schlong.
Look at that one.
Oh, I beat your record.
How many times you choke it?
Seven times.
Bullshit.
Seven times.
My mom thinks I have a cold year-round because of all the tissues around the house.
You can keep those if you want.
They're pumping so much junk in me,
I can't even get a decent chubby.
I got an idea.
Come on.
Let's go.
Where we going?
I'm getting you out of this place, man.
C'mon!
What are you, crazy, man?
I can't go anywhere.
Here you go.
I've known Bobby since I was 3.
He's my best friend.
He was the best player on our basketball team.
Two years ago, he got leukemia.
He keeps fighting it off.
I know Bobby's going to beat it.
He could beat anything.
Watch!
Jim, you're going to kill me, man.
If you let go, I swear...
I swear I'll kill you, man.
Watch the bump!
What the hell happened to forty deuce?
Last time I was here, that theater was playing Sperminator II.
Oh, yeah.
I remember that.
No, man.
This whole block has been done over by all these new artists.
It's pretty cool, huh?
Yeah.
They should put your stuff up there.
Yeah.
Right.
Still scribbling stuff in that notebook of yours, ain't you?
Of course.
You bring anything for me?
What, like to read?
No, like to eat.
What do you think?
Yeah.
I mean, I got this, but it's not a big deal.
I don't even remember writing it, to tell you the truth.
Yeah, Yeah.
I'll be the judge of this.
"Little kids shoot marbles
"where branches break the sun
"into graceful shafts of light.
I just want to be pure.
All right.
# What a life #
Nothing like the real thing to float your boat, huh, Bobby?
# What a life #
# Didn't know where, didn't know when... #
That's nice.
# Said that I'll go...
go learn #
# Put up my hand, wait my turn #
# But it never comes, I have to shout out #
# That's life #
# And that's what it's all about #
# So through the comfort and the strife #
# What a life... #
Get me out of here, Jim.
What are you talking about, man?
This was a stupid idea.
I don't feel so good.
Well, can we wait till the end of the show?
Did you hear what I said?
I said get me the hell out of here!
Hey, Bob, man...
I'm really sorry, you know?
Next time, we'll go somewhere...
Ain't gonna be no next time, Jim.
I love it this way... my feet against the tar, which is soft from the spring heat, the slight breeze that runs across your entire body, especially your crotch.
You feel an incredible power being naked under a dome of stars while a giant city is dressed, dodging cars all around you five flights down.
I don't think of anything while I'm doing the actual tugging, least of all the heavy sex fantasies I have to resort to indoors.
Just my own naked self and the stars breathing down, and it's beautiful.
Time sure flies when you're young and jerking off.
"Camp summer position.
Driver... taxi."
Hey, that might be good.
You could get your license this summer.
Oh, yeah, Mom.
That sounds really great.
Hey, get your own job, and if you don't get it this summer, you're coming to work with me at the hotel.
Mom, please.
Why are you so worried about this?
Do I even ask you for money?
No.
I'm not worried about the money.
I want you to have responsibility.
I don't want you running around the streets of New York.
Idle time is the devil's plaything, Jim.
The devil's plaything, huh?
Mm-hmm.
That might be a cool title for my first book.
Thanks!
What are you talking about?
What are you writing?
Here.
Ooh.
Um...
Ma, I'm not really that hungry this morning, alright?
- Come on.
You got to eat something.
- I know...
Where you going?
I'm going to shoot some hoops.
Sometimes I feel like something's chasing me, like there's some whacko on a roof somewhere who could snuff me out at any moment.
And I feel this horrible fear.
Will I have time to finish...
The poems breaking loose in my head?
Hey, white boy, you ready for your beating?
Don't let your mouth get you into something your ass can't handle.
I'll shoot you for it.
So it's going to be like that, huh?
I... don't think so.
Yeah!
All right, so you made one.
Big deal.
You made one shot.
Make another.
# The days are muzzled in a vibe #
# I swing back from time to time #
# There's a Camaro, rusty red #
# That all my best friends drive in #
# Can you smell the summer air?
#
# Take me where they left the light on #
# Getting close, almost there #
# If that fuzzy silver badge #
# Don't greet us there #
# My head's dizzy, and I'm taking... # #
Yo, Jim!
What's the score?
Come on.
We got to go.
They don't keep score in this game.
Jim, come on.
We're losing the sun.
He's being a dick.
You want me to put a charge in his ass?
Whatch this.
Oh, look it, right here...
Jim's secret diary he's always writing in.
Bet you he wrote some shit about me.
Oh, right here.
"Spring...
Mickey."
Hey, there I am, Jim says.
"Mickey takes out a bottle of carbonic cleaning fluid and suggests we do a little sniffing to get high."
Whoo!
"After four deep whiffs, we're sailing someplace else."
Mickey, what are you doing?
"Bells ringing through my ears, little lights flashing through my eyes."
Mickey, put that down, all right?
"I pictured myself
"paddling across a river with black water,
"only the canoe was going backwards instead of forwards,
"with clouds that had faces.
Laughing, spooky, fun-house laughs..."
- Give it back, alright?
- What is that shit?
Why do you have to be such a schmuck, Mickey?
What are you talking about?
Don't you ever touch that again.
It's private.
What's your problem?
I'm...
I'm sorry.
He's writing about me, I can't read about it?
Jesus!
Hey, Jim, come on.
We're gone.
Yo, we got a cab!
Hey, cabby!
Hey, swami!
So, Shakespeare, you going to finish the game?
C'mon, Reggie, you know this game never ends.
See you later, all right?
Every crowd has its little games to prove if you're a punk or not.
My cousin in Jersey plays chickie, which is two cars heading towards each other at about 80 miles per hour.
First driver to swerve out of the way is, of course, chicken.
In Brooklyn, they make you press a lit cigarette into your arm and have it burn all the way down to the filter without the slightest flinch.
Us, Manhattan boys, we jump off cliffs into the Harlem River, which is literally shitty, because half a million toilets flush into it every day.
Whoo-oo!
Yeah!
Oooh!
Yeah!
Hey, y'all, I carried the clothes up, but I ain't carrying them down.
Peepee, this is you... all 33 pounds of you, gone with the wind.
Wow.
That's a long way down.
Devil's toe is no big deal.
We've all done it a million times.
I never done it.
You never did it?
Pedro, you never do nothing.
You know who was awesome on this rock?
Bobby.
That kids would do back flips off this rock.
Hey, Mickey.
What?
Don't talk about him like he's dead.
He's not dead.
There goes the circle line.
Check it out.
Whoo!
Full moon!
Whoo!
Hey, yo!
Whoo!
Hey, circle this!
Hey, I'm going.
Watch out, watch out...
I'm going to show you how to do it.
Ye-ea-ah!
That was a good jump.
Oh, he's nuts.
Hey, I'm going to walk down.
What you talking about?
You can't walk down.
There's no way to walk down.
I ain't jumping.
Pedro, your clothes are down there.
How you gonna get your clothes?
You going to walk around naked all day?
Pedro, if you don't jump, Mickey's going to tease you so bad...
You might as well just jump and get it over with.
Feel better.
What the hell, right?
Oh... shit...
Pedro!
Bad form.
Bad form.
Oh...
My God!
Oh, shit.
Is he all right?
Pedro, you all right?
You ready?
Yeah.
Listen, don't tell the other guys, but when we leave here, I got a surprise for you.
Tell me what it is.
It's a surprise.
Trust me, all right?
Ouch, don't mess around, man...
Alright, you ready?
Come on!
You ready?
- Let's jump.
- On three.
Ready?
Uh-huh.
1, 2,
3.
Come on.
Let's go.
What's up, Manny?
How you doing?
Fine.
Thank you, sir.
This is my friend Jim.
How you doing?
I can't believe I hit my head on that rock.
It's killing me.
Jim, um, this is Winkie.
- Hi.
- How you doing?
Good.
And this... this is Blinkie.
- Hi.
- Hi.
# I lost my heart #
# Under the bridge #
# That little girl... #
I've seen you play ball, Jim.
You're a very beautiful player.
Very zen.
# And now I moan #
# And now I holler #
# She'll never know #
# Just what I found #
# That blue-eyed girl # it'll make you fuck like Superman.
# She said no more #
Faster than a speeding bullet...
# Became blue-eyed whore... #
More powerful than a locomotive...
# Down by the water #
# Down by the water... #
Able to, um...
I can't think of anything with a single bound.
# See her again #
# See her again... #
Do you have any protection?
Yeah.
This one's, uh, ribbed for extra pleasure.
So what are you waiting for?
What do you mean?
Take off your clothes.
Well, uh... could we shut off the lights first?
# Little fish, big fish #
# Swimming in the water #
# Come back here, man #
# Give me my daughter #
# Little fish, big fish #
# Swimming in the water # #
White ship disappears in the wave machine this morning.
Your eyes got shut with secret chains that pillow armies eventually set free... like soft horses through toy deserts.
I love this mansion, though it's too many windows... to open halfway each morning... to close halfway each night.
I looked at his body, and it was death for the first time.
His face was thin and wrinkled, almost apelike.
His hair, just gray patches on his scalp.
He looked 60 years old, and he was 16.
Couldn't believe how skinny he was... much skinnier than he was in the hospital.
It was like having the skeleton of someone you knew put right in front of you.
I felt dazed, like I'd just come out of a four-hour movie I didn't understand.
I kept thinking about his face... and death... what a cheat the whole thing was.
Hey, you guys remember that Halloween when Bobby filled that paper bag with dog shit, lit it on fire and put it outside Father Dunne's door, and we all hid behind the dumpster?
Yeah.
I could picture Father Dunne comming outside, stepping on that shit.
Picture him in the john...
Scraping the shit off his shoe like this.
You think that'll keep him out of heaven?
Are you kidding?
Jesus Christ himself would have laughed at that.
It was hilarious!
What about the time at the formal when Bobby got caught in the bathroom with Mary Ann Dugan and McNulty came in and busted him?
He was, like, "Father, I swear.
We weren't doing anything."
Meanwhile she's got a giant wad of cum hanging off her face.
I tell you, that kid was definitely a pisser.
It was weird seeing him today, man.
He was all shriveled up and wrinkled.
He looked like my grandfather.
I'll tell you what, though.
That kid was in so much pain, it's better off he died.
How the hell would you know, Mickey?
Did you go and visit him?
Huh?
Any of you guys go and visit him?
All right.
Then shut the fuck up.
Hey, Jim.
Look at my brother's girlfriend in the park.
She's sitting there, eating a sandwich.
Next thing you know, she's shot in the head.
She's dead.
It's over.
What about little Teddy Rayhill?
Perfect example.
Remember that night he was up on the roof, and he was doing poppers, having a great time, laughing his ass off
He started walking backwards...
Boom!
He fell right off the goddamn roof.
It was meant to be, right?
Fuck that, you guys!
Bobby was the best fucking guy around, you know that?
What are you, a bunch of idiots?
You don't even understand, do you?
Jim, you all right?
Huh?
Listen, maybe you should talk to one of the priests.
I don't know.
Maybe...
Maybe they can help you out.
Help me out?
I wouldn't ask one of those cocksuckers for directions.
You know what?
You guys need to lighten the fuck up, all right?
Let bygones be fucking bygones.
Shitty fucking world.
Live life to the fucking fullest.
You know what I mean?
Shit happens, man.
Shit fucking happens.
Come on.
Let's go.
Jim, come on.
You're growing up, and rain sort of remains on the branches of a tree that will someday rule the earth.
And that's good that there's rain.
Clears the month of your sorry rainbow expressions.
And it clears the streets of the silent armies so we can dance.
# Ted sniffing glue He was 12 years old #
# Fell from the roof on east 2-9 #
# Cathy was 11 when she pulled the plug # # 26 reds and a bottle of wine #
# Bobby had leukemia, 14 years old #
# He looked like 65 when he died #
# He was a friend of mine #
# Those are people who died, died #
# Those are people who died, died #
# Those are people who died, died #
# Those are people who died, died #
# They were all my friends #
# They just died #
# Those are people who died, died #
# Those are people who died, died #
# Those are people who died, died #
# Those are people who died, died #
# They were all my friends and they died # #
Did I ever tell you about the first time I did heroin?
I went down to Pedro's basement.
All sorts of characters were in the storage-room shooting gallery.
I was just going to sniff a bag, but a guy says,
"If you're going to sniff, might as well pop it, and if you're going to pop it, might as well mainline."
I was scared of needles, but I gave in.
It was like a long heat wave through my body.
Any ache or pain or sadness or guilty feeling was completely flushed out.
Look, Ma, I'm not in the mood for your dime-store psychology, all right?
Could you just please leave me alone?
I got a little sick, all right?
We're not going to live like this, Jim.
We're not going to live like this.
I'm warning you!
I'm telling you.
Oh, God, Mom.
You're always warning me, aren't you?
Blah, blah, blah.
You're always in my fucking ear.
Blah, blah, blah.
You don't know anything.
What are you talking about?
Go clean toilets or whatever the hell it is you do.
When you're done, clean this one.
Don't talk like that!
What's the matter with you?
Gee whiz, Ma, you know... we got to have these heart-to-heart talks more often.
They're really good for us.
I don't know you.
I don't believe this is you, Jim.
Please, Jim.
I don't know who you are.
Yeah, I know.
I was such a good little boy, right... with such potential, wasn't that it?
Is that what you're going to say?
Oh, Jim.
What's happening?
Jim, what's happening?
First, it's a Saturday-night thing, and you feel cool, like a gangster or a rock star.
It's just something to kill the boredom, you know?
They call it a chippie, a small habit.
It feels so good, you start doing it on Tuesdays, then Thursdays.
Then it's got you.
Every wise-ass punk on the block says it won't happen to them, but it does.
Go do it!
I ain't doing it.
I always do it!
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could you tell me the fastest way to the subway?
Yeah.
That's the "B" train.
Go to this corner and make a left.
It's right there.
What are you doing?
Let go!
Let go!
Let go of that!
Oh, my God!
What?
Oh!
- Help!
No!
No!
- What are you doing?
Let's go!
Come on!
I don't feel like going in today.
Father, is it all right if I don't go in today?
Why?
What are you scared of?
Nothing.
I just don't feel like it, that's all.
I imagine you have more to confess than anybody here.
Unburden yourself.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been about four months since my last confession.
Yes, my son?
Well, I don't know where to start, Father.
Have you taken the name of Jesus Christ in vain?
Yeah.
Yeah, I have.
Have you disrespected your mother and father?
Uh-huh.
Have you stolen or cheated your fellow man?
Yeah, but I'm not proud of it.
Have you had impure thoughts or engaged in impure deeds?
Oh, Father, you have no idea.
Is there something else that you want to tell me in your own words?
I've done all kinds of crazy shit.
Oh, excuse me, Father.
Fuck, I'm s...
Christ, I have a dirty mouth.
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry about that.
Will you just go on?
10 Hail Marys, five Our Fathers.
What do you mean?
And that's it?
That's my punishment?
You know something?
My friend Bobby, he was the best, and he's dead.
This sucks!
You know that?
This really sucks.
It's not fair, Father.
Your nose is running, your stomach cramps, your legs feel like they've played six straight games on top of each other, and the voice is always there in the back of your head...
"Just one more time.
Then we'll stop."
Quick to the ball.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Good, Ignatius.
Good.
Good.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Right behind you.
Sir, all right if I use the bathroom, Coach?
Jim, you got a bladder like a woman.
Let's go.
Again.
There we go.
Right behind him.
Right behind him.
Quick to the ball.
Two hands.
Two hands.
Jim?
I thought you were taking a piss.
Oh.
What are you doing in here every practice?
Have you been waiting for me, Jim?
Giving me some kind of a signal?
What are you talking about, Swifty?
Don't act surprised.
Do we understand each other?
It's not going to happen, Swifty.
Put the money away.
You want more?
Here.
Just let me do it.
Get the fuck out of my face!
Take it easy, Jim.
You can't blame me for trying.
I made a mistake, all right?
Let's just pretend it never happened.
Things will go back to exactly how they were before.
Okay?
Okay?
Here, keep the money.
Keep the money.
Just don't tell anybody, all right?
Good.
Tell anybody you want!
Nobody's going to believe a drughead like you, anyway.
You think we don't know what you've been doing?
Give me the fucking money and get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck...
Get the fuck out here!
Come on!
Get out of here!
And you want to stop.
You really do.
But it's like a dream.
You can't stop dreams.
They move in crazy pieces, any way they want to, and suddenly, you're capable of anything.
Ha ha ha!
No!
Wake up, Mr. Carroll!
It's later than you think.
Oh.
All right!
- I need a lift.
- All right.
What do you got?
Three different pills.
Which are the ups?
I never asked.
I thought one of youse would know.
Oh, great.
We look like pharmacists?
I don't know what to take.
What do we take?
Let me see.
The blacks and the reds are the ups.
I think the pink ones are the ups.
Why?
'Cuz I associate pink with lightness, you know?
The black ones seem like they'd knock you on your ass.
They might be faded seconals.
No, they're not faded.
They'd be sticky.
They're not.
That's bullshit.
- Fuck your mother.
- My what?
All right!
Calm down.
Don't ever talk about my mother.
Don't ever hit me like that again.
Come on!
Alright!
Give me your hat.
We got a game to play, alright?
Just give me something.
Hi, Neutron.
Let me ask him.
Neutron, you know which ones are the ups?
I think you should put that shit away before Swifty comes in here.
Why you acting like such a square ass?
Screw you, Mickey.
Screw you, too, Tough guy.
Man.
I'm just going to take the black.
You sure?
Mm-hmm.
You got a better idea?
Nope.
Your guess is as good as mine, Jimbo.
It's on today.
50 rebounds.
Good.
Come on.
Let's go.
I'm your friend now, right?
What, I got to smack you again, c'mon!
Yeah, take your little rat with you.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, what's up?
Why are you acting like that?
You know what's wrong.
Used to be about getting high and playing basketball.
Now it's just about getting high with you.
You're blowing it, Jim.
Oh, come on.
I don't need to hear this from you, Neutron.
Yeah, you do, Jim!
Listen, no, Jim!
I'm really proud of you, man.
Everything's cool.
You look great.
I'll see you in the NBA.
# Riders on the storm #
# Riders on the storm #
# Into this house we're born #
# Into this world we're thrown #
# Like a dog without a bone #
# In fact we're all alone #
# Riders on the storm #
# There's a killer on the road #
# His brain is squirming like a toad #
# Take a long holiday #
# Let your children play #
# If you give this man a ride #
# Sweet family will die #
# Killer on the road #
# Yeah # #
Did you find it?
No, Father.
It's clean.
There's no drugs in there.
Thank you, Officer.
I told you we didn't have nothing.
You boys think you're awfully smart, don't you?
Well, you're both suspended for a week!
Ooh...
And you'll never play basketball here again.
That you can count on.
You can't kick me off the team, Swifty.
Oh?
Why is that?
'Cause I quit the team... and the school and this whole faggot-ass scene, that's why.
I could second that motion.
Your resignations are accepted!
Neutron, you coming with us?
Huh?
Yeah.
That's what I figured.
Come on, man.
I'm fucking out of here.
Don't worry, Swifty.
I'm not going to rat you out.
And in the next life, Father,
I'm going to have the paddle!
Get out!
Thanks a lot, Neutron.
Thanks, man.
I can't believe this, you know?
I know.
What happened to the pills?
We got kicked out of the school, Mickey.
Who cares, man?
We lost the pills.
The cops took them...
We can't play ball anymore.
Jim, who cares about school, man?
We just lost $40 worth of pharmaceuticals.
I know what happened to them, too.
The cops, they take that all the time.
They either pop them themselves or they sell them.
What's my mom going to say, man?
When I go home?
She ain't gonna say nothing.
You just tell her you're going to school every day in the morning.
Let's get out of here, man...
Go get into something.
You never sold any pills at the schoolyard?
No.
So it's all a big conspiracy against you.
Right, Jim?
Yeah.
Maybe it is.
Maybe it's not.
You been missing these?
What are you going to tell me...
they're vitamins?
Oh, fuck you, Ma.
What?
!
Get out of my house!
Oh, is that what you want, Ma?
Get out!
You don't talk to me that way!
If that's what you want, I'm fucking out of here.
All right?
What are you doing?
I'm leaving!
What do you think?
I wan you to take all your shit!
I'll help you.
Here!
You want me to leave?
Yes.
Get out!
I'm out of here.
Get the fuck out of my way!
This garbage is going to kill you, Jim!
I'm gone!
Gonna to kill you!
Don't you understand?
I can't watch you kill yourself?
Ma, you're never going to fucking see me again, alright?
Just remember that.
Don't say that, Jim.
Don't say that!
It was a dream, not a nightmare... a beautiful dream I could never imagine in a thousand nods.
I saw this girl next to me who wasn't beautiful until she smiled,
and I felt that smile come at me and heat waves following, soaking through my body and out my fingertips in shafts of color.
And I knew somewhere in the world... somewhere...
that there was love for me.
We just got to raise enough cash to keep our heads straight.
Luckily, finding money in New York is like getting laid at the prom... easy.
- Fuck it, Pedro!
- What's the matter with you?
Jesus!
Watch the road.
You could kill us all, c'mon!
I get 1,500 bucks for this car.
If it's whacked up, it's worth nothing.
We should buy shit in bulk, man
We'll put it on the street and make real money.
That's 500 bucks a piece.
We'll be on for days, nights, weeks.
Yeah, man.
I'd love to go to Puerto Rico, soak up some rays, you know?
See my bitch?
That's what I'd like to do.
- What are you talking about?
- What bitch?
We haven't seen a picture or nothing.
She's 500 pounds, Jim.
She got a mustache thicker than her father.
No.
That's your mother, Mickey.
She does not exist.
Don't fool yourself.
Be careful.
I'm about to whack.
Oh, shit, man.
My brother's going to take care of us and this car.
Pedro, wake the fuck up!
Pedro, come on, man!
You're going to get us killed, what are you doing?
I got it, man.
You want me to drive?
Mickey, you better drive the car.
I'm serious, man.
Just don't blow my high.
If there's a scratch in the car, my brother'll kill me.
Yo, get out of the booth!
Get out the booth, huh?
Get out.
Fucking...
What's up?
What's up?
Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Where's the car?
It's good to see you, too.
It's over here.
It's nice.
It's smokin'.
You tell me that?
It's everything you wanted.
Get your hands off.
You guys look like shit.
Oh, my God.
They're taking the car.
Show me the sign, man!
Show me the freaking sign!
It's right there.
You see?
It says "tow-away." Huh?
You scumbags even read?
I should kick all your punk asses!
Goddamn it!
I can get you another car tonight.
Yeah?
John Halligan is waiting for this car.
I got him out of bed with his wife.
You know how this makes me fucking look?
Kenny, get off.
You're too stupid to be my brother!
You're too stupid!
You want a piece of me, Carroll?
Back off!
Back off!
- Kenny, no more!
- Mr. Tough Guy.
- Kenny, no more!
- Huh?
Tough guy?
Give me a sip of your soda.
You wipe off the bottle before you take a sip?
You don't even think twice about sharing works with Mickey.
You think you'll catch something from the bottle you're not catch from a needle?
You mistake me for somebody who gives a shit.
Headquarters...
home on and off to every down-and-out junkie and wino from 14th Street to the Bowery.
It's like a fucking all-star team.
Jimmy, the other day, my mother's been ragging on me,
"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
"You've tried every other way.
Go to church.
Put yourself in Christ's hands."
So I do it, man.
I figure, give it a shot.
I dig Jesus.
So, I go, man.
High mass...
a choir and everything.
The first thing I see on the right, the side altar, are those little candles in the red glass that we used when it was windy in the park to cook up.
And then, this altar boy, he's coming down the aisle with this 6-foot candle.
I envision this huge spoon above it, man, with, like, shopping bags full of dope inside of it.
And then the kicker comes, man.
The priest, he starts doing the thing with the incense.
You know, starts wafting out.
I'm in the back.
It finally hits me.
"Where do I know this smell from, man?
My room, man."
It's the smell exactly of really primo dope cooking up.
Yeah?
Exactly the same.
So what happened next?
At that point, I split.
I went home,
I went inside my closet,
I got my stash out of the inside pocket of my sharkskin easter suit, and I got stoned.
Ba bing... ba bang.
I love a ritual.
Oh, Mary, if you can hear me...
I need you to fill Jim's heart with love because he really needs it now.
Oh, God... please watch over my son.
He needs you now.
Just take care of him, okay?
I'll be okay.
I love you, Jim.
I love you.
Hey, you holding?
You straight, man?
Get out of here.
Come on.
No.
Hey, have you seen Falco?
Come on, man.
Are you holding anything?
Hey, Diane...
Come here, Diane.
- I'll take care of you, babe.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
How about some of this?
Ha ha!
I wouldn't do you for a bag, you fucking piece of shit.
Jim.
Jimmy.
You're looking good.
Who's your embalmer?
I want some of what you got.
Shh.
Check everything in this place.
Wow.
I always wanted to use these syrup pumps.
And these professional ice-cream scoopers.
Oh, my God.
Don't make me do it!
I'll do it!
I swear to God!
Jim, watch out.
Come on!
It's not opening.
They don't make them like this anymore.
You got to get it from the side.
I got it!
Oh, cool.
Change!
Shit!
Let's get out of here.
It's locked.
We got to go out the back.
Pedro, let's get out of here!
What am I, hallucinating here?
Pedro, you'll get us caught.
The cops are going to come.
Oh, you want to be tough, huh?
Go ahead... take another sip so I can blow your fucking head all over the counter!
Go ahead, Pedro!
Go ahead!
Come on, guys!
Let's go.
Put that gun away!
Don't fuck with me, motherfucker!
What the hell are you doing, Mickey?
What the hell did you do that for?
Let that little spic rot, man!
He'll get us caught.
Jim, the cops are coming.
Come on!
Jim!
Jim!
Pedro!
Pedro!
Jim!
Freeze!
Freeze!
On your stomach!
On your stomach!
I didn't do anything, I'm telling you!
This is it, man.
That Jew got to keep the money under his pillow.
Hey, Jim, I know you're still mad about Pedro.
I couldn't do nothing, man.
He was going to get us caught.
Definitely shouldn't have went that far.
What happened to you?
Your mother kick your ass?
Yeah, real funny.
Bring us a couple of Cokes, will you?
You all right?
Hey, bartender, move out of the way.
Jim, I'm getting sick.
I got to get some money to cop.
Jim.
You with me here?
What the hell are you wa...
Oh, shit.
That's Neutron.
That's the all-American high school game?
We could have played in that game.
Who gives a shit?
Come on.
I'm waiting to hear back on a scholarship from Saint John's...
I'm not sure about it, but hopefully it will work out.
Jim, I'm starting to jones.
Gotta get out there.
We need some money.
Jim, don't dwell on these dreams, man.
Will you come on?
Meet you outside, man.
I'm getting sick.
You want to meet me out there?
Is it okay if I say hi to my mom?
Hi, Mom.
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.
# You don't know it, but you're coming right along #
# Please be strong #
# You don't know it, but you're coming right along # #
Hey, you!
Stop!
You can't go in there!
Stop!
What do you want?
You realize what time it is?
Yeah.
Um... is Winkie and Blinkie here?
Who the hell are Winkie and Blinkie?
Hey, guys.
Lisa, Mel, you know this boy?
No, Daddy.
Come on.
All right.
Come on.
Get out of here.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Rubin.
He got past me.
- Don't let it happen again.
It won't happen again.
Get out of here!
What?
What?
Asshole.
Hey, fuck-up, get fucking up, man!
- What's your problem, man?
- What's YOUR problem, mam?
You sold my girlfriend some shit the other day.
You almost killed her.
What was it... rat poison?
It's not my fault your girl can't handle her drugs.
I want my fucking $20 back, man.
Look, there's no money-back guarantees.
I'm not selling refrigerators here.
Oh, yeah?
I'll cut you a dynamite deal on mexican shit.
Give me my $20, or we'll go outside.
If we go outside, one of us is going to get hurt.
I told you one of us would get hurt.
Is that right?
It's been hard...
the writing...
lately.
Terrible numbness, then suddenly it comes... in beautiful fragments or terrible dreams... like nods... so high.
Uh!
Reggie, is that you?
Who the fuck do you think it is?
Ohh...
Don't worry, you're not dead yet.
It's not bad.
Hey, give me that.
How come it's all wet?
Because you pissed on it.
I didn't say you could read this.
What, have you been digging through all my stuff?
I need...
I got to get out of here.
Where's my jacket?
You're welcome.
What the hell am I thanking you for?
Because you was frozen in the snow like a goddamn creamsicle.
Where is it?
What?
You know what the fuck I'm talking about, Reggie!
Where is it?
You mean this?
Huh?
Give it to me.
I'll cut your fucking throat, Reggie!
Give it to me, all right?
Just give it to me!
Oh, give it to me!
Give it to me!
I'm serious!
Give me it!
Give it to me!
Goddamn it!
I'll make you an incredible offer.
I'm going to save your life twice in one day, understand me?
You should have left me in the fucking snow, man.
Give me the money for my dope, too.
I'm not gonna suck your dick, all right?
Put that away.
Who the hell wants you to suck their dick?
Goddamn it!
Look at yourself!
Just look at yourself.
Oh, Reggie... it's okay.
Why are you doing this?
Because once upon a time, somebody helped me, and I always pay what I owe.
Reggie.
Reggie, I just need a taste.
I just need a little something, Reggie.
You don't understand.
It hurts, Reggie!
Ow!
Reggie, I got to go.
I got to go see my mom.
You got to let me get out of here, Reggie.
Reggie!
It hur...
It hurts.
Aah!
Shit!
Oh, boy...
# Touch the taste and taste the smell #
# Smell the scent, all the gifts you gave to me, baby #
# The food of your brain #
# The room is spinning round #
# I never come down #
# The room is spinning round #
# I never come down... #
Reggie.
You got to give me it.
You got to give me it, Reggie.
Please!
Oh!
Reggie, come on!
# I remember you, too #
# I blew my mind # #
Wake up.
Can't sleep all day.
Oh.
Thanks.
Jesus Christ.
What happened to you?
What does it look like?
Motherfucker shot me.
Woke my black ass up.
Shit.
Look, uh...
I'll be back in the morning, Jim.
You just stay cool.
You start to get panicky, write about me in that book of yours.
Actually, I was a little hurt I wasn't mentioned.
You really like my writing, huh, Reggie?
Damn, man, I told you four times already.
What do you want me to do?
Bend over and kiss your ass?
Hey, Reg, do me a favor.
While you're out, pick me up a bag.
# The room is spinning round #
# I may never come down #
I am alone.
Not just me.
We're alone... alone forever.
And who's at the end of that forever tunnel I run through, up Fifth with the wallpaper of skyscrapers?
I'm thinking, after all those beautiful trips, that this is one of those bad ones.
Diane?
Hey!
Jim.
Remember me?
Man, you look great.
Yeah, thanks.
Good to see somebody from the old neighborhood...
What do you want, Jim?
- You holding anything?
- No.
Just like a 5 or something?
Just to tide me over, you know?
Please, Diane?
Come on.
Yeah.
For an old friend?
Why not?
I've been looking all over for this.
Oh, you know what?
I only got a 20.
A 20 is good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
A 20 is great, yeah.
That would help me out a lot.
- You want a 20?
- Yeah.
Why don't you go buy yourself some pretzels, you asshole.
You bitch!
You're nothing but a whore!
I don't give a shit about your clothes!
You're still a whore to me!
Yeah?
Shut up.
Look at you.
Oh, are you desperate now, baby?
Who's a whore now?
Don't talk to me like that, you bitch!
Ha ha.
Who's laughing, stupid?
Don't play a game with me!
I know you!
Ah!
Shit.
Oh, man.
Shit.
Ha ha ha!
Mickey.
Mick, what's up, man?
Hey, what's up, man?
Did you get anything?
No, not a dime.
You score?
Yeah, I got something.
What'd you get?
About 35 bucks.
35?
Where'd you get it?
I robbed some fucking asshole on the "D" train.
Dude, 35 will keep us on for, like, two days.
Well, could we get some stuff, man?
I'm fucking... my head is...
I see some spics.
I think we can score.
You wanna check it out?
- Yeah, alright.
- Come on.
They're over here.
Why the fuck do we have to cop on the street all the time?
My fucking nuts are itching like crazy.
Think this is him?
Is your name Pino?
Listen... could we get us some dope?
The dude over there said you could help.
You want to cop some shit?
Let me see some cash.
I got it here.
Let me see.
Hey, no money without no taste.
You want a taste?
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Hurry, man.
Come on.
There's fucking cops all over.
That's good, man.
That's good.
All right, listen...
4 for 35.
4 for 35, man?
Come on, man.
$5.00 short.
What's the big deal?
Ta bien, chico...
Toma, toma.
- You got four?
- Yeah.
We should taste this.
Where are we going to cook it up?
I don't know about his guy.
No, he's cool.
Fuck, man!
What's the matter?
- Just taste it!
Come on.
- What do you mean?
I tasted it.
He beat us.
He fucking beat us.
I swear to fucking God...
Put that away!
I'm gonna kill this mother...!
- Come here, motherfucker!
- Put it away!
I'm going to fucking kill you, you motherfucker!
Motherfucker, you're fucking dead, you hear me?
Dude, don't make me do it.
Where's the money?
I want the money.
I want the money and the bags.
Where's the fucking money?
The fucking money!
I want it!
Aah!
No!
- Oh, shit!
- We fucking killed him!
What the fuck do you mean, we?
I didn't fucking touch him!
Don't put that shit on me!
He beat us, man!
He deserved it!
You went too far, Mickey!
Oh, shit!
Is he dead?
Of course he's fucking dead!
He fell six stories!
Jim, come on.
Come on!
Will you come one?
Jim, don't make me leave you here!
Oh, shit.
# Star #
# I'll reach you if I try #
# Show me the truth, yeah #
# Star #
# I'll reach you if I try #
# Show me the truth, yeah # #
Come on, get back up!
Come on!
Get off of me!
What are you doing?
Who is it?
Ma...
let me in.
Ma, let me in!
Please, Ma.
Ma?
Hey, Ma?
Are you in there, Ma?
Ma, is that you?
Yeah.
Ma?
Ma?
- Are you there?
- Yeah.
Hi.
Hi, Ma.
Hi.
Hi.
Listen, I need you to help me out, all right?
I need you to give me some money.
Okay?
I need you to give me, like, five doll...
Like, $20, something like that because I'm in some trouble.
Ma?
Do you hear me, Ma?
Yeah, I hear you.
I can't help you.
Okay, listen, what you got to do is give me some money, okay?
Jim, I can't do that.
Why not?
Mom, you know I'm not going to do anything with it.
I just need to go out of town for a little while 'cause I got into some trouble, and I need some help.
Okay?
So, you got to give me some money, Mom.
Can you hold my hand?
Yeah, I'll hold your hand.
Mom, can you give me some money, please?
Mom, can you give me some money, please?
Stop fucking around!
I can't.
Mom, give me some fucking money, please!
What are you doing?
I'm your son!
I don't have any.
Mom, don't fuck around like this!
Give me some money!
Mom!
Come on!
Let me in the fucking door!
Oh, God.
Oh, fuck.
Let me in.
I need some money.
I need some money real bad.
Ohh...
Oh, God.
Someone's breaking into my apartment.
They have a knife.
Oh!
Mom!
You don't understand, Mom.
You don't know what you're fucking doing to me.
Mom, I'm in pain.
How could you do this to your son, you bitch?
You fucking bitch!
Ah!
Oh, let me in!
I'll do anything!
I'll be a good boy!
I'll be a good boy, mom, if you let me in.
Get off me!
Get off!
No!
No!
You fuckers!
You're not going to do this!
Fuck you!
Ma!
Don't do this!
Ma!
Ma!
Ma!
I got six months in Riker's Island for assault, robbery, resisting arrest, and possession of narcotics.
I sweated out a horrible cure and stayed clean the whole stretch even though it's been easier to get good junk in here than it is on the street.
Shit, it's been hard, man.
All I've been doing is reading these diaries and wondering how the hell I'm still alive, and even if I care.
Suffice to say that I'm finished with the asshole bandits of shower-room rape, and suffice to say that those swine guards won't draw blood from my ankles again.
Suffice to say that I've been just thinking about dumb stuff like what a nice concept it is to have a godmother and a godfather, wondering who my godparents might be.
My mom won't visit me here, so I guess I'll just have to wait till I get home to ask.
Jim?
Who's there?
It's me.
Pedro?
What's up, man?
Nothing.
You know.
I...
I hear you come here.
I just came by to say hi.
I'm sorry about that night at the candy store and everything.
It's all right.
Reform school turned out to be real cool, so don't sweat it.
Did you hear about Mickey, that scumbag?
He went and threw some chump off a roof.
He's getting 5 to 15 years, man.
They tried him like an adult.
Shit.
I got a present for you, Jim.
A bag of the finest dope in Manhattan.
You know, me and you?
Like old times?
I can't.
Come on.
It would be dynamite.
I got this thing to do.
Why don't you come check it out?
No.
I'm going to go, then, you know?
You know how it is.
Take care of yourself, little man.
Know this.
There's different types of users of junk.
You got your rich dilettante square-ass who dabbles now and then and always has enough money to run off to the Riviera if he feels he's fucking around to the danger point.
Street junkies hate these pricks, but they're always suckers, and their money makes them tolerable.
Then you got your upper-middle-class
Westchester preppies... same as the others, basically.
What they're good for is opening their mommy and daddy's eyes to this social virus and putting pressure on the government to do something about it.
Then there's us street kids.
Start fucking around very young,
13 or so...
We think we all got it under control and won't get strung out.
This rarely works.
I'm living proof.
But in the end, you just got to see the junk as another 9-to-5 gig.
The hours are just a bit more inclined to shadows.
Anything?
Not really.
The polyferranide deposits are contaminated with astiline.
Commander, there's something over here
I think you should see.
Pack it up.
We'll find better quality somewhere down the line.
That line is going to be cut short when our nacelles burn themselves up if we don't find it soon.
What have you got, Lieutenant?
There have been other visitors to this moon recently.
What do you think this is?
Some kind of message?
I don't want you to go wandering off.
I'm not.
I'm just looking at something.
Antonio.
Vay-chit no-op-puse-nee.
Chakotay, kay-nee-post.
Pon-ah-chee nun-pah-hee-no.
Kay-nee-post itchee-oh.
Kep-pon-nee!
He says you're quite a scout.
A kep-pon-nee.
I was just looking at a lizard when I saw it.
Well, it was your eyes that saw it.
No one else's did.
That's the important thing.
Come.
I want you to understand this.
It's a blessing to the land.
An ancient healing symbol.
A CHAH-mooz-ee.
They probably cut this down for firewood.
The Rubber Tree people?
Well, the closest thing to the Ancient Rubber Tree people that we'll ever see.
The people in this tribe are their descendants.
Just like we are.
But they never left this jungle.
And they rarely intermarry with other tribes.
And they still use firewood instead of magnesite fuel like everyone else.
Chakotay, they've chosen to live like this for centuries.
That's why we are traveling on foot and not using a transporter.
We honor the Sky Spirits who led our ancestors to this sacred land.
Sacred land?
Yes.
Huh.
The Sky Spirits must have taken a wrong turn somewhere.
Maybe it's a blessing to the land.
For damaging it with the campfire.
What is your basis for that conclusion, Commander?
Oh, just... something somebody told me once.
Describe the nature of your pain.
In the lower back.
It's tight.
Choose the word that would best describe your pain.
Burning, throbbing, piercing, pinching, biting, stinging, shooting...
Shooting.
It even goes down my legs.
Hmm.
Is the baby all right?
Hmm?
Oh, certainly.
Fine, nothing to worry about.
Well, that makes me feel better.
The position of the baby is simply putting pressure on your sciatic nerve.
You may return to your post.
The pain makes it difficult to sit for any period of time.
It's really quite uncomfortable.
Elevating your legs when you sit should provide all the relief you need.
Perhaps a day of rest, off-duty.
Mm-mm.
Ensign Wildman, according to your medical history, this is your first pregnancy, correct?
Yes.
Well, Ensign, unfortunately, pregnancy causes its fair share of discomforts and you'll have to learn to live with them.
That's just the way it is.
We'll schedule her for follow-up in two days.
If the pain has not subsided on its own by then, we'll attempt to decrease the sensitivity of the nerve in that region.
Thank you, Doctor.
Call me day or night if this gets any worse.
Don't you have any compassion for the way she feels?
Every member of this crew is an adult.
I will not coddle them.
Compassion can be your department.
Fortunately, you have enough for both of us.
You've never been sick or in pain.
I just wish, once in your life, you could know what it's like, how it makes you feel vulnerable and a little afraid.
Then you'd understand.
I don't have a life.
I have a program.
I hated every minute of it.
My father had dragged me all the way from our colony near the Cardassian border on this quest of his.
Away from my friends, my home, and here we were, in the middle of a brutal Central American jungle looking for the descendants of the Ancient Rubber people.
It must have been very important to him.
Believe me, it was.
And he was very disappointed that I didn't share his enthusiasm.
He'd been tracking down the origins of our tribe for years.
The one on the right is the one I found today.
And now, something you saw on that trip years ago, shows up again on a moon surface almost 70,000 light-years away.
I don't suppose you have any theories that might explain this.
I can give you an official Rubber Tree people theory if you like.
-Sky Spirits.
-Sky Spirits?
It's an ancient myth.
Sky Spirits from above created the first Rubber people in their own image, and led the way to a sacred land where the Rubber people would live for eternity.
You obviously don't put a great deal of faith in this explanation.
How much faith do you put in Adam and Eve?
Hasn't science proved that all humans developed from a single evolutionary process?
That's what I was always taught.
On the other hand, none of my teachers ever spent much time in the Delta Quadrant.
B'Elanna tells me we picked up a warp signature heading away from the moon.
Think we should follow it?
I don't know that it's fair for me to put my own personal curiosity ahead of the ship's priorities.
We still haven't found the polyferranide we need to seal the warp coils.
If these people have warp technology, they might be able to help us.
Besides... we are in the business of exploring, aren't we?
My father would put on his expedition hat and shout, "Let's go!"
I guess that's good enough for me.
Showing no life signs.
Mr. Paris, are you certain the warp signature ended here?
Positive, Captain.
Harry, check your sensors.
That look like some kind of power source to you?
That is an unusually high EM reading for a natural occurrence.
Could be some kind of cloaking technology.
Mr. Kim, transmit a continuous message on all frequencies identifying who we are, where we're from and make it clear our intentions are peaceful.
Torres to Bridge.
Go ahead.
We're in luck, Captain.
My readings are showing high concentrations of polyferranide about ten kilometers below the surface.
Acknowledged.
We'll send out an away team to continue the survey.
Report to Transporter Room 3.
On my way.
Commander, if we meet any resistance abort the mission.
I have no intention of disturbing an alien race that would rather be left alone.
Understood.
On the other hand, if we can make contact, our goal is to get permission to begin excavation as soon as possible.
Tuvok, you're with me.
Mr. Neelix, please report to Transporter Room 3 for an away mission.
I'll meet you there, Commander.
We may be out of luck.
Problem?
I'm not sure we can transport down.
Every time we try to lock on to a transport sight, a storm begins.
Storm?
We've tried seven different sites and as soon as we lock on, an electrical storm forms right above the location.
When we change sites, a new storm forms and the old one dissipates.
Might the transporter beam itself be causing an electrostatic charge in the atmosphere?
That's as good a guess as any.
I can't explain it.
We just can't transport.
Fine, we'll take a shuttle.
Once again, the storm seems to have formed as a direct result of our interaction with the atmosphere.
The meteorological conditions changed radically when we began our entry sequence.
Shields are holding.
It takes more than a little thunderstorm to bother one of your mighty Starfleet ships, huh?
Nothing we can't handle.
Relax, Neelix.
That's why they call it a rain forest.
Why do your Sky Spirits choose a place where it rains all the time?
And it's hot... and there are so many bugs?
It's said the Sky Spirits honored the land above all else.
Maybe it's because this land yields so many different kinds of life.
Maybe they wanted us to become friends with everything in nature.
Including the bugs.
Sorry, Sky Spirits.
I will never make friends with bugs.
Maybe that's why they keep biting you.
You're miserable.
It was a mistake to bring you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I can't be what you want me to be.
From the day you came out of your mother... upside down...
I knew the spirits had chosen you to be a contrary.
No one chooses for me.
I choose my own way.
And if that makes me a contrary,
I'll have to live with it.
If you have no spirits to guide you,
I fear you will lose your way.
Altitude: 5,000 meters.
Decreasing speed to 720 kph.
Entering terminal approach phase.
Visibility still zero.
Switching to enhanced terrain scanning.
Touchdown sight scanned.
Continuing descent.
Computer, activate the emergency medical holographic program.
Please state the nature of the medical emergency.
I thought we changed your program so you wouldn't have to say that anymore.
We did.
But I became so uncomfortable trying to find new ways to "break the ice," as it were, that I restored it.
Let's just say it works for me.
Doctor?
Ah, you noticed.
Are holograms supposed to... sneeze?
Generally, no.
But I have accepted your challenge.
I programmed myself with the symptoms of the 29-hour Levodian flu.
Thus I will gain the experience that you suggest would be beneficial to the performance of my duties.
Holographic tissue paper for the holographic runny nose.
Don't offer them to patients.
Mmm, interesting sensation, blowing one's nose.
It's my first time.
I think this is very brave of you.
Nothing of the sort.
I intend it to be an educational experience.
I'm sure you'll learn a lot.
I meant for the crew.
I'm tired of the whiny, cranky attitudes we see around here.
I intend to serve as an example of how one's life and duties do not have to be disrupted by simple illness.
Doc?
I don't feel so good.
Neither do I, and you don't hear me complaining.
We are not making any progress locating the source of that unusual power reading, Commander.
Then I guess we'll have to search for these people the old-fashioned way...
with our eyes and ears.
Is something bothering you,
Commander?
No, it just reminds me of another jungle that I visited once.
The Central American rain forest on Earth.
It's the only other place in the universe that I've ever seen this flower.
It appears to be a rare variety of Cypriprdium of the Asiatic genus Paphiopedilum.
I never knew you had such horticultural expertise, Mr. Vulcan.
In fact, I am...
or, more accurately, I was... a breeder of prize Vulcan orchids.
Then we have something in common...
I breed orchids, too!
Don't they make the most exquisite salad?
A touch of Baldoxic vinegar...
pure heaven.
I hereby designate the two of you the team's botanical surveyors.
Collect a sample of that flower.
B'Elanna?
It's just what we've been looking for.
Almost pure polyferranide.
But there's a problem with crust reactivity.
If we can't solve it before excavation, we might contaminate the entire yield.
Have Ensign Kim run an analysis from the ship.
We should be able to...
I'll be damned.
What?
It almost looks like a hawk, doesn't it?
Listen to him, Chakotay.
What does he say to you?
He says, "You are home." Huh?
I'm leaving the tribe, Father.
What?
I got to know a lot of the Starfleet officers patrolling the Cardassian border.
I asked Captain Sulu if he would sponsor me at Starfleet Academy.
And he would do such a thing without even discussing it with me?
I told him I had your approval.
Ah!
I kept him as far away from you as I could.
I take it you've been accepted by the Academy.
Well, you've never fully embraced the traditions of our tribe, I know that.
And you've always been curious about other societies.
And that is why I allowed you to read about them.
Because I believe that ignorance is our greatest enemy.
But to leave the tribe...
Our tribe lives in the past.
A past of fantasy and myth.
That past is a part of you, no matter how hard you try to reject it.
Other tribes have learned to accept the 24th century.
Why can't ours?
It is not the place of a 15-year-old boy to question the choices of his tribe.
I know.
That's why I have to leave.
You will never belong to that other life.
And if you leave, you will never belong to this one.
You'll be caught between worlds.
I ask for your blessing, Father.
Oon-day.
Oon-day, Kolopak.
Botanical surveyor number one to Commander Chakotay.
Go ahead, Neelix.
You won't believe what I found.
I think it's...
Neelix, what the...?
The bird, the bird!
My eye!
Away team to Voyager.
Go ahead, Commander.
Emergency beam-out.
Get Neelix to Sick Bay.
Acknowledged.
Commander.
You're very lucky this bird didn't snatch your eye right out of the socket.
We have no spare Talaxian eyeballs.
Is something the matter with him?
The Doctor gave himself the Levodian flu to see what it's like.
Is he contagious?
It's a holographic simulation, not an actual virus.
There's no need for concern.
You may sit up.
Touchy, isn't he?
He isn't feeling well.
I don't require any compassion, thank you very much.
I have been experiencing these symptoms for nearly 20 hours, and I am in complete command of my faculties.
You may both leave now.
Mr. Kim believes if we bombard the crust with antithoron radiation, we can decontaminate it before excavation begins.
Then all we need to do is locate these people and get their permission.
Any progress?
Everything we've found here suggests the people who live in this village left recently and in a hurry.
Do you believe our arrival frightened them?
We can't discount that.
You'd think with warp technology, they would have encountered other alien life before now.
You'd think with warp technology, they wouldn't be living like this.
Captain, have you had any unusual readings that might explain the images of a strange face I've been seeing?
Images?
Very odd.
Like the flash of a memory.
But it's someone I've never met.
Nothing unusual has shown up on the ship's sensors.
Tuvok hasn't detected any telepathic activity, either.
If you want to call it a day, Commander...
No.
I think we'll press on for a while.
If there are any other problems, I'll let you know.
Chakotay out.
The dwellings are constructed with an alloy polymer matrix we've never encountered before, Commander.
They're out there.
Our tricorders may not tell us so, but they're out there.
Lay down your weapons.
Commander?
Disarm...
I want them to see that we don't pose any threat to them.
May I remind the Commander that Starfleet protocol demands that away teams remain armed and ready to defend themselves until contact is...
I know all about Starfleet protocol, Lieutenant.
As we have not yet established the inhabitants' intentions, it would not be a logical course of action.
The logical course isn't always the right course.
Lay down your weapons in plain sight.
Those are my orders.
Would you at least permit me to advise the Captain to move the ship into a stronger tactical position?
Negative.
We'll show no force of any kind.
For the record, I must take exception to these orders.
Noted.
They have reason to be scared.
Who can blame them?
Their history, our history, is filled with conquerors who brought slavery and disease and death.
Maybe we should just leave them alone.

I have no explanation, Commander!
There is no storm activity indicated.
All right, let's get back to the shuttle.
Hey!
Wait!
We will never make it!
Where's Chakotay?
!
Away team to Voyager.
Emergency beam-out.
He was right behind us.
I don't understand what could have happened to him.
Was he wearing the combadge the last time you saw him?
Just before the storm, he was using it to speak with you, Captain.
Mr. Paris, what are the current surface conditions near the shuttle?
Surface conditions are back to normal, Captain.
Winds two knots, but...
I can't find any sign of their shuttle.
It's not where they landed it.
And it isn't airborne?
No, ma'am.
I'll lead the away team back.
Mr. Tuvok, Lieutenant, you're with me.
Mr. Paris, you have...
Captain Janeway, this is the Doctor.
Please turn to your emergency medical holographic channel.
What is it, Doctor?
Something terrible has happened.
My program...
Doctor, I think you're carrying this experiment of yours a little too far.
One hour too far, to be precise.
I very specifically programmed a 29-hour Levodian flu.
And it has now been 30 hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry, but we have more pressing matters...
You can't leave me like this.
I need help, now!
Get me somebody who can tweak the computer and make me feel better, immediately.
Very well.
Mr. Kim is on his way.
Try to relax, Doctor.
I'll see to that, Captain.
I'm going to need you with me, Kes.
Prepare a medkit and bring it with you to Transporter Room 3.
Commander Chakotay is still on the surface and may be injured.
Janeway out.
Oh, I don't understand it.
I...
I ran a computer diagnostic and it said that my program was fine.
Just rest, Doctor.
Here's a cool, holographic towel for your forehead.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.
Please... don't go yet.
I have to.
The Captain...
I feel like I'm fading, just... fading away.
You don't know what that means to a hologram.
What seems to be the problem?
My simulated virus is leading me to a simulated death.
It's nothing to worry about.
I just added a couple of hours to his computer program.
He'll be fine in about 45 minutes.
Knowing when it would end didn't exactly make it a fair test, did it, Doctor?
Oh, she is far more devious than I ever suspected.
No shuttle.
Well, at least they got out okay.
You have nothing to fear from me.
Talk to me.
Let me see you.
Is-to ko-hee-nis.
No!
Thank you.
You have nothing to fear from me.
Talk to me.
Let me see you.
I don't understand it.
It's the same thing that happened the first time we tried to go down.
A storm develops wherever we try to lock on.
Why would we have the ability to beam people up, but not to beam them down?
I believe we have seen enough to discern a pattern, Captain.
The logical conclusion is that someone is controlling the elements of nature to ward us off.
The transporter anomaly is evidence of this conclusion.
We are allowed to leave the planet, but not to approach.
If that's true, I'd be happy to respect their wishes, but, unfortunately,
I have a missing crewman to get back first.
Janeway to Paris.
Yes, Captain.
Mr. Paris, we're going to land Voyager on the surface.
Take us into the atmosphere.
Acknowledged.
Beginning entry sequence.
I'm reading electrical storms forming all around us.
Adjusting flight path.
The barometric pressure is continuing to fall.
We're looking at monsoon conditions out there.
Mr. Paris, the shuttle crew didn't report turbulence this severe during their landing.
I'm doing the best I can, Captain.
I'm showing gale force winds out there.
It is conceivable that the aliens have been able to intensify their response now that they are familiar with our capabilities.
Red Alert!
Inertial dampers are off-line.
We seem to be caught in some kind of vortex.
I can't maintain altitude.
Captain, it's a cyclone.
Altitude 20,000 meters and falling.
I can't get us out of this thing, Captain.
Bridge to Torres.
We need more power from the engines.
I've got them running 20 percent over rated maximum, Captain.
It's not enough.
Could we go to low warp under these conditions?
The ship might make it without inertial dampers, but we'd all just be stains on the back wall.
I can try to augment the engines with power from the auxiliary fusion reactors, but it's going to take at least 20 minutes.
How much time do we have, Mr. Paris?
Altitude at 18,000 meters and falling.
At this rate, we're looking at about ten minutes.
If you can hear me, speak to me.
Dosh-du-pah kee-ne?

Warning.
Approach vector is too steep.
Discontinue landing sequence.
Would somebody turn that off, please?
Engineering, report.
We need that extra power, B'Elanna.
Ten minutes.
I just need ten minutes!
Do you understand my words now?
Yes.
Explain the face marking.
I wear it to honor my father.
He wore it to honor his ancestors.
Ancestors...
You are human?
Yes.
Are there others on your world with this mark?
Yes.
Not many, but some.
We were taught all of them had been annihilated.
We were taught your world had been ravaged by those with no respect for life or land.
There was a time when that was true.
But no longer.
He claims to be a descendent of the Inheritors.
Inheritors?
The ones...
our ancestors chose to honor.
I'm surprised you have no memory of the Inheritors.
One of our gifts was the memory.
If you are a descendent, you should remember.
I'm not sure I understand.
Perhaps it has been lost over time.
45,000 years ago, on our first visit to your world, we met a small group of nomadic hunters.
They had no spoken language, no culture, except the use of fire and stone weapons, but they did have a respect for the land and for other living creatures that impressed us deeply.
We decided to give them an inheritance... a genetic bonding... so they might thrive and protect your world.
On subsequent visits, we found that our genetic gift brought about a spirit of curiosity and adventure.
It impelled them to migrate away from the cold climate to a new, unpeopled land.
It took them almost a thousand generations to cross your planet.
Hundreds of thousands of them flourished in their new land.
Their civilization had a profound influence on others of your species.
But then new people came with weapons and disease.
The Inheritors who survived scattered.
Many sought refuge in other societies.
12 generations ago when we returned, we found no sign of their existence.
My people called you the Sky Spirits.
Why have you been hiding from us since we landed here?
When we heard your message, who you were, observed you probing our land, we believed you were a threat.
We thought you would annihilate us as you had the Inheritors.
Our message was supposed to communicate peaceful intentions.
We were taught that is the way human conquerors often introduce themselves.
As I said... we've tried to change our ways since the last time you stopped by.
Altitude: 2,000 meters.
Stand by, Bridge.
We're initiating the transfer now.
I'm showing an eight percent boost in the engines.
That's all?
The fusion reactors are nearly drained.
Fighting the storm is taking every reserve we have.
Altitude: 1,000 meters.
Impact in 20 seconds.
B'Elanna.
Impact in 15 seconds.
I'm sorry, Captain, that's all we've got.
Impact in ten seconds.
Report.
We're free.
Gaining altitude.
2,000 meters.
2,500.
Dampers back on line.
The storms have completely dissipated.
There's not a cloud in the sky.
Stand down Red Alert.
Anybody have an explanation?
It appears the inhabitants of this planet have decided to make contact, Captain.
The cloaking device has been turned off, and we are showing an alien population.
I have located the shuttle.
It may be possible to locate Commander Chakotay without landing.
Establish a search pattern, Mr. Paris.
Yes, Captain.
Begin scanning for human life signs.
As soon as you find Chakotay, we'll send down an away team.
My ship will be coming for me soon.
I'm sorry we cannot permit you to extract all the materials you need.
You were generous to offer as much as you did.
You have a long journey ahead.
It took us more than two generations to reach your world.
I wish I could see my father's face right now.
Does he still live?
No.
He died fighting enemies who would have taken our home colony.
Our tribe moved there a few hundred years ago.
So he honored the land just as... his ancestors did.
Yes.
Yes, he did.
We weren't on very good terms when he died.
Once he was gone, I didn't know how to reconcile our differences, how to heal our old wounds.
I returned to my colony, and continued the fight in his name.
I took the mark that he wore to honor his ancestors.
I spoke to him in my vision quests, but he never answered.
Until now.
CHAH-mooz-ee.
Commander.
Put those away.
Listen to him, Chakotay.
Do you hear what he says to you?
Yes, Father.
I hear him.
I finally hear him.
Four to beam up, Voyager.
Anything?
Not really.
The polyferranide deposits are contaminated with astiline.
Commander, there's something over here I think you should see.
Pack it up.
We'll find better quality somewhere down the line.
That line is going to be cut short when our nacelles burn themselves up if we don't find it soon.
What have you got, Lieutenant?
There have been other visitors to this moon recently.
What do you think this is?
Some kind of message?
I don't want you to go wandering off.
I'm not.
I'm just looking at something.
Antonio.
Vay-chit no-op-puse-nee.
Chakotay, kay-nee-post.
Pon-ah-chee nun-pah-hee-no.
Kay-nee-post itchee-oh.
Kep-pon-nee!
He says you're quite a scout.
A kep-pon-nee.
I was just looking at a lizard when I saw it.
Well, it was your eyes that saw it.
No one else's did.
That's the important thing.
Come.
I want you to understand this.
It's a blessing to the land.
An ancient healing symbol.
A CHAH-mooz-ee.
They probably cut this down for firewood.
The Rubber Tree people?
Well, the closest thing to the Ancient Rubber Tree people that we'll ever see.
The people in this tribe are their descendants.
Just like we are.
And they still use firewood instead of magnesite fuel like everyone else.
Chakotay, they've chosen to live like this for centuries.
That's why we are traveling on foot and not using a transporter.
We honor the Sky Spirits who led our ancestors to this sacred land.
Sacred land?
Yes.
Huh.
The Sky Spirits must have taken a wrong turn somewhere.
Maybe it's a blessing to the land.
For damaging it with the campfire.
What is your basis for that conclusion, Commander?
Oh, just... something somebody told me once.
Describe the nature of your pain.
In the lower back.
It's tight.
Choose the word that would best describe your pain.
Burning, throbbing, piercing, pinching, biting, stinging, shooting...
Shooting.
It even goes down my legs.
Hmm.
is the baby all right?
Hmm?
Oh, certainly.
Fine, nothing to worry about.
Well, that makes me feel better.
The position of the baby is simply putting pressure on your sciatic nerve.
You may return to your post.
The pain makes it difficult to sit for any period of time.
It's really quite uncomfortable.
Elevating your legs when you sit should provide all the relief you need.
Perhaps a day of rest, off-duty.
Mm-mm.
Ensign Wildman, according to your medical history, this is your first pregnancy, correct?
Yes.
Well, Ensign, unfortunately, pregnancy causes its fair share of discomforts and you'll have to learn to live with them.
That's just the way it is.
We'll schedule her for follow-up in two days.
If the pain has not subsided on its own by then, we'll attempt to decrease the sensitivity of the nerve in that region.
Thank you, Doctor.
Call me day or night if this gets any worse.
Don't you have any compassion for the way she feels?
Every member of this crew is an adult.
I will not coddle them.
Compassion can be your department.
Fortunately, you have enough for both of us.
You've never been sick or in pain.
I just wish, once in your life, you could know what it's like, how it makes you feel vulnerable and a little afraid.
Then you'd understand.
I don't have a life.
I have a program.
I hated every minute of it.
My father had dragged me all the way from our colony near the Cardassian border on this quest of his.
Away from my friends, my home, and here we were, in the middle of a brutal Central American jungle looking for the descendants of the Ancient Rubber people.
It must have been very important to him.
Believe me, it was.
And he was very disappointed that I didn't share his enthusiasm.
He'd been tracking down the origins of our tribe for years.
The one on the right is the one I found today.
And now, something you saw on that trip years ago, shows up again on a moon surface almost 70,000 light-years away.
I don't suppose you have any theories that might explain this.
I can give you an official Rubber Tree people theory if you like.
-Sky Spirits.
-Sky Spirits?
It's an ancient myth.
Sky Spirits from above created the first Rubber people in their own image, and led the way to a sacred land where the Rubber people would live for eternity.
You obviously don't put a great deal of faith in this explanation.
How much faith do you put in Adam and Eve?
Hasn't science proved that all humans developed from a single evolutionary process?
That's what I was always taught.
On the other hand, none of my teachers ever spent much time in the Delta Quadrant.
B'Elanna tells me we picked up a warp signature heading away from the moon.
Think we should follow it?
I don't know that it's fair for me to put my own personal curiosity ahead of the ship's priorities.
We still haven't found the polyferranide we need to seal the warp coils.
If these people have warp technology, they might be able to help us.
Besides... we are in the business of exploring, aren't we?
My father would put on his expedition hat and shout, "Let's go!"
I guess that's good enough for me.
Showing no life signs.
Mr. Paris, are you certain the warp signature ended here?
Positive, Captain.
Harry, check your sensors.
That look like some kind of power source to you?
That is an unusually high EM reading for a natural occurrence.
Could be some kind of cloaking technology.
Mr. Kim, transmit a continuous message on all frequencies identifying who we are, where we're from and make it clear our intentions are peaceful.
Torres to Bridge.
Go ahead.
We're in luck, Captain.
My readings are showing high concentrations of polyferranide about ten kilometers below the surface.
Acknowledged.
We'll send out an away team to continue the survey.
Report to Transporter Room 3.
On my way.
Commander, if we meet any resistance abort the mission.
I have no intention of disturbing an alien race that would rather be left alone.
Understood.
On the other hand, if we can make contact, our goal is to get permission to begin excavation as soon as possible.
Tuvok, you're with me.
Mr. Neelix, please report to Transporter Room 3 for an away mission.
I'll meet you there, Commander.
We may be out of luck.
Problem?
I'm not sure we can transport down.
Every time we try to lock on to a transport sight, a storm begins.
Storm?
We've tried seven different sites and as soon as we lock on, an electrical storm forms right above the location.
When we change sites, a new storm forms and the old one dissipates.
Might the transporter beam itself be causing an electrostatic charge in the atmosphere?
That's as good a guess as any.
I can't explain it.
We just can't transport.
Fine, we'll take a shuttle.
Once again, the storm seems to have formed as a direct result of our interaction with the atmosphere.
The meteorological conditions changed radically when we began our entry sequence.
Shields are holding.
It takes more than a little thunderstorm to bother one of your mighty Starfleet ships, huh?
Nothing we can't handle.
Relax, Neelix.
That's why they call it a rain forest.
Why do your Sky Spirits choose a place where it rains all the time?
And it's hot... and there are so many bugs?
It's said the Sky Spirits honored the land above all else.
Maybe it's because this land yields so many different kinds of life.
Maybe they wanted us to become friends with everything in nature.
including the bugs.
Sorry, Sky Spirits.
I will never make friends with bugs.
Maybe that's why they keep biting you.
You're miserable.
It was a mistake to bring you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I can't be what you want me to be.
From the day you came out of your mother... upside down... I knew the spirits had chosen you to be a contrary.
No one chooses for me.
I choose my own way.
And if that makes me a contrary, I'll have to live with it.
If you have no spirits to guide you, I fear you will lose your way.
Altitude: 5,000 meters.
Decreasing speed to 720 kph.
Entering terminal approach phase.
Visibility still zero.
Switching to enhanced terrain scanning.
Touchdown sight scanned.
Continuing descent.
Computer, activate the emergency medical holographic program.
Please state the nature of the medical emergency.
I thought we changed your program so you wouldn't have to say that anymore.
We did.
But I became so uncomfortable trying to find new ways to "break the ice," as it were, that I restored it.
Let's just say it works for me.
Doctor?
Ah, you noticed.
Are holograms supposed to... sneeze?
Generally, no.
But I have accepted your challenge.
I programmed myself with the symptoms of the 29-hour Levodian flu.
Thus I will gain the experience that you suggest would be beneficial to the performance of my duties.
Holographic tissue paper for the holographic runny nose.
Don't offer them to patients.
Mmm, interesting sensation, blowing one's nose.
It's my first time.
I think this is very brave of you.
Nothing of the sort.
I intend it to be an educational experience.
I'm sure you'll learn a lot.
I meant for the crew.
I'm tired of the whiny, cranky attitudes we see around here.
I intend to serve as an example of how one's life and duties do not have to be disrupted by simple illness.
Doc?
I don't feel so good.
Neither do I, and you don't hear me complaining.
We are not making any progress locating the source of that unusual power reading, Commander.
Then I guess we'll have to search for these people the old-fashioned way-- with our eyes and ears.
is something bothering you,
Commander?
No, it just reminds me of another jungle that I visited once.
The Central American rain forest on Earth.
It's the only other place in the universe that I've ever seen this flower.
It appears to be a rare variety of Cypriprdium of the Asiatic genus PaphiopediIum.
I never knew you had such horticultural expertise, Mr. Vulcan.
In fact, I am-- or, more accurately, I was-- a breeder of prize Vulcan orchids.
Then we have something in common-- l breed orchids, too!
Don't they make the most exquisite salad?
A touch of Baldoxic vinegar-- pure heaven.
I hereby designate the two of you the team's botanical surveyors.
Collect a sample of that flower.
B'Elanna?
It's just what we've been looking for.
Almost pure polyferranide.
But there's a problem with crust reactivity.
If we can't solve it before excavation, we might contaminate the entire yield.
Have Ensign Kim run an analysis from the ship.
We should be able to... I'll be damned.
What?
It almost looks like a hawk, doesn't it?
Listen to him, Chakotay.
What does he say to you?
He says, "You are home." Huh?
I'm leaving the tribe, Father.
What?
I got to know a lot of the Starfleet officers patrolling the Cardassian border.
I asked Captain Sulu if he would sponsor me at Starfleet Academy.
And he would do such a thing without even discussing it with me?
I told him I had your approval.
Ah!
I kept him as far away from you as I could.
I take it you've been accepted by the Academy.
Well, you've never fully embraced the traditions of our tribe, I know that.
And you've always been curious about other societies.
And that is why I allowed you to read about them.
Because I believe that ignorance is our greatest enemy.
But to leave the tribe...
Our tribe lives in the past.
A past of fantasy and myth.
That past is a part of you, no matter how hard you try to reject it.
Other tribes have learned to accept the 24th century.
Why can't ours?
It is not the place of a 15-year-old boy to question the choices of his tribe.
I know.
That's why I have to leave.
You will never belong to that other life.
And if you leave, you will never belong to this one.
You'll be caught between worlds.
I ask for your blessing, Father.
Oon-day.
Oon-day, KoIopak.
Botanical surveyor number one to Commander Chakotay.
Go ahead, Neelix.
You won't believe what I found.
I think it's...
Neelix, what the...?
The bird, the bird!
My eye!
Away team to Voyager.
Go ahead, Commander.
Emergency beam-out.
Get Neelix to Sick Bay.
Acknowledged.
Commander.
You're very lucky this bird didn't snatch your eye right out of the socket.
We have no spare Talaxian eyeballs.
is something the matter with him?
The Doctor gave himself the Levodian flu to see what it's like.
is he contagious?
It's a holographic simulation, not an actual virus.
There's no need for concern.
You may sit up.
Touchy, isn't he?
He isn't feeling well.
I don't require any compassion, thank you very much.
I have been experiencing these symptoms for nearly 20 hours, and I am in complete command of my faculties.
You may both leave now.
Mr. Kim believes if we bombard the crust with antithoron radiation, we can decontaminate it before excavation begins.
Then all we need to do is locate these people and get their permission.
Any progress?
Everything we've found here suggests the people who live in this village left recently and in a hurry.
Do you believe our arrival frightened them?
We can't discount that.
You'd think with warp technology, they would have encountered other alien life before now.
You'd think with warp technology, they wouldn't be living like this.
Captain, have you had any unusual readings that might explain the images of a strange face I've been seeing?
Images?
Very odd.
Like the flash of a memory.
But it's someone I've never met.
Nothing unusual has shown up on the ship's sensors.
Tuvok hasn't detected any telepathic activity, either.
If you want to call it a day, Commander...
No.
I think we'll press on for a while.
If there are any other problems, I'll let you know.
Chakotay out.
The dwellings are constructed with an alloy polymer matrix we've never encountered before, Commander.
They're out there.
Our tricorders may not tell us so, but they're out there.
Lay down your weapons.
Commander?
Disarm-- l want them to see that we don't pose any threat to them.
May I remind the Commander that Starfleet protocol demands that away teams remain armed and ready to defend themselves until contact is... I know all about Starfleet protocol, Lieutenant.
As we have not yet established the inhabitants' intentions, it would not be a logical course of action.
The logical course isn't always the right course.
Lay down your weapons in plain sight.
Those are my orders.
Would you at least permit me to advise the Captain to move the ship into a stronger tactical position?
Negative.
We'll show no force of any kind.
For the record, I must take exception to these orders.
Noted.
They have reason to be scared.
Who can blame them?
Their history, our history, is filled with conquerors who brought slavery and disease and death.
Maybe we should just leave them alone.

All right, let's get back to the shuttle.
Hey!
Wait!
We will never make it!
Where's Chakotay?
!
Away team to Voyager.
Emergency beam-out.
He was right behind us.
I don't understand what could have happened to him.
Was he wearing the combadge the last time you saw him?
Just before the storm, he was using it to speak with you, Captain.
Mr. Paris, what are the current surface conditions near the shuttle?
Surface conditions are back to normal, Captain.
Winds two knots, but... I can't find any sign of their shuttle.
It's not where they landed it.
And it isn't airborne?
No, ma'am.
I'll lead the away team back.
Mr. Tuvok, Lieutenant, you're with me.
Mr. Paris, you have...
Captain Janeway, this is the Doctor.
Please turn to your emergency medical holographic channel.
What is it, Doctor?
Something terrible has happened.
My program...
Doctor, I think you're carrying this experiment of yours a little too far.
One hour too far, to be precise.
I very specifically programmed a 29-hour Levodian flu.
And it has now been 30 hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry, but we have more pressing matters...
You can't leave me like this.
I need help, now!
Get me somebody who can tweak the computer and make me feel better, immediately.
Very well.
Mr. Kim is on his way.
Try to relax, Doctor.
I'll see to that, Captain.
I'm going to need you with me, Kes.
Prepare a medkit and bring it with you to Transporter Room 3.
Commander Chakotay is still on the surface and may be injured.
Janeway out.
Oh, I don't understand it.
I...
I ran a computer diagnostic and it said that my program was fine.
Just rest, Doctor.
Here's a cool, holographic towel for your forehead.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.
Please... don't go yet.
I have to.
The Captain... I feel like I'm fading, just... fading away.
You don't know what that means to a hologram.
What seems to be the problem?
My simulated virus is leading me to a simulated death.
It's nothing to worry about.
I just added a couple of hours to his computer program.
He'll be fine in about 45 minutes.
Knowing when it would end didn't exactly make it a fair test, did it, Doctor?
Oh, she is far more devious than I ever suspected.
No shuttle.
Well, at least they got out okay.
You have nothing to fear from me.
Talk to me.
Let me see you.
Is-to ko-hee-nis.
No!
Thank you.
You have nothing to fear from me.
Talk to me.
Let me see you.
I don't understand it.
It's the same thing that happened the first time we tried to go down.
A storm develops wherever we try to lock on.
Why would we have the ability to beam people up, but not to beam them down?
I believe we have seen enough to discern a pattern, Captain.
The logical conclusion is that someone is controlling the elements of nature to ward us off.
The transporter anomaly is evidence of this conclusion.
We are allowed to leave the planet, but not to approach.
If that's true, I'd be happy to respect their wishes, but, unfortunately, I have a missing crewman to get back first.
Janeway to Paris.
Yes, Captain.
Mr. Paris, we're going to land Voyager on the surface.
Take us into the atmosphere.
Acknowledged.
Beginning entry sequence.
I'm reading electrical storms forming all around us.

The barometric pressure is continuing to fall.
We're looking at monsoon conditions out there.

I'm doing the best I can, Captain.
I'm showing gale force winds out there.
It is conceivable that the aliens have been able to intensify their response now that they are familiar with our capabilities.
Red Alert!
lnertial dampers are off-line.
We seem to be caught in some kind of vortex.
I can't maintain altitude.
Captain, it's a cyclone.
Altitude 20,000 meters and falling.
I can't get us out of this thing, Captain.
Bridge to Torres.
We need more power from the engines.
I've got them running 20 percent over rated maximum, Captain.
It's not enough.
Could we go to low warp under these conditions?
The ship might make it without inertial dampers, but we'd all just be stains on the back wall.
I can try to augment the engines with power from the auxiliary fusion reactors, but it's going to take at least 20 minutes.
How much time do we have, Mr. Paris?
Altitude at 18,000 meters and falling.
At this rate, we're looking at about ten minutes.
If you can hear me, speak to me.

I just need ten minutes!
Do you understand my words now?
Yes.
Explain the face marking.
I wear it to honor my father.
He wore it to honor his ancestors.
Ancestors...
You are human?
Yes.
Are there others on your world with this mark?
Yes.
Not many, but some.
We were taught all of them had been annihilated.
We were taught your world had been ravaged by those with no respect for life or land.
There was a time when that was true.
But no longer.
He claims to be a descendent of the inheritors.
Inheritors?
The ones...
our ancestors chose to honor.
I'm surprised you have no memory of the inheritors.
One of our gifts was the memory.
If you are a descendent, you should remember.
I'm not sure I understand.
Perhaps it has been lost over time.
45,000 years ago, on our first visit to your world, we met a small group of nomadic hunters.
They had no spoken language, no culture, except the use of fire and stone weapons, but they did have a respect for the land and for other living creatures that impressed us deeply.
We decided to give them an inheritance-- a genetic bonding-- so they might thrive and protect your world.
On subsequent visits, we found that our genetic gift brought about a spirit of curiosity and adventure.
It impelled them to migrate away from the cold climate to a new, unpeopled land.
It took them almost a thousand generations to cross your planet.
Hundreds of thousands of them flourished in their new land.
Their civilization had a profound influence on others of your species.
But then new people came with weapons and disease.
The Inheritors who survived scattered.
Many sought refuge in other societies.
12 generations ago when we returned, we found no sign of their existence.
My people called you the Sky Spirits.
Why have you been hiding from us since we landed here?
When we heard your message, who you were, observed you probing our land, we believed you were a threat.
We thought you would annihilate us as you had the inheritors.
Our message was supposed to communicate peaceful intentions.
We were taught that is the way human conquerors often introduce themselves.
As I said... we've tried to change our ways since the last time you stopped by.
Altitude: 2,000 meters.

Dampers back on line.
The storms have completely dissipated.
There's not a cloud in the sky.
Stand down Red Alert.
Anybody have an explanation?
It appears the inhabitants of this planet have decided to make contact, Captain.
The cloaking device has been turned off, and we are showing an alien population.
I have located the shuttle.
It may be possible to locate Commander Chakotay without landing.
Establish a search pattern, Mr. Paris.
Yes, Captain.
Begin scanning for human life signs.
As soon as you find Chakotay, we'll send down an away team.
My ship will be coming for me soon.
I'm sorry we cannot permit you to extract all the materials you need.
You were generous to offer as much as you did.
You have a long journey ahead.
It took us more than two generations to reach your world.
I wish I could see my father's face right now.
Does he still live?
No.
He died fighting enemies who would have taken our home colony.
Our tribe moved there a few hundred years ago.
So he honored the land just as... his ancestors did.
Yes.
Yes, he did.
We weren't on very good terms when he died.
Once he was gone, I didn't know how to reconcile our differences, how to heal our old wounds.
I returned to my colony, and continued the fight in his name.
I took the mark that he wore to honor his ancestors.
I spoke to him in my vision quests, but he never answered.
Until now.
CHAH-mooz-ee.
Commander.
Put those away.
Listen to him, Chakotay.
Do you hear what he says to you?
Yes, Father.
I hear him.
I finally hear him.
Four to beam up, Voyager.
Anything?
Not really.
The polyferranide deposits are contaminated with astiline.
Commander, there's something over here I think you should see.
Pack it up.
We'll find better quality somewhere down the line.
That line is going to be cut short when our nacelles burn themselves up if we don't find it soon.
What have you got, Lieutenant?
There have been other visitors to this moon recently.
What do you think this is?
Some kind of message?
I don't want you to go wandering off.
I'm not.
I'm just looking at something.
Antonio.
Vay-chit no-op-puse-nee.
Chakotay, kay-nee-post.
Pon-ah-chee nun-pah-hee-no.
Kay-nee-post itchee-oh.
Kep-pon-nee!
He says you're quite a scout.
A kep-pon-nee.
I was just looking at a lizard when I saw it.
Well, it was your eyes that saw it.
No one else's did.
That's the important thing.
Come.
I want you to understand this.
It's a blessing to the land.
An ancient healing symbol.
A CHAH-mooz-ee.
They probably cut this down for firewood.
The Rubber Tree people?
Well, the closest thing to the Ancient Rubber Tree people that we'll ever see.
The people in this tribe are their descendants.
Just like we are.
But they never left this jungle.
And they rarely intermarry with other tribes.
And they still use firewood instead of magnesite fuel like everyone else.
Chakotay, they've chosen to live like this for centuries.
That's why we are traveling on foot and not using a transporter.
We honor the Sky Spirits who led our ancestors to this sacred land.
Sacred land?
Yes.
Huh.
The Sky Spirits must have taken a wrong turn somewhere.
Maybe it's a blessing to the land.
For damaging it with the campfire.
What is your basis for that conclusion, Commander?
Oh, just... something somebody told me once.
Describe the nature of your pain.
In the lower back.
It's tight.
Choose the word that would best describe your pain.
Burning, throbbing, piercing, pinching, biting, stinging, shooting...
Shooting.
It even goes down my legs.
Hmm.
is the baby all right?
Hmm?
Oh, certainly.
Fine, nothing to worry about.
Well, that makes me feel better.
The position of the baby is simply putting pressure on your sciatic nerve.
You may return to your post.
The pain makes it difficult to sit for any period of time.
It's really quite uncomfortable.
Elevating your legs when you sit should provide all the relief you need.
Perhaps a day of rest, off-duty.
Mm-mm.
Ensign Wildman, according to your medical history, this is your first pregnancy, correct?
Yes.
Well, Ensign, unfortunately, pregnancy causes its fair share of discomforts and you'll have to learn to live with them.
That's just the way it is.
We'll schedule her for follow-up in two days.
If the pain has not subsided on its own by then, we'll attempt to decrease the sensitivity of the nerve in that region.
Thank you, Doctor.
Call me day or night if this gets any worse.
Don't you have any compassion for the way she feels?
Every member of this crew is an adult.
I will not coddle them.
Compassion can be your department.
Fortunately, you have enough for both of us.
You've never been sick or in pain.
I just wish, once in your life, you could know what it's like, how it makes you feel vulnerable and a little afraid.
Then you'd understand.
I don't have a life.
I have a program.
I hated every minute of it.
My father had dragged me all the way from our colony near the Cardassian border on this quest of his.
Away from my friends, my home, and here we were, in the middle of a brutal Central American jungle looking for the descendants of the Ancient Rubber people.
It must have been very important to him.
Believe me, it was.
And he was very disappointed that I didn't share his enthusiasm.
He'd been tracking down the origins of our tribe for years.
The one on the right is the one I found today.
And now, something you saw on that trip years ago, shows up again on a moon surface almost 70,000 light-years away.
I don't suppose you have any theories that might explain this.
I can give you an official Rubber Tree people theory if you like.
-Sky Spirits.
-Sky Spirits?
It's an ancient myth.
Sky Spirits from above created the first Rubber people in their own image, and led the way to a sacred land where the Rubber people would live for eternity.
You obviously don't put a great deal of faith in this explanation.
How much faith do you put in Adam and Eve?
Hasn't science proved that all humans developed from a single evolutionary process?
That's what I was always taught.
On the other hand, none of my teachers ever spent much time in the Delta Quadrant.
B'Elanna tells me we picked up a warp signature heading away from the moon.
Think we should follow it?
I don't know that it's fair for me to put my own personal curiosity ahead of the ship's priorities.
We still haven't found the polyferranide we need to seal the warp coils.
If these people have warp technology, they might be able to help us.
Besides... we are in the business of exploring, aren't we?
My father would put on his expedition hat and shout, "Let's go!"
I guess that's good enough for me.
Showing no life signs.
Mr. Paris, are you certain the warp signature ended here?
Positive, Captain.
Harry, check your sensors.
That look like some kind of power source to you?
That is an unusually high EM reading for a natural occurrence.
Could be some kind of cloaking technology.
Mr. Kim, transmit a continuous message on all frequencies identifying who we are, where we're from and make it clear our intentions are peaceful.
Torres to Bridge.
Go ahead.
We're in luck, Captain.
My readings are showing high concentrations of polyferranide about ten kilometers below the surface.
Acknowledged.
We'll send out an away team to continue the survey.
Report to Transporter Room 3.
On my way.
Commander, if we meet any resistance abort the mission.
I have no intention of disturbing an alien race that would rather be left alone.
Understood.
On the other hand, if we can make contact, our goal is to get permission to begin excavation as soon as possible.
Tuvok, you're with me.
Mr. Neelix, please report to Transporter Room 3 for an away mission.
I'll meet you there, Commander.
We may be out of luck.
Problem?
I'm not sure we can transport down.
Every time we try to lock on to a transport sight, a storm begins.
Storm?
We've tried seven different sites and as soon as we lock on, an electrical storm forms right above the location.
When we change sites, a new storm forms and the old one dissipates.
Might the transporter beam itself be causing an electrostatic charge in the atmosphere?
That's as good a guess as any.
I can't explain it.
We just can't transport.
Fine, we'll take a shuttle.
Once again, the storm seems to have formed as a direct result of our interaction with the atmosphere.
The meteorological conditions changed radically when we began our entry sequence.
Shields are holding.
It takes more than a little thunderstorm to bother one of your mighty Starfleet ships, huh?
Nothing we can't handle.
Relax, Neelix.
That's why they call it a rain forest.
Why do your Sky Spirits choose a place where it rains all the time?
And it's hot... and there are so many bugs?
It's said the Sky Spirits honored the land above all else.
Maybe it's because this land yields so many different kinds of life.
Maybe they wanted us to become friends with everything in nature.
including the bugs.
Sorry, Sky Spirits.
I will never make friends with bugs.
Maybe that's why they keep biting you.
You're miserable.
It was a mistake to bring you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I can't be what you want me to be.
From the day you came out of your mother... upside down... I knew the spirits had chosen you to be a contrary.
No one chooses for me.
I choose my own way.
And if that makes me a contrary, I'll have to live with it.
If you have no spirits to guide you, I fear you will lose your way.
Altitude: 5,000 meters.
Decreasing speed to 720 kph.

Visibility still zero.
Switching to enhanced terrain scanning.
Touchdown sight scanned.
Continuing descent.
Computer, activate the emergency medical holographic program.
Please state the nature of the medical emergency.
I thought we changed your program so you wouldn't have to say that anymore.
We did.
But I became so uncomfortable trying to find new ways to "break the ice," as it were, that I restored it.
Let's just say it works for me.
Doctor?
Ah, you noticed.
Are holograms supposed to... sneeze?
Generally, no.
But I have accepted your challenge.
I programmed myself with the symptoms of the 29-hour Levodian flu.
Thus I will gain the experience that you suggest would be beneficial to the performance of my duties.
Holographic tissue paper for the holographic runny nose.
Don't offer them to patients.
Mmm, interesting sensation, blowing one's nose.
It's my first time.
I think this is very brave of you.
Nothing of the sort.
I intend it to be an educational experience.
I'm sure you'll learn a lot.
I meant for the crew.
I'm tired of the whiny, cranky attitudes we see around here.
I intend to serve as an example of how one's life and duties do not have to be disrupted by simple illness.
Doc?
I don't feel so good.
Neither do I, and you don't hear me complaining.
We are not making any progress locating the source of that unusual power reading, Commander.
Then I guess we'll have to search for these people the old-fashioned way-- with our eyes and ears.
is something bothering you,
Commander?
No, it just reminds me of another jungle that I visited once.
The Central American rain forest on Earth.
It's the only other place in the universe that I've ever seen this flower.
It appears to be a rare variety of Cypriprdium of the Asiatic genus PaphiopediIum.
I never knew you had such horticultural expertise, Mr. Vulcan.
In fact, I am-- or, more accurately, I was-- a breeder of prize Vulcan orchids.
Then we have something in common-- l breed orchids, too!
Don't they make the most exquisite salad?
A touch of Baldoxic vinegar-- pure heaven.
I hereby designate the two of you the team's botanical surveyors.
Collect a sample of that flower.
B'Elanna?
It's just what we've been looking for.
Almost pure polyferranide.
But there's a problem with crust reactivity.
If we can't solve it before excavation, we might contaminate the entire yield.
Have Ensign Kim run an analysis from the ship.
We should be able to... I'll be damned.
What?
It almost looks like a hawk, doesn't it?
Listen to him, Chakotay.
What does he say to you?
He says, "You are home." Huh?
I'm leaving the tribe, Father.
What?
I got to know a lot of the Starfleet officers patrolling the Cardassian border.
I asked Captain Sulu if he would sponsor me at Starfleet Academy.
And he would do such a thing without even discussing it with me?
I told him I had your approval.
Ah!
I kept him as far away from you as I could.
I take it you've been accepted by the Academy.
Well, you've never fully embraced the traditions of our tribe, I know that.
And you've always been curious about other societies.
And that is why I allowed you to read about them.
Because I believe that ignorance is our greatest enemy.
But to leave the tribe...
Our tribe lives in the past.
A past of fantasy and myth.
That past is a part of you, no matter how hard you try to reject it.
Other tribes have learned to accept the 24th century.
Why can't ours?
It is not the place of a 15-year-old boy to question the choices of his tribe.
I know.
That's why I have to leave.
You will never belong to that other life.
And if you leave, you will never belong to this one.
You'll be caught between worlds.
I ask for your blessing, Father.
Oon-day.
Oon-day, KoIopak.
Botanical surveyor number one to Commander Chakotay.
Go ahead, Neelix.
You won't believe what I found.
I think it's...
Neelix, what the...?
The bird, the bird!
My eye!
Away team to Voyager.
Go ahead, Commander.
Emergency beam-out.
Get Neelix to Sick Bay.
Acknowledged.
Commander.
You're very lucky this bird didn't snatch your eye right out of the socket.
We have no spare Talaxian eyeballs.
is something the matter with him?
The Doctor gave himself the Levodian flu to see what it's like.
is he contagious?
It's a holographic simulation, not an actual virus.
There's no need for concern.
You may sit up.
Touchy, isn't he?
He isn't feeling well.
I don't require any compassion, thank you very much.
I have been experiencing these symptoms for nearly 20 hours, and I am in complete command of my faculties.
You may both leave now.
Mr. Kim believes if we bombard the crust with antithoron radiation, we can decontaminate it before excavation begins.
Then all we need to do is locate these people and get their permission.
Any progress?
Everything we've found here suggests the people who live in this village left recently and in a hurry.
Do you believe our arrival frightened them?
We can't discount that.
You'd think with warp technology, they would have encountered other alien life before now.
You'd think with warp technology, they wouldn't be living like this.
Captain, have you had any unusual readings that might explain the images of a strange face I've been seeing?
Images?
Very odd.
Like the flash of a memory.
But it's someone I've never met.
Nothing unusual has shown up on the ship's sensors.
Tuvok hasn't detected any telepathic activity, either.
If you want to call it a day, Commander...
No.
I think we'll press on for a while.
If there are any other problems, I'll let you know.
Chakotay out.
The dwellings are constructed with an alloy polymer matrix we've never encountered before, Commander.
They're out there.
Our tricorders may not tell us so, but they're out there.
Lay down your weapons.
Commander?
Disarm-- l want them to see that we don't pose any threat to them.
May I remind the Commander that Starfleet protocol demands that away teams remain armed and ready to defend themselves until contact is... I know all about Starfleet protocol, Lieutenant.
As we have not yet established the inhabitants' intentions, it would not be a logical course of action.
The logical course isn't always the right course.
Lay down your weapons in plain sight.
Those are my orders.
Would you at least permit me to advise the Captain to move the ship into a stronger tactical position?
Negative.
We'll show no force of any kind.
For the record, I must take exception to these orders.
Noted.
They have reason to be scared.
Who can blame them?
Their history, our history, is filled with conquerors who brought slavery and disease and death.
Maybe we should just leave them alone.

There is no storm activity indicated.
All right, let's get back to the shuttle.
Hey!
Wait!
We will never make it!
Where's Chakotay?
!
Away team to Voyager.
Emergency beam-out.
He was right behind us.
I don't understand what could have happened to him.
Was he wearing the combadge the last time you saw him?
Just before the storm, he was using it to speak with you, Captain.
Mr. Paris, what are the current surface conditions near the shuttle?
Surface conditions are back to normal, Captain.
Winds two knots, but... I can't find any sign of their shuttle.
It's not where they landed it.
And it isn't airborne?
No, ma'am.
I'll lead the away team back.
Mr. Tuvok, Lieutenant, you're with me.
Mr. Paris, you have...
Captain Janeway, this is the Doctor.
Please turn to your emergency medical holographic channel.
What is it, Doctor?
Something terrible has happened.
My program...
Doctor, I think you're carrying this experiment of yours a little too far.
One hour too far, to be precise.
I very specifically programmed a 29-hour Levodian flu.
And it has now been 30 hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry, but we have more pressing matters...
You can't leave me like this.
I need help, now!
Get me somebody who can tweak the computer and make me feel better, immediately.
Very well.
Mr. Kim is on his way.
Try to relax, Doctor.
I'll see to that, Captain.
I'm going to need you with me, Kes.
Prepare a medkit and bring it with you to Transporter Room 3.
Commander Chakotay is still on the surface and may be injured.
Janeway out.
Oh, I don't understand it.
I...
I ran a computer diagnostic and it said that my program was fine.
Just rest, Doctor.
Here's a cool, holographic towel for your forehead.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.
Please... don't go yet.
I have to.
The Captain... I feel like I'm fading, just... fading away.
You don't know what that means to a hologram.
What seems to be the problem?
My simulated virus is leading me to a simulated death.
It's nothing to worry about.
I just added a couple of hours to his computer program.
He'll be fine in about 45 minutes.
Knowing when it would end didn't exactly make it a fair test, did it, Doctor?
Oh, she is far more devious than I ever suspected.
No shuttle.
Well, at least they got out okay.
You have nothing to fear from me.
Talk to me.
Let me see you.
Is-to ko-hee-nis.
No!
Thank you.
You have nothing to fear from me.
Talk to me.
Let me see you.
I don't understand it.
It's the same thing that happened the first time we tried to go down.
A storm develops wherever we try to lock on.
Why would we have the ability to beam people up, but not to beam them down?
I believe we have seen enough to discern a pattern, Captain.
The logical conclusion is that someone is controlling the elements of nature to ward us off.
The transporter anomaly is evidence of this conclusion.
We are allowed to leave the planet, but not to approach.
If that's true, I'd be happy to respect their wishes, but, unfortunately, I have a missing crewman to get back first.
Janeway to Paris.
Yes, Captain.
Mr. Paris, we're going to land Voyager on the surface.
Take us into the atmosphere.
Acknowledged.
Beginning entry sequence.
I'm reading electrical storms forming all around us.
Adjusting flight path.
The barometric pressure is continuing to fall.
We're looking at monsoon conditions out there.
Mr. Paris, the shuttle crew didn't report turbulence this severe during their landing.
I'm doing the best I can, Captain.
I'm showing gale force winds out there.
It is conceivable that the aliens have been able to intensify their response now that they are familiar with our capabilities.
Red Alert!
lnertial dampers are off-line.
We seem to be caught in some kind of vortex.
I can't maintain altitude.
Captain, it's a cyclone.
Altitude 20,000 meters and falling.
I can't get us out of this thing, Captain.
Bridge to Torres.
We need more power from the engines.
I've got them running 20 percent over rated maximum, Captain.
It's not enough.
Could we go to low warp under these conditions?
The ship might make it without inertial dampers, but we'd all just be stains on the back wall.
I can try to augment the engines with power from the auxiliary fusion reactors, but it's going to take at least 20 minutes.
How much time do we have, Mr. Paris?
Altitude at 18,000 meters and falling.
At this rate, we're looking at about ten minutes.
If you can hear me, speak to me.

Engineering, report.
We need that extra power, B'Elanna.
Ten minutes.
I just need ten minutes!
Do you understand my words now?
Yes.
Explain the face marking.
I wear it to honor my father.
He wore it to honor his ancestors.
Ancestors...
You are human?
Yes.
Are there others on your world with this mark?
Yes.
Not many, but some.
We were taught all of them had been annihilated.
We were taught your world had been ravaged by those with no respect for life or land.
There was a time when that was true.
But no longer.
He claims to be a descendent of the inheritors.
Inheritors?
The ones...
our ancestors chose to honor.
I'm surprised you have no memory of the inheritors.
One of our gifts was the memory.
If you are a descendent, you should remember.
I'm not sure I understand.
Perhaps it has been lost over time.
45,000 years ago, on our first visit to your world, we met a small group of nomadic hunters.
They had no spoken language, no culture, except the use of fire and stone weapons, but they did have a respect for the land and for other living creatures that impressed us deeply.
We decided to give them an inheritance-- a genetic bonding-- so they might thrive and protect your world.
On subsequent visits, we found that our genetic gift brought about a spirit of curiosity and adventure.
It impelled them to migrate away from the cold climate to a new, unpeopled land.
It took them almost a thousand generations to cross your planet.
Hundreds of thousands of them flourished in their new land.
Their civilization had a profound influence on others of your species.
But then new people came with weapons and disease.
The Inheritors who survived scattered.
Many sought refuge in other societies.
12 generations ago when we returned, we found no sign of their existence.
My people called you the Sky Spirits.
Why have you been hiding from us since we landed here?
When we heard your message, who you were, observed you probing our land, we believed you were a threat.
We thought you would annihilate us as you had the inheritors.
Our message was supposed to communicate peaceful intentions.
We were taught that is the way human conquerors often introduce themselves.
As I said... we've tried to change our ways since the last time you stopped by.
Altitude: 2,000 meters.

Dampers back on line.
The storms have completely dissipated.
There's not a cloud in the sky.
Stand down Red Alert.
Anybody have an explanation?
It appears the inhabitants of this planet have decided to make contact, Captain.
The cloaking device has been turned off, and we are showing an alien population.
I have located the shuttle.
It may be possible to locate Commander Chakotay without landing.
Establish a search pattern, Mr. Paris.
Yes, Captain.
Begin scanning for human life signs.
As soon as you find Chakotay, we'll send down an away team.
My ship will be coming for me soon.
I'm sorry we cannot permit you to extract all the materials you need.
You were generous to offer as much as you did.
You have a long journey ahead.
It took us more than two generations to reach your world.
I wish I could see my father's face right now.
Does he still live?
No.
He died fighting enemies who would have taken our home colony.
Our tribe moved there a few hundred years ago.
So he honored the land just as... his ancestors did.
Yes.
Yes, he did.
We weren't on very good terms when he died.
Once he was gone, I didn't know how to reconcile our differences, how to heal our old wounds.
I returned to my colony, and continued the fight in his name.
I took the mark that he wore to honor his ancestors.
I spoke to him in my vision quests, but he never answered.
Until now.
CHAH-mooz-ee.
Commander.
Put those away.
Listen to him, Chakotay.
Do you hear what he says to you?
Yes, Father.
I hear him.
I finally hear him.
Four to beam up, Voyager.
Anything?
Not really.
The polyferranide deposits are contaminated with astiline.
Commander, there's something over here I think you should see.
Pack it up.
We'll find better quality somewhere down the line.
That line is going to be cut short when our nacelles burn themselves up if we don't find it soon.
What have you got, Lieutenant?
There have been other visitors to this moon recently.
What do you think this is?
Some kind of message?
I don't want you to go wandering off.
I'm not.
I'm just looking at something.
Antonio.
Vay-chit no-op-puse-nee.
Chakotay, kay-nee-post.
Pon-ah-chee nun-pah-hee-no.
Kay-nee-post itchee-oh.
Kep-pon-nee!
He says you're quite a scout.
A kep-pon-nee.
I was just looking at a lizard when I saw it.
Well, it was your eyes that saw it.
No one else's did.
That's the important thing.
Come.
I want you to understand this.
It's a blessing to the land.
An ancient healing symbol.
A CHAH-mooz-ee.
They probably cut this down for firewood.
The Rubber Tree people?
Well, the closest thing to the Ancient Rubber Tree people that we'll ever see.
The people in this tribe are their descendants.
Just like we are.
But they never left this jungle.
And they rarely intermarry with other tribes.
And they still use firewood instead of magnesite fuel like everyone else.
Chakotay, they've chosen to live like this for centuries.
That's why we are traveling on foot and not using a transporter.
We honor the Sky Spirits who led our ancestors to this sacred land.
Sacred land?
Yes.
Huh.
The Sky Spirits must have taken a wrong turn somewhere.
Maybe it's a blessing to the land.
For damaging it with the campfire.
What is your basis for that conclusion, Commander?
Oh, just... something somebody told me once.
Describe the nature of your pain.
In the lower back.
It's tight.
Choose the word that would best describe your pain.
Burning, throbbing, piercing, pinching, biting, stinging, shooting...
Shooting.
It even goes down my legs.
Hmm.
is the baby all right?
Hmm?
Oh, certainly.
Fine, nothing to worry about.
Well, that makes me feel better.
The position of the baby is simply putting pressure on your sciatic nerve.
You may return to your post.
The pain makes it difficult to sit for any period of time.
It's really quite uncomfortable.
Elevating your legs when you sit should provide all the relief you need.
Perhaps a day of rest, off-duty.
Mm-mm.
Ensign Wildman, according to your medical history, this is your first pregnancy, correct?
Yes.
Well, Ensign, unfortunately, pregnancy causes its fair share of discomforts and you'll have to learn to live with them.
That's just the way it is.
We'll schedule her for follow-up in two days.
If the pain has not subsided on its own by then, we'll attempt to decrease the sensitivity of the nerve in that region.
Thank you, Doctor.
Call me day or night if this gets any worse.
Don't you have any compassion for the way she feels?
Every member of this crew is an adult.
I will not coddle them.
Compassion can be your department.
Fortunately, you have enough for both of us.
You've never been sick or in pain.
I just wish, once in your life, you could know what it's like, how it makes you feel vulnerable and a little afraid.
Then you'd understand.
I don't have a life.
I have a program.
I hated every minute of it.
My father had dragged me all the way from our colony near the Cardassian border on this quest of his.
Away from my friends, my home, and here we were, in the middle of a brutal Central American jungle looking for the descendants of the Ancient Rubber people.
It must have been very important to him.
Believe me, it was.
And he was very disappointed that I didn't share his enthusiasm.
He'd been tracking down the origins of our tribe for years.
The one on the right is the one I found today.
And now, something you saw on that trip years ago, shows up again on a moon surface almost 70,000 light-years away.
I don't suppose you have any theories that might explain this.
I can give you an official Rubber Tree people theory if you like.
-Sky Spirits.
-Sky Spirits?
It's an ancient myth.
Sky Spirits from above created the first Rubber people in their own image, and led the way to a sacred land where the Rubber people would live for eternity.
You obviously don't put a great deal of faith in this explanation.
How much faith do you put in Adam and Eve?
Hasn't science proved that all humans developed from a single evolutionary process?
That's what I was always taught.
On the other hand, none of my teachers ever spent much time in the Delta Quadrant.
B'Elanna tells me we picked up a warp signature heading away from the moon.
Think we should follow it?
I don't know that it's fair for me to put my own personal curiosity ahead of the ship's priorities.
We still haven't found the polyferranide we need to seal the warp coils.
If these people have warp technology, they might be able to help us.
Besides... we are in the business of exploring, aren't we?
My father would put on his expedition hat and shout, "Let's go!"
I guess that's good enough for me.
Showing no life signs.
Mr. Paris, are you certain the warp signature ended here?
Positive, Captain.
Harry, check your sensors.
That look like some kind of power source to you?
That is an unusually high EM reading for a natural occurrence.
Could be some kind of cloaking technology.
Mr. Kim, transmit a continuous message on all frequencies identifying who we are, where we're from and make it clear our intentions are peaceful.
Torres to Bridge.
Go ahead.
We're in luck, Captain.
My readings are showing high concentrations of polyferranide about ten kilometers below the surface.
Acknowledged.
We'll send out an away team to continue the survey.
Report to Transporter Room 3.
On my way.
Commander, if we meet any resistance abort the mission.
I have no intention of disturbing an alien race that would rather be left alone.
Understood.
On the other hand, if we can make contact, our goal is to get permission to begin excavation as soon as possible.
Tuvok, you're with me.
Mr. Neelix, please report to Transporter Room 3 for an away mission.
I'll meet you there, Commander.
We may be out of luck.
Problem?
I'm not sure we can transport down.
Every time we try to lock on to a transport sight, a storm begins.
Storm?
We've tried seven different sites and as soon as we lock on, an electrical storm forms right above the location.
When we change sites, a new storm forms and the old one dissipates.
Might the transporter beam itself be causing an electrostatic charge in the atmosphere?
That's as good a guess as any.
I can't explain it.
We just can't transport.
Fine, we'll take a shuttle.
Once again, the storm seems to have formed as a direct result of our interaction with the atmosphere.
The meteorological conditions changed radically when we began our entry sequence.
Shields are holding.
It takes more than a little thunderstorm to bother one of your mighty Starfleet ships, huh?
Nothing we can't handle.
Relax, Neelix.
That's why they call it a rain forest.
Why do your Sky Spirits choose a place where it rains all the time?
And it's hot... and there are so many bugs?
It's said the Sky Spirits honored the land above all else.
Maybe it's because this land yields so many different kinds of life.
Maybe they wanted us to become friends with everything in nature.
including the bugs.
Sorry, Sky Spirits.
I will never make friends with bugs.
Maybe that's why they keep biting you.
You're miserable.
It was a mistake to bring you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I can't be what you want me to be.
From the day you came out of your mother... upside down... I knew the spirits had chosen you to be a contrary.
No one chooses for me.
I choose my own way.
And if that makes me a contrary, I'll have to live with it.
If you have no spirits to guide you, I fear you will lose your way.
Altitude: 5,000 meters.
Decreasing speed to 720 kph.
Entering terminal approach phase.
Visibility still zero.
Switching to enhanced terrain scanning.
Touchdown sight scanned.
Continuing descent.
Computer, activate the emergency medical holographic program.
Please state the nature of the medical emergency.
I thought we changed your program so you wouldn't have to say that anymore.
We did.
But I became so uncomfortable trying to find new ways to "break the ice," as it were, that I restored it.
Let's just say it works for me.
Doctor?
Ah, you noticed.
Are holograms supposed to... sneeze?
Generally, no.
But I have accepted your challenge.
I programmed myself with the symptoms of the 29-hour Levodian flu.
Thus I will gain the experience that you suggest would be beneficial to the performance of my duties.
Holographic tissue paper for the holographic runny nose.
Don't offer them to patients.
Mmm, interesting sensation, blowing one's nose.
It's my first time.
I think this is very brave of you.
Nothing of the sort.
I intend it to be an educational experience.
I'm sure you'll learn a lot.
I meant for the crew.
I'm tired of the whiny, cranky attitudes we see around here.
I intend to serve as an example of how one's life and duties do not have to be disrupted by simple illness.
Doc?
I don't feel so good.
Neither do I, and you don't hear me complaining.
We are not making any progress locating the source of that unusual power reading, Commander.
Then I guess we'll have to search for these people the old-fashioned way-- with our eyes and ears.
is something bothering you,
Commander?
No, it just reminds me of another jungle that I visited once.
The Central American rain forest on Earth.
It's the only other place in the universe that I've ever seen this flower.
It appears to be a rare variety of Cypriprdium of the Asiatic genus PaphiopediIum.
I never knew you had such horticultural expertise, Mr. Vulcan.
In fact, I am-- or, more accurately, I was-- a breeder of prize Vulcan orchids.
Then we have something in common-- l breed orchids, too!
Don't they make the most exquisite salad?
A touch of Baldoxic vinegar-- pure heaven.
I hereby designate the two of you the team's botanical surveyors.
Collect a sample of that flower.
B'Elanna?
It's just what we've been looking for.
Almost pure polyferranide.
But there's a problem with crust reactivity.
If we can't solve it before excavation, we might contaminate the entire yield.
Have Ensign Kim run an analysis from the ship.
We should be able to... I'll be damned.
What?
It almost looks like a hawk, doesn't it?
Listen to him, Chakotay.
What does he say to you?
He says, "You are home." Huh?
I'm leaving the tribe, Father.
What?
I got to know a lot of the Starfleet officers patrolling the Cardassian border.
I asked Captain Sulu if he would sponsor me at Starfleet Academy.
And he would do such a thing without even discussing it with me?
I told him I had your approval.
Ah!
I kept him as far away from you as I could.
I take it you've been accepted by the Academy.
Well, you've never fully embraced the traditions of our tribe, I know that.
And you've always been curious about other societies.
And that is why I allowed you to read about them.
Because I believe that ignorance is our greatest enemy.
But to leave the tribe...
Our tribe lives in the past.
A past of fantasy and myth.
That past is a part of you, no matter how hard you try to reject it.
Other tribes have learned to accept the 24th century.
Why can't ours?
It is not the place of a 15-year-old boy to question the choices of his tribe.
I know.
That's why I have to leave.
You will never belong to that other life.
And if you leave, you will never belong to this one.
You'll be caught between worlds.
I ask for your blessing, Father.
Oon-day.
Oon-day, KoIopak.
Botanical surveyor number one to Commander Chakotay.
Go ahead, Neelix.
You won't believe what I found.
I think it's...
Neelix, what the...?
The bird, the bird!
My eye!
Away team to Voyager.
Go ahead, Commander.
Emergency beam-out.
Get Neelix to Sick Bay.
Acknowledged.
Commander.
You're very lucky this bird didn't snatch your eye right out of the socket.
We have no spare Talaxian eyeballs.
is something the matter with him?
The Doctor gave himself the Levodian flu to see what it's like.
is he contagious?
It's a holographic simulation, not an actual virus.
There's no need for concern.
You may sit up.
Touchy, isn't he?
He isn't feeling well.
I don't require any compassion, thank you very much.
I have been experiencing these symptoms for nearly 20 hours, and I am in complete command of my faculties.
You may both leave now.
Mr. Kim believes if we bombard the crust with antithoron radiation, we can decontaminate it before excavation begins.
Then all we need to do is locate these people and get their permission.
Any progress?
Everything we've found here suggests the people who live in this village left recently and in a hurry.
Do you believe our arrival frightened them?
We can't discount that.
You'd think with warp technology, they would have encountered other alien life before now.
You'd think with warp technology, they wouldn't be living like this.
Captain, have you had any unusual readings that might explain the images of a strange face I've been seeing?
Images?
Very odd.
Like the flash of a memory.
But it's someone I've never met.
Nothing unusual has shown up on the ship's sensors.
Tuvok hasn't detected any telepathic activity, either.
If you want to call it a day, Commander...
No.
I think we'll press on for a while.
If there are any other problems, I'll let you know.
Chakotay out.
The dwellings are constructed with an alloy polymer matrix we've never encountered before, Commander.
They're out there.
Our tricorders may not tell us so, but they're out there.
Lay down your weapons.
Commander?
Disarm-- l want them to see that we don't pose any threat to them.
May I remind the Commander that Starfleet protocol demands that away teams remain armed and ready to defend themselves until contact is... I know all about Starfleet protocol, Lieutenant.
As we have not yet established the inhabitants' intentions, it would not be a logical course of action.
The logical course isn't always the right course.
Lay down your weapons in plain sight.
Those are my orders.
Would you at least permit me to advise the Captain to move the ship into a stronger tactical position?
Negative.
We'll show no force of any kind.
For the record, I must take exception to these orders.
Noted.
They have reason to be scared.
Who can blame them?
Their history, our history, is filled with conquerors who brought slavery and disease and death.
Maybe we should just leave them alone.

I have no explanation, Commander!
There is no storm activity indicated.
All right, let's get back to the shuttle.
Hey!
Wait!
We will never make it!
Where's Chakotay?
!
Away team to Voyager.
Emergency beam-out.
He was right behind us.
I don't understand what could have happened to him.
Was he wearing the combadge the last time you saw him?
Just before the storm, he was using it to speak with you, Captain.
Mr. Paris, what are the current surface conditions near the shuttle?
Surface conditions are back to normal, Captain.
Winds two knots, but... I can't find any sign of their shuttle.
It's not where they landed it.
And it isn't airborne?
No, ma'am.
I'll lead the away team back.
Mr. Tuvok, Lieutenant, you're with me.
Mr. Paris, you have...
Captain Janeway, this is the Doctor.
Please turn to your emergency medical holographic channel.
What is it, Doctor?
Something terrible has happened.
My program...
Doctor, I think you're carrying this experiment of yours a little too far.
One hour too far, to be precise.
I very specifically programmed a 29-hour Levodian flu.
And it has now been 30 hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry, but we have more pressing matters...
You can't leave me like this.
I need help, now!
Get me somebody who can tweak the computer and make me feel better, immediately.
Very well.
Mr. Kim is on his way.
Try to relax, Doctor.
I'll see to that, Captain.
I'm going to need you with me, Kes.
Prepare a medkit and bring it with you to Transporter Room 3.
Commander Chakotay is still on the surface and may be injured.
Janeway out.
Oh, I don't understand it.
I...
I ran a computer diagnostic and it said that my program was fine.
Just rest, Doctor.
Here's a cool, holographic towel for your forehead.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.
Please... don't go yet.
I have to.
The Captain... I feel like I'm fading, just... fading away.
You don't know what that means to a hologram.
What seems to be the problem?
My simulated virus is leading me to a simulated death.
It's nothing to worry about.
I just added a couple of hours to his computer program.
He'll be fine in about 45 minutes.
Knowing when it would end didn't exactly make it a fair test, did it, Doctor?
Oh, she is far more devious than I ever suspected.
No shuttle.
Well, at least they got out okay.
You have nothing to fear from me.
Talk to me.
Let me see you.
Is-to ko-hee-nis.
No!
Thank you.
You have nothing to fear from me.
Talk to me.
Let me see you.
I don't understand it.
It's the same thing that happened the first time we tried to go down.
A storm develops wherever we try to lock on.
Why would we have the ability to beam people up, but not to beam them down?
I believe we have seen enough to discern a pattern, Captain.
The logical conclusion is that someone is controlling the elements of nature to ward us off.
The transporter anomaly is evidence of this conclusion.
We are allowed to leave the planet, but not to approach.
If that's true, I'd be happy to respect their wishes, but, unfortunately, I have a missing crewman to get back first.
Janeway to Paris.
Yes, Captain.
Mr. Paris, we're going to land Voyager on the surface.
Take us into the atmosphere.
Acknowledged.
Beginning entry sequence.
I'm reading electrical storms forming all around us.
Adjusting flight path.
The barometric pressure is continuing to fall.
We're looking at monsoon conditions out there.
Mr. Paris, the shuttle crew didn't report turbulence this severe during their landing.
I'm doing the best I can, Captain.
I'm showing gale force winds out there.
It is conceivable that the aliens have been able to intensify their response now that they are familiar with our capabilities.
Red Alert!
lnertial dampers are off-line.
We seem to be caught in some kind of vortex.
I can't maintain altitude.
Captain, it's a cyclone.
Altitude 20,000 meters and falling.
I can't get us out of this thing, Captain.
Bridge to Torres.
We need more power from the engines.
I've got them running 20 percent over rated maximum, Captain.
It's not enough.
Could we go to low warp under these conditions?
The ship might make it without inertial dampers, but we'd all just be stains on the back wall.
I can try to augment the engines with power from the auxiliary fusion reactors, but it's going to take at least 20 minutes.
How much time do we have, Mr. Paris?
Altitude at 18,000 meters and falling.
At this rate, we're looking at about ten minutes.
If you can hear me, speak to me.
Dosh-du-pah kee-ne?

Warning.
Approach vector is too steep.
Discontinue landing sequence.
Would somebody turn that off, please?
Engineering, report.
We need that extra power, B'Elanna.
Ten minutes.
I just need ten minutes!
Do you understand my words now?
Yes.
Explain the face marking.
I wear it to honor my father.
He wore it to honor his ancestors.
Ancestors...
You are human?
Yes.
Are there others on your world with this mark?
Yes.
Not many, but some.
We were taught all of them had been annihilated.
We were taught your world had been ravaged by those with no respect for life or land.
There was a time when that was true.
But no longer.
He claims to be a descendent of the inheritors.
Inheritors?
The ones...
our ancestors chose to honor.
I'm surprised you have no memory of the inheritors.
One of our gifts was the memory.
If you are a descendent, you should remember.
I'm not sure I understand.
Perhaps it has been lost over time.
45,000 years ago, on our first visit to your world, we met a small group of nomadic hunters.
They had no spoken language, no culture, except the use of fire and stone weapons, but they did have a respect for the land and for other living creatures that impressed us deeply.
We decided to give them an inheritance-- a genetic bonding-- so they might thrive and protect your world.
On subsequent visits, we found that our genetic gift brought about a spirit of curiosity and adventure.
It impelled them to migrate away from the cold climate to a new, unpeopled land.
It took them almost a thousand generations to cross your planet.
Hundreds of thousands of them flourished in their new land.
Their civilization had a profound influence on others of your species.
But then new people came with weapons and disease.
The Inheritors who survived scattered.
Many sought refuge in other societies.
12 generations ago when we returned, we found no sign of their existence.
My people called you the Sky Spirits.
Why have you been hiding from us since we landed here?
When we heard your message, who you were, observed you probing our land, we believed you were a threat.
We thought you would annihilate us as you had the inheritors.
Our message was supposed to communicate peaceful intentions.
We were taught that is the way human conquerors often introduce themselves.
As I said... we've tried to change our ways since the last time you stopped by.
Altitude: 2,000 meters.
Stand by, Bridge.
We're initiating the transfer now.
I'm showing an eight percent boost in the engines.
That's all?
The fusion reactors are nearly drained.
Fighting the storm is taking every reserve we have.
Altitude: 1,000 meters.
lmpact in 20 seconds.
B'Elanna.
lmpact in 15 seconds.
I'm sorry, Captain, that's all we've got.
lmpact in ten seconds.
Report.
We're free.
Gaining altitude.
2,000 meters.
2,500.
Dampers back on line.
The storms have completely dissipated.
There's not a cloud in the sky.
Stand down Red Alert.
Anybody have an explanation?
It appears the inhabitants of this planet have decided to make contact, Captain.
The cloaking device has been turned off, and we are showing an alien population.
I have located the shuttle.
It may be possible to locate Commander Chakotay without landing.
Establish a search pattern, Mr. Paris.
Yes, Captain.
Begin scanning for human life signs.
As soon as you find Chakotay, we'll send down an away team.
My ship will be coming for me soon.
I'm sorry we cannot permit you to extract all the materials you need.
You were generous to offer as much as you did.
You have a long journey ahead.
It took us more than two generations to reach your world.
I wish I could see my father's face right now.
Does he still live?
No.
He died fighting enemies who would have taken our home colony.
Our tribe moved there a few hundred years ago.
So he honored the land just as... his ancestors did.
Yes.
Yes, he did.
We weren't on very good terms when he died.
Once he was gone, I didn't know how to reconcile our differences, how to heal our old wounds.
I returned to my colony, and continued the fight in his name.
I took the mark that he wore to honor his ancestors.
I spoke to him in my vision quests, but he never answered.
Until now.
CHAH-mooz-ee.
Commander.
Put those away.
Listen to him, Chakotay.
Do you hear what he says to you?
Yes, Father.
I hear him.
I finally hear him.
Four to beam up, Voyager.
Anything?
Not really.
The polyferranide deposits are contaminated with astiline.
Commander, there's something over here
I think you should see.
Pack it up.
We'll find better quality somewhere down the line.
That line is going to be cut short when our nacelles burn themselves up if we don't find it soon.
What have you got, Lieutenant?
There have been other visitors to this moon recently.
What do you think this is?
Some kind of message?
I don't want you to go wandering off.
I'm not.
I'm just looking at something.
Antonio.
Vay-chit no-op-puse-nee.
Chakotay, kay-nee-post.
Pon-ah-chee nun-pah-hee-no.
Kay-nee-post itchee-oh.
Kep-pon-nee!
He says you're quite a scout.
A kep-pon-nee.
I was just looking at a lizard when I saw it.
Well, it was your eyes that saw it.
No one else's did.
That's the important thing.
Come.
I want you to understand this.
It's a blessing to the land.
An ancient healing symbol.
A CHAH-mooz-ee.
They probably cut this down for firewood.
The Rubber Tree people?
Well, the closest thing to the Ancient Rubber Tree people that we'll ever see.
The people in this tribe are their descendants.
Just like we are.
But they never left this jungle.
And they rarely intermarry with other tribes.
And they still use firewood instead of magnesite fuel like everyone else.
Chakotay, they've chosen to live like this for centuries.
That's why we are traveling on foot and not using a transporter.
We honor the Sky Spirits who led our ancestors to this sacred land.
Sacred land?
Yes.
Huh.
The Sky Spirits must have taken a wrong turn somewhere.
Maybe it's a blessing to the land.
For damaging it with the campfire.
What is your basis for that conclusion, Commander?
Oh, just... something somebody told me once.
Describe the nature of your pain.
In the lower back.
It's tight.
Choose the word that would best describe your pain.
Burning, throbbing, piercing, pinching, biting, stinging, shooting...
Shooting.
It even goes down my legs.
Hmm.
Is the baby all right?
Hmm?
Oh, certainly.
Fine, nothing to worry about.
Well, that makes me feel better.
The position of the baby is simply putting pressure on your sciatic nerve.
You may return to your post.
The pain makes it difficult to sit for any period of time.
It's really quite uncomfortable.
Elevating your legs when you sit should provide all the relief you need.
Perhaps a day of rest, off-duty.
Mm-mm.
Ensign Wildman, according to your medical history, this is your first pregnancy, correct?
Yes.
Well, Ensign, unfortunately, pregnancy causes its fair share of discomforts and you'll have to learn to live with them.
That's just the way it is.
We'll schedule her for follow-up in two days.
If the pain has not subsided on its own by then, we'll attempt to decrease the sensitivity of the nerve in that region.
Thank you, Doctor.
Call me day or night if this gets any worse.
Don't you have any compassion for the way she feels?
Every member of this crew is an adult.
I will not coddle them.
Compassion can be your department.
Fortunately, you have enough for both of us.
You've never been sick or in pain.
I just wish, once in your life, you could know what it's like, how it makes you feel vulnerable and a little afraid.
Then you'd understand.
I don't have a life.
I have a program.
I hated every minute of it.
My father had dragged me all the way from our colony near the Cardassian border on this quest of his.
Away from my friends, my home, and here we were, in the middle of a brutal Central American jungle looking for the descendants of the Ancient Rubber people.
It must have been very important to him.
Believe me, it was.
And he was very disappointed that I didn't share his enthusiasm.
He'd been tracking down the origins of our tribe for years.
The one on the right is the one I found today.
And now, something you saw on that trip years ago, shows up again on a moon surface almost 70,000 light-years away.
I don't suppose you have any theories that might explain this.
I can give you an official Rubber Tree people theory if you like.
-Sky Spirits.
-Sky Spirits?
It's an ancient myth.
Sky Spirits from above created the first Rubber people in their own image, and led the way to a sacred land where the Rubber people would live for eternity.
You obviously don't put a great deal of faith in this explanation.
How much faith do you put in Adam and Eve?
Hasn't science proved that all humans developed from a single evolutionary process?
That's what I was always taught.
On the other hand, none of my teachers ever spent much time in the Delta Quadrant.
B'Elanna tells me we picked up a warp signature heading away from the moon.
Think we should follow it?
I don't know that it's fair for me to put my own personal curiosity ahead of the ship's priorities.
We still haven't found the polyferranide we need to seal the warp coils.
If these people have warp technology, they might be able to help us.
Besides... we are in the business of exploring, aren't we?
My father would put on his expedition hat and shout, "Let's go!"
I guess that's good enough for me.
Showing no life signs.
Mr. Paris, are you certain the warp signature ended here?
Positive, Captain.
Harry, check your sensors.
That look like some kind of power source to you?
That is an unusually high EM reading for a natural occurrence.
Could be some kind of cloaking technology.
Mr. Kim, transmit a continuous message on all frequencies identifying who we are, where we're from and make it clear our intentions are peaceful.
Torres to Bridge.
Go ahead.
We're in luck, Captain.
My readings are showing high concentrations of polyferranide about ten kilometers below the surface.
Acknowledged.
We'll send out an away team to continue the survey.
Report to Transporter Room 3.
On my way.
Commander, if we meet any resistance abort the mission.
I have no intention of disturbing an alien race that would rather be left alone.
Understood.
On the other hand, if we can make contact, our goal is to get permission to begin excavation as soon as possible.
Tuvok, you're with me.
Mr. Neelix, please report to Transporter Room 3 for an away mission.
I'll meet you there, Commander.
We may be out of luck.
Problem?
I'm not sure we can transport down.
Every time we try to lock on to a transport sight, a storm begins.
Storm?
We've tried seven different sites and as soon as we lock on, an electrical storm forms right above the location.
When we change sites, a new storm forms and the old one dissipates.
Might the transporter beam itself be causing an electrostatic charge in the atmosphere?
That's as good a guess as any.
I can't explain it.
We just can't transport.
Fine, we'll take a shuttle.
Once again, the storm seems to have formed as a direct result of our interaction with the atmosphere.
The meteorological conditions changed radically when we began our entry sequence.
Shields are holding.
It takes more than a little thunderstorm to bother one of your mighty Starfleet ships, huh?
Nothing we can't handle.
Relax, Neelix.
That's why they call it a rain forest.
Why do your Sky Spirits choose a place where it rains all the time?
And it's hot... and there are so many bugs?
It's said the Sky Spirits honored the land above all else.
Maybe it's because this land yields so many different kinds of life.
Maybe they wanted us to become friends with everything in nature.
Including the bugs.
Sorry, Sky Spirits.
I will never make friends with bugs.
Maybe that's why they keep biting you.
You're miserable.
It was a mistake to bring you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I can't be what you want me to be.
From the day you came out of your mother... upside down...
I knew the spirits had chosen you to be a contrary.
No one chooses for me.
I choose my own way.
And if that makes me a contrary,
I'll have to live with it.
If you have no spirits to guide you,
I fear you will lose your way.
Altitude: 5,000 meters.
Decreasing speed to 720 kph.
Entering terminal approach phase.
Visibility still zero.
Switching to enhanced terrain scanning.
Touchdown sight scanned.
Continuing descent.
Computer, activate the emergency medical holographic program.
Please state the nature of the medical emergency.
I thought we changed your program so you wouldn't have to say that anymore.
We did.
But I became so uncomfortable trying to find new ways to "break the ice," as it were, that I restored it.
Let's just say it works for me.
Doctor?
Ah, you noticed.
Are holograms supposed to... sneeze?
Generally, no.
But I have accepted your challenge.
I programmed myself with the symptoms of the 29-hour Levodian flu.
Thus I will gain the experience that you suggest would be beneficial to the performance of my duties.
Holographic tissue paper for the holographic runny nose.
Don't offer them to patients.
Mmm, interesting sensation, blowing one's nose.
It's my first time.
I think this is very brave of you.
Nothing of the sort.
I intend it to be an educational experience.
I'm sure you'll learn a lot.
I meant for the crew.
I'm tired of the whiny, cranky attitudes we see around here.
I intend to serve as an example of how one's life and duties do not have to be disrupted by simple illness.
Doc?
I don't feel so good.
Neither do I, and you don't hear me complaining.
We are not making any progress locating the source of that unusual power reading, Commander.
Then I guess we'll have to search for these people the old-fashioned way...
with our eyes and ears.
Is something bothering you,
Commander?
No, it just reminds me of another jungle that I visited once.
The Central American rain forest on Earth.
It's the only other place in the universe that I've ever seen this flower.
It appears to be a rare variety of Cypriprdium of the Asiatic genus Paphiopedilum.
I never knew you had such horticultural expertise, Mr. Vulcan.
In fact, I am...
or, more accurately, I was... a breeder of prize Vulcan orchids.
Then we have something in common...
I breed orchids, too!
Don't they make the most exquisite salad?
A touch of Baldoxic vinegar...
pure heaven.
I hereby designate the two of you the team's botanical surveyors.
Collect a sample of that flower.
B'Elanna?
It's just what we've been looking for.
Almost pure polyferranide.
But there's a problem with crust reactivity.
If we can't solve it before excavation, we might contaminate the entire yield.
Have Ensign Kim run an analysis from the ship.
We should be able to...
I'll be damned.
What?
It almost looks like a hawk, doesn't it?
Listen to him, Chakotay.
What does he say to you?
He says, "You are home." Huh?
I'm leaving the tribe, Father.
What?
I got to know a lot of the Starfleet officers patrolling the Cardassian border.
I asked Captain Sulu if he would sponsor me at Starfleet Academy.
And he would do such a thing without even discussing it with me?
I told him I had your approval.
Ah!
I kept him as far away from you as I could.
I take it you've been accepted by the Academy.
Well, you've never fully embraced the traditions of our tribe, I know that.
And you've always been curious about other societies.
And that is why I allowed you to read about them.
Because I believe that ignorance is our greatest enemy.
But to leave the tribe...
Our tribe lives in the past.
A past of fantasy and myth.
That past is a part of you, no matter how hard you try to reject it.
Other tribes have learned to accept the 24th century.
Why can't ours?
It is not the place of a 15-year-old boy to question the choices of his tribe.
I know.
That's why I have to leave.
You will never belong to that other life.
And if you leave, you will never belong to this one.
You'll be caught between worlds.
I ask for your blessing, Father.
Oon-day.
Oon-day, Kolopak.
Botanical surveyor number one to Commander Chakotay.
Go ahead, Neelix.
You won't believe what I found.
I think it's...
Neelix, what the...?
The bird, the bird!
My eye!
Away team to Voyager.
Go ahead, Commander.
Emergency beam-out.
Get Neelix to Sick Bay.
Acknowledged.
Commander.
You're very lucky this bird didn't snatch your eye right out of the socket.
We have no spare Talaxian eyeballs.
Is something the matter with him?
The Doctor gave himself the Levodian flu to see what it's like.
Is he contagious?
It's a holographic simulation, not an actual virus.
There's no need for concern.
You may sit up.
Touchy, isn't he?
He isn't feeling well.
I don't require any compassion, thank you very much.
I have been experiencing these symptoms for nearly 20 hours, and I am in complete command of my faculties.
You may both leave now.
Mr. Kim believes if we bombard the crust with antithoron radiation, we can decontaminate it before excavation begins.
Then all we need to do is locate these people and get their permission.
Any progress?
Everything we've found here suggests the people who live in this village left recently and in a hurry.
Do you believe our arrival frightened them?
We can't discount that.
You'd think with warp technology, they would have encountered other alien life before now.
You'd think with warp technology, they wouldn't be living like this.
Captain, have you had any unusual readings that might explain the images of a strange face I've been seeing?
Images?
Very odd.
Like the flash of a memory.
But it's someone I've never met.
Nothing unusual has shown up on the ship's sensors.
Tuvok hasn't detected any telepathic activity, either.
If you want to call it a day, Commander...
No.
I think we'll press on for a while.
If there are any other problems, I'll let you know.
Chakotay out.
The dwellings are constructed with an alloy polymer matrix we've never encountered before, Commander.
They're out there.
Our tricorders may not tell us so, but they're out there.
Lay down your weapons.
Commander?
Disarm...
I want them to see that we don't pose any threat to them.
May I remind the Commander that Starfleet protocol demands that away teams remain armed and ready to defend themselves until contact is...
I know all about Starfleet protocol, Lieutenant.
As we have not yet established the inhabitants' intentions, it would not be a logical course of action.
The logical course isn't always the right course.
Lay down your weapons in plain sight.
Those are my orders.
Would you at least permit me to advise the Captain to move the ship into a stronger tactical position?
Negative.
We'll show no force of any kind.
For the record, I must take exception to these orders.
Noted.
They have reason to be scared.
Who can blame them?
Their history, our history, is filled with conquerors who brought slavery and disease and death.
Maybe we should just leave them alone.
Oh-chip way-nob-ee teem-mock-uh an-tope-ah-nee.
Hi-yeta-koo-nay-pas.
Cha-kan-a hi-mee.
Cha-kan-a hi-mee.
Duh su kan-nuh-da.

Binda kana.
Father.
Kah-yo-tay.
Hay-noh.
CHAH-mooz-ee.
Teem-ma-ka-ha.
I have no explanation, Commander!
There is no storm activity indicated.
All right, let's get back to the shuttle.
Hey!
Wait!
We will never make it!
Where's Chakotay?
!
Away team to Voyager.
Emergency beam-out.
He was right behind us.
I don't understand what could have happened to him.
Was he wearing the combadge the last time you saw him?
Just before the storm, he was using it to speak with you, Captain.
Mr. Paris, what are the current surface conditions near the shuttle?
Surface conditions are back to normal, Captain.
Winds two knots, but...
I can't find any sign of their shuttle.
It's not where they landed it.
And it isn't airborne?
No, ma'am.
I'll lead the away team back.
Mr. Tuvok, Lieutenant, you're with me.
Mr. Paris, you have...
Captain Janeway, this is the Doctor.
Please turn to your emergency medical holographic channel.
What is it, Doctor?
Something terrible has happened.
My program...
Doctor, I think you're carrying this experiment of yours a little too far.
One hour too far, to be precise.
I very specifically programmed a 29-hour Levodian flu.
And it has now been 30 hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry, but we have more pressing matters...
You can't leave me like this.
I need help, now!
Get me somebody who can tweak the computer and make me feel better, immediately.
Very well.
Mr. Kim is on his way.
Try to relax, Doctor.
I'll see to that, Captain.
I'm going to need you with me, Kes.
Prepare a medkit and bring it with you to Transporter Room 3.
Commander Chakotay is still on the surface and may be injured.
Janeway out.
Oh, I don't understand it.
I...
I ran a computer diagnostic and it said that my program was fine.
Just rest, Doctor.
Here's a cool, holographic towel for your forehead.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.
Please... don't go yet.
I have to.
The Captain...
I feel like I'm fading, just... fading away.
You don't know what that means to a hologram.
What seems to be the problem?
My simulated virus is leading me to a simulated death.
It's nothing to worry about.
I just added a couple of hours to his computer program.
He'll be fine in about 45 minutes.
Knowing when it would end didn't exactly make it a fair test, did it, Doctor?
Oh, she is far more devious than I ever suspected.
No shuttle.
Well, at least they got out okay.
You have nothing to fear from me.
Talk to me.
Let me see you.
Is-to ko-hee-nis.
No!
Thank you.
You have nothing to fear from me.
Talk to me.
Let me see you.
I don't understand it.
It's the same thing that happened the first time we tried to go down.
A storm develops wherever we try to lock on.
Why would we have the ability to beam people up, but not to beam them down?
I believe we have seen enough to discern a pattern, Captain.
The logical conclusion is that someone is controlling the elements of nature to ward us off.
The transporter anomaly is evidence of this conclusion.
We are allowed to leave the planet, but not to approach.
If that's true, I'd be happy to respect their wishes, but, unfortunately,
I have a missing crewman to get back first.
Janeway to Paris.
Yes, Captain.
Mr. Paris, we're going to land Voyager on the surface.
Take us into the atmosphere.
Acknowledged.
Beginning entry sequence.
I'm reading electrical storms forming all around us.
Adjusting flight path.
The barometric pressure is continuing to fall.
We're looking at monsoon conditions out there.
Mr. Paris, the shuttle crew didn't report turbulence this severe during their landing.
I'm doing the best I can, Captain.
I'm showing gale force winds out there.
It is conceivable that the aliens have been able to intensify their response now that they are familiar with our capabilities.
Red Alert!
Inertial dampers are off-line.
We seem to be caught in some kind of vortex.
I can't maintain altitude.
Captain, it's a cyclone.
Altitude 20,000 meters and falling.
I can't get us out of this thing, Captain.
Bridge to Torres.
We need more power from the engines.
I've got them running 20 percent over rated maximum, Captain.
It's not enough.
Could we go to low warp under these conditions?
The ship might make it without inertial dampers, but we'd all just be stains on the back wall.
I can try to augment the engines with power from the auxiliary fusion reactors, but it's going to take at least 20 minutes.
How much time do we have, Mr. Paris?
Altitude at 18,000 meters and falling.
At this rate, we're looking at about ten minutes.
If you can hear me, speak to me.
Dosh-du-pah kee-ne?
Swasge-muh kee-say-yo-pah?
Swas-ti-ma-hay.
Kee-say-yo-pah.
Pah-kee-ne?
Sas-ga no-yo-du no-kay-dah?
I'm sorry.
I don't know the ancient language of my people.
I can't understand.
Po-kud-zee yo-atah.

A CHAH-mooz-ee.
CHAH-mooz-ee.
Swasge-muh kee-say.
Yo-pah no-kay-dah?
CHAH-mooz-ee.
Altitude 6,000 meters.
Warning.
Approach vector is too steep.
Discontinue landing sequence.
Would somebody turn that off, please?
Engineering, report.
We need that extra power, B'Elanna.
Ten minutes.
I just need ten minutes!
Do you understand my words now?
Yes.
Explain the face marking.
I wear it to honor my father.
He wore it to honor his ancestors.
Ancestors...
You are human?
Yes.
Are there others on your world with this mark?
Yes.
Not many, but some.
We were taught all of them had been annihilated.
We were taught your world had been ravaged by those with no respect for life or land.
There was a time when that was true.
But no longer.
He claims to be a descendent of the Inheritors.
Inheritors?
The ones...
our ancestors chose to honor.
I'm surprised you have no memory of the Inheritors.
One of our gifts was the memory.
If you are a descendent, you should remember.
I'm not sure I understand.
Perhaps it has been lost over time.
45,000 years ago, on our first visit to your world, we met a small group of nomadic hunters.
They had no spoken language, no culture, except the use of fire and stone weapons, but they did have a respect for the land and for other living creatures that impressed us deeply.
We decided to give them an inheritance... a genetic bonding... so they might thrive and protect your world.
On subsequent visits, we found that our genetic gift brought about a spirit of curiosity and adventure.
It impelled them to migrate away from the cold climate to a new, unpeopled land.
It took them almost a thousand generations to cross your planet.
Hundreds of thousands of them flourished in their new land.
Their civilization had a profound influence on others of your species.
But then new people came with weapons and disease.
The Inheritors who survived scattered.
Many sought refuge in other societies.
12 generations ago when we returned, we found no sign of their existence.
My people called you the Sky Spirits.
Why have you been hiding from us since we landed here?
When we heard your message, who you were, observed you probing our land, we believed you were a threat.
We thought you would annihilate us as you had the Inheritors.
Our message was supposed to communicate peaceful intentions.
We were taught that is the way human conquerors often introduce themselves.
As I said... we've tried to change our ways since the last time you stopped by.
Altitude: 2,000 meters.
Stand by, Bridge.
We're initiating the transfer now.
I'm showing an eight percent boost in the engines.
That's all?
The fusion reactors are nearly drained.
Fighting the storm is taking every reserve we have.
Altitude: 1,000 meters.
Impact in 20 seconds.
B'Elanna.
Impact in 15 seconds.
I'm sorry, Captain, that's all we've got.
Impact in ten seconds.
Report.
We're free.
Gaining altitude.
2,000 meters.
2,500.
Dampers back on line.
The storms have completely dissipated.
There's not a cloud in the sky.
Stand down Red Alert.
Anybody have an explanation?
It appears the inhabitants of this planet have decided to make contact, Captain.
The cloaking device has been turned off, and we are showing an alien population.
I have located the shuttle.
It may be possible to locate Commander Chakotay without landing.
Establish a search pattern, Mr. Paris.
Yes, Captain.
Begin scanning for human life signs.
As soon as you find Chakotay, we'll send down an away team.
My ship will be coming for me soon.
I'm sorry we cannot permit you to extract all the materials you need.
You were generous to offer as much as you did.
You have a long journey ahead.
It took us more than two generations to reach your world.
I wish I could see my father's face right now.
Does he still live?
No.
He died fighting enemies who would have taken our home colony.
Our tribe moved there a few hundred years ago.
So he honored the land just as... his ancestors did.
Yes.
Yes, he did.
We weren't on very good terms when he died.
Once he was gone, I didn't know how to reconcile our differences, how to heal our old wounds.
I returned to my colony, and continued the fight in his name.
I took the mark that he wore to honor his ancestors.
I spoke to him in my vision quests, but he never answered.
Until now.
CHAH-mooz-ee.
Commander.
Put those away.
Listen to him, Chakotay.
Do you hear what he says to you?
Yes, Father.
I hear him.
I finally hear him.
Four to beam up, Voyager.
- What are you doing here?
- Seeing a movie with Jimmy.
I think it's oddly coincidental that out of all the movies playing in all the movie theaters, we end up at the same one at the same time.
I think that it shows how we have the same tastes.
- I walked out.
- So did I. Jimmy loved it.
I walked out because the plot was just warmed-over Bambi without the political subtext.
You?
I fell asleep.
What difference does it make why I walked out?
Because I think it shows how we look at the same thing differently.
I think we're completely in sync.
Yeah.
We're so in sync that when you broke up with me for my own good you figured I'd probably know it was for the best because we're so in sync.
We're about as in sync as the English in a Japanese horror film.
Lois, I was wrong and I admitted it.
You can't stay mad.
Yes, I can.
You can fly, I can stay mad.
It's a gift.
Hi, Lois.
Michelle.
Clark, meet Michelle and Arnold Sitkowitz, my neighbors.
You make an adorable couple.
I hope you'll be as happy as Arnold and me.
Ten years and never a cross word.
- Well, it's getting late.
- Yeah.
See you tomorrow.
Nice meeting you.
Ten years.
Arnold and Michelle Sitkowitz.
Where did that come from?
Look, Arnold, a burning bush.
Do not be afraid.
You have been chosen.
Chosen for what?
- You do have an alibi for last night?
- Alibi?
Why do I need an alibi?
That lady.
With the cop.
Michelle Sitkowitz's sister, Louise.
She lives across town.
The Sitkowitzes were supposed to be there last night.
They play poker every Thursday.
Is there anything in this building you don't find out about?
No.
Anyway, Arnold and Michelle never made it.
Maybe they went someplace else last night.
Louise and Michelle are close.
Michelle would've called.
- Excuse me.
- Anyway, Louise got worried so she came over here last night, and the Sitkowitzes never came home.
What?
That's right.
Vanished.
That's so weird.
I just introduced them to Clark.
Happiest couple I have ever met besides you and Clark from time to time.
- I hope Louise doesn't mind me butting in.
- What can you do?
I'm a reporter.
I can make some noise about this.
People disappear in this city all the time and nobody seems to care.
I'm not gonna let that happen to Arnold and Michelle.
I've unpacked some brownies for now and I'm putting the rest in the freezer.
And my homemade applesauce is in the fridge.
Mom, every time you guys visit me, you bring me enough food for the winter.
Well, it's what we do, honey.
Care for our boy with his favorite food, good advice and unconditional support.
No big deal.
I wish the rest of the world worked that way.
I mean, a guy makes one, admittedly big, mistake and bam.
The door slams closed in his face and the Supreme Court isn't hearing any appeals.
Trouble with Lois?
Remember that great idea I had about breaking up with Lois because being close to me put her at risk?
Yeah, we were afraid that wouldn't sit too well.
I mean, don't you think she's making a mountain out of a molehill here?
Frankly, Clark, I have to go with Lois on this one.
- Dad?
- I have to go with your mother.
It's not supposed to work like this.
You guys are my parents.
Side with me.
We do take your side, in the big picture.
We want you to be happy, and Lois makes you happy.
Unless you make her unhappy and then she makes you unhappy and that makes us unhappy.
Son love and marriage are a partnership.
Both people are equal in that partnership.
Bottom line, they make their decisions together.
What are you saying, I should go crawling back on my hands and knees?
No, honey.
Fly back.
It's faster.
Chief, I really do wanna devote some time to the Sitkowitz disappearance.
So you said, Lois, and I'm sure your neighbors are lovely people...
- ...but it's not exactly hard news.
- I think it is.
Out of the 531 people missing last year do you realize that a large percentage of them are married couples?
You're reaching, Lois.
Oh, man, Larry Smiley.
Well, howdy, howdy, howdy.
- And welcome to all you...
- Larry Smiley?
Isn't he the guy that runs that place, the Institute of Love and Dependence?
Commitment.
Love and Commitment.
This man's a visionary.
Alice and I went on his retreat.
Sure opened our eyes.
...basic steps that I learned at the knee of my beloved mama who made her marriage a true romance.
Sit back and listen to my guests, and they'll tell you the straight poop.
Michelle and Arnold, howdy.
That's them.
That's Michelle and Arnold.
Well, she told me she taped something last month, I had no idea it was this.
I was hoping that you might share with us how my principles on equal.
Opportunity lovingness have affected your life.
Well, Larry, Arnold and I always thought we had the perfect marriage.
Ten years and never a cross word.
But thanks to your lessons of sharing and unity, we are unified in our sharing.
- Sounds like they really believe in this guy.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
You know, without Larry, my marriage would've been a shutout.
As it is, we're heading into extra innings.
Morning, Chief.
Lois.
- Listen, I can come back.
- No, no, no.
Just a minute.
I've been meaning to talk to you two.
Now, I can't help but notice the chill going on between you two.
If you need a friendly ear to bend, I'm it.
But just don't let whatever it is hurt your work.
- Okay?
- Chief, I think Clark and I are both professional enough to behave...
- ...professionally.
- Good, because partners need to know...
- ...they can count on each other.
- Superman!
Help!
Cover for each other.
Gee, would you look at the time.
I gotta go get...
Chunko chocolate monster chip ice cream.
Go, before they sell out.
You know, that boy will walk on water for you.
Or he'd drown trying.
Here you go.
- Hi.
Where you off to?
- The interview.
- What interview?
- Didn't I tell you?
You're hardly speaking to me.
This is one of those things you hardly spoke about.
I wanna talk to the friends and family of the missing couples see if we can find any common links.
I'm due at Emerson's Cafe at noon.
Lois, I'm kind of busy.
Excuse me.
- Isn't he something?
- Yeah.
Thanks to him, the sisters and I will still be able to bring our toy collection to the orphanage.
Superman is a national treasure.
You know, it's just wonderful being angry at a national treasure.
Lois, I can't help it.
People like me.
I help them.
- You used to like me.
- I still like you.
I'm just upset.
Even though it's your fault, I feel like it's mine.
Good old Clark, good old Superman, crabby old Lois.
And even if I could tell someone, which I can't they'd still think you were the good guy and I was the bad.
Can you hang on?
Sisters, look!
He's saving the toys from being scorched.
Of course.
Bless you.
I'm sorry, you were saying?
Nothing.
I'm gonna be a professional and go to the interview and internalize my feelings so I get an ulcer the size of Cleveland.
Women.
Earth women.
I guess you didn't have any trouble parking.
- Mr. Hansen...
- Lois Lane.
Good to meet you.
Mr. Hansen here says that his brother and sister-in-law vanished last month.
They were struggling artists, married a year.
They moved here from Dayton.
So they had nothing in common with the Sitkowitzes.
They didn't by chance have a wonderful, seemingly perfect marriage, did they?
- No, not at all.
- It was worth a shot.
In fact, until two months ago Inga spoke of divorce and moving back to Dayton.
What changed her mind?
- A place called the Larry Smiley Institute.
- For Love and Commitment?
- They went there?
- They said that this Smiley fellow restored their relationship.
He rebuilt their trust in each other and promised them a hopeful future.
And then they disappeared.
What is this?
What do you want with us?
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
Michelle!
Hi.
Come see these.
Got hold of a group photo of the Sitkowitzes at the Institute and the Hansens with their group.
I had the computer narrow missing persons for the past two years down to missing married couples.
If we cross-reference the names on these pictures with missing couples maybe we can find some matches.
Is this the kind of conversation we're gonna have from now on?
- I'll go cross-reference these.
- Lois.
Here.
Four matches.
From these two photos, four couples have vanished in the past two years.
Who knows how many have disappeared from the Institute.
- I mean, Perry, you might even be at risk.
- Come on, now, Lois.
If there was something sinister, you don't think a news hound like myself...
- ...wouldn't sense it?
- Maybe it's really well hidden, Chief.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Possibly.
Anyway, if you wanted to nose around, it would have to be kind of an undercover, sniff-it-out type of thing.
- That's not what I was getting at.
- You know, as a matter of fact I could make arrangements for you to go on retreat as a married couple.
Oh no.
No, no.
That's just not a good idea.
- Not at this time, Chief.
- Why?
Surely not for personal reasons.
Because you both said nothing would stand in the way of your professionalism.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Just don't think it's a good idea.
Okay.
Well, your sentiments are duly noted.
Don't you guys think you should get out of here and pack?
Each of our guests goes by the name of an animal species symbolic of the primal urge to mate and further the species.
Larry wants two of every kind.
You guys will be known as the Hawks.
They mate for life.
- What were the Sitkowitzes called?
- The Badgers.
Here we are.
I'll just jot your name here on the doorway and we'll be on our way.
- Nope.
- What?
We don't like this cabin.
We don't?
Honey, it faces east.
The winds are from the south.
You know how you get.
Yes.
I get ugly.
Really ugly.
Okay.
This way.
Sir, I'm running out of cabins.
Perhaps this one will do.
Yes.
This will be just fine.
Won't it, pumpkin?
Yep.
Fine.
Fine.
Enjoy your stay.
Hope things work out.
Okay, what was that all about?
You said the Sitkowitzes were the Badgers, right?
Well...
- This was their cabin?
- I thought it might be useful.
- Lois, your dress.
- That's okay.
I'll change.
So this is where they slept.
Arnold probably sat right in that chair, happy he came here.
Michelle probably sat at this desk scared of something, writing her sister.
Boy, this wood is so soft.
You can see years of imprints of writing.
Hey, Clark.
Do you think that you could lift out Michelle's handwriting from the others?
You know, using your vision gizmo?
Lois, "vision gizmo doesn't sound particularly cool, you know.
Yeah.
- Got it.
This is where she wrote it.
- Anything else?
She said in the letter Smiley scared her.
There's one other thing.
"Kathy, 4:30, meditation tree."
Who's Kathy?
Male and Female Hawk?
Your bags.
- Good, I gotta change.
Thanks.
- Larry Smiley's waiting.
- The first session's starting now.
- Wait a minute.
Where's my suitcase?
Where's my suitcase?
Harmonicity.
Well, you can put away your Funk Wagnalls, folks.
That ain't English.
It's what I call a Larryism.
Harmonicity is a blend, if you will, of complementary desires.
And as my dear mama would say, that's exactly what Mother Nature intended for marriage to be.
Now, how about it, folks?
We got harmonicity?
Yeah.
Heck, then, let's all take hands.
Smile on yourselves.
Mama, I can feel it.
I feel the harmony.
I feel the love.
It's not like I did it on purpose.
- My bag was there, right on the stoop.
- I thought you put it in the car.
You know, maybe subconsciously you have some need to...
- Hi.
- Male and Female Hawk.
And not a moment too soon.
No, no, no, stay standing.
Let's get right to work.
You know, around here we speak bluntspeak.
And that is a what?
- Larryism.
- Right you are, Female Lemur.
And bluntly speaking, you two have got to stop dressing alike.
Look at yourself, honey.
Do you hate your feminine side?
- What?
No.
- No, she's very feminine.
Now, see, this is what I call the "echo pattern."
She says something, you just gotta chime in.
That the way it works?
- No.
- Of course not.
Son, don't allow this.
You gotta sing your own song.
It takes two tones for...
Harmonicity.
Harmonicity.
Please be seated.
Let's all close our eyes and go to that safe place where we find our own pure tone.
It's a really great group this week.
They're really catching on.
- It's Kathy.
- Larry.
Larry, Female Hawk is whispering.
Female Hawk, you are riding on a horse called domination and you won't get off.
Does she need a time-out?
Yes!
Step outside, Female Hawk.
Don't you return until you're singing with the choir.
Really?
Do I have to?
Shucks.
You know something?
You got a tiger by the tail there, boy.
Tell me about it.
Kathy?
- Hi, Female Hawk.
- Hi.
We're having a great time.
Some friends of ours recommended it.
Arnold and Michelle Sitkowitz.
Wonderful people.
- Ever get a chance to talk to them?
- No, never.
I don't know them.
Are you sure?
Because I thought they mentioned you.
No, I don't know them.
Fire.
Symbol of light where there was darkness.
Warmth where there was cold.
And most assuredly, purification of the impure.
You hear that, Kathy?
Betraying my trust would be an awfully impure thing to do.
- Larry, I'd never betray your trust.
- Wouldn't you, honey?
You real sure about that?
You mess with fire, you're gonna get burned.
Hear that?
The phone.
Hello.
Yes, sir, boss.
Smiley here.
You don't say.
I know you're busy, sir.
Yeah, say hi to everyone for me.
And bless you too, sir.
Yep.
Yep, that was God, everybody.
And God has news.
Seems everybody in heaven is talking about us.
Everybody in heaven is saying that them Smiley people are gonna be the rulers of the New Dawn.
That's what I promised you, isn't it?
Yes.
A place by my side in a better world.
Boys and girls, a new day is at hand.
The countdown has begun.
Darling, did you hear?
We're almost there.
The New Dawn.
Meet you for bacon and eggs.
Jimmy, if the photos don't come, tell them to lock down the front page and roll them.
Oh, brother, where is she?
- I thought you hated the symphony.
- I do, Jimmy.
That's why I'm standing here in a monkey suit waiting for my wife, who loves the symphony.
And with whom I am on very thin ice.
So I can plunk down a thousand smackers for bad seats on charity opening night.
Now, son, when you get married, this will all make perfect sense.
Right.
- Hi, dumpling.
- Hello, Mrs. White.
- Chief, I'm gonna stay till we roll.
- Okay, bud.
Thank you.
Judas priest.
What the sam hill's going on here?
Alice?
Jimmy!
Scared to death.
I just mentioned the Sitkowitz name, Kathy turned white as a ghost.
Well, I scanned the whole area.
There's no sight or sound of them.
So either they're not here or they're in a lead-lined room.
Or they're dead.
- This is not a bed.
- No, this is a bed.
- Actually, it's a very large bed.
- This is business.
Yeah.
You think I can't handle this?
I can.
I can handle this just fine.
Your life is so strange.
And getting stranger by the minute.
Lois, flying for me is a piece of cake.
I've been doing it since high school.
What happens if I screw up?
Lose a little altitude?
But being in a relationship it's completely new.
If I blow this I lose everything.
Clark, I'm not actually as good at romance as I look.
Really?
I mean, my life's basically been about work.
I'm just trying to figure this out like you are.
So we'll help each other.
- I don't always respond appropriately.
- Neither do I.
And I don't always know how to express how I feel.
And I get tongue-tied sometimes.
But I do know you broke my heart.
And you just have to let me work that out.
You can't expect me to just snap out of it.
I will.
And I don't.
- Good night, Lois.
- Good night, Clark.
What are you doing?
- Can you please get off of me.
- I would if you'd just hold still.
Hey, pal, been there.
- It was an accident.
- Falling from floating?
- That's not possible.
- I guess you're better at it than I am?
All right.
All right.
I got scared.
Let's just calm down.
It's okay.
It's just a rock.
You know, I sleep like a baby in Metropolis.
What is so relaxing about the stupid mountains?
It says, "Meet me at the meditation tree tomorrow at midnight."
Signed, "Guess Who."
If this is some pathetic bid for notoriety, let me just tell you something right now.
The Daily Planet does not deal with kidnappers.
Greetings, Male Wombat.
Things okay with you and Female Wombat?
Yeah.
Sure.
Larry where's Alice?
Is this some kind of a spot progress check or something?
Because let me tell you, you've taken years off my life here.
You'll gain them all back in the New Dawn.
- The new what?
- It's where we're all going.
All the most promising graduates of the Larry Smiley Institute for Love and Commitment.
I got me two of every kind.
Farmers, doctors, lawyers and you.
Why, you of all people should see where I'm heading.
Yeah.
A little quiet room with rubber on the walls.
- Don't rile me, I'll leave you to drown.
- Drown?
Didn't I mention?
I'm flooding the earth.
Well.
Okay.
I'll just grab Alice and be on my way.
Thanks, man.
I appreciate...
God has made it real clear what I gotta do.
Start over.
Get rid of everyone except for the chosen, of course.
Larry, Larry, stay with me, now.
You can't flood the earth.
It's not possible, Larry.
One of the advantages of healing the famous and the accomplished is that the little devils are capable of building the doggonest contraptions.
Behold, the Aquaplus 1000 storm maker.
Neat?
Damn it, man.
Where's Alice?
I wanna see her, please.
Oh, my gosh.
What have you done to her, man?
Suspended animation.
Her life signs are hovering just above death.
But, like all the others, she'll be revived as soon as the waters recede and the New Dawn breaks.
Clark?
My, you're really racking up the frequent-flier miles.
- That was sweet.
- I know.
Group time.
Ready?
Superman.
Female Hawk, you know Superman?
Well, yeah, kind of.
We have the same dentist.
Clark?
Clark?
You gonna be out of the shower soon?
Superman's leaving.
You know what would be so great?
Superman could join our session.
- Superman's here?
- So many people here could benefit from your fairness and wisdom.
- I have to get going.
I'm very late.
- He's gotta get going.
Isn't your job to help people in need?
I just want Brian to make me feel validated, is all.
You want validation, go to a parking lot.
This is the same argument we've been having for weeks.
I take a job for more money and better benefits and she complains because we didn't discuss it.
The job is in Tibet.
All I am saying is we should've talked this through.
- I hear you there.
- Female Hawk, must you?
Sorry.
- She is a challenge.
- Okay, so maybe I was rash.
I said I was sorry.
I only had our best interest at heart.
It's none of my business.
Sorry.
Superman, what do you think?
Well, I'm no expert.
But if you really care about someone and they make a mistake because they're only human, after all, then they sincerely apologize I think you forgive them.
A mistake's one thing, but this is a whole attitude.
Just because somebody says "I love you it doesn't put them in charge of your whole life.
True.
But saying "I love you" does mean that I would never hurt you on purpose.
And maybe I'll make more mistakes along the way, just as you will.
But we'll learn from them and move on.
Hear, hear.
Son, you pack a lot of horse sense in them tight britches.
Thank you.
I really do have to go.
You guys keep up the good work.
- Finally got the poison oak under control.
- You missed it.
He was wonderful.
What did you think?
I thought he made some interesting points.
You know, I don't think this group-therapy stuff is so bad.
I thought the wild applause was a bit excessive.
And you're convinced this note's from Kathy?
Yeah.
I think she wanted to tell us what she never got to tell Michelle Sitkowitz.
Unless it's a hoax.
Or a trap.
Maybe she just got cold feet.
Oh, boy.
Lois, it's Kathy.
She's dead.
Well, I always knew that little girl had troubles.
Many's the time when her tears washed down my shoulders.
But suicide?
Who would've ever thought it?
It's ancient.
Torn from a book.
I can read a lot of languages, but...
It looks kind of like Hebrew, but I can't make it out.
She must've had some reason for wanting us to see it.
Which one of these books you think it came from?
None of them.
They're all too new.
There might be something in that next room.
What next room?
Smiley must work in here.
There are files divided into piles marked "accepted" and "rejected" candidates.
Candidates for what?
Clark, we're in the "rejected" pile.
Lois, don't you think that's probably a good thing?
Well, I'd like to feel wanted.
Smiley says we're not compatible.
He says I don't trust or respect you and he doesn't know why you even put up with me.
- Lois, the guy's a murderer.
- Of course I trust you.
And I respect you more than anyone else I've ever met.
And, you know, if I do get angry, it's only because I've never opened up to somebody so much in my whole life, and it hurts me when I feel like that trust isn't returned.
And you put up with me for the same reason I put up with you.
It's because I'm completely in love with you.
And I love you.
- Did we just make up?
- I think so.
Could we maybe do this someplace that's not so musty and not owned by a killer?
I think I just found the book that this page came from.
There.
It's a perfect fit.
But probably a dead language.
We're gonna need an expert to read this.
Well, we won't be able to find an expert at 2:00 in the morning.
Star.
You could take it to Star.
Star?
Anything?
Lois says you can call up voices from the past, get them to speak through you.
Clark, honey.
I know you're real stressed and you want this to work.
But you gotta do me a itty-bitty favor.
- Sure, anything.
What?
- Shut up.
Come on, Clark.
Where are you?
Well, come in.
Why are you so late?
Jimmy.
I tried calling, but you're not allowed calls.
I climbed the fence.
What's wrong?
What are you doing?
It's the Chief.
The last time I saw him, he went to a concert with Alice.
They never made it home, and he didn't come to work.
Oh, God.
I bet it was Smiley.
Okay, folks.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Your arm's too short to box with God.
We're on a schedule here.
One more box and let's go.
Smiley and those people are abandoning camp.
Over here, guys.
Over here.
Let's get that stuff unloaded.
All right, folks.
Let's show some hustle.
The game is on.
Well, folks, this is it.
Liftoff.
T minus zero.
Anchors aweigh.
We only await the sign.
I hate waiting for the phone to ring, don't you?
There it is.
Hello.
Yep, it's him.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
All systems are go, sir.
Well, thank you, and Vaya con Dios to you too, sir.
It's gonna be a heck of a storm, boys and girls.
Forty days and 40 nights.
The flood will wipe out all mankind but for that which floats with us in the ark.
- Man, that's just like Waterworld.
- Only cheaper.
Darling, we're about to be joined together once more.
Hello, Mama.
Boy, this guy's got real problems.
I am the citizen Landicus, philosopher and prophet.
Who seeketh me?
I do.
Seeker, eager for an exchange of thought and prophesy?
Well, actually, no, citizen Landicus.
I wanted to know if you could read this piece of paper.
Lois.
All right, look lively, folks.
Let's load them up.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
Here's a candidate who didn't make the cut.
Female Hawk, I distinctly recall eliminating you from the New Dawn.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
I'm definitely not worthy.
Jimmy, let's just go.
I can see we're gonna have to do a whole lot better job of eliminating.
The language is ancient.
Aramaic.
It is a passage from what you call the Dead Sea Scrolls.
"The end of all flesh is come before me and the earth is filled with violence through them, and behold I will destroy them from the earth.
They entered the Ark, male and female, and the Lord shut them in...
- This is the story of Noah and his Ark?
- Verily.
Smiley's nabbing couples.
He said he wants two of every kind.
Oh, man, Smiley thinks he's Noah.
This storm is the daddy of them all, folks.
I sure wouldn't wanna be anywhere near a lightning rod.
But then, that's just me.
- You don't think he can flood the earth?
- No, Jimmy.
It's this turning-us-into-toast thing that's got me worried.
All right.
Well, since this is it, I'm gonna confess that...
Well, I used to have a little crush on you.
In fact, I had this dream... and then you took my hand and said, "Jimmy, I can make a man of you."
Thanks.
Lois, panic makes a man say some strange things sometimes and I was wondering if you could sort of forget what I...
Trust me.
All right, Smiley.
Shut it off.
You can't stop this.
This day has been foretold.
Only by you, Smiley.
And that's not enough.
No!
Just brilliant.
Now you've ruined everything.
That machine was the source of all power in the New Dawn.
It was supposed to bring them back.
Now they'll all die.
- Michelle.
- Arnold.
- Olsen.
Late edition?
Get put to bed?
- Yeah, Chief, it did.
Alice?
Alice, are you all right, honey?
Mama.
Please forgive me.
Oh, Mama.
Lawrence, you have been a very naughty boy.
Smiley had given up on people finding happiness together.
I haven't.
Have you?
No.
But we keep messing up.
Why is that?
Well, first of all, people mess up.
And I think adjusting to the whole idea of marriage, along with everything else we've been going through, is just making us both a little nuts.
- So?
- So maybe we should just take a little break from the whole idea of marriage.
Not even say the M word.
And just be in love.
I can do that.
It's a lot of pressure, this "forever" thing.
It's not the M word that makes it forever for me, Lois.
My love is forever because...
Because it just is.
Allow me.
You're welcome.
When did everyone become so boorish?
Sometimes, I think I'm the only person with any sense of refinement.
Oh, smell my hands.
Thank you, no.
I'm so proud.
I had to stop for gas, and I pumped it myself.
- It's part of a new kick I'm on.
- What?
I'm learning to be handy.
I depend too much on others, so I'm doing it myself.
Feel that.
Surely the start of a first-rate callus.
- You left this in your booth.
- Thank you.
- What is it?
- A tape I rented for Dad.
It's our new Wednesday ritual.
Dad makes chilli, we watch an Angie Dickinson movie and I wish I was dead.
- You should join us.
- No, I got my first work shirt today and tonight, I'm tackling the squeaky hasp on my cigar humidor.
Be sure to wear your hernia belt.
Roz, will you join us?
No, I'll just go sit over here.
Are you trying to avoid me?
Yes.
You took a year to learn my name.
- You always make snide remarks.
- Name one.
You told me my bedroom was easier to get into than a community college.
I was hoping you'd name that one.
I've got half a mind to...
Just hold on!
You got off on the wrong foot.
If you two had a real conversation, you'd hit it off famously.
You sit and I will go and get your coffee.
So, how are you?
- Fine.
You?
- Great.
I'm handy now.
So...that's a nice jacket.
- Thank you.
- It's offbeat.
What does that mean? "Offbeat"?
- Well...
- I know.
Offbeat as in cheap.
I'm not rich enough to shop at the International House of Tight Ass like you and Maris the Heiress.
- That is what you meant, right?
- Yes, but I didn't think you'd get it.
- Then you were insulting me.
- You got in some good shots, too.
I did, didn't I?
I'm so glad we did this!
Sometimes I'm such a good therapist, I scare myself.
- Where's my briefcase?
- Isn't it under your chair?
Someone must have taken it!
Frasier, look, there it is!
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
- Is that your briefcase?
- Yes.
- Where did you get it?
- Some nuns in my parish gave it to me.
Then that would make you a priest.
Yes.
Then, Father, perhaps you'd like to explain why you'd be carrying around a Bible and some rosary beads!
- What are you looking for?
- A movie.
I loaned it to the monsignor to give to you.
Apparently he forgot.
It's a two-day rental.
It doesn't matter.
Sorry.
It looked like yours.
They have the same inferior leather.
- I gave him that briefcase.
- I know.
Yes, I would mind holding.
I've already held three times.
I'm trying to report stolen credit cards but every five seconds...
Damn it!
Don't stare at me.
I'm a humane man, but right now, I could kick a kitten through an electric fan.
Hey, Frase.
Niles called.
Somebody stole your briefcase?
Go ahead, tell me how stupid I was to get taken advantage of.
Better than listening to "Jumping Jack Flash" for piano and flute.
You weren't stupid.
These guys are pros.
They need a second, and bam!
That's rather refreshing.
I thought you'd call me a naive dupe or...
- A bone-headed rube?
- But you're not.
No.
You learned a lesson.
You gotta keep your guard up.
This world would be a happier place if everybody remembered people stink.
That's a little cynical for me.
I prefer to think of people as basically good.
Yes, I am here, but I'm in the middle of a speech so you'll have to hold!
I enjoy my life that way.
If the price I have to pay is to replace a few credit cards, so be it.
Reminds me of when I moved to London.
I didn't trust people back then.
I tried to stay out of harm's way by walking with my eyes cast down, never meeting anyone's glance.
But I decided that was no way to live.
So one day, I lifted up my chin and took it all in.
The change was amazing.
There were sights I'd never seen, sounds I'd never heard.
A tiny old man came up to me with a note in his hand.
He needed help.
This was no city full of thieves and muggers.
People needed me.
I took his note, read it, and I still remember what I said to him:
"That's not how you spell fellatio."
So, whose point did she prove?
I have no idea.
It's been fun chatting with you all, nasty old Gertrude aside.
I'd like to close with a personal message.
This goes out to the person who stole my briefcase yesterday.
And also stole my dry cleaning with the claim ticket that was inside it.
You need help, and I am here to provide it.
Also, the double-breasted navy blue suit should be worn with French cuffs.
You may be sick, but you should be stylish.
Until tomorrow, this is Dr Frasier Crane.
Man, that was a great show!
It was better than great!
It was brilliant!
You...
What do you want?
- Remember I said I need Friday off?
- No.
You don't remember or I can't have Friday off?
Take one of each.
I'm feeling generous.
(Phone rings)
- Hello.
- (Man) 'Dr Crane?
'
- Yes.
- 'Oh, man!
I can't believe I got through!
'
My show is over.
Please call in again tomorrow.
- 'I'm calling cos I found your briefcase.'
- Are you sure?
- 'Pretty sure.'
- We can check.
In the upper right-hand corner, there's a water mark left by the careless resting of a champagne flute.
- 'It's full of your stuff, Dr Crane.'
- That works as well.
- Is everything still there?
- 'A pen, a set of car keys, a date book.'
- And my wallet?
- 'Sorry.'
That was asking for too much.
How can I get it back?
'I could drop it off.'
Meet me at the Café Nervosa on Pike.
I'd be glad to give you a reward.
'Meeting you is reward enough.
Half an hour?
'
That's perfect.
Bye.
- That was great.
- But not surprising.
- I told you to have faith in people.
- Yes.
People are good.
And fair.
We do nice things for people because of karma.
- You're not getting Friday off.
- Why?
Allow me.
Can you believe that?
That's the second time this week!
- I want to say something.
- Why don't you?
Something happens when I talk to a beautiful woman.
My knees turn to jelly.
You can only break people of bad habits by confronting them.
- That's true.
- So?
- Who's next here?
- I am.
No, you weren't next.
I am!
People like you who glide through life in a cosy cocoon of narcissism never notice such things!
But learn this lesson, sister!
There's still such a thing as good manners.
That's why I insist you let me buy you your coffee and please try the poppy seed muffins.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Kind of brutal, weren't you?
I just remember "l was next" and the sound of blood in my ears.
Soon you'll be home with Maris and you'll forget about beautiful women.
- Let's sit here so we can see him.
- Your Good Samaritan?
Yes.
I'm feeling rather good about this whole thing.
I lost my wallet and my favourite suit but other things were intact:
my date book, my spare car keys, my fountain pen.
But best of all, what remained intact is my sense that people are basically trustworthy.
He has your keys.
He's meeting you here knowing you'd bring your car?
Before you launch into a paranoid riff, my car is... moving down the street!
Stop that well-dressed man!
Charlie, it's Frasier's car.
Could you put some extra manpower on this?
Yeah.
I know.
Fell for that old scam.
I told him to keep his guard up, but Frasier always knows better.
Mr Up-With-People.
Yeah.
Remember what we used to call guys like him on the force?
Hey, we're still talking about my son here!
Yeah.
I'll talk to you.
- Hi, Frasier.
How's it going?
- Terribly!
Guess what happened today.
- What?
- My car was stolen!
You're kidding.
I fell victim to a master criminal.
Did they hot-wire it?
Boy, those guys got fingers like concert pianists.
No.
He had the key.
A real pro.
Made a wax impression and then had a duplicate key made?
No.
It was the same miscreant that stole my briefcase.
He used the spare set that was inside.
He tailed you so he'd know where to find the car?
Not exactly.
He called the station and we agreed to meet.
- What for?
- Low-fat lattes and biscotti.
What are you, the town crier?
It doesn't shake my belief in the basic goodness of people.
Sure.
He's probably using your car to deliver hot meals to shut-ins.
I'm glad my misfortune's given you so much glee.
Dad, I have two requests.
First, wipe that smirk off your face.
I'm not a child.
What's the second request?
Can I borrow your car?
I want to go to the movies.
And last stop on our tour, my booth, where all the magic happens.
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Dr Crane needed a lift so I came up.
Just go on about your business.
It's not like I'm listening.
Have we had one visitor yet who didn't do that?
Thanks but we do have a show to do.
- People say I have a talent for this.
- Yes, of course.
Your soothing voice.
I could listen to you for hours.
- Do you really think so?
- Yes.
Absolutely.
Now get out.
(Phone rings)
- Could you get that?
- Hello?
Who's calling, please?
Just a second.
Denise.
She was out with you last night.
- I wasn't out with anyone of that name.
- Ooh, speakerphone!
All right.
Hello.
This is Frasier Crane.
(Denise) 'Hey, tiger.
I miss you already.'
I beg your pardon?
'You just snuck out this morning without giving me your number, 'and I woke up to see your BMW pulling down my driveway.'
You did?
'I'm not mad.
How can I be after my best first night ever with a man?
'
Denise, could you hold on for a moment?
- Do you realise what this means?
- He told her he was you!
And it worked!
Nobody ever sleeps with me on a first date!
Hi.
'Sorry but I won't be able to meet you for that drink at Alberto's.
'The agency called.
They booked me for a swimsuit layout.
'There's my cab.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Kisses.'
Unbelievable!
He wasn't content to steal my possessions.
He wants my identity!
- I'm calling the police.
- No!
I am going to Alberto's!
- You have a show!
- Run "The Best of Dr Crane".
This jackal will meet me, not Denise!
- He could be dangerous!
- I don't care!
He's after my soul!
Shakespeare wrote, "He who steals my purse, steals trash.
But he who..."
Oh, I forget the rest, but it makes me good and mad!
Have you seen a man wearing an impeccably tailored Italian suit?
- Just you.
- Oh, well.
Thank you.
- Giorgio Armani.
- It's nice to meet you, Giorgio.
- My name's Heather.
- Frasier Crane.
Do you mind?
Wait a minute.
Dr Frasier Crane, from the radio?
- Yes.
- I've heard your show.
You're great.
- Thank you.
- This is exciting!
Didn't you say that someone had impersonated you at the dry cleaners?
- Yes, someone did.
- You could be the impersonator.
If you're looking for identification, I...
- I thought so.
- He stole my wallet.
- Who did?
- Frasier did.
The bad Frasier!
You're pretty sick, you know that?
This is absurd!
Can't you recognise my...?
Nice suit.
- Oh, my God!
It's you!
- No!
You're mine now!
All right.
I give up.
Damn it!
How did you find me?
Denise called to cancel your rendezvous.
- Great.
And I put on my best suit.
- No, you put on my best suit.
Well, I guess this is it.
Party's over.
I'm so stupid!
You want to call the police?
No.
I'd like to throttle you till your eyes shoot across the room like champagne corks!
But this is still a civilised world, though not for long if you have your way!
Every wallet you steal puts bars on someone else's windows.
Every purse you snatch puts mace on another key chain!
You make our lives less liveable and I hope that burns on your conscience!
What do you have to say for yourself?
You're right.
I see.
You think by agreeing with me, I'll let you off the hook.
No, you're right.
I'm guilty and I deserve what I get.
Your keys.
The car's out front with your briefcase in it.
Call the police.
That's your new car phone, by the way.
I upgraded.
I knew things would turn out like this.
Here comes the old sob story.
"My parents didn't love me, the bully next door stole my baseball glove."
No.
Dad loved me.
Mom spoiled me and I was the bully next door.
- Let me do that.
It's kind of tricky.
- Thank you.
I myself am to blame for my problems.
Hi.
The number for the Seattle PD, please.
I take the easy way out of everything.
And you know why?
I'm lazy.
Lazy, lazy, lazy.
Oh, sweetheart, could you just connect me?
Thanks, hon.
Your life of crime is down to your laziness?
I don't like to work.
It's easier to take something than to work.
I'm a lazy criminal.
A briefcase here, car keys there, light shoplifting.
But a bank robbery?
All that planning!
Split-second timing.
Forget it!
And that second-storey stuff - grappling hooks!
Who does that?
Yeah.
Thank you.
You're on hold.
Story of my week.
- You seem to be taking this well.
- It was bound to happen.
Perhaps you wanted to get caught.
Think about it.
You've taken ever-greater risks.
That's a man who wants to get caught.
I'm telling you.
Lazy!
Your pants.
You'd think I'd have them hemmed?
Staples.
Oh, dear God!
I still say that you really wanted to get caught.
- It's a classic cri de cœur.
- Cri de what?
It means you don't like the life that you're living.
It's not a great life.
I don't know where my rent's coming from, I have no solid relationship.
- Why don't you change?
- Gimme an 'L'.
Gimme an 'A'...
As a psychiatrist, I don't buy that.
You're not lazy.
You are afraid.
There are lots of things you could do legitimately.
You're afraid to try one of them and fail at it.
- You think I can change?
- Yes.
I believe in the basic goodness of people.
Hello.
Yes.
Just a moment, please.
Start now.
Take responsibility for yourself.
For once, don't take the easy way out.
Hello?
Yeah, I'd like to report a crime.
He's been impersonating Frasier Crane!
- Let's go.
- What?
I am Frasier Crane.
- Do you have any ID?
- No, but it's true.
Tell them.
Thank God you're here.
I've detained him.
- What?
!
- But he's lying!
He's the impostor!
Don't you recognise me?
This is madness!
People of the world, listen to me!
Trust no one, especially that lazy bastard!
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling tossed salads and scrambled eggs
# Oh, my!
# And maybe I seem a bit confused Well, maybe...but I got you pegged!
# But I don't know what to do with those tossed salads and scrambled eggs
# They're calling again #
Good night, Seattle, we love you!
Allow me.
You're welcome.
When did everyone become so boorish?
Sometimes, I think I'm the only person with any sense of refinement.
Oh, smell my hands.
Thank you, no.
I'm so proud. I had to stop for gas, and I pumped it myself.
- lt's part of a new kick I'm on.
- What?
I'm learning to be handy.
I depend too much on others, so I'm doing it myself.
Feel that.
Surely the start of a first-rate callus.
- You left this in your booth.
- Thank you.
- What is it?
- A tape I rented for Dad.
It's our new Wednesday ritual.
Dad makes chilli, we watch an Angie Dickinson movie and I wish I was dead.
- You should join us.
- No, I got my first work shirt today and tonight, I'm tackling the squeaky hasp on my cigar humidor.
Be sure to wear your hernia belt.
Roz, will you join us?
No, I'll just go sit over here.
Are you trying to avoid me?
Yes.
You took a year to learn my name.
- You always make snide remarks.
- Name one.
You told me my bedroom was easier to get into than a community college.
I was hoping you'd name that one.
I've got half a mind to...
Just hold on!
You got off on the wrong foot.
If you two had a real conversation, you'd hit it off famously.
You sit and I will go and get your coffee.
So, how are you?
- Fine.
You?
- Great.
I'm handy now.
So...that's a nice jacket.
- Thank you.
- lt's offbeat.
What does that mean? "Offbeat"?
- Well...
- l know.
Offbeat as in cheap.
I'm not rich enough to shop at the lnternational House of Tight Ass like you and Maris the Heiress.
- That is what you meant, right?
- Yes, but I didn't think you'd get it.
- Then you were insulting me.
- You got in some good shots, too.
I did, didn't I?
I'm so glad we did this!
Sometimes I'm such a good therapist, I scare myself.
- Where's my briefcase?
- lsn't it under your chair?
Someone must have taken it!
Frasier, look, there it is!
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
- ls that your briefcase?
- Yes.
- Where did you get it?
- Some nuns in my parish gave it to me.
Then that would make you a priest.
Yes.
Then, Father, perhaps you'd like to explain why you'd be carrying around a Bible and some rosary beads!
- What are you looking for?
- A movie.
I loaned it to the monsignor to give to you.
Apparently he forgot.
It's a two-day rental. lt doesn't matter.
Sorry. lt looked like yours.
They have the same inferior leather.
- l gave him that briefcase.
- l know.
Yes, I would mind holding.
I've already held three times.
I'm trying to report stolen credit cards but every five seconds...
Damn it!
Don't stare at me. I'm a humane man, but right now, I could kick a kitten through an electric fan.
Hey, Frase.
Niles called.
Somebody stole your briefcase?
Go ahead, tell me how stupid l was to get taken advantage of.
Better than listening to "Jumping Jack Flash" for piano and flute.
You weren't stupid.
These guys are pros.
They need a second, and bam!
That's rather refreshing.
I thought you'd call me a naive dupe or...
- A bone-headed rube?
- But you're not.
No.
You learned a lesson.
You gotta keep your guard up.
This world would be a happier place if everybody remembered people stink.
That's a little cynical for me. I prefer to think of people as basically good.
Yes, I am here, but I'm in the middle of a speech so you'll have to hold!
I enjoy my life that way.
If the price I have to pay is to replace a few credit cards, so be it.
Reminds me of when I moved to London. I didn't trust people back then.
I tried to stay out of harm's way by walking with my eyes cast down, never meeting anyone's glance.
But I decided that was no way to live.
So one day, I lifted up my chin and took it all in.
The change was amazing.
There were sights I'd never seen, sounds I'd never heard.
A tiny old man came up to me with a note in his hand.
He needed help.
This was no city full of thieves and muggers.
People needed me.
I took his note, read it, and I still remember what I said to him:
"That's not how you spell fellatio."
So, whose point did she prove?
I have no idea.
It's been fun chatting with you all, nasty old Gertrude aside.
I'd like to close with a personal message.
This goes out to the person who stole my briefcase yesterday.
And also stole my dry cleaning with the claim ticket that was inside it.
You need help, and I am here to provide it.
Also, the double-breasted navy blue suit should be worn with French cuffs.
You may be sick, but you should be stylish.
Until tomorrow, this is Dr Frasier Crane.
Man, that was a great show!
It was better than great!
It was brilliant!
You...
What do you want?
- Remember I said I need Friday off?
- No.
You don't remember or I can't have Friday off?
Take one of each. I'm feeling generous.
(Phone rings)
- Hello.
- (Man) 'Dr Crane?
'
- Yes.
- 'Oh, man!
I can't believe I got through!
'
My show is over.
Please call in again tomorrow.
- 'l'm calling cos l found your briefcase. '
- Are you sure?
- 'Pretty sure.'
- We can check.
In the upper right-hand corner, there's a water mark left by the careless resting of a champagne flute.
- 'lt's full of your stuff, Dr Crane. '
- That works as well.
- ls everything still there?
- 'A pen, a set of car keys, a date book. '
- And my wallet?
- 'Sorry.'
That was asking for too much.
How can I get it back?
'l could drop it off.'
Meet me at the Café Nervosa on Pike.
I'd be glad to give you a reward.
'Meeting you is reward enough.
Half an hour?
'
That's perfect.
Bye.
- That was great.
- But not surprising.
- l told you to have faith in people.
- Yes.
People are good.
And fair.
We do nice things for people because of karma.
- You're not getting Friday off.
- Why?
Allow me.
Can you believe that?
That's the second time this week!
- l want to say something.
- Why don't you?
Something happens when I talk to a beautiful woman.
My knees turn to jelly.
You can only break people of bad habits by confronting them.
- That's true.
- So?
- Who's next here?
- l am.
No, you weren't next. I am!
People like you who glide through life in a cosy cocoon of narcissism never notice such things!
But learn this lesson, sister!
There's still such a thing as good manners.
That's why I insist you let me buy you your coffee and please try the poppy seed muffins.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Kind of brutal, weren't you?
I just remember "l was next" and the sound of blood in my ears.
Soon you'll be home with Maris and you'll forget about beautiful women.
- Let's sit here so we can see him.
- Your Good Samaritan?
Yes. I'm feeling rather good about this whole thing.
I lost my wallet and my favourite suit but other things were intact:
my date book, my spare car keys, my fountain pen.
But best of all, what remained intact is my sense that people are basically trustworthy.
He has your keys.
He's meeting you here knowing you'd bring your car?
Before you launch into a paranoid riff, my car is... moving down the street!
Stop that well-dressed man!
Charlie, it's Frasier's car.
Could you put some extra manpower on this?
Yeah. I know.
Fell for that old scam.
I told him to keep his guard up, but Frasier always knows better.
Mr Up-With-People.
Yeah.
Remember what we used to call guys like him on the force?
Hey, we're still talking about my son here!
Yeah. I'll talk to you.
- Hi, Frasier.
How's it going?
- Terribly!
Guess what happened today.
- What?
- My car was stolen!
You're kidding.
I fell victim to a master criminal.
Did they hot-wire it?
Boy, those guys got fingers like concert pianists.
No.
He had the key.
A real pro.
Made a wax impression and then had a duplicate key made?
No.
It was the same miscreant that stole my briefcase.
He used the spare set that was inside.
He tailed you so he'd know where to find the car?
Not exactly.
He called the station and we agreed to meet.
- What for?
- Low-fat lattes and biscotti.
What are you, the town crier?
It doesn't shake my belief in the basic goodness of people.
Sure.
He's probably using your car to deliver hot meals to shut-ins.
I'm glad my misfortune's given you so much glee.
Dad, I have two requests.
First, wipe that smirk off your face.
I'm not a child.
What's the second request?
Can I borrow your car?
I want to go to the movies.
And last stop on our tour, my booth, where all the magic happens.
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Dr Crane needed a lift so I came up.
Just go on about your business.
It's not like I'm listening.
Have we had one visitor yet who didn't do that?
Thanks but we do have a show to do.
- People say I have a talent for this.
- Yes, of course.
Your soothing voice.
I could listen to you for hours.
- Do you really think so?
- Yes.
Absolutely.
Now get out.
(Phone rings)
- Could you get that?
- Hello?
Who's calling, please?
Just a second.
Denise.
She was out with you last night.
- l wasn't out with anyone of that name.
- Ooh, speakerphone!
All right.
Hello.
This is Frasier Crane.
(Denise ) 'Hey, tiger. I miss you already. ' l beg your pardon?
'You just snuck out this morning without giving me your number, 'and I woke up to see your BMW pulling down my driveway.'

# But I don't know what to do with those tossed salads and scrambled eggs
# They're calling again #
Good night, Seattle, we love you!
Tommy, hit it up.
Let's have it.
- May I cut in?
- Why, certainly.
Boys will be boys.
Not all girls are raving bloody lesbians, you know.
That is a misfortune that I am perfectly well aware of.
She says that I think more of you than I do of her.
Well, you do, don't you?
Well, we won't go into that.
Go right ahead, boys.
Don't mind me.
But you're not a girl.
You're a guy.
- Why would a guy want to marry a guy?
- Security.
I think that the right woman could reform you.
You know, I think the right woman could reform you too.
These aren't my clothes.
Well, why are you wearing these clothes?
Because I just went gay all of a sudden!
In a hundred years of movies... homosexuality has only rarely been depicted on the screen.
When it did appear, it was there as something to laugh at... or something to pity... or even something to fear.
These were fleeting images, but they were unforgettable... and they left a lasting legacy.
Hollywood, that great maker of myths... taught straight people what to think about gay people... and gay people what to think about themselves.
No one escaped its influence.
Movies are part of my life... part of everybody's life.
That's where we learn about life.
Watching Cary Grant taught me how to behave with a woman... how to get dressed at night, how to go to a restaurant and order dinner.
They're our storytelling.
They're the fabric of our lives.
They show us what is glorious... and tragic and wonderful and funny... about the day-to-day experiences we all share.
When you're gay... and don't see that reflected in any way ever in the movies... you began to feel that something truly is wrong.
You feel invisible.
You feel like a ghost... and a ghost that nobody believes in.
There's this sense of isolation.
Join the club, man.
There's a whole group... that is not represented.
We are pathetically starved for images of ourselves... so much so that a friend will call... and say, "There's a movie you must see."
This happened to me.
"This movie you've got to see.
There's this incredible lesbian relationship.
There's this great love scene.
All right, they're vampires.
But you got to see it.
It's great."
There are lots of needs for art.
The greatest one is the mirror... of our own lives and our own existence.
That hunger I felt as a kid looking for gay images... was to not be alone.
My mother took me to the silent movies... in a spirit of ostentatious condescension.
she said they were nothing like life... and I must not believe them.
she was wrong.
Everyone who comes from England to America and goes back... says one thing first.
"It's more like the movies than you'd ever dream."
And it is.
From the very beginning, movies could rely on homosexuality... as a surefire source of humor.
Your ideas about who you are don't just come from inside you.
They come from the culture.
In this culture, they come from movies.
We learn from the movies what it means to be a man or a woman... what it means to have sexuality.
The movies did provide us with some kind of history... of how society thought homosexuals were.
A very good example is a Chaplin film...
Behind the screen.
There's a moment where Chaplin kisses someone who looks like a man.
He knows that it's a woman.
someone else comes along and sees it... and immediately starts swishing around in the most overt effeminate way.
It's fascinating that those stereotypes were so completely in place... that a mainstream popular film could assume... that the audience would know what this swishy mime was all about.
- Mr. Ernest!
- Ernest.
Dear Ernest!
Dear Lady Grayston.
Ernest, I'm so happy you were able to come.
You must excuse my coming in my town clothes... but your chauffeur said there wasn't a moment to lose, so I came just as I am.
Enter the sissy...
Hollywood's first gay stock character.
The sissy made everyone feel more manly or more womanly... by occupying the space in between.
He didn't seem to have a sexuality... so Hollywood allowed him to thrive.
They were sissies.
They were never addressed as homosexual.
It was a convention that was totally accepted.
They were perceived as homosexuals just subliminally.
This subject was not discussed... privately, certainly not publicly.
It wasn't discussed, but you knew.
They were all very prissy... these little skinny white men with little mustaches who would go like this.
Stop.
Stop.
Girls, girls, girls!
Be careful of my hats.
We gotta get down on the stage.
I don't care.
I won't allow you to ruin them.
I told ya they were too high and too wide.
Well, big woman.
I designed the costumes for the show, not the doors for the theater.
I know that.
If you had, they'd have been done in lavender.
This is ripped.
Who were you with?
strangler Lewis.
Catch as catch can, hmm?
If we could get the runs with this show these dames get in their stockings...
I'd be able to make the second payment on my kimono.
Here, Clarence.
Put that in the trunk.
And don't wear it.
Selfish.
They were a cliché.
I don't care whether they were a gay cliché or what...
I thought they were disgusting... unfunny, had no business being in it... and I never understood why people laughed.
It's the same thing when they had the stepping' fetchits for the blacks.
I liked the sissy.
Is it used in negative ways?
Yeah, but... my view has always been visibility at any cost.
I'd rather have negative than nothing.
That's just my particular view, and also because I am a sissy.
And go dashing up and down the hall
In one movie you could even find sissies table-hopping... in Hollywood's first peek at a gay bar.
If a sailor in pajamas I should see
I know he'll scare the life out of me
And on a great big battleship you, d like to be
Working as chambermaids sissy characters in movies... were always a joke.
There's no sin like being a woman.
When a man dresses as a woman, the audience laughs.
When a woman dresses as a man, nobody laughs.
They just thought she looked wonderful.
I saw Marlene Deitrich in Morocco when I was a teenager.
I just was flipping the channels and saw her... and decided to settle in for an old movie.
There's the scene where... she comes into a nightclub, and she's just stunning... in this tuxedo.
- May I have this?
- of course.
The camera lingers.
I wasn't catching this out of the side of the screen.
It's right in the center.
she has a romance with Gary Cooper in this movie... but that romance just went right out the window for me.
I was, "Who was that woman?
What had happened?"
I start writing a whole other script for what was really going on.
The thing worked for everybody of every sex.
What's amazing...
I don't think they've done anything... as delicious sexually as that since.
They didn't pretend it was anything but what it was.
she was doing it to turn on both the woman and the man... which appealed to everybody, as it should.
It was so free.
Ebba!
Come in!
Now don't daily, Your Majesty.
You have a busy day.
Morning, Ebba.
- What are you doing up so early?
- I couldn't sleep.
The movie Queen Christina was based on the life of a real Swedish monarch... and lesbian.
Hollywood changed the story, but traces of the truth seemed to linger.
There are rumors that Your Majesty is planning a foreign marriage?
They are baseless.
But, Your Majesty, you cannot die an old maid!
I have no intention to, Chancellor.
I shall die a bachelor!
We hope that it will not be necessary... to close all the motion picture houses... because of some undesirable ones.
But that we will have cleaner... and better motion pictures so that they may all stay open.
What happened, of course, in the 20s and 30s when they got very raunchy... the Catholic Church and fundamentalist Protestants came down hard.
It was a lot of pulpit stuff... preaching about orgiastic aspects... of what was happening on the screen.
The big change occurred when the movie moguls got together.
"Let's save Hollywood.
We must get an outsider."
Preferably some politician... who was above suspicion.
So they looked into the cabinet of Warren G. Harding.
At that time, there were a number of unindicted members of his cabinet.
They picked the Postmaster General, Will Hays of Indiana... who looked not unlike Mickey Mouse.
The code sets up high standards of performance... for motion picture producers.
It states the considerations which good taste and community value... make necessary in this universal form of entertainment.
Will Hays would head the movies, first voluntary effort at self-censorship.
The early Hays code was a token gesture, seldom taken seriously.
But by 1934, the Catholic Church had devised a scheme of its own.
The Legion of Decency... not only rated movies as to content but threatened massive boycotts.
Hollywood promised to play by the rules.
The Hays code just set up a series of rules... that were inviolable.
Code director Joe Breen ran Hollywood's censorship machinery... for over two decades.
He was authorized to change words, personalities and plots.
A novel about a sexually-confused alcoholic... became a movie about an alcoholic with writer's block.
A novel about gay bashing and murder... became a movie about anti-semitism and murder.
our American people are a homely... and wholesome crowd.
Cockeyed philosophies of life, ugly sex situations... cheap jokes and dirty dialogue are not wanted.
Decent people don't like this sort of stuff... and it is our job to see to it that they get none of it.
- Have you ever modeled before?
- No, I haven't.
I'm doing a study of a young girl's head and shoulders.
You won't object to removing your blouse, will you?
No, I guess not.
You can get ready behind that screen.
For all its efforts, the production code didn't erase homosexuals from screens.
It just made them harder to find.
Now they had a new identity...
as cold-blooded villains.
I'm ready now.
I suppose you'll want these pulled down, won't you?
Yes.
Why are you looking at me that way?
Won't I do?
Yes, you'll do very well indeed.
Do you like jewels, Lily?
This is very old and very beautiful.
I'll show it to you.
I don't think I'll pose tonight.
I think I'll go, if you don't mind.
Please don't come any closer!
I didn't expect to see you, Mrs. Danvers.
I noticed a window wasn't closed.
I came to see if I could fasten it.
Why did you say that?
I closed it before I left the room.
You opened it yourself, didn't you?
Rebecca is one of the movies in which the word... homosexuality or lesbianism is never uttered... but there's this one scene that... really stands out for a gay audience.
That is, Rebecca is dead.
she was the beautiful woman... who is mysteriously not on the scene any longer.
Her former housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers... is obsessed with her, even after her death.
This is where I keep all her clothes.
You would like to see them, wouldn't you?
Feel this.
It was a Christmas present from Mr. DeWinter.
He was always giving her expensive gifts, the whole year round.
I keep her underwear on this side.
They were made specially for her by the nuns in the convent of St. Clair.
she opens the underwear drawer.
It's so sensuous.
Look.
You can see my hand through it.
The guys who ran that code weren't rocket scientists.
They missed a lot of stuff.
If a director was subtle enough and clever enough, they got around it.
What'll it cost to be on the safe side?
Okay, go ahead.
- Gardenia.
- Quick, darling.
In with him.
We know Peter Lorre's gay in The Maltese Falcon even before we see him.
We're told there's a man outside... wearing perfume... gardenia.
Then we also hear some kind of funny... slightly oriental, feminine music.
- You'll sit down, Mr. Cairo?
- Thank you, sir.
The original novel didn't mince words about Peter Lorre's character.
It read, "This guy is queer."
May I offer condolences for your partner's unfortunate death?
The movie could only hint...broadly.
See, Mr. Spade, I'm trying to recover... an ornament that, shall we say, has been mislaid?
I thought and hoped you could assist me.
That ornament is a statuette.
Black figure of a bird.
Leave it to Alfred Hitchcock to create not one but two gay villains... murderous lovers based on real-life psychopaths...
Leopold and Loeb.
We knew that they were gay, yeah, sure.
Nobody said anything about it.
This was 1947.
Let's not forget that.
That was one of the points of the film.
Brandon, how did you feel?
- When?
- During it.
I don't know really.
I don't remember feeling very much of anything... until his body went limp... and I knew it was over.
And then?
Then I felt tremendously exhilarated.
How did you feel?
I don't think the censors at that time realized... that this was about gay people.
They didn't have a clue.
That's how it got by.
sometimes the censors turned a blind eye to lesbians on the screen... as long as they were kept safely behind bars.
- Hi, Anne!
- Hello, Harper.
Since you went fancy working upstairs for Benton, I kind of missed you.
This is Marie Allen.
Mrs. Benton says to put her in laundry.
Marie's gonna have a baby.
A baby, huh?
Why, you're just a kid yourself.
- So long, Marie.
- Good-bye, Anne.
Thank you.
Let's you and me get acquainted, honey.
You may be a number to the others, but not to me.
Sit down in this chair.
It's kind of roomy.
There's supposed to be a social message to all this.
"Isn't it terrible to go to prison, to lose your femininity?
Isn't it terrible for a woman to go hard?"
What's your name?
How'd you hurt your hand?
I'm a big girl, and this isn't my first year away from home.
The name is Marie Allen.
If I said no to Kitty, I'm sure not gonna say yes to you.
she's a cute trick.
In Young Man With a Horn, we have one of my favorite... lesbian glamour symbols.
Jo's interesting, isn't she?
so simple and uncomplicated.
Must be wonderful to wake up in the morning... and know which door you're going to walk through.
She's so terribly normal.
She's a good singer too.
I like Lauren Bacall because she gets up in the morning... and she has no idea what's going to happen to her next.
I'm dying to see the rest of your sketches.
We'll have dinner out and then go back to my place.
How nice of you to come to the party, Richard.
This is my husband.
Miss Carson, I told you about her, the girl who paints so well.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- See you at 9:00 then, Amy.
- Fine.
It's been a wonderful party.
Those movies were a warning to ladies to just watch it... and get back to the kitchen where God meant them to be.
What a swell combination we were.
You said you wanted experiences, Amy.
Well, here's one for you.
I'm leaving you.
I'd like to kill you.
You almost did.
You're a sick girl, Amy.
You'd better see a doctor.
I look back on the '50s now and think that it was halcyon.
People were still being educated.
There wasn't a race war on.
The drug thing wasn't...
It seems like a kind of paradise now.
But at the time we were living through it... we thought that we were in a decade... of such towering dullness and stupidity.
I want to be proud of him.
That's why I had him in the first place.
But he makes it so difficult for me.
My associates ask what he wants to be, and I have to tell them that... he hasn't made up his mind... because I just won't tell them he wants to be a folksinger.
The grief of love endures
In '50s America masculinity ruled.
seeming gay was almost as bad as being gay... so a man had to watch his every step.
Look, Tom, the way you walk...
I'm just trying to help you!
Nobody gave a damn about how I walked till last week!
Forget it!
- Al?
- Yeah?
Tea and sympathy is definitely about being homosexual.
I'm sorry.
Tell me how I walk.
It's a film that's about curing homosexuality... and the signs of homosexuality are effeminacy.
Well, then, you walk, and let me watch you.
- I never noticed how you walk.
- okay.
Do it again.
- If you tell the guys about this...
- You think I would?
We know the Sal Mimeo character is gay... party because he has a picture of Alan Ladd in his locker... but also from his adoration of the James Dean character.
You want to come home with me?
There's nobody home at my house.
Heck, I'm not tired.
Are you?
See, I don't have too many people I can talk to.
Who has?
People talk about whether that was a homosexual relationship.
The intention wasn't that.
But any film is at the same time... an expression of a writer... and it's an offering to an audience to create their own film.
Are you cold?
Rebel was about tenderness, intimacy.
It was an attempt to widen the permission to love... when men were supposed to be one way with each other.
- Can I keep it?
- Well, what do you think?
Here.
I think if I were writing that script again today... that I would be much more specific about Plato.
I would let him be an outcast because... the gang thought he was a faggot... and let his isolation come from that opinion.
- What do you guys want?
- You know what we want!
- We want your friend!
- Yeah, we got eyes for him.
The real rebel seems to me the Sal Mineo character.
He's got something to be rebellious about... namely, being gay in a homophobic society.
He, of course, has to be killed.
- Turn out the lights!
- Jim!
That's what happens to real rebels in our society.
You got very good at projecting subtext... without saying a word about it.
The best example I lived through was writing Ben-Hur.
Ben-Hur and Messala, one Jewish, one Roman... had known each other from youth.
They disagree over politics and hate each other for the next three hours.
That isn't much to put a whole three-hour movie on... even something as gorgeously junky as Ben-Hur.
The director of the movie, William Wyler, said "What do you do?"
I said, "Let me try something."
Let's say these two guys were 15, 16 when they last saw each other.
They had been lovers, and they're meeting again... and the Roman wants to start it up.
Messala, played by Stephen Boyd, wants to start it up again... with Ben-Hur, played by Charlton Heston.
Heaven knows why, but he does.
Anyway, he's Roman.
so Willie stared at me, face gray.
I said' "Well' I'll never use the word.
There will be nothing overt.
But it'll be perfectly clear that Messala is in love with Ben-Hur...
Willie said, Gore, this is Ben-Hur.
A Tale of the Christ, I think is the subtitle, he said vaguely.
Willie finally said, "Well, it's certainly better than what we've got.
We'll try it...
After all these years.
Still close.
In every way.
He said, "You talked to anybody about this?" And I said' "No."
He said, "You talk to Boyd..." Messala.
"Don't say anything to Heston.
Chuck will fall apart.
I'll take care of him."
So Heston thinks he's doing Francis X. Bushman in a silent version.
His head is constantly on high like this and like this.
Stephen Boyd is acting it to pieces.
There are looks that he gives him that are just so clear.
I said I'd come back.
I never thought you would.
I'm so glad.
- Look at you.
- Look at you.
You've come back a tribune.
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.
We'll drink another now.
Once I had a secret love
That lived within
The heart of me
Hollywood had learned to write movies between the lines.
some members of the audience had learned to watch them that way.
Gosh a-mighty!
You're the prettiest thing I ever seen.
Never knowed a woman could look like that.
- How do you hold that dress up there?
- Please!
It's amazing how if you're a gay audience... and you're accustomed to crumbs... how you will watch an entire movie just to see somebody wear an outfit... that you think means that they're a homosexual.
The whole movie can be a dud... but you're just sitting there... waiting for Joan Crawford to put on her black cowboy shirt again.
I'm going to kill you.
I know... if I don't kill you first.
Gay audiences were desperate to find something.
I think all minority audiences watch movies with hope.
They hope they will see what they want to see.
That's why nobody really sees the same movie.
Let's give 'em a hand over here.
That's a good-looking gun you were about to use back there.
Can I see it?
Maybe you'd like to see mine.
Nice.
Awful nice.
Monty Clift and John Ireland knew what they were doing.
I think that's why the scene is funny... 'cause of their delight in playing the sexuality of the gun.
There are only two things more beautiful than a good gun.
A Swiss watch or a woman from anywhere.
You ever had a good Swiss watch?
Go ahead.
Try it.
Hey, that's very good.
Hey, that's good too.
Go on.
Keep it going.
Most expressions of homosexuality in most of movies are indirect.
What's interesting is that that, of course... is what it what like to express homosexuality in life.
That we could only express ourselves indirectly... just as people on the screen could only express themselves indirectly.
There's a sense in which the characters are in the closet... the movie's in the closet, and we're in the closet.
Now I shout it
From the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last
My heart's
An open door
And my secret love's
No secret
Anymore one, two, three, four
There were films even in the '50s that got away... with an amazing amount of at least gay subtext.
You can't keep... gay life or behavior out of the movies.
It's like keeping it out of life in general.
It pops up often in somewhat hidden or somewhat coded ways.
In the film of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes... there's a gym full of bodybuilders who have no interest in Jane Russell.
He don't have to be Hercules Don't anyone know about birds and bees
Ain't there anyone here for love sweet love
Ain't there anyone
Here for
Love
Doubles?
Anyone?
Court's free!
Two out of three?
Anyone?
Doesn't anyone want to play?
In the '50s and '60s, especially in sex comedies... there were often characters who could be read as gay... whether they were the Tony Randall roles... or the boss of the decorating establishment.
And here.
This isn't bad either.
What color's that floor?
Lilac.
Lilac?
Leonard, who has a lilac floor in their kitchen?
I have.
Oh, well, Leonard, everyone isn't as artistic as you are.
We have to sell this wax to average, ordinary, everyday people.
Them!
In Hollywood for years and years... there was what was called the DF movie.
All the Doris Day movies were DF movies.
It was delayed fuck because they couldn't sleep together until married.
No sex before marriage.
That was the law of Hollywood.
What a marvelous-looking man.
I wonder if he's single.
I don't know how long I can get away with this act... but she's sure worth a try.
Rock had a screening room in his house.
He liked to assemble his houseguests and show his old movies.
Most of the guys I knew liked to see the old Doris Day films.
one of the reasons we laughed at them... was that there was a real gay in-joke occurring... in almost all of those light comedies... because at some point or another the character Rock Hudson played... posed as gay in order to get a woman into bed.
Tell me about your job.
It must be very exciting' workin' with all them colors and fabrics and all.
It was tremendously ironic.
Here was a gay man impersonating a straight man... impersonating a gay man.
Ain't these tasty?
Wonder if I could get the recipe?
sure would like to surprise my ma when I go back home.
We're all half man, half woman.
We come from those two cells, you know?
so when I put together Josephine in some Like It Hot...
I thought of Grace Kelly... thought of my mother... and a little bit of Eve Arden.
- My name is Josephine.
- I'm Daphne.
I thought my top lip was a little thin' so every time I stopped talking I'd...
- Men!
- You don't have to worry about that.
We wouldn't be caught dead with men.
Rough, hairy beasts with eight hands!
That kind of sexuality of ours which overlaps... some like it hard.
some like it soft.
That kind of waving in there is in that movie, just delicately.
Osgood, I'm gonna level with ya.
We can't get married at all!
Why not?
Well, in the first place, I'm not a natural blond.
Doesn't matter.
I smoke.
I smoke all the time.
I don't care.
I have a terrible past.
For three years I've lived with a saxophone player.
I forgive you.
I can never have children.
We can adopt some.
You don't understand, Osgood.
I'm a man!
Well, nobody's perfect.
When the subject turned serious and actual sex was suggested... out came the blue pencil, the scissors and the scene.
"Antoninus, Sicilian, age 26... singer of songs."
For whom did you practice this wondrous talent?
For the children of my master, whom I also taught the classics.
Classics, indeed.
What position have we, I wonder, for a boy of such varied gifts?
You shall be my body servant.
Instruct him.
All of you, come with me.
The first time you see Antoninus is there in the lineup... when he says, "I want him for my body servant."
That's the only indication.
Body servant.
What does that mean?
He says body servant.
The next thing you know we're in the tub.
I'm washing him.
In here with it.
There's some chat between us, and then finally he says to me...
"Antoninus, do you like snails?"
I said, "Yeah, I do."
"What about oysters?" I said, "Well, I don't think so."
Do you consider the eating of oysters to be moral... and the eating of snails to be immoral?
No, Master.
of course not.
It is all a matter of taste, isn't it?
Yes, Master.
And taste is not the same as appetite... and, therefore, not a question of morals, is it?
You can see even in that long shot I've...
I'm kind of getting an idea what he's trying to say to me.
I said, "Yes, Master."
He says, "Well, I like both oysters and snails."
He realizes that he's going to be asked... to do something he's not prepared to do.
I liked Antoninus for that, you know?
Take me out to dinner first.
Give me a little good time.
Don't throw me in the tub and drop the soap.
My taste includes both snails and oysters.
They cut that scene out.
I have never seen such a time in my life with censorship.
You started drinkin' with your friend skipper's death.
That's the truth.
They cut and cut Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.
There was no way Brick could have had any kind of sexual desire for his buddy.
What are you suggesting?
- Nothin' but...
- But what?
Say what's on your mind.
say it!
- Why are you so excited?
- Go ahead!
say it!
- What are you shouting like that for?
- skipper and I were friends.
- Can you understand that?
- Gooper and Mae said that skipper was... skipper is the only thing I got left to believe in!
- You are dragging it through the gutter!
- Now, just a minute...
You are making it shameful and filthy, you...
It was clear to anybody on the right wavelength what you were doing.
You just couldn't use the word.
I met this head-on in a movie called suddenly, Last summer... from a Tennessee Williams play.
You know why I was doing it.
I told you.
I was procuring for him.
Sebastian was lonely, Doctor.
The Legion of Decency... headed by this shark-like Jesuit priest...
I must have had five meetings with him.
"You can't say this.
You can't say that."
By the time we started to cut it, it was making no sense at all.
Sebastian only needed you while you were still useful.
- Useful?
- I mean, young, able to attract.
she's babbling again, babbling and lying.
He left her home because she had lost her...
- Because you stole him!
- Lost her attraction.
What would attraction have to do with a son and a mother?
- I'll tell you...
- Is there no way to stop these lies?
Yes!
Have my brain cut!
It was like working under the Kremlin, like writing for Pravda.
You did learn how to write between the lines or photograph between the lines.
You do it with a look, or there'd be a take on Hepburn's face... as Elizabeth Taylor would be telling her... getting closer and closer to the truth... which the Legion of Decency wouldn't dare let us say.
- We were decoys.
- Decoys?
For Sebastian.
He used us as bait.
When she was no longer able to lure the better fish into the net, he let her go.
Bait for what?
What were the better fish?
We procured for him.
Did Sebastian like boys or not?
Well, the fact that he's eaten up at the end by...
Admittedly, Tennessee occasionally went over the top with his dramatic effects.
When he tried to escape from those streets... down those little side streets between the buildings... they came from everywhere... so the only way was up.
Sebastian Venable was the perfect homosexual for his times... one without a face or a voice.
since he lives as a monster, he must die as one... in a scene reminiscent of an early horror classic.
I don't know how he still ran.
He never ran.
But he ran and he ran and he ran!
He never reached the end!
Never!
They overtook him.
He screamed just once.
I...
I...
Then I...
Then I...
Help!
Help!
So Suddenly, Last summer opens, and the New York Times is going to destroy... this degenerate film, the work of degenerates.
so you've got a review from Bosley Crowther that said...
"If you like incest, rape, sodomy, cannibalism, degeneracy... this is the movie for you, this sickening picture."
Everybody in the country went to see it.
That review made the movie.
A taut... tense drama of the most... of the most untalked-about subject.
While Hollywood remained reticent...
British films began to tackle homosexuality head-on... with a major star like Dirk Bogarde as the screen's first gay hero.
I want to know the truth.
I want to know why he hanged himself.
He was being blackmailed.
- That's why he stole?
- Yes.
someone found out he was a homosexual and blackmailed him?
That's it.
It takes two to make a reason for blackmail.
Were you the other man?
Were you?
There is a scene in the film in which... he is quite explicit about... wanting to have sex with another man.
That's an extraordinary statement for a star of that magnitude... in a popular entertainment movie to make in 1961.
All right, you want to know.
I shall tell you.
You won't be content until you know, will you?
Till you've ripped it out of me!
I stopped seeing him because I wanted him.
Do you understand?
Because I wanted him!
Back in Hollywood, the production code had gradually been whittled away.
Moviemakers, fed up with restrictions, set out to smash the last taboo.
Homosexuality was finally being talked about on the screen... but only as something that nice people didn't talk about.
We've seen things too.
- What things?
- Bad things.
I can't tell you.
You're annoying me very much.
If you have anything to say, say it.
I mean, I can't say it out loud.
I've got to whisper it.
- Why must you whisper it?
- I don't know.
I've just got to.
At the time we made the picture... there were not real discussions about homosexuality.
Do you know what you're saying?
It was about a child, s accusations.
It could have been about anything.
stop the car, John!
stop the car, John!
so none of us were really aware.
We might have been the forerunners, but we weren't really... because we didn't do the picture right.
We were in the mind-set... of not understanding... what we were basically doing.
You've got to know!
I've got to tell you!
I can't keep it to myself any longer.
I'm guilty!
You're guilty of nothing!
These days there would be a tremendous outcry, as well there should be.
Why would Martha break down and say, "What's wrong with me?
I'm so polluted.
I've ruined you."
she would fight.
she would fight for her budding preference.
When you look at it, to have Martha play that scene... and no one questioned what that meant... or what the alternatives could have been underneath the dialogue...
It's mind boggling.
We were unaware.
Don't you see?
I can't stand to have you touch me.
I can't stand to have you look at me.
It's all my fault!
I've ruined your life, and I've ruined my own.
I swear I didn't know it!
I didn't mean it!
oh, I feel so damn sick and dirty!
I can't stand it anymore!
The profundity of this subject... was not in the lexicon of our rehearsal period even.
Audrey and I never talked about this.
Isn't that amazing?
Truly amazing.
The loathing she feels...
How sick she is with herself...
It still makes me cry when I see that.
I think, why am I crying?
Why does this still get to me?
This is just an old silly movie.
People don't feel this way anymore.
But I don't think that's true.
I think people do feel that way today still.
There's part of me, despite all my little signs...
"Happy.
Proud.
Well-adjusted.
Bisexual.
Queer.
Kinky."
No matter how many posters I hold up saying...
"I'm a big pervert, and I'm so happy about it..."
there's this part of me that's, like, how could I be this way?
He said to tell you before you go on with the Lefflngwell matter... you ought to remember what happened in Hawaii.
Then he hung up.
What happened in Hawaii, Brig?
What was the voice like?
It was crawly.
He made it sound like he knew some kind of nasty secret.
I've been on the front pages the past few days.
Bound to get some crackpot calls.
Just hang up if you get anymore.
I saw Advise and Consent when I was in my senior year in high school.
Very much a virgin.
I didn't actually have sex with anybody... until I was 25 years old... so everything was theoretical at that point.
All I saw was a life that might lie down the road for me.
Let me hear a voice
A secret voice
A voice that will say senator Brigham Anderson, who's being blackmailed... goes to check out this former lover at a bar.
It was my first glimpse into what I imagined... organized gay life to be, and it was very, very scary... because it suggested people who have to remain hidden in the shadows.
Well, come on in.
Don't just stand there.
Don't run off.
Ray!
You're with me!
Brig?
- Wait a moment, Brig.
- Taxi!
- Let me explain.
Brig, wait a moment.
- Taxi!
I needed money, Brig!
Well, you wouldn't see me.
I kept calling.
I was drunk.
Drive, will ya?
Drive!
I felt that something dreadful was going to happen to me... something that I wouldn't be able to turn back... once I'd actually had sex with another man... and that the end of that road would be suicide.
I got that impression from the movies.
Is that Brig?
What's the matter?
He's dead.
Brig?
In his office.
He cut his throat.
Oliver saw you.
You were with Dove all afternoon.
You know, lying to me, Haley... oh, well, perhaps maturity will change all that.
What do you think I'll mature into?
You?
I want to know what's going on between you and that boy.
Are you in love with that Texas dirt farmer?
He's more than that.
It's gone quite far already, hasn't it?
You'd like to make him happy.
Make all his dreams come true.
- Perhaps even get married.
- Yes, even get married.
All right, I'll be sorry to lose you.
But if you think the world is your oyster, go ahead and take it.
How do you think the boy is going to feel when he finds out what you are... what you've been?
- He'll forgive me.
- All right, go to him.
After all, a girl like you has so much to offer a man.
A knife to cut his heart out.
- I'll change!
- Of course you'll change!
But haven't you said that so many times before?
But go on and tell him.
Tell him about the days and nights of Haley Gerard.
Tell him about the mud you've rolled in for years!
Well, tell him!
Growing up in that period in the '60s... all we had were images of unhappy... suicidal, desperate gay people.
The thought of turning... of turning involuntarily... into one of them... frightened me and made me sick with anger.
I went down there.
I had heard about the waterfront.
People giggle and make jokes about it.
I had had only two experiences before... once in college, once in the army.
I thought I'd gotten it out of my life, but I hadn't.
I looked at them.
Was this what I was like?
Oh, my God.
Twisted faces, outcasts... lives lived in shadows, always prey to a million dangers.
People don't realize what we go through.
I was raised in a family that would not even admit... that there was such a thing as a homosexual in this world... and here I was... and I couldn't do anything about it.
I couldn't stop!
These images magnify... the sadness... the hatred of us... the prediction that we will not find love.
How come you never got married?
You're not bad-looking.
Features are good.
Nice legs... ankles.
But you never had a man?
I think that's really your problem.
I think the fate of gay characters... in American literature, plays, films... is the same as the fate of all characters who are sexually free.
Haley?
Get Jo out of here!
You must pay.
You must suffer.
If you're a woman who commits adultery, you're only put out in the storm.
If you're a woman who has another woman, you'd better go hang yourself.
It's a question of degree, and if you're gay you have to do real penance... die.
I knew you were gay the moment you walked into the bar.
How could you know?
We know each other.
something about the way you walked.
something about the eyes.
What's the matter with you?
Let go of me!
I'll call the police!
Let go!
- Don't.
- Operator?
Don't do that!
You bitch!
By now, the pattern was clear... characters of questionable sexuality... would meet with a nasty end in the last reel.
Feed your faces and keep your traps shut if you don't want to...
Kill her.
Kill her!
Kill her!
Oh, Martha.
When the time comes, you won't have the guts.
It's not always like it happens in plays.
Not all faggots bump themselves off at the end of the story.
- One, two. one, two.
- Oh, Christ.
Single, single, dip.
- Wait a minute!
- One, two, three.
It's the geriatrics Rockettes.
Finally, it happened.
Hollywood made a movie in which gay men took a hard look at their own lives.
It's the sensational Menstruations!
And, in a refreshing twist... they all survived.
The great thing about seeing The Boys in the Band...
I hadn't come out yet... and what it did for me was present gay men... as having this incredible sense of camaraderie... this sense of belonging to a group which I, d never really felt before.
Forget your troubles Come on, get happy
You better chase all your cares away
What's more boring than a queen doing a Judy Garland imitation?
A queen doing a Bette Davis imitation.
I knew a lot of people... like those people.
I would say that probably all nine of them... are split-off pieces of myself.
What I am, Michael, is a 32-year-old, ugly, pockmarked Jew fairy... and if it takes me a while to pull myself together... if I smoke some grass before I get up the nerve to show myself to the world... it's nobody's goddamn business but my own.
And how are you this evening?
They were miserable and bitchy.
If I was wrong... it was definitely a reflection of what was... wrong in my head.
But that's the way I saw things then.
You're a sad and pathetic man.
You're a homosexual, and you don't want to be.
But there's nothing you can do to change it.
Not all your prayers to your God.
Not all the analysis you can buy in all the years you've got left to live.
You may very well one day be able to know a heterosexual life... if you want it desperately enough... if you pursue it with the fervor with which you annihilate.
But you'll always be homosexual as well.
Always, Michael.
Always... until the day you die.
Friends... thanks for the nifty party.
I think that the self-deprecating humor... was borne out of a... low self-esteem, if you will... from a sense of what the times told you about yourself.
Homosexuality was still classified as a mental illness.
You went into a gay bar, you were liable to be arrested... or the place be raided.
I've been in those situations.
There were still not just attitudes... there were laws against... one's being... the core of one's being.
If we could just not hate ourselves so much.
That's it, you know.
If we could just learn not to hate ourselves... quite so very much.
The first film... that really celebrated homosexuality, as far as I was concerned, was Cabaret.
For me, it embodied the very life I was beginning to live in San Francisco... one in which there was no real onus placed on homosexuality.
Doesn't my body drive you wild with desire?
Well, doesn't it?
Lt's a very nice body.
Do you really think so, darling?
It does have a certain kind of style.
I mean, look, it's very flat here... not much hips... and... here.
It's a little early in the day for this sort of thing.
Maybe you just don't sleep with girls.
oh.
You don't.
Listen, we're practically living together... so if you only like boys I wouldn't dream of pestering you.
Do you sleep with girls, or don't you?
You don't ask questions like that.
I do.
The boy was homosexual... and it seemed rational, reasonable.
I mean, that's what the story was.
There was no fuss with anybody.
None at all.
Oh, screw Maximillian!
I do.
so do I.
So, things changed... more quickly than you might imagine.
- And who are you?
- I'm Bernstein.
- You're Jewish?
- No, darling, I'm gay.
I don't care how you feel.
You're a great dancer.
You're not bad yourself.
I think it was easier... for the powers that be... to show a black rather than a white character as a homosexual.
Why?
I don't understand that.
But I do understand it... just like it's more easy for us to have... the sitcoms, situation comedies, on television... and not the serious dramas about our lives.
But a lot of things can be said through comedy.
Would you please get out of my face... you sorry-looking faggot?
Who you callin' sorry-lookin'?
Can't y'all see that she ain't funny?
She's just another poor example... of how the system destroys our men.
Honey, I am more man than you'll ever be and more woman than you'll ever get.
shit!
But there was a downside to the new gay visibility.
The threat of retaliation could be waiting just down the road.
This is the first image I remember... having of gays in a movie I saw.
It was the hitchhikers that were picked up in vanishing Point.
Pardon me.
Could you tell us which direction you're headed?
I'm going to Frisco.
Oh, well, that's perfect.
Thank you.
one of the guys was carrying a purse.
They wore very tight, pinched clothes.
He had a lascivious look on his face.
Why are you laughing?
I'm not laughing.
Yes, you are.
It's because you think we're queers, isn't it?
This is a stickup.
stickup?
Why are you laughing, Mary?
We all howled, because all you saw was the car speeding at 60 miles per hour... then screeching to a stop and the two guys were thrown out.
We thought that was great..." Remember when the two homos got thrown out?"
We thought that was amazing.
There it was, almost the image of what a homosexual was.
Bitch.
To be gay not only meant wearing pinched clothes with this look on your face... but you also carried a purse.
I've had the experience of being in a theater... and really enjoying a movie... and then suddenly, out of nowhere... comes some kind of pseudo-homosexual character... who is the villain, the killer, or is killed... and the audience bursts into applause.
I was with friends and we were watching Freebie and the Bean.
There's this killer transvestite... who does sort of a murderous ballet.
And of course, triumphantly, our hero pulls out a gun... and blows five million holes through the murderous transvestite... and the audience burst into applause.
There were two things happening there.
People were applauding the death of the villain... but they were also applauding the death of a homosexual.
You know you're watching a heterosexual movie when you see a Hollywood movie... but you don't... you're still not quite ready for being insulted.
Do you know, at this moment...
I have sunk as low as I can go.
I was wrong.
Are you gonna tell me you're a fag?
I don't think I can handle it.
I'm not a fag.
I'm a werewolf.
I never hear the word "nigger" used... unless it's by two black people... as a form of affection... or by a... totally bigoted southern sheriff.
You know, the blubbering stereotype.
To point out his ignorance, he would use that term.
You see?
"Faggot" is not used in that way.
"Faggot" is used by just anyone talking to anyone else.
Hey, doesn't this cafeteria have a "no fags allowed" rule?
Hey, killer.
Why are you on your knees?
You queer or somethin'?
I know what you've been after, you goddamn faggot.
You must be creamin' all over your faggot self.
After all this, you won't have to hang out with that faggot Caesar anymore.
Unhappy, faggot?
You're a faggot, a dirty queer.
- You a queer?
- Hell no, sir!
What's the matter?
You goin' faggot?
You turning' fag on me?
- Oh, you're a tough faggot, ain't you?
- What do you faggots want?
You hear me, you fuckin' faggots?
- Fuck you, faggot.
- Fuck you, queer.
- Who is this faggot?
- You bald-headed, flatfoot faggot.
You become either inured to it or conditioned to accept it... and it becomes the attitude... the prevailing attitude.
It becomes the way people perceive gay people.
When Hollywood finally acknowledged the burgeoning gay scene... it came up with a grisly thriller... set in the world of leather bars.
- How big are you?
- Party size.
- What are you into?
- I go anywhere.
- I don't do anything.
- That's cool.
Hips or lips?
I did have an experience with the movie Cruising.
Not about seeing the movie, but being the victim of someone who had.
My lover and I were gay-bashed by young men who worked in a movie theater.
They threatened us... they chased us out of the theater, into the street... and as I was escaping from one of them, he said to me...
"If you saw the movie Cruising, you know what you deserve."
Who's here?
I'm here.
You're here.
Now I'm afraid.
Homosexuals in movies had changed... from victims to victimizers.
show it.
Lift up the sweater.
Please.
Please.
Please.
You made me do that.
stop the movie Cruising!
stop the movie Cruising!
Gays fight back!
one movie boldly showed homosexuality... as an act of love, not violence.
so Hollywood had to warn the public.
This was 1982.
There hadn't been any gay characters... in leading roles.
okay, the truth is, I have gotten into a lot of different scenes.
I'm a writer.
I have to open myself up to new things... expand my horizons.
Why don't you just say it?
I'm gay.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
It was very hard to cast.
The men were hard to cast... because every one of their advisors... both Harry Hamlin and Michael Ontkean... told them not to play someone who was gay... that it would destroy their careers.
There was the general perception... at least in the early '80s...
I don't know what it's like now...
that Hollywood was a cowboy town.
A straight cowboy town.
I am sure that inside of me there is the same homophobia that we all share.
If I see a guy who's playing a gay role...
I'll question it and say, "Wow, is he gay?"
Why I do that, I don't know.
Then I'll stop and say, "That's silly.
You've been there, you've done that."
The question is, why do we care?
I mean, who cares?
I'll do that.
The ownership of the studio changed hands... and a new person came in who was not from the film world... nor the intellectual world... nor the world of letters and arts... and I had the unpleasant task... of running in the screening room for this man... and his lovely wife and daughters... the rough cut of the film.
None of my colleagues would be there.
They were all afraid.
I was there by myself, in the back.
He was sitting up front in the small screening room.
He was squirming all during the movie.
He just couldn't sit still.
And at the part in the movie... where the two men embrace and kiss... he jumped up and said...
"You made a goddamn faggot movie"... and stalked out.
The day it opened, I happened to be in Miami.
We sat down, the movie started... and as the movie progressed... you sensed the audience growing more and more uncomfortable... with what was going on the screen.
It kept escalating.
When they had the first kiss, it seemed there was an explosion in the theater.
People panicked.
There was pandemonium.
People started storming up the aisles.
At that point, I just left.
Mainstream people... dislike homosexuality... because they can't help concentrating... on what homosexual men do to one another.
And when you contemplate what people do... you think of yourself doing it... and they don't like that.
That's the famous joke...
"I don't like peas, and I'm glad I don't... because if I liked them I'd eat them, and I hate them."
There was a time when men were free to express tenderness on the screen.
But as the world grew more aware of homosexuality... male-to-male affection would be seen as an incriminating act.
A kiss would become an assault... or an ugly accusation.
I'll show you what you're gonna be.
What you are.
I'll kill you for that!
Americans, perhaps, are more scared of their sexuality.
They're prepared to show violence of all kinds... but when it comes to sexuality...
America is both self-righteous... and tries to bury it as if it didn't exist, which is silly.
Are you all right?
We had quite an argument about the kiss.
The screenwriter felt the whole thing should be in silhouetted long shot.
I said, "No way.
It should just happen."
And that's what we did.
There's a difference in how audiences look at two men getting it on... and two women getting it on.
There's a comfort with female nudity... and female girlishness and girly bonding... that it can be sexy and it can be completely palatable, even erotic.
Women don't find it threatening... and men find it either completely unthreatening or titillating.
straight men are more uncomfortable with two men making love... because somehow that means you're weak... and people equate weakness with male sensuality toward other men... not realizing that that's a ridiculous theory.
That's why people say, "I'm a man"... like being a man is based on who you happening to be boning that day.
In The Color Purple, Celie has fallen in love with Shug.
They're two women who love each other.
This intimacy... is not about sex.
I think it's much deeper.
Let's keep goin'.
What do you mean?
It's much easier for audiences to accept 2 women being affectionate than 2 men.
That's a big, big taboo.
You sure?
Hit it.
But when I put the kiss in at the end of Thelma and Louise... that gave people pause.
I told Geena.
I didn't tell anybody else.
They were beyond sexuality.
It was love.
If you're about to go off a cliff, I don't think you're gonna make a pass.
To me, it was a declaration of... that they were at a point where they were finishing each other's sentences... and they were there for each other in the tradition of Butch Cassidy... except that they didn't get shot down.
Go.
Wouldn't that have been great if Butch and Sundance...
Well, then they would've had more reason to shoot them, I suppose... if Butch and the Sundance Kid had kissed at the end.
But they did what guys do in movies...
They got their guns out, because they couldn't get their dicks out.
They got their guns out and went down with their guns.
That's what boys do.
Are you making a pass at me, Mrs. Blaylock?
Miriam.
Not that I'm aware of, Sarah.
Originally, the script was a Playboy version of them getting together.
It had a lot to do... with lingerie and posing.
There was no real scene.
And so I said that I really thought that what was sexy... would be the first moment the people touch.
so I came up with the little scene where she spills something on herself... she gives her something, they touch that way, they have a kiss... and then you go into all of the curtains blowing over their bodies stuff.
The other thing was, they felt I should be really drunk.
That was their way of taking away her choice, in a sense.
I insisted that that not be that way... that certainly you wouldn't have to get drunk to bed Catherine Deneuve...
I don't care what your sexual history to that point had been.
It was much more interesting if she went voluntarily.
I don't think, for better or worse... that women are taken very seriously in this area.
I think the feeling is, if two women are together... then it's probably experimental or some kind of phase... and if the right guy came along that would all change.
so it's something that straight men can watch and not be threatened by.
And straight men are the ones that are propelling the industry forward... so I don't think it's taken that seriously.
I suppose when you go to the movies and you see men being affectionate... besides the sex, the affection itself... is just too much.
Guys are supposed to be strong and unfeeling.
I get so angry... about what Hollywood will do with an original story or script... to get rid of the lesbian element... that I feel like standing up in the theater and just shouting.
These characters are dykes, and this movie isn't saying so.
What's your mother gonna say when she sees us both drunk?
stop worrying about what people think.
I mean, you've always done the right thing.
You took care of your daddy, the preacher, when he took sick.
You take care of all the kids over at the church school.
You're gonna take care of your mama.
I know, and I'm gonna marry the man I'm supposed to.
You're gettin' married?
As soon as the summer's over.
The passion that these two women feel for each other... was not presented in an open way in the movie.
I'm gonna miss you.
It's like somebody's just powdered me with fleas.
The entire time I'm being irritated that they're not telling the truth.
Everybody in the business... we all get paid more than we should, more than our fathers ever made.
There's always the fear that... they're gonna take it away, so we'd better be...
And that's why most people in those roles are conservative.
Most people who run big businesses in America are conservative.
Most newspaper chains are run by people who are conservative.
The public is always ahead of us about what they're ready for.
I think.
And if you do it well, if you pierce the heart truth... of what the public is feeling and thinking, you have a hit.
There is this constant desire on the part of the studios... to make characters likable.
My screen persona is pretty much non threatening.
I have never been one to strike fear into anybody's heart... when I enter a room or first appear on screen.
Because of it, then, this idea of a gay man with aids is not scary.
It's something else, but it doesn't have to be scary.
You don't have to be threatened by this man's presence in it... part of it because little Tommy Hanks is playing the role.
- What about my blood work?
- We're waiting.
I wanna prep you for a colonoscopy.
We want to take a look inside.
sounds delightful.
Wait a minute.
Why do you need to do this?
Who are you?
Who are you, Doctor...
- This is my partner.
- Yeah?
He keeps records of all my hospital visits.
It's nothing personal.
I'm Dr. Klenstein.
Listen, you're right.
A colonoscopy is not a pleasant procedure.
But if the Ks is causing the diarrhea, we've got to know about that right away.
But it could be parasites, an infection.
A reaction to the AZT.
All of these are possibilities, but we've got to perform the colonoscopy.
He's not going through some painful procedure... until we cancel out everything else.
I'm trying to help your partner.
- You're not in his immediate family.
- I'm not?
I could have you removed from the ER.
Look, he's upset.
He's sorry.
Don't apologize for me, okay?
Okay, he's not sorry.
The idea that there had to be an audience that wanted to see... stories about being gay in America... who wanted to see stories about a guy who has Al Ds in America... is this almost backward understanding of how it works... when you're standing in front of the box office in your local dodecaplex... and you have a choice between...
"What movie should we see?
We can see the movie about super spies from outer space, a cow who talks... the lawyer who has Al Ds or the big puppet show.
Well, I guess the lawyer with aids.
That's the one that's most different."
Philadelphia was terrific, but I don't think it proves anything.
It's about a gay hero who dies... and who is a tragic figure.
It remains to be seen whether Hollywood and the general public... will embrace a film with a gay hero who lives.
We felt that we would fail... if our movie played to people... who already think that discrimination against people with Al Ds is wrong... or people who already believe... that people shouldn't discriminate against homosexuals.
If our movie only played to people who thought just like we do... we would have done nothing very significant.
We all end up choosing who we're gonna be in love with the rest of our lives.
It seems that's what we're all searching for.
Andy found Miguel, Miguel found Andy.
That's a love that is born out of everything that goes into... two people deciding to be with each other.
It's forged through time.
It's a constant... the speed of light.
That's what the movie is saying.
It is all the same.
Love is spelled with the same four letters.
Readings in school were heterosexual.
Every movie I saw was heterosexual... and I had to do this translation.
I had to translate it to my life, rather than seeing my life.
Happy two-week anniversary.
Oh, Ed, you remembered.
Which is why, when people say to me...
"Your work is not really gay work, it's universal"...
I say, "Up yours.
It's gay.
That you can take it and translate it for your own life is very nice... but at last I don't have to do the translating... you do."
The long silence is finally ending.
New voices have emerged.
open and unapologetic.
They tell stories that have never been told... about people who have always been there.
We're victims of the sexual revolution.
The previous generation had all the fun, and we get to pick up the fucking tab.
Movies are important and they're dangerous... because it's, you know, we're the keeper of the dreams.
You go into a little, dark room... and become incredibly vulnerable.
All your perspectives can be challenged.
You feel things you normally couldn't.
It can encourage you... to be the protagonist in your own life.
on the other hand, it can completely misshape you.
There's been an incredible era of censorship... of, I wouldn't say positive images of gays and lesbians.
I would say real images of gays and lesbians.
Think of all the heroic stories that are real.
Here gay and lesbian people have lived... braving ostracism, loving, surviving.
There are so many real heroic stories.
- Your parents know you're gay?
- Sure.
Told 'em when I was 16.
sixteen?
I had a boyfriend in high school.
They freaked.
You know, the usual bullshit.
"How could you choose this kind of lifestyle, Peter?"
I said, "Hey, it chose me."
I want you to get dressed and leave.
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.
No, you don't.
I wouldn't know what to do.
You can start by putting the "Do Not Disturb" sign on the door.
Hollywood still runs scared from people... who feel that the very mention of homosexuality... the very display of it, in some form, on the screen... legitimizes the subject.
Well, of course it does.
It shows that homosexuals are human beings.
The movies could be making us laugh a lot more and cry a lot more... if they would actually acknowledge the true diversity of humanity.
- Not fair.
You've been in love a bunch.
- Just once, really.
Now he's gone, right?
He's right here.
I love you.
I love you too.

I'm only the middleman.
Phoebe borrowed the money.

$50,000 becomes $200,000, then became $250,000... and some bullshit "compensation fee" makes it $400,000.
You're so good with numbers, you might as well be a loan shark!
What?
Hwa, check out 32 Portland Street.

You want me to beat you up'?
What kind of a skimpy outfit is that?

Why don't you just take off ALL your clothes?
Beat it!
Happy Birthday.
Have you thanked Hwa yet?
Oh, I almost forgot.
Thanks.
Thanks for reminding me.
Let's cut the cake.

Brother Feng, the most important thing is good health.
Cheers!
With you by my side, I won't even catch a cold.
Don't make me blush, boss.
I might have to go into hiding.
I've already told you, don't call me boss if we're pals.
Yes, boss.
Very funny.
Let me tell you.
The merchandise I ordered from the Mainland is coming in tonight.
This is our largest shipment since I started dealing with them.
Brother Wu is personally checking it tonight at Sai Kung Harbor.
It's your birthday.
Let me handle it.
You enjoy yourself.
Of course I'll enjoy myself, but I also have to pick up the shipment.
Must show those Mainlanders some respect!
Bottoms up!
Chiang, come and enjoy yourself!
Let's drink!
- Let's play a fist game!
- OK.
I'll play with you.
Alright!
1,2,3.. piss or shit..
Can't you be a lady for once?
Whatever.
- Your mama... tits and ass--
- Here we go.
I'm bored.
Let's go for a walk.
It's more boring outside.
The atmosphere is better in here.
You deserve it, you double-crossing son of a bitch!
Brother Feng!
Brother Feng!
Sis, put in a good word for me!
I'm sorry, Brother Fang'.!
Brother Feng, I know I fucked up.
Please give me a second chance.
You loser!
Disappear in front of me right now.
Brother Feng!
I'm sorry, it'll never happen again!
Spare me!
Please..
Please, take it easy on me, please!
I beg you...
Give me another chance'.
Br other Fang'.!
Sister, sis!
Say something for me, sis!
Brother Feng, I know I fucked up.
Please, I beg you!
Please give me one chance!
You listen!
You shouldn't shit in the place you eat.
Return what you took and I'll let you go.
Thanks, Brother Feng!
Go home early and get some rest.
- Let's go.
- Sure.
Thanks, Brother Feng.
Be good.
That guy is just plain stupid.
He didn't mean to rip you off.
Besides, he's Yung's brother.
Don't let him get to you.
I'm not upset.
The only reason a loser like him... has the balls to screw around is because his sister is my woman.
Yung is with me only because of his brother.
True love?
Don't you think I know the difference?
Hwa...
I'll let you manage our drug business at Portland Street soon.
You stay alert, and it won't be long before you make it to the top!
I know what to do.
Boss!
Brother Hwa!
Where is he?
There he comes!
It's unlucky to light a cigarette like this!
Why?
Are you superstitious?
Not really.
But in our business, it's better to be safe than sorry!
Do you believe in "what goes around comes around"?
Hwa, I can really talk to you.
Yes, I do believe in it.
That's why I must make more money before "what" comes around!
Why?
Are you scared?
How many people have you seen dying at one time?
Since you put it that way, I'm sure you've seen plenty.
More than 1,300.
During the Cultural Revolution.
It was people fighting people, one against one, ten against one.
Until the whole village died.
What frightened me the most was not the dead, but the living.
Human relationships can be very scary!
This is only your opinion.
Everyone has his own point of view... own way of thinking.
There's no absolute right or wrong!
How many people have you killed during the Cultural Revolution?
I won't tell you.
Brother, I can be where I am now...
I've already put myself as another person.
If I didn't risk my life, these men wouldn't have followed me!
I hope you understand.
Quit when you've made enough.
9 out of 10 in our business got no happy ending.
I hope you're #10.
Br other Fang, you're right on time'.!
Brother Wu, count the money!
No need.
I trust you, buddy.
Boss.
Brother Feng.
It's good stuff, from America!
Want to give it a try?
Good stuff.
Attention, people at the pier!
You're under suspicion for drug trafficking.
Surrender with your arms up!
Tai, tell our people not to open fire!
We have an undercover in there!
You've set us up?
Fuck you!
Brother Feng, let's go!
- Fire!
- Stop your fire!
Fuck you, motherfucker!
I'm going to kill all you damn cops!
Motherfucker!
Hwa, what are you doing?
What are you thinking?
Just take them all out!
Attention all units.
We are trailing the suspect's car.
Heading to Kowloon from Sai Kung.
Over.
Why didn't you tell our boys that one of ours is also in the car?
Attention all units, this is Sergeant Wong of OCTB.
Do not open fire without my direct order!
The car ahead!
Stop immediately!
Stop immediately!
Hwa, let's send them all to hell!
You'd better surrender.
They'll open fire at us anytime.
I'd never thought you'd be so afraid of dying!
I'm not afraid.
I just don't want you to die.
I'll run them over!
No!
You can't win over those cops!
- Na').
- Get away from me'.!
Never thought I'd end up this way.
But look around.
I'm flattered by the big production.
At least I'll go out with a bang!
It's fate.
You're the robber, and I'm the cop.
Nothing I can do.
That's the rules of the game.
You've moved up the ranks fast, both with me and with the cops.
But you had to choose the cops!
How righteous!
And I thought I treat you pretty well.
That's not the point!
You sell drugs to junkies... to kids, to pregnant women.
Do you know how many people die each day because of you?
No!
I don't know!
I only know that's my way of living!
If it's not me, it'll be somebody else!
That's too selfish!
Surrender now.
You can find another way to make a living.
If you still considered us pals, then don't let those bastards get me!
Shoot me now!
Pull the trigger!
I won't go alone!
Let's die together!
Fire!
Brother Feng!
Brother Feng!
Brother Feng!
Don't!
Let me go!
What are you guys doing?
Let him go!
He's one of us!
Why did you open fire?
Why?
I would've got him!
Hwa, Hwa!
- Everything's taken care of.
- Give rne your car keys.
Go home and get some rest.
June's waiting for you.
Give me the car keys!
Hurry "P!
You should've been the one who died...
Inspector Lok Man Hwa.
Don't bow anymore!
My boss can't take it!
Let me go!
Let me go!
I want to kill the bastardl!
I want to avenge my boss' death!
Let me go!
You bastard!
Get your hands off me!
Officer Hwang.
June, how is he doing?
He's listed as stable now.
I know he'll make it.
Silly girl.
You're awake!
I thought who could it be by my side.
Sorry you've to wait so long.
Hey, what's 2 years.
Thank you.
If you really want to thank me, just eat the porridge I've brought you.
Remember you used to say my cooking was horrible?
Well, this porridge is the result of two years of intensive training.
Hey, Officer Lok!
Your case is all over the papers today.
Just incredible.
He's cracked another case.
Another couple of cases like this, you'll be looking at another promotion.
Then you'll take over my job!
Very funny.
Crack another couple cases?
It's a piece of cake for our Officer Lok.
He works so darn hard.
That's right.
Officer Lok never slacks off.
So you slack off often?
No, of course not.
I couldn't have done it without your help.
You're being modest, Officer Lok.
Get back to work.
A mob boss wouldn't be a mob boss without his devoted underlings.
Tai, what are you saying?
Once a mob boss, always a mob boss.
He's so good at betraying his buddies.
I'm afraid he'll do the same to us out of habit.
One can always change.
Unlike some suits in the office who bark orders from behind the desk.
What do you mean by that?
You mean you're the type Hwa referred to?
He was sent to the mob because he looked the part.
You better watch your asses!
We've received complaints from many merchants... that an organized... credit card counterfeiter is active in this shopping mall.
We have to apprehend these guys today, no matter what.
We've already made arrangements with the merchants.
As soon as they spot the counterfeiters, the sales people will signal to us and we'll arrest them immediately.
Officer Lok, Unit B is on the 3rd floor.
The others are in the basement.
Be on your toes.
These guys are pros.
Anything on 2nd and 4th floors?
Nothing on 2nd.
Keep watching.
Nothing on 4th.
Officer Lok, nothing in the basement.
Nothing on 3rd.
Miss, this model is very popular now.
OK, I'll take this one.
Do you take credit cards?
Sure.
Officer Lok, target is the woman in the jewelry store on 3rd floor.
Officer Lok, another one on 4th also.
You go up to the 4th floor.
I'll handle the one on the 3rd.
Yung!
Yung!
Yung!
Yung!
Handcuff me!
Why don't you'?
- Take me in now!
- Are you through?
Do it!
You're not going to arrest me'?
Then I'm going to walk.
I want to talk to you.
I've nothing to say to you.
Bitch!
You think you can just take off with the goods?
He's a cop!
Split!
You're bleeding.
Thanks.
Don't thank me.
Now we're even.
All patched up.
You can go now.
Why do you get involved in counterfeit cards?
What I do is none of your business.
Don't do it anymore.
You'll get caught sooner or later.
So what if I do?
Whether it's stealing or robbing, I'm just trying to make a living.
I can be a hooker and still be arrested by you cops.
When did it happen?
None of your business.
Leave.
Yurlg-
I know I've turned your world upside down.
Don't flatter yourself.
You didn't kill my brother.
It had nothing to do with you.
You don't need to feel guilty.
I'm really sorry.
Sorry?
Can I shoot you and then say I'm sorry?
Yung!
Is there anything I can do?
Do?
What can you do?
Soon after Brother Feng died, my brother was killed on the street.
He was my only family.
I didn't do counterfeit cards because of the money.
I'm lonely!
And you'?
You want to help me'?
How can you'?
I can.
Whenever you want to go out or just want to talk, call me.
I'll be there for you.
Okay.
Don't forget your promise.
You'll be on call around the clock.
I never go back on my word.
Okay?
Call me anytime.
- You're back!
- You didn't let me know you'd come.
I was working the night shift, so I thought I'd come and clean up for you.
Your apartment is a mess.
What happened?
Just a little scratch.
I'm fine.
What kind of bandage is this?
You didn't go to the hospital?
It's no big deal.
No.
You better come to the hospital with me tomorrow.
Just to be sure.
Okay-
I made some soup.
Let me warm it up for you.
You go back to sleep.
I can do it myself.
It's all right.
I'm up already.
"12345, GO TO HUNG HOM PIER RIGHT AWAY"
Call me here so late.
Are you treating me to a midnight snack?
Take care of the check for me.
Check please.
Officer Hwang.
Sorry I'm a little late.
What's the scoop?
Mail bomb.
Victim is one of the owners.
His name is Li Si Chiang.
One of the three Portland Street crime bosses.
What about the other two?
Over there.
Let's go.
You might as well get here tomorrow!
Come on.
Sir.
They won't talk.
Okay.
Let me handle it.
You've lost again.
Another game.
I'll go first.
Four 4's.
Five 4's.
Six 4's.
Nine 4's.
I call.
Gentlemen.
We didn't come here to watch you play dice.
Your partner had been murdered.
So what?
It's a little late for tears now, isn't it?
Four 4's.
You must know who did it.
If you don't tell us now... one of you may get it next.
You'll die next!
- You're next!
- He said it's your turn first.
Did you hear him?
- It's your turn first.
- You first.
Almost the entire Portland Street is under your control.
This is a very serious case.
Otherwise we wouldn't have come to bother you!
You guys are such a nuisance.
We are law abiding citizens with legal businesses.
Hey!
Don't try to get out of it.
Drink up!
Damn it!
The criminal is on the street!
Why are you wasting our time here?
Well.
Want to play another game?
Sure.
Four 6's.
Five 5's.
Six 4's.
Seven 5's.
Open it up.
I win again.
Drink up!
Let's go, Officer Hwang.
They're never going to talk.
That's right.
I've almost forgotten that they're pros too.
'L,2,3,4..
What are you doing?
I'm massaging the chicken.
Haven't you seen this in a movie?
You're crazy!
Who would massage a chicken?
I have to kiss it too!
Hey, don't..
Dinner time.
Time to eat!
Sit here.
I'm starving!
Me too!
Let's eat.
- Looks pretty good.
- Make yourselves at home.
Try this Virgin Chicken, a specialty by Hwa and me.
I want the drum stick.
How is it?
Is it okay?
"12345.
GO TO HOOVER CINEMA RIGHT AWAY"
Let me try it.
What is it?
You're needed at the station again?
Yeah.
They need me right away.
Can't you at least finish your dinner first?
That's right.
Go ahead.
It must be urgent if they're calling you at this hour.
I'm so sorry.
Enjoy yourselves.
"12345.
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD FOR FUN TONIGHT"
Get back!
Get back!
Officer Hwang.
What's Bald Yin up to now?
Somebody threw a bomb into his backyard.
But our explosive experts have determined that its' a fake.
Search?
It's too late now!
First, my friend's murdered.
Now a bomb is planted in my backyard!
We're lucky the bomb was fake.
Otherwise, my whole family would've been blown to kingdom come!
Why haven't you taken off your shoes?
We've already warned you.
It's just a matter of who gets it next.
You HAVE to take off your shoes when you come into my home!
Do you understand?
I've been around a long time... from being a nobody to what I am today.
Nothing ever scared me!
That depends on what you do, Bald Yin.
Which is usually anything but kosher.
You shut up, damn cop!
Watch your mouths in front of my son.
Don't listen to him.
Chubs, just tell us what you know.
It's good for both of us.
Tell you?
Why stop at just telling you?
Why don't I arrest the guy for you too?
No work on your part.
I'll even lure him out.
That would really save your time, moron!
I'm sure he knows who's behind this.
He just won't talk.
What do you think?
Dinner time.
It took me a whole evening to fix this chicken.
I'm still a great cook without your help.
I'll be the judge of that!
Let me taste it.
Come on.
Try the drumstick.
How is it?
Is it good?
It's.. 0.. kay.
You're teasing me!
"12345.
COME TO MY PLACE AT ONCE."
I've heard that more crimes are committed on a full moon.
I guess it's really true.
I didn't say it was the police station.
It was a wrong number, silly!
Come on.
Have another piece.
But that face of his, his laughter and his tears stay in my mind tonight.
I've said that my hopes and ambitions can't stop me from loving you and you alone.
Even if we are apart... and embraced so briefly...
I want it to last.
I still have those fond memories of you holding me... giving me pleasure and pain.
I hope that one of these days...
I'll see you again.."
I can't fall asleep... as lonely as my shadow.
Hurting and weeping under the starlight when will this ever ends?
Our small arguments had me shedding countless tears.
Cringing my frail heart... sobbing in the dark...
I hate this emptiness.
Hard to forget even by the end of my life.."
I'll get some more candles.
"I've tossed and turned many times in the darkness of the night.
But that face of his, his laughter and his tears stay in my mind tonight.
I've said that my hopes and ambitions... can't stop me from loving... you and you alone.."
Man Hwa.
Can't believe I'd live to see this beautiful city and you again.
I've been really lucky.
Still in one piece.
Don't try anything funny here.
I won't.
I'll be going back to Mainland tomorrow.
At least I have a home there.
All this time I've been running.
I've gotten used to life in the Mainland.
Why shouldn't you?
You're originally from there.
After 1997, you'll be just like me.
You better start learning now.
We'll be comrades;
you'll be no different.
That's what you think.
Is there anything I can do for you?
None.
Money?
No need.
I come only to get something back from a friend.
And to drop by to see you.
To see me'?
Aren't you worried that I'll turn you in'?
Well, will you?
Hwa, I know you very well.
You have righteousness in your heart.
If you weren't a cop, we could've been best friends.
Then it wouldn't have come to this.
I've never thought of you as just a friend.
Sorry, Brother Feng.
You don't have to say it... as long as we both know.
Frankly... if I were in your shoes I would've done the same.
Let's just say tonight never happened.
But if you try anything funny, I swear I'll arrest you.
Good.
A man of principle.
You really don't want to see Yung?
What's the use?
She can't be on the run with me too!
Not only can't I give her happiness...
I can't even give her security.
Why should I see her for?
It's best to let her start a new life.
Do you need my help?
It's very dangerous to run around like this.
OK.
At daybreak, I'll go to my friend's house to pick up my stuff.
You can give me a ride.
You're going in there alone?
What exactly are you picking up?
Don't worry.
Like I said, I'm just seeing an old friend.
A for Apple
B for Boy
C for Cat
Stay right there.
I said stay right there!
Boss, catch!
This way, Boss!
Shut up!
Mommy'.
I'm scared'.!
Mommy!
Who's the kid?
Drive!
What are you doing here?
Start driving!
Drive if you don't want to die!
Step on it!
Be quiet!
What are you trying to pull?
Who's the kid?
I've already told you.
I've come back to pick up something.
I won't be able to do it without him.
What are you picking up?
You're up to no good again!
It's not me!
It's his father who's stirring things up!
He owed me from a job I did for him.
What's so wrong about corning back and getting my dues?
Who's his dad?
That son of a bitch Bald Yin!
If he doesn't pay my Boss, I won't let him live!
It's $50 mil.
It was Boss' hard earned money.
Shut up!
I don't care what happened.
As long as you break the law, I'll have to arrest you.
You did the other two too, didn't you?
Hey, hurry up.
Get out of the car!
Don't think I'm scared by nutcases like you!
Let her go.
Like you, she also has her principles.
At least she's loyal to me!
Hwa, if you want me to go with you, I won't resist.
But I'll be damned if I didn't at least try.
You shouldn't have broken the law again.
I just want to get back what was rightfully mine, and then go away.
You should understand that.
Hwa, I don't blame you for what happened before.
But I'm begging you now.
Just help me out this one last time, OK'?
You can do it the legal way.
I wanted to, really.
But it won't work.
That bastard!
The job's already done.
He wouldn't cough up the money so easily now!
Hwa, I want you to be a middleman.
If you're there, he wouldn't dare try anything funny.
You've set up a meeting with Bald Yin?
Convention Center in half an hour.
Just do me this favor one last time.
I'll leave town as soon as I get the money.
I don't think you want Boss to be like this forever.
For old times sake?
Hwa, before all this leaks out... give me a way out!
"EMERGENCY AT THE STATION.
PLEASE RETURN ASAP."
After this is taken care of, you have to leave Hong Kong immediately.
Plus you have to guarantee the safety of the child.
Don't you worry.
He hands me the money, I hand him the kid.
No problem.
Boss, have a seat.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Oh!
An undercover cop.
Now I get it.
Bald Yin, it's not what you think.
I'm here only to make sure that you two calmly settle your business... once and for all.
Just get the kid back in one piece... you might as well spend some of your dirty money.
After today, we'll pretend this never happened.
You're on his side.
You can say anything.
Money?
Where is it?
Come.
Give him the money.
Yes.
Let my son go, then get the hell out of here!
How much money is here?
$50 million.
Not a penny less.
Something's wrong with your math.
What's wrong?
What about interest?
You're a grownup, use your brains.
If I had the money at the bank...
I would've at least gotten interest, fucker!
Brother Feng, quit while you're ahead.
I know what I'm doing.
How much do you want?
I want $100 million.
You might as well kill me, asshole!
Brother Feng, let's go now.
You stay right here!
What are you trying to pull?
I want all guns on the floor.
All guns on the floor!
You heard him, shitheads!
Now!
Brother Feng, if it's money that you want, I'll give you money.
Let my son go, and I'll even arrange a helicopter for you.
Good!
Then let's have it.
Fine.
Give me the phone.
How soon?
The earliest will have to be tomorrow.
Not soon enough.
I'll give you everything tonight!
I'll give you 10 seconds.
Brother Feng!
10!
Brother Feng, Brother Feng... s!
Q!
This game has gone too far!
W.
(s!
Brother Feng!
S!
I know I'm wrong now.
I am begging you!
- 4!
- Brother Feng, are you crazy?
Please let my son go!
B!
No!
Brother Feng!
2!
1!
Send them all to hell!
Lok Man Hwa, remember this.
Men never forgive or forget, especially if they've been betrayed.
You should never trust them again.
I've come back for revenge.
Police!
Freeze!
Don't move!
I'm a cop.
Put your gun down!
Freeze!
I've already said it many times.
What do I have to do to make you believe me'?
Lu Chan Feng has come back to Hong Kong.
He's still alive.
He's here to frame me.
He is framed by a ghost!
How do I put this down on my report?
I really despise your type!
You killed because you didn't get your share of the money.
You should have the guts to admit it.
I don't care what you say.
I've been waiting for this moment to ruin you.
You can't do this.
Of course I can.
What are you going to do about it?
OCTB
May I speak to Inspector Lok Man Hwa?
Who's calling?
This is his girlfriend.
Officer Chen, it's his girl.
Good.
Tell her she doesn't need to come and bail you out.
You're finished.
June, I..
Hwa, why are you working so late?
A man named Feng is here to see you.
He said you're expecting him.
He's been waiting for a long time.
Hold on.
Coke?
I'll get you one.
Hwa!
Are we having fun yet?
Be at your girlfriend's apartment in 15 minutes.
Don't move!
Let me go!
Lock him up!
Let me go!
I have to save June!
Don't move!
Tai, what are you doing?
This is MY case.
Don't even think about meddling!
YOU'RE the one who's meddling.
The higher ups have approved bail for Hwa.
Let me go!
Don't move!
Whatever happens will be your problem.
No problem.
Let him go now!
June!
June!
Man Hwa, let's check out the roof!
June!
Officer Hwang!
Officer Hwang!
Calling HQ.
Send an ambulance.
Male trauma victim on the scene.
Brother Feng!
Did I scare you?
You..
I've come back for you.
You're not dreaming.
Come on.
Come on!
You should know that I wouldn't just leave you behind.
This past year must've been hard on you.
Don't be angry at me.
No, of course not.
That's all behind you now.
Now that I'm back by your side, I'll give you the best in the world.
Do you know that you are very important to me'?
Let me take care of business first.
Then I'll come back for you.
Where are we going?
Yung!
You're gonna have some fun!
Mindy, take care of Yung for me.
Got it.
Go back to sleep.
I'll be right back.
Go to hell!
"Earlier today, there was an explosion in Sai Kung at the residence of police inspector Lok Man Hwa.
A dead body was found at the scene... later determined to be that of Sergeant Hwang.
Lok Man Hwa is considered extremely dangerous.
Police are now searching for his whereabouts."
Where are you going?
Why did you guys have to do that?
Why?
The bastard was an undercover cop!
Many of our buddies died because of him... and he nearly got Brother Feng killed!
And you're still asking why?
I'm not saying he was right.
But he was a cop and Brother Feng was a drug dealer.
He was only doing his job.
Why do you like him so much?
What's so good about him?
Whether I like him or not is my business.
But Br other Fang 'gust can't do this.
What'?
Brother Fang Ks so good to you and this is what he gets'?
You should always stand by him and love him.
YOU'RE the one who loves him!
Open the door, bitch!
Let me just tell you now!
I don't love Brother Feng!
You should be happy to hear this.
June!
June!
JUNE!
Let me get down there!
Let me get down there!
You thought you were a cop playing a robber.
But you're really a robber playing a cop.
I'm... a robber?
You shouldn't have trusted me.
You're not good enough to be a cop.
I've said before; your major weakness is you're too damn sentimental.
Don't tease me, June.
I'm not quite done with you yet.
Brother Feng!
Do as you're told.
Yes.
Get away!
Let me go!
Hwa!
Hwa!
Brother Feng.
I didn't know she would...
So you like him a lot?
Yes.
Bitch!
No one can take anything away from me.
Yes, I'm just a "thing" to you.
Did you ever bother to ask me, if I wanted to go with you'?
But he, he really cared about me!
Have you said enough?
No one dares to go against me!
You've already killed his girlfriend, what more do you want?
Take her away!
Yes!
Let him go!
Move it!
Move!
Mindy!
Let's take care of business first.
Let's have some more fun!
Put on a good show on Portland Street for us!
Freeze!
Freeze!
Asshole!
Calling HQ!
An armed man is shooting on Portland Street.
Send reinforcement and an ambulance.
Over!
Bastard!
Unit One to Shantung Street.
Unit Two Si Yau Street.
Remember.
Suspect is armed and dangerous.
Dismissed!
Yes, sir!
Stay away!
Stay away!
Get out of the way!
"Special News Bulletin."
"Tonight, a case of random shooting was reported on Portland Street.
A man with a handgun was shooting aimlessly into the public.
A police officer was wounded.
The police has already blocked off all intersections in the area... and is conducting an all out search for the suspect."
Freeze, on your knees!
Get away!
Get out!
Get out now!
Where have you been?
You just took off without saying goodbye.
Didn't even tell me where you were going.
I miss you.
You said we're going to light the lanterns.
I waited for you on Portland Street for 3 hours, 3 fucking hours!
I've missed you so much!
Take a pee.
Maybe that'll clear my head.
Pee...
Please take a message.
12345, it's urgent.
Come on.
Come on.
Pee.
I need to wake up.
I need to wake up!
Tell him I'll be waiting for him in front of...
OK convenience store on Portland Street.
"12345.
COME TO CONVENIENCE STORE ON PORTLAND STREET."
Do you have any ID?
Where are you going?
Going home.
Where do you live?
Mongkok.
The whole district?
Go home now.
It's dangerous here.
Hurry!
Stay where you are!
Freeze!
Hey!
Stay right there!
Do you hear me'?
I'm talking to you!
What are you doing here?
Hey!
Honey!
Where've you been?
I've been waiting for you.
Hey, cut the necking, you two.
It's very dangerous here!
Go home!
Is he drunk?
Take him home!
Don't get in our way!
Take him home!
Move!
If I had known you wanted to kill yourself...
I wouldn't have risked my life to save you!
You don't need to kill yourself.
Why bother?
Just go out there and let the cops gun you down.
Come and eat something.
I watched her die and I couldn't do anything.
All I did was laugh.
I want to be with her.
How do you know you'll find her?
I don't think she would like to see you this way.
Why are you helping me'?
Your brother died because of me.
You should be happy to see me dead.
I'll die with you.
Pull the trigger.
I'll feel better that way!
I am in love with you.
I always have.
You know that!
I still am.
Yes, my brother died because of you.
And you've lied to me!
I really wanted to hate you.
But..
I just couldn't.
I told myself to forget about you.
You already have a girlfriend.
So what if we see each other again.
What good would that do?
But I couldn't control myself!
I didn't know what to do!
I am truly in love with you!
And, that mid-autumn festival night...
Did you know how long I waited for you?
But you never came.
Why?
Where were you?
I did come...
I was there.
Just want to love once in my life... and to be loved by you.
I'm afraid, one day, you'll say to me... that our love is over.
Just want to love once in my life... please let me see my future in you.
We were truly in love once before... and I don't want to let go.
Just want to love once in my life... and to be loved by you.."
There must be a settlement between Feng and I.
Can you not go?
"If love can be controlled... then I won't be hurt.
Maybe I know that loving you... is all that I can do.
When I saw your face, my heart didn't hesitate.
When you are away, my world becomes a different place.
Only loneliness remains and there's nothing in me but pain."
"12345.
I LOVE YOU."
Do you know how to do your jobs?
You can't even find one guy!
Answer me!
Hey, fake Anglo, it's me.
Lok Man Hwa.
I'm calling from a phone booth.
Don't bother to track the call.
I'd give myself up if I were you.
You can't get away.
You don't have to step on me to get promoted.
You can choose not to believe me, but I'll catch Bald Yin's killer for you.
Just ask your men to stand by.
Why should I believe you?
Just hearing your voice makes me sick!
What's up, Officer Chen?
Call all the men in.
Inform SDU to stand by.
Yes sir!
Boss.
- Brother Feng!
- Brother Ben!
Man, you're clever.
It didn't take you much to take care of the cop.
I like your style.
Oh, it's nothing compared to you!
I'm just doing your dirty work... so you can sit back and put your feet up.
Pretty soon, all of Mongkok will be yours.
- Take a look at the merchandise.
- Sure.
This is good stuff!
Go ahead, Brother, take it.
Don't forget your friend when you're sitting on top of the world.
Brother Ben, don't say things like that.
Why don't we have a brotherly talk instead?
Asshole!
This bomb is a gift from me and Sergeant Hwang.
You want to play cops and robbers?
I've told you.
I'll arrest you if you try anything funny.
You'll get nothing.
Get up, Mindy.
Brother Feng...
I...
I love you...
Let's go!
Let's get the merchandise back!
She's no good anymore!
Fuck you!
Bastard!
Is this what you want?
You can have it!
It's Heroin #4!
The real thing!
Tell other junkies to come and get it!
Cool stuff!
Get away, asshole!
You want to play?
I'll play with you.
You shouldn't have come back!
You can't turn back the clock!
You think you're the Tiger of Mongkok?
You're only the Rat of Mongkok!
This is it for you.
Quick!
Hurry up!
Put down your weapon!
Drop it!
I won't die so easily!
I want you to die with me!
Let's die together then!
Be careful.
The suspect is armed!
Want me to die with you'?
Keep dreaming!
It will never happen.
I called the cops here.
If I give myself up now, they'll see that I'm innocent... and you'll go to jail for life.
That may be so, but you'll never see Yung again.
She'll always be mine, even in hell!
What have you done with her?
Get away from me!
Men are very selfish.
What I can't have, I'll destroy.
I don't mind jail.
I've killed Bald Yin, your girlfriend and Officer Hwang.
And I've killed Yung too.
So I deserve to go to jail for life.
But you, you have nothing!
Before Yung died, she begged me to spare you.
12345, recognize that pager code?
You motherfucker!
No, I won't kill you.
But I've killed them all.
I won't fall into your trap.
Don't let the cops get me...
don't let the cops get me!
Put down your weapons!
Freeze!
Drop your gun!
Put him in the car!
Don't move!
Let him go.
He's one of ours.
Yes, sir.
I'd rather die and take you with me!
Freeze...
Fire!
Call an ambulance!
Don't move him!
There's nothing to see here!
What happened?
What do you want, Miss?
"W a'.
Hwa, wake up!
I know you'll be okay.
Wake up!
I know you can hear me.
Say something!
Wake up!
12345.
What did you promise me'?
You promised me you'll always be there for me!
No need to be so melodramatic?
It's just a bruise.
I like you pressing against me.
You're teasing me!
I like some fried clams.
Would you come with me'?
"If love can be controlled... then I won't be hurt.
Maybe I know that loving you... is all that I can do.
When I first met you my heart fell under your spell.
When you first left me my world is a different tale.
Loneliness fills my heart... and sadness sips into my life.
I can't forget you... your image never fades.
I fell into deep distraught every night and day.
I know one day you and I will embrace again...
I don't believe that our love's just a one night stand.
I keep searching in vain... because my heart can't forget you.
Just want to love once in my life... please let me see my future in you.
We were truly in love once before... and I don't want to let go.
Just want to love once in my life... and to be loved by you.
I'm afraid, one day, you'll say to me... that our love is over."
( theme music playing )
AH-HH.
NOW YOU'VE FINISHED BREAKFAST, I WANT YOU TO GO INTO THE GARDEN.
WHY DO I GET THE FEELING I'M GOING INTO THE GARDEN?
WE MUST HELP EMMET.
HOW IS MY GOING INTO THE GARDEN HELPING EMMET?
BECAUSE HE'S SO SHY, POOR DEAR.
LOOK, I KNOW HE'S DYING TO OFFER ME A ROLE IN "THE BOYFRIEND"
BUT HE JUST CAN'T PLUCK UP THE COURAGE.
HYACINTH, I THINK HE'S GOT PEOPLE FOR ALL THE PARTS ALREADY.
YOU GO OUT INTO THE GARDEN,
WHEN YOU SPOT HIM, GIVE ME A SIGNAL AND I'LL START TO SING.
- WHAT SIGNAL?
- POINT OR SOMETHING.
WHAT AT?
AT ANYTHING!
POINT UP IN THE AIR!
SAY, "OH LOOK, THERE'S A BLUEBIRD."
THERE AREN'T ANY BLUEBIRDS.
BLACKBIRDS THEN.
- PLEASE DON'T MAKE DIFFICULTIES, RICHARD.
- ( groans )
YOU SHOULD TELL HER!
SHE NEVER LISTENS.
HYACINTH IS A TALKER, NOT A LISTENER.
YOU MUST FACE UP TO HER FAIRLY AND SQUARELY.
I TRIED THAT!
I TOLD HER THE OTHER MORNING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT EXCRUCIATING COFFEE SESSION.
THE ONE YOU COULDN'T MAKE, SISTER DEAR?
"HYACINTH," I SAID, "HYACINTH,
MY PRODUCTION OF 'THE BOYFRIEND' IS ALREADY FULLY CAST."
THAT WAS VERY BRAVE.
- ( sighs )
- WHAT DID SHE SAY?
SHE GAVE ME ONE OF HER SMILES,
SLIPPED ME A PARSNIP AND RHUBARB BISCUIT,
AND THEN ASKED ME WHETHER I'D SEEN HER PICTURES OF SHERIDAN
WHEN HE CAME FIRST IN HIS DANCE CLASS.
( laughing )
- HAVE YOU SEEN THEM?
- NO, THANK HEAVENS!
THEY'RE WORTH A LOOK.
POOR SHERIDAN.
YOU KNOW, HE NEVER REALLY STOOD A CHANCE.
SHOW ME YOUR SIGNAL, RICHARD.
RIGHT, I'M OFF.
IS THE COAST CLEAR?
THERE'S JUST RICHARD--
BEHAVING VERY STRANGELY.
POOR CHAP'S FINALLY FLIPPED.
AND WHO CAN BLAME HIM?
I'M AMAZED HE DIDN'T FLIP YEARS AGO.
( phone rings )
- MORNING, RICHARD.
- GOOD MORNING, EMMET.
OH LOOK!
A BLACKBIRD.
OH LOOK, ANOTHER.
OH, VIOLET, YOU KNOW YOU CAN CONFIDE IN ME.
YOU'RE GETTING FED UP WITH WHOSE COMPANY?
BRUCE'S?
THAT'S ONLY NATURAL, HE'S YOUR HUSBAND.
OH, YES, THEY DO GET TIRESOME.
( chuckles )
WHAT YOU NEED
IS ANOTHER DIMENSION TO YOUR LIFESTYLE.
YES, PERHAPS YOU SHOULD ENTERTAIN A LITTLE MORE.
GIVE A LITTLE SOIREE.
( laughs )
I COULD COME ALONG AND BRING SOME SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE GUESTS.
YES...
NO, DON'T GET ALARMED, VIOLET DEAR.
WE CAN KEEP IT QUITE SIMPLE.
A LITTLE CAVIAR, CHAMPAGNE, AND CUT-GLASS FINGERBOWLS.
ONSLOW...
WHERE DID WE FIRST MAKE LOVE?
WOULD YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION?
WHERE DID WE FIRST MAKE LOVE?
IT MADE SUCH AN IMPRESSION ON YOU, YOU CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER IT?
I CAN REMEMBER WHEN WE LAST MADE LOVE JUST.
WHY IS FATHER STANDING IN A BUCKET?
- IS HE STANDING IN A BUCKET?
- JUST STANDING THERE
WITH BOTH FEET IN THE BUCKET.
- IS HE QUIET?
- YES.
SO LEAVE HIM ALONE.
GET YOURSELF ANOTHER BUCKET.
I DON'T WANT A BUCKET.
SO WHY DO YOU CARE IF FATHER'S STANDING IN A BUCKET?
I WISH I'D NEVER ASKED.
WHY DIDN'T YOU COME OUT WHEN I SIGNALED?
I WAS ON THE TELEPHONE!
OH, I'VE NOTHING TO WEAR!
WELL, YOU'VE MISSED EMMET.
OH, YOU CAN FORGET ALL ABOUT THAT NOW.
WHAT?
WE SHALL INVITE ELIZABETH AND EMMET
TO GO WITH US TONIGHT TO VIOLET'S.
( sighs ) ARE WE GOING TO VIOLET'S?
YES, RICHARD!
FOR A SUPERLATIVE SUMMER EVENING WITH MY WELL-HEELED SISTER.
( groans )
CAVIAR, CHAMPAGNE, QUAIL'S EGGS.
CUT-GLASS FINGERBOWLS.
( growls )
( shudders )
IS ROSE COOKING BREAKFAST?
I SHOULDN'T THINK SO.
IF ROSE IS COOKING BREAKFAST, IT SMELLS VERY FUNNY.
IT WAS IN THAT BUS SHELTER IN MILTON STREET.
WHAT WAS?
WHERE WE FIRST MADE LOVE.
NO, IT WASN'T!
WE NEVER NEEDED A BUS THAT WENT PAST MILTON STREET.
I WAS SURE I HAD A BOYFRIEND THAT NEEDED
A BUS THAT WENT PAST MILTON STREET.
WELL, IT WASN'T ME.
IT'S NOT AN EMPTY BUCKET!
WHAT'S IN IT?
HORSE MANURE.
ASK A SIMPLE QUESTION...
FATHER IS STANDING BAREFOOT
IN A BUCKET OF HORSE MANURE.
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?
MAYBE HE LOST HIS SLIPPERS.
I KNEW IT DIDN'T SMELL LIKE BREAKFAST.
YOU'LL LOVE IT AT VIOLET'S!
- YOU'VE HEARD ME TALK OF VIOLET?
- MANY TIMES.
SHE'S MY SISTER WITH THE MERCEDES, SAUNA AND ROOM FOR A PONY.
( cabinet slams )
YOU MUST BRING EMMET.
WE SHALL HAVE A SUPERLATIVE SUMMER EVENING.
CAVIAR, CHAMPAGNE,
QUAIL'S EGGS, SMOKED SALMON PARCELS.
NOTHING TOO FORMAL.
JUST SOMETHING TASTEFUL WITH HAND-ENGRAVED CUT-GLASS FINGERBOWLS.
( humming )
( singing loudly ) * THERE'S SAFETY IN NUMBERS... *
EMMET WILL LOVE IT!
OH, I DON'T THINK EMMET WILL BE ABLE TO COME, HYACINTH.
HMM?
OH, HE WILL WHEN HE KNOWS I'LL BE THERE.
WELL, I'M NOT EVEN CERTAIN I CAN GET WORD TO HIM.
YOU SEE, HE'S REHEARSING ALL DAY AT THE CHURCH HALL.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT, DEAR.
WE'LL CATCH HIM THERE.
I-I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S A FRIGHTFULLY--
I COULD HELP EMMET DRILL HIS CAST.
IT'LL BE NICE FOR HIM TO HAVE SOMEONE TO LEAN ON.
OH, I'M SORRY.
HOW DID THAT GET IN THERE?
( crashing )
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY, HYACINTH!
DON'T WORRY, DEAR.
THEY'RE NOT REALLY ALL THAT EXPENSIVE.
MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE WOULD PAY, BUT THEN, ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN.
RATHER TOO FREQUENTLY, UNFORTUNATELY.
OH... ( shouts )
SHOULD WE REALLY BE INTERRUPTING EMMET'S REHEARSALS?
THAT'S BEEN WORRYING ME TOO.
EMMET WON'T MIND IF IT'S ME.
EMMET AND I ARE BONDED BY OUR MUTUAL LOVE OF MUSIC.
I THINK PERHAPS WE OUGHT TO WARN HIM--
CALL HIM ON THE TELEPHONE FIRST.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A VERY GOOD IDEA.
BUT THERE'S NO PHONE IN THE CHURCH HALL.
WE'LL HAVE TO PHONE THE VICARAGE AND HIS POOR WIFE
WILL HAVE TO TAKE THE MESSAGE OVER TO THE HALL.
I STILL THINK IT MIGHT BE THE THING TO DO.
RICHARD, DID YOU SEE THIS?
THIS MAN PUSHED IN.
JUST WAIT.
WAIT?
!
WHY SHOULD I WAIT?
EXCUSE ME, BUT THAT'S MY TELEPHONE CALL YOU'RE MAKING.
I WAS HERE FIRST.
PLEASE GO AWAY, MADAM.
I SHAN'T BE A MINUTE.
RICHARD, EJECT THIS MAN!
I KNEW SHE'D SAY THAT.
RICHARD, THIS MAN'S INSULTED ME.
NOT QUITE, BUT IT'S GETTING CLOSE.
( banging )
YOU OBVIOUSLY OVERUSE THE PUBLIC SYSTEM.
I VERY RARELY USE IT AS I POSSESS
A WHITE SLIMLINE TELEPHONE WITH AUTOMATIC REDIAL.
WITH A VOICE LIKE YOURS, I'M SURPRISED YOU EVEN NEED A TELEPHONE.
RICHARD, COME AND HELP ME!
( yelling ) HYACINTH, STOP THAT AT ONCE AND GET INTO THE CAR!
WELL DONE, SIR.
IN WARTIME, YOU'D HAVE GOT A MEDAL FOR COURAGE LIKE THAT.
* WE'RE BEING FINISHED AND OUR FAMILIES' WEALTH *
* MAY BE DIMINISHED *
* BUT AT LEAST WE ALL HAVE PERFECT HEALTH... *
HOLD IT, HOLD IT, GIRLS.
THAT'S VERY GOOD, BUT I THINK WE CAN DO A BIT MORE WITH IT.
VICAR, HAVE YOU EVER DONE THIS SORT OF THING?
NOT FOR SOME TIME.
UNIVERSITY.
I'M SURE YOU CAN REMEMBER THE OLD--
( rapid tapping )
- YES.
- KNEES ARE A BIT RUSTY.
IT'S GOOD, IT'S GOOD.
NOT-
- NOT BAD AT ALL.
WHY DON'T YOU COME UP HERE AND WE'LL SHOW THEM HOW TO DO IT?
- OKAY.
- COME ON, GIRLS.
GO DOWN THERE AND WATCH.
* WE'RE PERFECT YOUNG LADIES PREPARING TO TAKE *
* OUR PLACES AMONGST THE NOBLESSE *
* WE'RE PERFECT YOUNG LADIES PREPARING TO DATE... *
( melodramatic music on TV )
FATHER'S NOT AS DAFT AS YOU THINK.
STANDING IN A BUCKET OF HORSE MANURE?
HE'S GIVING IT A GOOD TRY.
HE SAYS IT'S GOOD FOR HIS CHILBLAINS.
HAS HE GOT CHILBLAINS?
NO-
- SO THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN IT.
WHERE DID HE GET THE STUFF FROM ANYWAY?
HE FOUND IT IN THE STREET.
HE'S BEGINNING TO WORRY WHERE HIS NEXT LOAD'S COMING FROM.
WELL, I'M NOT GOING OUT COLLECTING FOR HIM.
( chuckles, laughing )
NOW WHAT?
HE MAY THINK IT'S GOOD FOR HIS CHILBLAINS,
BUT IF THAT'S THE ONLY MEDICINE HE'S GOT FAITH IN,
I HOPE HE NEVER GETS BARBER'S RASH.
IT'S NO GOOD SULKING, HYACINTH.
THE SITUATION CALLED FOR FIRM MEASURES.
IT WAS EMBARRASSING.
IT WAS EMBARRASSING.
I MUST SAY, RICHARD,
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I'M AMAZED BY YOUR IMPATIENCE
AND YOUR LACK OF CONSIDERATION FOR OTHER PEOPLE.
- MY IMPATIENCE?
- YES!
ELIZABETH WAS A WITNESS.
SHE HEARD YOU RAISE YOUR VOICE TO ME.
WELL, I'VE NEVER RAISED MY VOICE TO YOU BEFORE.
I THINK I'LL JUST GO AND WARN EMMET YOU'RE COMING.
NO, WE'LL SURPRISE HIM.
I THINK I'D RATHER BE OUT HERE WHEN EMMET'S SURPRISED.
DON'T FORGET THE SMILES.
ALWAYS BIG SMILES.
- ( Hyacinth singing )
- IT'S THE BUCKET WOMAN.
* I'LL BE CONTENTED TO LIVE ANYWHERE *
* WHAT WOULD I CARE-- * OH--
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE WEARING?
NOT VERY HAUTE COUTURE, IS IT?
HAS ANYONE SEEN EMMET?
- HAD TO LEAVE.
- IN A HURRY.
- IN A GREAT HURRY.
- OH, WHAT A PITY.
HE'LL BE SORRY HE'S MISSED ME.
OF COURSE, I COULD WAIT
AND TAKE YOU THROUGH YOUR PACES.
( singing off-key ) * ANY GIRL WHO'S REACHED THE AGE OF 17 OR THEREABOUTS *
* HAS BUT ONE DESIRE IN VIEW *
* SHE KNOWS SHE HAS REACHED THE STAGE *
* OF NEEDING ONE TO CARE ABOUT *
* NOTHING ELSE WILL REALLY DO *
* CHILDHOOD GAMES ARE LEFT BEHIND *
* AND HER HEART TAKES WING... *
LET'S GO RIGHT OUTSIDE.
IT'S HER HUSBAND.
COME ON, QUICK.
* ...
THAT CERTAIN THING CALLED THE BOYFRIEND... *
- ISN'T THAT YOUR--?
- MY WIFE, YES.
OH, I THOUGHT I RECOGNIZED THE NOISE.
VOICE.
SHALL WE GO ROUND THE BACK WAY?
WHAT A GOOD IDEA.
* ...
THE BOYFRIEND!
*
DID YOU NOTE MY DICTION?
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THE AUDIENCE CAN HEAR THE WORDS.
THAT'S FUNNY.
WHY EXACTLY IS MRS. BOUQUET SINGING?
SHE WANTED TO INVOLVE HERSELF IN MY BROTHER'S REHEARSALS.
- I BET HE WAS PLEASED.
- ( Elizabeth laughs )
Hyacinth:
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?
PLEASE DON'T FEEL EMBARRASSED WATCHING ME.
I CAN QUITE UNDERSTAND HOW ENVIOUS YOU MUST BE.
IT'S A GIFT, YOU SEE.
SOME OF US HAVE IT, SOME OF US DON'T.
YOU CAN'T ALL EXPECT TO HAVE VOICES
LIKE MYSELF AND JOAN SUTHERLAND.
THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME CARRY THE JUMBLE.
WE'LL PUT IT UNDER THE STAGE.
WOULD YOU MIND, ELIZABETH?
NO, NO, OF COURSE NOT.
IF I POP INSIDE, PERHAPS YOU'D HAND THINGS DOWN TO ME?
CERTAINLY.
WHAT ON EARTH'S GOING ON?
WHAT ARE Y'ALL DOING DOWN HERE?
REHEARSING.
- AREN'T WE?
- All:
YES, YES.
- VERY TRICKY ROUTINE.
- Emmet:
OH-
- VERY TRICKY.
READY, GIRLS?
ONE, TWO, THREE.
* WE'RE PERFECT YOUNG LADIES PREPARING TO TAKE-- *
EMMET, WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING?
- REHEARSING.
- I'M AFRAID I'M NOT CONVINCED.
MICHAEL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING UNDER THE STAGE
WITH THREE...
GIRLS?
IT'S NOT JUST THREE GIRLS.
- EMMET'S HERE.
- HE'S A SINGLE MAN.
DIVORCED.
IT'S THE SAME THING.
NOT QUITE TECHNICALLY, DEAR.
EXCUSE ME.
LOOK, WHY ARE YOU MAKING SUCH FUSS?
YOU THINK UNDER THE STAGE, IN THE PITCH DARK
WITH THREE GIRLS IS REALLY APPROPRIATE FOR A VICAR?
DARKNESS IS CLERICAL TERRITORY.
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO FIGHT IT, NOT JOIN IT!
HELLO-OO!
Vicar:
THERE'S A PERFECTLY SIMPLE EXPLANATION.
I KNOW!
THAT'S WHAT WORRIES ME.
OH, THERE YOU ARE, EMMET.
JUST WHEN I THOUGHT I WAS IN ENOUGH TROUBLE.
AND YOU TOO, VICAR,
HOW FORTUNATE TO FIND YOU ALL TOGETHER.
I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU.
YOU'RE ALL INVITED THIS EVENING...
TO MY SISTER VIOLET'S.
SHE'S THE ONE WITH THE MERCEDES,
THE SAUNA AND ROOM FOR A PONY.
NOW, I WANT YOU ALL THERE AT 6:00 THIS EVENING,
FOR A BON VIVANT BUFFET,
AND ALFRESCO MANCHETTES.
WEATHER PERMITTING, OF COURSE.
WE DON'T WANT SOGGY VOL-AU-VENTS, DO WE?
OH, NO.
NOW, RICHARD, I WANT YOU TO BE
AT YOUR MOST ELEGANT THIS EVENING.
I DON'T DO A GOOD ELEGANT.
BUT OF COURSE YOU DO, DEAR.
LOOK WHO'S BEEN TRAINING YOU ALL THESE YEARS.
WHAT ABOUT THE BUFFET ITEMS?
YOU CAN FETCH ALL THAT IN A MINUTE.
( electronic ringing )
LISTEN TO THAT.
IT'S EVEN BETTER THAN OURS.
- HELLO, DEAR.
- HYACINTH!
- RICHARD.
- Man:
WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU GONE NOW?
!
VIOLET, PAY ATTENTION WHEN I'M YELLING AT YOU!
( yells ) GET LOST!
OH, NOT YOU.
HIM.
LOVELY TO SEE YOU BOTH.
BYE.
WHO WAS THIS GUY YOU WERE WITH
IN THE BUS SHELTER IN MILTON STREET?
DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM.
YOU LIKED HIM.
IT'S NOT AS IF IT WAS SOMEBODY YOU DIDN'T LIKE.
SOUNDS AS IF YOU LIKED HIM BETTER.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I LIKED HIM?
!
HE WAS A FRIEND OF YOURS.
OH, NICE!
SOME FRIEND!
( TV plays )
IT'S NOT AS IF WE WERE MARRIED AT THE TIME.
FATHER'S GONE.
DID YOU KNOW SHE USED TO BE AT A BUS SHELTER
IN MILTON STREET WITH SOME GUY?
- ONLY ON FRIDAYS.
- WHAT GUY?
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW-
- WHAT GUY?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "FATHER'S GONE"?
HE'S GONE WITH HIS BUCKET, LOOKING FOR ANOTHER LOAD.
DO YOU MEAN THAT SHELTER AT THE BOTTOM END OF MILTON STREET?
- THAT'S THE ONE.
- ( both giggle )
I SPENT SOME HAPPY HOURS IN THAT SHELTER.
SOUNDS AS THOUGH EVERYBODY EXCEPT ME
SPENT HAPPY HOURS IN THAT BUS SHELTER.
I THINK HE'S JEALOUS.
OO-OOH!
OH-HH, I THINK THAT'S SO SWEET!
I WOULDN'T MIND, YOU WERE ALWAYS BORROWING YOUR BUS FARE.
THIS LOOKS RATHER GOOD.
NOT QUITE MY CANDLELIGHT SUPPER, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY ELEGANT.
Violet:
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO CHOKE ME?
Bruce:
'CAUSE I HATE YOU!
I CAN'T STAND YOU!
WHY DON'T WE JUST PHONE ROUND AND CANCEL EVERYBODY?
RICHARD, I WILL NOT DISAPPOINT PEOPLE.
WE HAVE FRIENDS COMING TONIGHT
WHO ARE EXPECTING A BON VIVANT BUFFET AND ALFRESCO MANCHETTES,
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO RECEIVE.
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ROW INDOORS?
IT'LL QUIETEN DOWN.
IT'LL HAVE TO.
IF IT DOESN'T WE'LL DROWN IT OUT WITH MUSIC.
- DO WE HAVE ANY MUSIC?
- DON'T MAKE DIFFICULTIES, RICHARD.
TAKE A POSITIVE ATTITUDE, DEAR.
I WANT THIS EVENING TO BE ELEGANT AND MEMORABLE.
( Violet screams ) DON'T DO THAT!
I HAVE A FEELING IT IS GOING TO BE MEMORABLE.
HMMM.
OH, YES, THAT'S REALLY LOVELY.
AN ELEGANT GASTRONOMIC DELIGHT.
ARE YOU ON TOP OF THE BARBECUE, RICHARD?
I'M GETTING THERE.
SLOWLY.
Violet:
YOU'VE HIDDEN THE CARVING KNIFE AGAIN!
CARVING KNIFE, DID YOU HEAR THAT?
RICHARD, I WILL NOT HAVE YOU EAVESDROPPING ON PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS.
- DO YOU CALL THAT PRIVATE?
- Violet:
GET OUT OF MY WAY!
( sighs ) DO SOMETHING, DEAR.
- Violet:
I HATE YOU!
- ( glass shatters )
- YOUR LEGS ARE TOO SHORT!
- WAIT, I HAVE AN IDEA.
I'M GOING NOWHERE NEAR THEM
IF THEY'RE WAVING CARVING KNIVES AROUND.
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DROWN OUT THEIR VOICES.
NOR AM I CONTACTING THE ROYAL ARTILLERY.
NO.
JUST GO AND HAVE A LOOK INSIDE,
AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIND SOME LARGE SHEETS OF CARD
AND A THICK PEN.
- WHAT FOR?
- NEVER YOU MIND.
COULDN'T WE HAVE A PUNCTURE OR SOMETHING?
COULDN'T THE CAR BREAK DOWN AND THEN WE COULDN'T POSSIBLY GET THERE?
YOU PROMISED THE VICAR YOU'D COME.
YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE EACH OTHER MUTUAL SUPPORT.
Bruce:
IF I HAD A BRAIN, DO YOU THINK I'D BE MARRIED TO YOU?
THERE!
BUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
HOLD IT UP AND HOPE THAT VIOLET AND BRUCE WILL SURRENDER?
NO!
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BARBECUE SINGSONG.
SURELY YOU CAN UNDERSTAND ANYONE HIDING FROM THE BUCKET WOMAN.
YES, OF COURSE I CAN.
WHAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IS WHY YOU FELT
YOU NEEDED THE "MORAL SUPPORT"
OF THREE ATTRACTIVE YOUNG LADIES.
- Bruce:
YOU'RE THE ONE WITH THE MOUTH!
- REALLY THINK THIS'LL WORK?
IT WILL IF WE SING LOUD ENOUGH.
THAT'S PROBABLY ELIZABETH AND EMMET.
AT LEAST IT'S QUIET AT THE MOMENT.
THEY'LL BE IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS.
LOOKING FOR THE JUGULAR.
Hyacinth:
HELLO, ELIZABETH AND EMMET!
- Both:
HELLO.
- WELCOME TO OUR BARBECUE.
WITH THE UNIQUE SING-FOR-YOUR-SUPPER SPECIALTY.
OH NO-
- SHE'S NOT GOING TO SING?
PLEASE, TELL ME SHE'S NOT GOING TO SING.
SHH, BE QUIET.
WELL, I MUST SAY THE BUFFET LOOKS LOVELY, HYACINTH.
THANK YOU, DEAR.
HOW DOES THE SINGING SIDE OF THE EVENING WORK?
OH, IT'S A PARTY GAME BASED ON AN IDEA
ORIGINALLY CONCEIVED BY HENRY VIII FOR HIS BANQUETS.
- HOW INTERESTING.
- YES, FASCINATING.
YES, IT'S PERFECTLY SIMPLE.
WHENEVER I PICK UP ONE OF THESE CARDS,
THEN EVERYONE SINGS THE SONG IT NAMES.
- ( Bruce yelling )
- RULE BRITANNIA!
All reluctantly:
* BRITANNIA RULES THE WAVES *
* BRITONS NEVER, NEVER, NEVER SHALL BE SLAVES-- *
COME ALONG, RICHARD, SING UP THERE.
* RULE, BRITANNIA, BRITANNIA RULES THE WAVES *
* BRITONS NEVER, NEVER, NEVER SHALL BE SLAVES-- *
- ( arguing ends )
- LOVELY, LOVELY.
( Hyacinth laughs ) NOW...
WHAT CAN I OFFER YOU AS A PRELIMINARY NIBBLE?
DO YOU THINK SHE HAS ANY SUICIDE PILLS?
EMMET, BEHAVE YOURSELF.
OH, HELLO AGAIN, VICAR.
HOW NICE TO SEE YOU AND YOUR GOOD LADY.
- GOOD EVENING, MRS. BUCKET.
- "BOUQUET."
DO RELAX AND ENJOY YOURSELVES.
Violet:
WHY DO YOU GO THAT FUNNY COLOR?
OH!
* THERE'LL ALWAYS BE AN ENGLAND *
* WHILE THERE'S A COUNTRY LANE *
( loudly ) * WHEREVER THERE'S A COTTAGE SMALL *
* BESIDE A FIELD OF GRAIN *
* THERE'LL ALWAYS BE AN ENGLAND *
* AND ENGLAND SHALL BE FREE... *
- ( bickering stops ) - ( singing quiets )
( chuckles ) JUST A PARTY GAME, VICAR.
YOU'LL SOON GET THE HANG OF IT.
RICHARD'LL SOON HAVE THE HOT FOOD READY.
WON'T YOU, DEAR?
BUT IN THE MEANTIME, DO HELP YOURSELF TO MY ANCILLARY ITEMS.
- THANK YOU, HYACINTH.
- Bruce:
DON'T BITE ME THERE!
YOU'RE ALWAYS BITING ME THERE!
* THERE'LL ALWAYS BE AN ENGLAND *
* WHILE THERE'S A COUNTRY LANE-- *
* SHE'LL BE COMING 'ROUND THE MOUNTAIN WHEN SHE COMES *
* SHE'LL BE COMING 'ROUND THE MOUNTAIN WHEN SHE COMES *
* SHE'LL BE COMING 'ROUND THE MOUNTAIN *
* COMING 'ROUND THE MOUNTAIN *
* COMING 'ROUND THE MOUNTAIN WHEN SHE COMES... *
- ( singing fades )
- WONDERFUL.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING.
NOW DO HELP YOURSELVES.
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE IT ALL HOME AGAIN.
- IT ALL HAS TO BE EATEN.
- Violet:
HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT!
* OLD macdonald HAD A FARM EE-I-EE-I-OH *
- * AND ON THAT FARM THERE WAS A-- * - * DUCK!
*
* EE-I-EE-I-OH *
* WITH A QUACK-QUACK HERE AND A QUACK-QUACK THERE-- *
OOH LOOK!
MRS. BOUQUET, FIRE!
OH, RICHARD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOUR BARBECUE'S OUT OF CONTROL.
DADDY!
WHAT A MIRACLE!
JUST WHEN WE NEED HIM,
DADDY APPEARS WITH A BUCKET OF WATER.
- I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU!
I REALLY HAVE!
- ( screaming )
DULL OLD THING YOU ARE-- GO AWAY!
OH DEAR, WHAT A PITY BRUCE CAN'T STAY.
YOU WILL JOIN US, VIOLET DEAR?
I THOUGHT WE MIGHT TAKE HOME A CHINESE.
( theme music playing )
AH-HH.
NOW YOU'VE FINISHED BREAKFAST, I WANT YOU TO GO INTO THE GARDEN.
WHY DO I GET THE FEELING I'M GOING INTO THE GARDEN?
WE MUST HELP EMMET.
HOW IS MY GOING INTO THE GARDEN HELPING EMMET?
BECAUSE HE'S SO SHY, POOR DEAR.
LOOK, I KNOW HE'S DYING TO OFFER ME A ROLE IN "THE BOYFRIEND"
BUT HE JUST CAN'T PLUCK UP THE COURAGE.
HYACINTH, I THINK HE'S GOT PEOPLE FOR ALL THE PARTS ALREADY.
YOU GO OUT INTO THE GARDEN,
WHEN YOU SPOT HIM, GIVE ME A SIGNAL AND I'LL START TO SING.
WHAT SIGNAL?
- POINT OR SOMETHING.
WHAT AT?
AT ANYTHING!
POINT UP IN THE AIR!
SAY, "OH LOOK, THERE'S A BLUEBIRD."
THERE AREN'T ANY BLUEBIRDS.
BLACKBIRDS THEN.
PLEASE DON'T MAKE DIFFICULTIES, RICHARD.
YOU SHOULD TELL HER!
SHE NEVER LISTENS.
HYACINTH IS A TALKER, NOT A LISTENER.
YOU MUST FACE UP TO HER FAIRLY AND SQUARELY.
I TRIED THAT!
I TOLD HER THE OTHER MORNING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT EXCRUCIATING COFFEE SESSION.
THE ONE YOU COULDN'T MAKE, SISTER DEAR?
"HYACINTH," I SAID, "HYACINTH,
MY PRODUCTION OF 'THE BOYFRIEND' IS ALREADY FULLY CAST."
THAT WAS VERY BRAVE.
WHAT DID SHE SAY?
SHE GAVE ME ONE OF HER SMILES,
SLIPPED ME A PARSNIP AND RHUBARB BISCUIT,
AND THEN ASKED ME WHETHER I'D SEEN HER PICTURES OF SHERIDAN
WHEN HE CAME FIRST IN HIS DANCE CLASS.
HAVE YOU SEEN THEM?
- NO, THANK HEAVENS!
THEY'RE WORTH A LOOK.
POOR SHERIDAN.
YOU KNOW, HE NEVER REALLY STOOD A CHANCE.
SHOW ME YOUR SIGNAL, RICHARD.
RIGHT, I'M OFF.
IS THE COAST CLEAR?
THERE'S JUST RICHARD-
BEHAVING VERY STRANGELY.
POOR CHAP'S FINALLY FLIPPED.
AND WHO CAN BLAME HIM?
I'M AMAZED HE DIDN'T FLIP YEARS AGO.
MORNING, RICHARD.
- GOOD MORNING, EMMET.
OH LOOK!
A BLACKBIRD.
OH LOOK, ANOTHER.
OH, VIOLET, YOU KNOW YOU CAN CONFIDE IN ME.
YOU'RE GETTING FED UP WITH WHOSE COMPANY?
BRUCE'S?
THAT'S ONLY NATURAL, HE'S YOUR HUSBAND.
OH, YES, THEY DO GET TIRESOME.
WHAT YOU NEED
IS ANOTHER DIMENSION TO YOUR LIFESTYLE.
YES, PERHAPS YOU SHOULD ENTERTAIN A LITTLE MORE.
GIVE A LITTLE SOIREE.
I COULD COME ALONG AND BRING SOME SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE GUESTS.
YES...
NO, DON'T GET ALARMED, VIOLET DEAR.
WE CAN KEEP IT QUITE SIMPLE.
A LITTLE CAVIAR, CHAMPAGNE, AND CUT-GLASS FINGERBOWLS.
ONSLOW...
WHERE DID WE FIRST MAKE LOVE?
WOULD YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION?
WHERE DID WE FIRST MAKE LOVE?
IT MADE SUCH AN IMPRESSION ON YOU, YOU CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER IT?
I CAN REMEMBER WHEN WE LAST MADE LOVE JUST.
WHY IS FATHER STANDING IN A BUCKET?
IS HE STANDING IN A BUCKET?
- JUST STANDING THERE
WITH BOTH FEET IN THE BUCKET.
IS HE QUIET?
- YES.
SO LEAVE HIM ALONE.
GET YOURSELF ANOTHER BUCKET.
I DON'T WANT A BUCKET.
SO WHY DO YOU CARE IF FATHER'S STANDING IN A BUCKET?
I WISH I'D NEVER ASKED.
WHY DIDN'T YOU COME OUT WHEN I SIGNALED?
I WAS ON THE TELEPHONE!
OH, I'VE NOTHING TO WEAR!
WELL, YOU'VE MISSED EMMET.
OH, YOU CAN FORGET ALL ABOUT THAT NOW.
WHAT?
WE SHALL INVITE ELIZABETH AND EMMET
TO GO WITH US TONIGHT TO VIOLET'S.
ARE WE GOING TO VIOLET'S?
YES, RICHARD!
FOR A SUPERLATIVE SUMMER EVENING WITH MY WELL-HEELED SISTER.
CAVIAR, CHAMPAGNE, QUAIL'S EGGS.
CUT-GLASS FINGERBOWLS.
IS ROSE COOKING BREAKFAST?
I SHOULDN'T THINK SO.
IF ROSE IS COOKING BREAKFAST, IT SMELLS VERY FUNNY.
IT WAS IN THAT BUS SHELTER IN MILTON STREET.
WHAT WAS?
WHERE WE FIRST MADE LOVE.
NO, IT WASN'T!
WE NEVER NEEDED A BUS THAT WENT PAST MILTON STREET.
I WAS SURE I HAD A BOYFRIEND THAT NEEDED
A BUS THAT WENT PAST MILTON STREET.
WELL, IT WASN'T ME.
IT'S NOT AN EMPTY BUCKET!
WHAT'S IN IT?
HORSE MANURE.
ASK A SIMPLE QUESTION...
FATHER IS STANDING BAREFOOT
IN A BUCKET OF HORSE MANURE.
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?
MAYBE HE LOST HIS SLIPPERS.
I KNEW IT DIDN'T SMELL LIKE BREAKFAST.
YOU'LL LOVE IT AT VIOLET'S!
YOU'VE HEARD ME TALK OF VIOLET?
- MANY TIMES.
SHE'S MY SISTER WITH THE MERCEDES, SAUNA AND ROOM FOR A PONY.
YOU MUST BRING EMMET.
WE SHALL HAVE A SUPERLATIVE SUMMER EVENING.
CAVIAR, CHAMPAGNE,
QUAIL'S EGGS, SMOKED SALMON PARCELS.
NOTHING TOO FORMAL.
JUST SOMETHING TASTEFUL WITH HAND-ENGRAVED CUT-GLASS FINGERBOWLS.
* THERE'S SAFETY IN NUMBERS... *
EMMET WILL LOVE IT!
OH, I DON'T THINK EMMET WILL BE ABLE TO COME, HYACINTH.
HMM?
OH, HE WILL WHEN HE KNOWS I'LL BE THERE.
WELL, I'M NOT EVEN CERTAIN I CAN GET WORD TO HIM.
YOU SEE, HE'S REHEARSING ALL DAY AT THE CHURCH HALL.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT, DEAR.
WE'LL CATCH HIM THERE.
I-I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S A FRIGHTFULLY-
I COULD HELP EMMET DRILL HIS CAST.
IT'LL BE NICE FOR HIM TO HAVE SOMEONE TO LEAN ON.
OH, I'M SORRY.
HOW DID THAT GET IN THERE?
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY, HYACINTH!
DON'T WORRY, DEAR.
THEY'RE NOT REALLY ALL THAT EXPENSIVE.
MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE WOULD PAY, BUT THEN, ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN.
RATHER TOO FREQUENTLY, UNFORTUNATELY.
OH...
SHOULD WE REALLY BE INTERRUPTING EMMET'S REHEARSALS?
THAT'S BEEN WORRYING ME TOO.
EMMET WON'T MIND IF IT'S ME.
EMMET AND I ARE BONDED BY OUR MUTUAL LOVE OF MUSIC.
I THINK PERHAPS WE OUGHT TO WARN HIM-
CALL HIM ON THE TELEPHONE FIRST.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A VERY GOOD IDEA.
BUT THERE'S NO PHONE IN THE CHURCH HALL.
WE'LL HAVE TO PHONE THE VICARAGE AND HIS POOR WIFE
WILL HAVE TO TAKE THE MESSAGE OVER TO THE HALL.
I STILL THINK IT MIGHT BE THE THING TO DO.
RICHARD, DID YOU SEE THIS?
THIS MAN PUSHED IN.
JUST WAIT.
WAIT?
!
WHY SHOULD I WAIT?
EXCUSE ME, BUT THAT'S MY TELEPHONE CALL YOU'RE MAKING.
I WAS HERE FIRST.
PLEASE GO AWAY, MADAM.
I SHAN'T BE A MINUTE.
RICHARD, EJECT THIS MAN!
I KNEW SHE'D SAY THAT.
RICHARD, THIS MAN'S INSULTED ME.
NOT QUITE, BUT IT'S GETTING CLOSE.
YOU OBVIOUSLY OVERUSE THE PUBLIC SYSTEM.
I VERY RARELY USE IT AS I POSSESS
A WHITE SLIMLINE TELEPHONE WITH AUTOMATIC REDIAL.
WITH A VOICE LIKE YOURS, I'M SURPRISED YOU EVEN NEED A TELEPHONE.
RICHARD, COME AND HELP ME!
HYACINTH, STOP THAT AT ONCE AND GET INTO THE CAR!
WELL DONE, SIR.
IN WARTIME, YOU'D HAVE GOT A MEDAL FOR COURAGE LIKE THAT.
* WE'RE BEING FINISHED AND OUR FAMILIES' WEALTH *
* MAY BE DIMINISHED *
* BUT AT LEAST WE ALL HAVE PERFECT HEALTH... *
HOLD IT, HOLD IT, GIRLS.
THAT'S VERY GOOD, BUT I THINK WE CAN DO A BIT MORE WITH IT.
VICAR, HAVE YOU EVER DONE THIS SORT OF THING?
NOT FOR SOME TIME.
UNIVERSITY.
I'M SURE YOU CAN REMEMBER THE OLD-
YES.
- KNEES ARE A BIT RUSTY.
IT'S GOOD, IT'S GOOD.
NOT-NOT BAD AT ALL.
WHY DON'T YOU COME UP HERE AND WE'LL SHOW THEM HOW TO DO IT?
OKAY.
- COME ON, GIRLS.
GO DOWN THERE AND WATCH.
* WE'RE PERFECT YOUNG LADIES PREPARING TO TAKE *
* OUR PLACES AMONGST THE NOBLESSE *
* WE'RE PERFECT YOUNG LADIES PREPARING TO DATE... *
FATHER'S NOT AS DAFT AS YOU THINK.
STANDING IN A BUCKET OF HORSE MANURE?
HE'S GIVING IT A GOOD TRY.
HE SAYS IT'S GOOD FOR HIS CHILBLAINS.
HAS HE GOT CHILBLAINS?
NO-SO THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN IT.
WHERE DID HE GET THE STUFF FROM ANYWAY?
HE FOUND IT IN THE STREET.
HE'S BEGINNING TO WORRY WHERE HIS NEXT LOAD'S COMING FROM.
WELL, I'M NOT GOING OUT COLLECTING FOR HIM.
NOW WHAT?
HE MAY THINK IT'S GOOD FOR HIS CHILBLAINS,
BUT IF THAT'S THE ONLY MEDICINE HE'S GOT FAITH IN,
I HOPE HE NEVER GETS BARBER'S RASH.
IT'S NO GOOD SULKING, HYACINTH.
THE SITUATION CALLED FOR FIRM MEASURES.
IT WAS EMBARRASSING.
IT WAS EMBARRASSING.
I MUST SAY, RICHARD,
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I'M AMAZED BY YOUR IMPATIENCE
AND YOUR LACK OF CONSIDERATION FOR OTHER PEOPLE.
MY IMPATIENCE?
- YES!
ELIZABETH WAS A WITNESS.
SHE HEARD YOU RAISE YOUR VOICE TO ME.
WELL, I'VE NEVER RAISED MY VOICE TO YOU BEFORE.
I THINK I'LL JUST GO AND WARN EMMET YOU'RE COMING.
NO, WE'LL SURPRISE HIM.
I THINK I'D RATHER BE OUT HERE WHEN EMMET'S SURPRISED.
DON'T FORGET THE SMILES.
ALWAYS BIG SMILES.
IT'S THE BUCKET WOMAN.
* I'LL BE CONTENTED TO LIVE ANYWHERE *
* WHAT WOULD I CARE- * OH-
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE WEARING?
NOT VERY HAUTE COUTURE, IS IT?
HAS ANYONE SEEN EMMET?
HAD TO LEAVE.
- IN A HURRY.
IN A GREAT HURRY.
- OH, WHAT A PITY.
HE'LL BE SORRY HE'S MISSED ME.
OF COURSE, I COULD WAIT
AND TAKE YOU THROUGH YOUR PACES.
* ANY GIRL WHO'S REACHED THE AGE OF 17 OR THEREABOUTS *
* HAS BUT ONE DESIRE IN VIEW *
* SHE KNOWS SHE HAS REACHED THE STAGE *
* OF NEEDING ONE TO CARE ABOUT *
* NOTHING ELSE WILL REALLY DO *
* CHILDHOOD GAMES ARE LEFT BEHIND *
* AND HER HEART TAKES WING... *
LET'S GO RIGHT OUTSIDE.
IT'S HER HUSBAND.
COME ON, QUICK.
*...
THAT CERTAIN THING CALLED THE BOYFRIEND... *
ISN'T THAT YOUR-?
- MY WIFE, YES.
OH, I THOUGHT I RECOGNIZED THE NOISE.
VOICE.
SHALL WE GO ROUND THE BACK WAY?
WHAT A GOOD IDEA.
*...
THE BOYFRIEND!
*
DID YOU NOTE MY DICTION?
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THE AUDIENCE CAN HEAR THE WORDS.
THAT'S FUNNY.
WHY EXACTLY IS MRS. BOUQUET SINGING?
SHE WANTED TO INVOLVE HERSELF IN MY BROTHER'S REHEARSALS.
I BET HE WAS PLEASED.
Hyacinth:
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?
PLEASE DON'T FEEL EMBARRASSED WATCHING ME.
I CAN QUITE UNDERSTAND HOW ENVIOUS YOU MUST BE.
IT'S A GIFT, YOU SEE.
SOME OF US HAVE IT, SOME OF US DON'T.
YOU CAN'T ALL EXPECT TO HAVE VOICES
LIKE MYSELF AND JOAN SUTHERLAND.
THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME CARRY THE JUMBLE.
WE'LL PUT IT UNDER THE STAGE.
WOULD YOU MIND, ELIZABETH?
NO, NO, OF COURSE NOT.
IF I POP INSIDE, PERHAPS YOU'D HAND THINGS DOWN TO ME?
CERTAINLY.
WHAT ON EARTH'S GOING ON?
WHAT ARE Y'ALL DOING DOWN HERE?
REHEARSING.
AREN'T WE?
- All:
YES, YES.
VERY TRICKY ROUTINE.
- Emmet:
OH-VERY TRICKY.
READY, GIRLS?
ONE, TWO, THREE.
* WE'RE PERFECT YOUNG LADIES PREPARING TO TAKE- *
EMMET, WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING?
REHEARSING.
- I'M AFRAID I'M NOT CONVINCED.
MICHAEL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING UNDER THE STAGE
WITH THREE...
GIRLS?
IT'S NOT JUST THREE GIRLS.
EMMET'S HERE.
- HE'S A SINGLE MAN.
DIVORCED.
IT'S THE SAME THING.
NOT QUITE TECHNICALLY, DEAR.
EXCUSE ME.
LOOK, WHY ARE YOU MAKING SUCH FUSS?
YOU THINK UNDER THE STAGE, IN THE PITCH DARK
WITH THREE GIRLS IS REALLY APPROPRIATE FOR A VICAR?
DARKNESS IS CLERICAL TERRITORY.
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO FIGHT IT, NOT JOIN IT!
HELLO-OO!
Vicar:
THERE'S A PERFECTLY SIMPLE EXPLANATION.
I KNOW!
THAT'S WHAT WORRIES ME.
OH, THERE YOU ARE, EMMET.
JUST WHEN I THOUGHT I WAS IN ENOUGH TROUBLE.
AND YOU TOO, VICAR,
HOW FORTUNATE TO FIND YOU ALL TOGETHER.
I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU.
YOU'RE ALL INVITED THIS EVENING...
TO MY SISTER VIOLET'S.
SHE'S THE ONE WITH THE MERCEDES,
THE SAUNA AND ROOM FOR A PONY.
NOW, I WANT YOU ALL THERE AT 6:00 THIS EVENING,
FOR A BON VIVANT BUFFET,
AND ALFRESCO MANCHETTES.
WEATHER PERMITTING, OF COURSE.
WE DON'T WANT SOGGY VOL-AU-VENTS, DO WE?
OH, NO.
NOW, RICHARD, I WANT YOU TO BE
AT YOUR MOST ELEGANT THIS EVENING.
I DON'T DO A GOOD ELEGANT.
BUT OF COURSE YOU DO, DEAR.
LOOK WHO'S BEEN TRAINING YOU ALL THESE YEARS.
WHAT ABOUT THE BUFFET ITEMS?
YOU CAN FETCH ALL THAT IN A MINUTE.
LISTEN TO THAT.
IT'S EVEN BETTER THAN OURS.
HELLO, DEAR.
- HYACINTH!
RICHARD.
- Man:
WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU GONE NOW?
!
VIOLET, PAY ATTENTION WHEN I'M YELLING AT YOU!
GET LOST!
OH, NOT YOU.
HIM.
LOVELY TO SEE YOU BOTH.
BYE.
WHO WAS THIS GUY YOU WERE WITH
IN THE BUS SHELTER IN MILTON STREET?
DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM.
YOU LIKED HIM.
IT'S NOT AS IF IT WAS SOMEBODY YOU DIDN'T LIKE.
SOUNDS AS IF YOU LIKED HIM BETTER.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I LIKED HIM?
!
HE WAS A FRIEND OF YOURS.
OH, NICE!
SOME FRIEND!
IT'S NOT AS IF WE WERE MARRIED AT THE TIME.
FATHER'S GONE.
DID YOU KNOW SHE USED TO BE AT A BUS SHELTER
IN MILTON STREET WITH SOME GUY?
ONLY ON FRIDAYS.
- WHAT GUY?
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW-WHAT GUY?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "FATHER'S GONE"?
HE'S GONE WITH HIS BUCKET, LOOKING FOR ANOTHER LOAD.
DO YOU MEAN THAT SHELTER AT THE BOTTOM END OF MILTON STREET?
THAT'S THE ONE.
I SPENT SOME HAPPY HOURS IN THAT SHELTER.
SOUNDS AS THOUGH EVERYBODY EXCEPT ME
SPENT HAPPY HOURS IN THAT BUS SHELTER.
I THINK HE'S JEALOUS.
OO-OOH!
OH-HH, I THINK THAT'S SO SWEET!
I WOULDN'T MIND, YOU WERE ALWAYS BORROWING YOUR BUS FARE.
THIS LOOKS RATHER GOOD.
NOT QUITE MY CANDLELIGHT SUPPER, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY ELEGANT.
Violet:
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO CHOKE ME?
Bruce: 'CAUSE I HATE YOU!
I CAN'T STAND YOU!
WHY DON'T WE JUST PHONE ROUND AND CANCEL EVERYBODY?
RICHARD, I WILL NOT DISAPPOINT PEOPLE.
WE HAVE FRIENDS COMING TONIGHT
WHO ARE EXPECTING A BON VIVANT BUFFET AND ALFRESCO MANCHETTES,
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO RECEIVE.
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ROW INDOORS?
IT'LL QUIETEN DOWN.
IT'LL HAVE TO.
IF IT DOESN'T WE'LL DROWN IT OUT WITH MUSIC.
DO WE HAVE ANY MUSIC?
- DON'T MAKE DIFFICULTIES, RICHARD.
TAKE A POSITIVE ATTITUDE, DEAR.
I WANT THIS EVENING TO BE ELEGANT AND MEMORABLE.
DON'T DO THAT!
I HAVE A FEELING IT IS GOING TO BE MEMORABLE.
HMMM.
OH, YES, THAT'S REALLY LOVELY.
AN ELEGANT GASTRONOMIC DELIGHT.
ARE YOU ON TOP OF THE BARBECUE, RICHARD?
I'M GETTING THERE.
SLOWLY.
Violet:
YOU'VE HIDDEN THE CARVING KNIFE AGAIN!
CARVING KNIFE, DID YOU HEAR THAT?
RICHARD, I WILL NOT HAVE YOU EAVESDROPPING ON PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS.
DO YOU CALL THAT PRIVATE?
- Violet:
GET OUT OF MY WAY!
DO SOMETHING, DEAR.
Violet:
I HATE YOU!
YOUR LEGS ARE TOO SHORT!
- WAIT, I HAVE AN IDEA.
I'M GOING NOWHERE NEAR THEM
IF THEY'RE WAVING CARVING KNIVES AROUND.
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DROWN OUT THEIR VOICES.
NOR AM I CONTACTING THE ROYAL ARTILLERY.
NO.
JUST GO AND HAVE A LOOK INSIDE,
AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIND SOME LARGE SHEETS OF CARD
AND A THICK PEN.
WHAT FOR?
- NEVER YOU MIND.
COULDN'T WE HAVE A PUNCTURE OR SOMETHING?
COULDN'T THE CAR BREAK DOWN AND THEN WE COULDN'T POSSIBLY GET THERE?
YOU PROMISED THE VICAR YOU'D COME.
YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE EACH OTHER MUTUAL SUPPORT.
Bruce:
IF I HAD A BRAIN, DO YOU THINK I'D BE MARRIED TO YOU?
THERE!
BUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
HOLD IT UP AND HOPE THAT VIOLET AND BRUCE WILL SURRENDER?
NO!
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BARBECUE SINGSONG.
SURELY YOU CAN UNDERSTAND ANYONE HIDING FROM THE BUCKET WOMAN.
YES, OF COURSE I CAN.
WHAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IS WHY YOU FELT
YOU NEEDED THE "MORAL SUPPORT"
OF THREE ATTRACTIVE YOUNG LADIES.
Bruce:
YOU'RE THE ONE WITH THE MOUTH!
- REALLY THINK THIS'LL WORK?
IT WILL IF WE SING LOUD ENOUGH.
THAT'S PROBABLY ELIZABETH AND EMMET.
AT LEAST IT'S QUIET AT THE MOMENT.
THEY'LL BE IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS.
LOOKING FOR THE JUGULAR.
Hyacinth:
HELLO, ELIZABETH AND EMMET!
Both:
HELLO.
- WELCOME TO OUR BARBECUE.
WITH THE UNIQUE SING-FOR-YOUR-SUPPER SPECIALTY.
OH NO-SHE'S NOT GOING TO SING?
PLEASE, TELL ME SHE'S NOT GOING TO SING.
SHH, BE QUIET.
WELL, I MUST SAY THE BUFFET LOOKS LOVELY, HYACINTH.
THANK YOU, DEAR.
HOW DOES THE SINGING SIDE OF THE EVENING WORK?
OH, IT'S A PARTY GAME BASED ON AN IDEA
ORIGINALLY CONCEIVED BY HENRY VIII FOR HIS BANQUETS.
HOW INTERESTING.
- YES, FASCINATING.
YES, IT'S PERFECTLY SIMPLE.
WHENEVER I PICK UP ONE OF THESE CARDS,
THEN EVERYONE SINGS THE SONG IT NAMES.
RULE BRITANNIA!
All reluctantly:
* BRITANNIA RULES THE WAVES *
* BRITONS NEVER, NEVER, NEVER SHALL BE SLAVES- *
COME ALONG, RICHARD, SING UP THERE.
* RULE, BRITANNIA, BRITANNIA RULES THE WAVES *
* BRITONS NEVER, NEVER, NEVER SHALL BE SLAVES- *
LOVELY, LOVELY.
NOW...
WHAT CAN I OFFER YOU AS A PRELIMINARY NIBBLE?
DO YOU THINK SHE HAS ANY SUICIDE PILLS?
EMMET, BEHAVE YOURSELF.
OH, HELLO AGAIN, VICAR.
HOW NICE TO SEE YOU AND YOUR GOOD LADY.
GOOD EVENING, MRS. BUCKET.
- "BOUQUET."
DO RELAX AND ENJOY YOURSELVES.
Violet:
WHY DO YOU GO THAT FUNNY COLOR?
OH!
* THERE'LL ALWAYS BE AN ENGLAND *
* WHILE THERE'S A COUNTRY LANE *
* WHEREVER THERE'S A COTTAGE SMALL *
* BESIDE A FIELD OF GRAIN *
* THERE'LL ALWAYS BE AN ENGLAND *
* AND ENGLAND SHALL BE FREE... *
JUST A PARTY GAME, VICAR.
YOU'LL SOON GET THE HANG OF IT.
RICHARD'LL SOON HAVE THE HOT FOOD READY.
WON'T YOU, DEAR?
BUT IN THE MEANTIME, DO HELP YOURSELF TO MY ANCILLARY ITEMS.
THANK YOU, HYACINTH.
- Bruce:
DON'T BITE ME THERE!
YOU'RE ALWAYS BITING ME THERE!
* THERE'LL ALWAYS BE AN ENGLAND *
* WHILE THERE'S A COUNTRY LANE- *
* SHE'LL BE COMING 'ROUND THE MOUNTAIN WHEN SHE COMES *
* SHE'LL BE COMING 'ROUND THE MOUNTAIN *
* COMING 'ROUND THE MOUNTAIN *
* COMING 'ROUND THE MOUNTAIN WHEN SHE COMES... *
WONDERFUL.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING.
NOW DO HELP YOURSELVES.
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE IT ALL HOME AGAIN.
IT ALL HAS TO BE EATEN.
- Violet:
HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT!
* OLD macdonald HAD A FARM EE-I-EE-I-OH *
- * AND ON THAT FARM THERE WAS A- * - * DUCK!
*
* EE-I-EE-I-OH *
* WITH A QUACK-QUACK HERE AND A QUACK-QUACK THERE- *
OOH LOOK!
MRS. BOUQUET, FIRE!
OH, RICHARD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOUR BARBECUE'S OUT OF CONTROL.
DADDY!
WHAT A MIRACLE!
JUST WHEN WE NEED HIM,
DADDY APPEARS WITH A BUCKET OF WATER.
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU!
I REALLY HAVE!
DULL OLD THING YOU ARE- GO AWAY!
OH DEAR, WHAT A PITY BRUCE CAN'T STAY.
YOU WILL JOIN US, VIOLET DEAR?
I THOUGHT WE MIGHT TAKE HOME A CHINESE.
Even the children of this country know that the deal for tanks which we had with the Gunstorm Company has a pay-off over a billion involved.
Who is the man who has swindled the money?
Who is the one to have betrayed the people of India?
Whoever he is...
he's now within our reach and he will not be able to escape.
That's my word to you.
In order to find out the identity of that man I have appointed three responsible citizens of this city.
I'm Mr. Vishwasrao's Deputy Minister.
With Gunstorm, an American arms-manufacturing Company our Government had entered into an agreement.
I pocketed the brokerage in the deal that took place.
This is something that only people in the American company know and I know.
And now, before Mr. Vishwasrao goes to America and unearths my name and turns me into a mere peon from a Deputy Minister this mission must be carried out.
Otherwise, neither will you be of any use to me and nor will I be of any use to you.
- That's right, isn't it?
- Yes, it is right.
It's already pretty late...
people are waiting for you.
Two members of the Enquiry Commission are dead.
You're the 3rd...
aren't you afraid?
How can anyone be scared of traitors?
What do the traitors of the nation think?
Will the elimination of three individuals wipe out the nation too?
Will we now be scared?
Not at all!
This Enquiry Commission...
will now be headed by me.
I always wanted you to be at the forefront of this noble endeavor!
Victory to India!
Quiet, now!
This doesn't work!
I'll get you another, once we get home.
Okay?
I want one right now!
Make him shut up, will you?
This is terrible!
What are you up to, Mister!
This is a special bus...
there are no vacant seats!
Get aside!
There no special buses as far as we are concerned!
Can't you see, the bus is full!
Where'll you sit?
On my lap?
!
You will provide the lap but Tony, where will you sit?
Any seat will do for me!
- This bag?
- It's made of leather.
You'll get a slap, smart-ass!
Make yourself scarce!
I can't get scarce... but I can get fatter, if you wish.
You want to mess with us, do you?
There's no room for that in here how about stepping out?
- Is it?
!
This punk's itching for a fight!
Let's get even then!
Come on!
Let's go, driver!
That was a great trick!
The bus halts for ten minutes...
you may refresh yourselves!
And take care of your belongings.
Let's go and buy a chocolate for you.
It's the same boy who was in the bus.
Which means the smart-ass must be around too!
Let's look for him!
Give it to me...
- Did you find him?
- No...
He must be in the bus.
- Did you take a proper look?
- There he is!
Looks like they've arrived.
Why, smart-ass?
!
They're bulletproof windshields!
Smash them!
You will not escape, Minister!
Who are you?
A servant...
A government-servant.
The one you just killed...
...was my brother!
The Law knows no relationships.
Give me a soda.
Minister Vishwasrao was attacked on the National Highway this morning.
A report from India This Week.
There was this man from there...
...from there look at his courage... he came charging from there and sprang on one of the terrorists here.
He gave the chap a sound thrashing!
Where did this man spring from?
We just couldn't know...
This man has killed a brother of mine and has had another arrested.
This is indeed our good fortune!
That man, whom we don't know, was present at the Inn and Mr. Vishwasrao's life was saved.
- How did you find the capsule?
- Third-rate.
- What?
- Do you call that a program?
It's worse than a newsreel!
It's absolutely bogus!
Why is it "bogus", Uncle?
You've called me "Uncle" again!
Had you not been my niece, I'd have dumped you in the dustbin!
But at least tell me what mistake I've made.
Good Lord!
I'll have to tell her about her mistakes now!
You've interviewed the public, okay.
But where's the "hero's" interview?
Who's the hero?
The chap who was present at the Inn and who saved the minister.
Now look, Sanjana I think you'd better return to your parents in America find a good boy and settle down in life.
Building a career is not your cup of tea.
Bye...
You want that man's interview, don't you?
I will hunt him down and get his interview.
We've made enquiry's about the man.
His name is Amar Damji.
Such brave young men should get a reward for their bravery.
He has an amazing agility in his body with his brains working much faster.
He's no ordinary man.
Beware, Deshpande... the enemy cometh in the garb of a friend!
Don't you worry, Jamdade...
We'll immortalize this Amar Damji... much before his time.
- I hear, he's very strict.
- Let's see...
Welcome, Mr. Amar!
I'm Jamdade...
And my name is Deshpande.
Please come...
You were really brave to have saved the Minister's life!
But you'd better be careful;
They're a dangerous lot.
But you won't have to be scared, till we're both around!
We're not only officers here, but two strong "shoulders"...!
...who take the entire responsibility of the office!
Perhaps this is why you have a stoop in your left-shoulder.
I have full confidence in these shoulders you possess.
I'm sure that... if I'm killed you will surely carry my corpse to the crematorium.
But why should you die?
May death befall your enemies!
Besides, we haven't joined the force to lose our lives, have we?
The truth is that we join the Police force to sacrifice our lives.
I'm absolutely ready and willing.
Get prepared too, and join me inside.
You have been sent here on a Special Mission.
But you have proved even before taking charge that you are the Police Officer who can protect the lives of the important personalities of the city.
There's another thing...
You will also have to find about those people who are bent on spreading disturbances in the nation.
I realize what I have to do.
Those, who are out to destroy our Nation will very soon be behind bars.
The Minister's here, sir.
- How are you, Majumdar?
- Fine.
You could've sent for me.
Why did you take the trouble?
I've come to thank this brave police officer.
I know such brave officers don't accept words of gratitude.
They attribute their deeds to their duty.
But it's my duty too to thank courageous brave officers like you.
Who has saved my life.
Who could have attacked you?
Do you have any suspicions?
I never grope in the darkness, Majumdar.
Write to me for anything that you need to fight these terrorists.
I'll immediately endorse it.
Glory to India.
This Court sentences Raghunath Singh, alias Dashrath Singh under Section 302 and 304 to death.
I announce in this very Court that I will not let you live!
You have killed my brother...
...my Munna!
Till yesterday I accepted contracts to kill other people...
But today, I have given my self a contract to destroy you!
- I will destroy you!
- And I will await you.
You will not have to wait for very long!
I will certainly avenge my brother's death!
I will not let you live...
I will not!
What's all this?
Why have all of you got into my house?
We had no other way, Minister.
I am still not a proper Minister, my friend I'm still a mere Deputy Minister.
All thanks to you!
You first goofed up in killing Vishwasrao and now descend with a battalion on my house!
Are you out to have me sacked from my position then?
Vishwasrao's security has been doubled!
And for an investigation in what you did... what is he called?
By calling someone Amar, does he really become Amar (immortal)?
Forget Vishwasrao for the time being and get rid of Amar.
No...
Nobody will even touch him.
Why is that?
- He's not related to you, is he?
- No.
He is Raghu's prey.
Now listen, Madam that Raghu hasn't merely attempted to rape a woman!
...that he'd be out of prison in a week!
He's been held under TAD A!
T-A-D-A!
How does it matter whether Raghu kills Amar or somebody else does!
It does.
It makes a lot of difference.
Govind was our brother.
Therefore, his death will be avenged, as we want to.
Whether you avenge it your way...
...or mine be quick with whatever you have to do.
If Amar Damji were to start bothering me then I won't spare you.
- I'm coming.
- Hurry up.
- Hurry up, Amar...
- Are you too coming with us?
Yes.
I must pay his fees and even go to the market.
Are you comfortable?
- Drink your milk, Amar...
- No, I will not have milk!
- But why?
- I won't have it till Papa returns.
- Who the hell are you?
!
- A thief... no!
A servant here!
And who are you?
The man of the house.
- It's pronounced AMAR.
Not AMAD.
- That's it...
A-M-A-D!
- Not with a 'D'... with an 'R'.
- That's what I've said!
But, sir, why did you have to come in from the rear like a thief?
Had that iron-bar struck me, I'd have been dead, right?
!
Just a minute!
Just you hold on!
Who's in there?
!
There's no one in there!
You may go in now.
You seem to be a smart detective.
You've got it!
By God, you've recognized me!
You could recognize the genius hidden in me!
I'll open it...
Where were you trained?
Nowhere at all!
All those detective-novels I've read have made my brain tick!
- It shows on your face.
And how will it not?
!
I have it in my blood!
My grandpa was a jailer of the British era!
Then how haven't you still become an Inspector?
Do you think I don't want to be an Inspector?
The Police Department won't let me!
You will see once I don the uniform as to what I can do!
Now that you've been transferred here, please do something for me!
Well, okay... but can you do something for me right now?
- Can I get a cup of tea?
- What's mere tea?
A "sherbet" or any other cold drink...
I will get you everything you want!
In this house, it's I who...
- Damji here...
- This is the collector speaking.
- Yes?
- The file of evidence against Chaube, which you have...
- Why are you worried?
That file on Chaube is in my custody.
Till such time as the file reaches your desk, no one can even touch it.
You don't know anything about Chaube.
He's a Councilor only in name.
Otherwise, he's a dreaded hoodlum.
I'm also told that he's coming to your house.
Be careful, okay?
Very well.
- Was it the file on Jeevanlal?
- Yes.
- You both will remain inside.
- But you...
Don't question me, Shanti...
and do as I say.
- I'm getting scared...
- Go on now...
- Suppose something happens to you?
- Nothing will happen to me.
I, Mr. Chaube, have stepped onto your threshold, Damji you can say you've found someone to pay you your price.
One loses a lot of precious time in observing social niceties.
Don't worry about my time...
I've got plenty of it.
But I have none!
I've only just become a Member of Legislative Assembly I must be a Member of Parliament and a Minister too there's so much to do in such a short life!
Very true.
You have a very short life.
Shall we use the 'short-cut' then?
Where's the need to sit down?
Now look I've already paid you in cash.
And I also promise you a promotion.
Just give me that file in which there is evidence against me.
Now look, a politician has great reach...
If that is true... then stretch and pick up the file.
So that is the file, eh!
- Beat him up!
- Don't you dare!
You won't come around like this.
You're bent on killing yourself!
People like me join the Police Force to sacrifice their lives.
- What happened?
- A lot.
- Tell me something...
- Chaube will always rue this day.
- And where are you going now?
- To the Collector's office.
Mother...
Mother...
What's happened, mother?
Your father hasn't yet returned, son.
Go to sleep now.
Auntie?
Shanti... my dear...
What happened, sir?
Nothing...
I happened to recall something...
I'll take it.
Just a minute.
It's a Sanjana Roy... she wants to interview you.
Refuse it.
I don't want to give an interview.
He does not want to give an interview.
That's correct.
Had Damji listened to me, you'd have still been a married woman.
I tried to make him see reason.
But he wouldn't understand.
Haven't you become a widow now?
And look at that boy... isn't he looking like a proper orphan?
!
As if he were a beggar's son!
Never mind!
Just step inside...
Run away, Amar!
- Mother!
- Grab the boy!
Run away son...
...for my sake, run away!
Get him!
Don't let him escape!
Look at these dirty clothes!
Even the laundry would refuse them!
And it's so hot, I feel like just stripping!
Must be someone for you.
- Is Mr. Amar Damji there?
- Why?
I'm Sanjana Roy, a journalist from "India This Week" we want to interview him.
Oh yes!
He's very much here.
Mr. Amar!
Come along.
Do you want to become an Inspector?
Good Lord!
Must you ask me now?
!
- Dress up quickly then!
- Why?
Am I in the nude right now?
- Tea for you, Madam...
- Move aside!
- Where's your boss?
- He'll be here in a minute.
Madam... will you take a photograph of mine, too?
Go and attend to your work.
Is everything set, Mohan?
Here's the boss!
- I want an interview with you.
- That's very good how much of money will I be paid for it?
- Money?
- What else!
I've spent money too!
How will I give you an interview for nothing?
So what if I'm doing a job...
I haven't lost my business acumen!
Now getting cracking with the interview!
I want to know how you saved Mr. Vishwasrao's life.
He loves playing with danger!
- Who's "He"?
- I mean... it's me!
When children used to play with toy-guns I amused myself with marbles.
- Marbles!
I went wrong!
It happens when I speak to a girl!
I get nervous!
He means he's been playing with guns and bullets since he was a child.
Sir's right!
"Sir"?
Who's that?
This servant of mine!
The chap's name is "Sir"!
I see.
Can you recall the moment when the guns of the terrorists were about to spray bullets how did you feel then?
- How did I feel?
!
Anger!
He was absolutely livid!
- Yes.
I was fuming!
- Why is that?
Because I wondered why I was walking into the jaws of death!
I wanted someone to stop me!
But you said you loved playing with danger!
That's it; he says something and does something else.
Exactly!
That's the problem.
I never do what I say I will!
And I rescued Vishwasrao from the jaws of death beat up the killers, made life miserable for them and brought the same old heart.
How have you found my interview?
There's a last question.
Would you suggest something for the improvement of the Police force?
Once... just once let me get my hands on a uniform and you will see then you will see!
- What?
- How I iron the uniform...
- Iron it?
- How I have it laundered!
- Laundered?
What do you mean?
He means a cop's reputation should never get tainted by corruption!
Wonderful!
Bravo, chappie!
Thank you!
...For the interview!
And thanks to you, too.
Why him?
It's I who gave you the interview... for free!
That's right.
But had it not been for him I wouldn't have understood half the things you said!
That's Raghu; the most dangerous member of their gang.
He's not afraid of killing... nor is he scared of losing his life.
It's good that you arrested him.
It's a major success for us.
And this is Shiva...
Raghu and Govind's brother.
He is the one operating from a secret hideout.
His aides are Rani and Raju Pandit.
You have to get to Shiva.
And this is the only picture we have with us.
Mangal Singh... known for the big, Rajasthani moustache he sports.
- An acid caused his left...
- Who are you talking about, sir?
This is my daughter, Anjali.
- What doubt?
- He doesn't look like a Commando.
That's something special about Amar.
He doesn't seem to be what he is.
I have a specialty, too.
I don't seem to be what I really am.
And what I am, I don't seem to be.
- Did you understand?
- Yes, I did.
I'm leaving for my college.
Bye...
You can choose any officer you need for your assistance.
- I'd like to handle the case alone.
- Why is that?
- Don't you trust my officers?
- It's not that at all...
But to win a game of chess you need a person to concentrate, not several brains to spoil things.
Wow!
Wow!
Wonderful!
- Mr. Chaturvedi!
- We seem to share our ideas!
How could you be so bright, even when you're not a Chaturvedi?
- That's Amar Damji, sir.
- I know that I know the contents of a letter from the look of the envelope!
Now look Mr. Vishwasrao must be a Minister for everyone in the world.
But for me... he's like an elder brother.
He's like a parent to me.
In fact, you have not merely saved his life you have saved me from being orphaned.
And you... you don't really know what it is to be orphaned.
I know very well... how it feels to be orphaned.
If there is anything you need...
...at anytime ask me for it.
Okay?
Who do you think this person is?
This?
It's Saab (Sir);
Amar Damji's servant.
Oh Lord!
People are destroyed by their enemies but in my case, my own niece is out to ruin me!
Now look, sir... there are no relationships in business.
Just tell me what I've done.
Then tell me something, Madam.
Do you want people to tear out my hair at this age of mine?
- Or tear my clothes?
- No...
Or then hurl stones at me as they would at a madman?
Then where is Amar Damji's interview?
There it is!
"This" is Amar Damji.
That's his servant there...
...and this is your ticket for America.
That chap's my servant.
His name itself is "Sir".
I get nervous when I talk to girls.
It's you, eh?
!
Welcome!
Welcome!
My interview seems to have been a roaring success, right?
Don't act smart... or I'll have you sent to prison!
I'll never give an interview again!
I swear it by my grandfather!
- Get on with it!
- I will, friend...
Forgive me, Madam!
...I only did as Mr. Amar asked me to.
What else could I do?
- But now you will do as I say.
- What is that?
!
- Is this report complete?
- Yes, sir.
Pass the phone to Inspector Amar.
You may leave...
It's Amar speaking.
- I have your servant in my custody!
- Who is the man?
If you want to save his life...
- Who are you?
- What will you do knowing that?
Listen to his voice, if you can't believe me.
Save me, Mr. Amar, or else, this chap will kill me!
Did you hear that?
"You're on foot and your goal is far away"
"My sympathies are with you"
"As I say, darling...
I will walk with you"
"As I say, darling...
I will walk with you"
"What are we waiting for?"
"I know it's a long journey;
but why are you afraid?"
"I'm young and passionate;
there's romance in the air"
"As I say, darling...
I will walk in step with you"
"You have been walking...
you must take a breather"
"You have been walking...
you must take a breathing"
"Walk you must..."
"You have far to go...
so listen to me"
"As I say, darling...
I will walk in step with you"
"As I say, darling...
I will walk in step with you"
"I've made a mistake, all right"
"But please don't ridicule me like this"
"Looks like you'll say..."
"don't worry me"
"C'mon, sisters...
beat him up"
"It was a mistake someone else made"
"So don't treat me like this"
"Looks like you'll say...
don't bother me"
"I'm not guilty, I'm innocent"
"I hope I don't hurt them"
"Why have you stopped walking, darling?"
"Why have you stopped walking, darling?"
"What are we waiting for?"
"You have a long way to go, okay.
But what are you afraid of"
"I'm young and passionate;
there's romance in the air"
"As I say, darling..."
"I've heard you, lady"
"As I say, darling..."
"I've heard you, lady"
We sent our delegates there on two occasions but the Gunstorm Company refused to divulge the name of the person who has pocketed over a billion of public money.
It is a matter of great regret that some corrupt politicians are filling their coffers with money from such deals.
Can you tell us what you and your Government are doing in this regard?
I will myself go to America now and I can assure you that I will not return empty-handed.
I will get the name of the person who is the real culprit.
And it will not be me or you...
but the public who will punish him.
My deputy Mr. Chaturvedi will now answer your queries.
Jai Hind.
Yes, gentlemen?
I have all the answers for you.
What are you doing in this uniform?
Didn't I tell you that I don't look what I really am?
- I'm a Cadet of the N.C.C.
- I see.
Excuse me, sir...
I have something to ask you for.
- When are you coming home?
- Er?
Very soon!
...as to how they work.
If I could get some live-coverage...
I'll solve your problem just now.
This is Ms Sanjana Roy from "India This Week".
She wants to make a TV program on your profession.
- Is a week enough for you?
- I'll do my best, sir.
- Even two weeks are okay!
- But, sir...
At 9 a.m. Tomorrow.
Once I get my hands on you!
What do you think my first move should be, Hira?
My moves are all haywire, sir!
Get out now!
Come on!
What are you up to?
The rat's hiding in the hole.
I'm trying to get it out.
Don't put your hand in there, it might bite you!
To ferret the rat out, tempt it out with a crispy...
I mean, tempt it with some bread.
- What's in it?
- Open up!
- A gun!
- Not a mere gun, it's an army-gun!
Forget it.
I know where this gun belongs.
Let's go!
Over here!
What's it?
Get lost!
You won't get anything more!
- But we've come to give something.
- What is it?
We won't tell you.
We'll tell Mr. Kasim... it's imported.
Come along.
- Where did you find this?
- In the dustbin!
Lying there!
In the dustbin, did you say?
You dare lie to me!
- I swear by my mother!
- Are we fools to lie to you?
Drive them away with some money.
Is that all, sir?
We came to you with great hopes!
We knew only you'd need such a thing in the whole of the town!
- What was that?
!
- It's okay, sir...
- Get lost!
- Thanks, sir!
...we'll see you soon with something more.
That's a promise.
Well, Mister, have you seen a black-colored bag of mine?
- It had two guns...
- Hey punks!
Who the hell is he?
There it is!
Thank God I've found it!
It's just that the gun belongs to the Police Department.
To the Government.
One has to return it, doesn't he?
Hey!
Who the hell are you!
Shall we go to the lock-up then?
You'll get ample air and a lot of kicks there!
Who do you sell the guns to?
We don't sell them, sir.
It was only to knock someone off that I bought these two guns.
Those who "knock" others off are large-hearted enough to lose their own lives, too.
Let's see how large-hearted you are.
No... sir!
I'll tell you!
I sell them to Raju Pandit...
I don't know anything else, sir!
But I do know... that there are still bullets in my gun.
His stuff is arriving in a tanker, sir!
Can I know where we are going?
Don't you want to tell me?
That's okay!
What is the difference between the life of a commando and a commoner?
A commando is a commando and a common man is a common man.
Why don't you wear a uniform like the police?
Nor is your hair like the police.
Why don't you have it trimmed?
I don't wear a police-uniform, because I'm a Commando.
And I don't trim my hair because there's no barber where I stay.
Is this how you behave with every girl?
Is this what you've been trained in?
Will you stop your childish questions now?
Do I look like a child to you?
I've done a course in journalism!
- Do you understand?
- Oh yes.
You have indeed grown.
But only physically.
Not mentally.
Sit tight now.
If you fall your body will shrink like your brains!
So, I'm a kid!
I've no brains!
And you!
...you're the bright boy!
Is this a place to park your car?
Keep your camera ready.
Hey!
Look there!
We're sunk!
It's the same Inspector!
Move aside, Amar!
He won't budge!
Get down, all of you!
Out!
What is it?
Who do you think you are for stopping us like this?
You dare open fire!
Don't you know we're carrying oil in there?
Well, Inspector?
What kind of high-handedness is this?
- Where are you taking the stuff?
- What stuff?
Can't you see it's an oil tanker?
A tricky situation, Deshpande!
Let's find out...
What are you doing, sir?
It's only an oil tanker!
It has something else.
Not oil.
What else can there be, sir?
It's oil, for sure!
Get on top of the carrier and see what it contains!
What else can an oil-tanker contain, but oil, sir?
It's oil, sir.
Did you see that, sir?
Didn't we say it was oil!
Run!
It's amazing, sir!
One couldn't even dream that...
This is why we have great respect for you!
Get hold of these rascals!
Arrest them!
You dare carry explosives in an oil tanker!
You look like a street-side ruffian!
I'm going in and you will wait here.
If I don't return in 20 minutes, go straight to the police station.
Well, darling... haven't you recognized me?
No.
What drink will you have?
Orange or Lemon?
You don't think I've come shopping for fruits, do you?
- I want to meet Raju Pandit.
- Raju Pandit?
You bet!
Go and tell him Akhtar Hyderabadi has arrived.
What name was that?
I swear by the Charminar!
You've big eyes, not ears!
Go and tell him, will you?
Go on!
Call him over.
I'm Raju Pandit.
And who are you?
Well, Pal!
Have you forgotten Akhtar Hyderabadi?
- I think I've seen you somewhere.
- Speak softly and do not repeat what you just said in Hyderabad.
Even a kid would laugh at you!
After all, who does not know Akhtar Hyderabadi!
Now look, punk!
Stop picking my brains!
Come straight to the point.
What is it?
I want to buy an imported gun.
A gun?
!
Whoever told you that we sell guns here!
The guys out there.
Who else?
Actually, pal...
I've been sent here by Kasimbhai.
Have you got the dough?
Dough!
My pants are being pulled down with the weight of money!
If you don't believe me, should I show you?
Come along now.
My wife has a lover, Raju whose passions I want to put an end to!
Give me a gun that will pump all the bullets in him at one go!
Do you understand now?
They've fooled me enough!
Is this where the military's stocks its arms?
Wait for sometime.
Some more of my stuff is on its way.
AK-47s... automatic.
Show him whatever he wants, Murthy.
- This is Shiva speaking.
- What is it, Mr. Shiva?
Kasim has been arrested by the police.
And the vehicle carrying our arms has been seized.
- What?
!
- You must be careful now that cop could be hot on your trail.
Hold on for a minute...
- Do you intend to kill me!
- This is not even loaded!
Put it away.
I don't want a gun pointing at me!
Don't touch that.
I'll give you a punch that will drive you home.
Get it?
Yes, Mr. Shiva... that bird has flown into our cage!
What!
He's reached there too!
- I'll put him to sleep here and now!
- You will do nothing to him!
He has to be kept alive;
those are the boss's orders.
Very well then.
By the Charminar!
I can't quite decide which gun I must buy!
Your Charminar is now shaken, Akhtar Hyderabadi!
Forget the Charminar... not a stone in Hyderabad will budge!
Don't, Amar!
Drop your pistol, or I'll cut this girl to pieces!
Go on!
Throw it!
Drop your gun!
Now turn around!
Move now!
Walk, I said!
Why did you come after me?
I had to kill him because of you!
My efforts have all been wasted.
Or I'd have...
You forgot your gun in the car.
I thought I'd help...
- And so...
- Henceforth, do as you are told!
Raise your hair...
Now look, Sanjana.
You need not come with me from tomorrow.
I think you've already got what you wanted.
No...
I still haven't got, what I wanted.
At 9 tomorrow, then.
"What's wrong with me?"
"I've fallen in love"
"It has been love at first sight"
"I don't know how it happened...
tell me, O heart"
"What's wrong with me?
I've fallen in love"
"I lost my heart at first sight"
"I fell in love"
"How did it happen, I don't know;
tell me, O heart"
"What's wrong with me?
I've fallen in love"
"I possess a clean heart;
I never ever knew I'd fall in love"
"Do not torment me now that my passions are aroused"
"I possess a clean heart...
I never knew I'd fall in love"
"Do not torment me now that my passions are aroused"
"I hope we do nothing untoward"
"What's happened to me?
I seem to have fallen in love"
"I lost my heart at first sight"
"Every evening I miss you"
"I must return before it's dawn"
"Every evening I miss you"
"I must return before it's dawn"
"There's a whole night ahead"
"Let's be together now"
"What's happened to me?
I've fallen in love"
"How did it happen?
You tell me"
"How did it happen?
I've fallen in love"
"How did it happen to me?
Tell me, my love"
Well, Mr. Shiva...
Ms Rani your brother asked us to keep Amar alive.
We did as he wished!
But with Amar being alive, Raju Pandit got killed!
Now tell me, till when we must sit twiddling our thumbs!
Why are you rubbing salt into your wounds, Chaturvedi?
There you are!
It hurts, doesn't it?
I've been telling you repeatedly that it's a very simple task...
Kidnap his mother... bring her here.
I'll handle everything else.
- His mother is dead.
- Then bring his father.
He doesn't even have a father.
He's not a "son-of-the-soil", is he?
He must have some relative...
someone his own!
He has no one... he has no weaknesses whatsoever.
One is not born with a weakness it has to be created.
I'll involve him in such a quagmire now that no matter how much he tries, he will not be able to wriggle out!
- Let's go, sonny...
- Yes, Uncle.
- You wait here.
- Where are you going?
- Upstairs...
- I'm getting scared!
- How can I remain here all alone?
- I had asked you not to come!
Now quietly sit here!
And don't get scared...
...nothing will happen.
Let's do this... keep this gun for your protection.
If I don't return in 10 minutes, go to the police station.
And don't get out of the van.
Understand?
No!
Don't come closer!
What happened?
He's dead.
What's this you have done?
You've killed him!
What will happen now?
I gave you a gun to scare him off.
Not to kill him!
I don't know how the gun went off!
- But he was attacking me!
- What the hell does that mean!
- He came charging at me, and...
- And you opened fire?
!
Do you know you can be sentenced to death for murder?
Save me, Amar...
You know this wasn't intentional.
- You know he tried to attack me...
- Now let me think!
- There's only one way now.
- What is that?
I'll take the blame.
But... what will you do then?
There's no other way.
I'll handle it.
We shouldn't wait here any more.
Come on, let's go.
Let's go.
Here's your ticket.
I got it with great difficulty.
Don't worry.
I'll take care of everything here.
Will you be sent to prison?
No.
I'll claim that he was killed in an encounter.
- At the most, I might lose my job.
- Please try to forgive me...
I'd never forgive myself if you were to be punished.
I know what I'm doing.
I am only worried about you.
Whatever you did today is something I'll never forget.
Your bag.
Air India Flight Al 101 to New York is ready for take-off.
Passengers are requested to proceed for their security check.
You killed him.
You know you can be sentenced to death for this.
There is no other alternative but to take the blame myself.
While lying still, I was listening to everything.
As she got down from the car, she said, "please save me Amar!"
And listen to what Amar says, "I will take the blame myself"
And she gets emotional and says, "What will happen to you, Amar?"
Which was the dialogue that scared her?
"You can be sentenced to death on charges of murder"
- Sanjana, listen to me...
- What is there to listen now?
I've heard everything.
Look, I have something to explain to you.
There is no need for that.
I know you too well by now.
By ridiculing me in front of others, you have proved that you care for no one, except yourself.
Even if... the other happens to be in love with you.
"You have come to make a place for yourself in my heart"
"You have come to make a place for yourself in my heart"
"You have come to make a place in my heart:
"You have now come to be my love"
"You have come to make a place in my heart"
"You have come to live in my heart"
"You have come to be my love"
"You have made a place in my heart"
"You have been kind to choose me"
"Even if you don't utter another word, I've heard everything"
"You have come to be my love"
"You have made a place in my heart"
"You have made a place in my heart"
"You're a deadly youth"
"You have beauty that kills"
"We're both drunk today...
- On love"
"You are now my darling"
"You have come to make a place in my heart"
"You have made a place for yourself in my heart"
- Uncle?
Is that you?
- Yes, it's me.
But Papa's not at home.
I know that.
He's gone to Poona, hasn't he?
He said there was a file at home which I must collect.
Please come in, Uncle.
Mr. Majumdar had told me about a file it is very important.
Where is it lying?
- Could this be the one, Uncle?
- Let me see.
No, this is very thin.
That was a thick file.
You have become very fat, too.
I'm not fat at all, uncle.
I hope Amar has not taken the file, has he?
What do you know?
What do you know!
But how did you get to know?
Didn't I say I guess the contents of a letter from the mere look of its envelope!
Okay tell me now... have you ever fallen in love?
Have you done some of those kissing scenes they show on TV?
- Should I talk about your wedding?
- With whom?
- With Amar.
- With Amar?
Should I propose your marriage to Amar?
- Will you do that?
- Why not?
I'm a public-servant.
It's my duty to help out.
Go and telephone him now and tell him that I'd like to speak to him.
Just a minute, please...
Mr. Amar.
It's for you.
- Amar here...
- Amar, this is Anjali.
There is something I must talk to you about.
Will you come over?
- Now?
At this time?
- Yes...
It's very important.
Okay.
I'll be there in an hour.
- He'll be here in an hour!
- Clap to that!
What kind of hands to you have?
So dry what are you up to at college?
- What are you doing?
- I'm kissing it...
Didn't you like it?
I'll do it nicely again...
Who's that?
Amar?
How are you?
What has brought you there so late in the night?
- Where's Anjali?
- There's something wrong here.
Please come immediately.
What's wrong?
Everything's fine, I hope.
I can't tell you over the phone.
Please come over immediately.
- This is Amar Damji speaking.
- Yes, sir?
Reach the Commissioner's house immediately.
With the finger-prints expert.
- What's up, sir?
- Anjali Majumdar has been murdered.
- That's enough, sir.
- And here you are.
The move I've made this time has killed the foe and not harmed me, too!
- Please come with me, sir.
- What's the matter?
It's important.
Please come along.
What's wrong?
!
According to the report, the finger-prints belong to him.
They're his finger-prints!
The finger-print expert, Dr. Moghe, please present yourself!
You're a renowned finger-print expert and also a doctor.
Is it ever possible for one to not even touch something and for his finger-prints to still be left on some objects?
Not at all.
Mr. Amar claims that the finger-prints found on the scene of the crime are not his.
He also claims that he did not touch anything there.
The finger-prints found at the scene of the crime and his finger-prints are the same.
It's a lie!
He's lying!
It's not he who's lying...
it's you!
You're not a human-being, you're an animal!
A wolf!
Please testify in the Witness Box only.
When I called from Poona that fateful night it was none other than this man who received the call!
That is what I'm trying to tell you, sir!
Why would I take the call, if I were guilty?
A man can lie... but his finger-prints do not lie!
They cannot!
It is this man who has killed her!
I was going to get my daughter married to you anyway then why did you do this?
Why?
Please believe me, sir!
I'm innocent, sir!
In view of the evidence available this Court sentences Amar Damji, for the rape and murder of Anjali Majumdar, to death.
I had not expected this of you.
I'm innocent, Sanjana.
Whether someone believes you or not but I...
trust you implicitly.
Take care of yourself.
We'll rest only after we've killed you, Amar Damji!
You thought you were very smart!
You've made a mistake by provoking us!
- What are you looking at?
- We'll kill you!
We will not spare you!
We'll kill you, Inspector!
Did you hear that?
We'll kill you!
He's come here, too.
Your time is up...
You've come to the right place I won't spare you!
Shut up!
Go on... go inside.
I don't want any trouble from the three of you!
Well, sir, you got us caught for nothing, didn't you?
He's no more a "Sir"...
he's a criminal like us.
...of our own status.
He'll long for his parents, just as we do!
Only then will he realize the suffering of parents!
These guys are cops!
They don't give a damn for suffering!
They only want medals... promotions the world be damned!
Do you think I'm working only for medals?
People like you can never understand the sacrifices of the police.
Because you have never even attempted to.
As for the parents and family you refer to they are all your own.
Have you ever thought of those parents whose lives these animals have destroyed?
And who are still destroying it?
And those who are ruining this very nation?
I'm doing my work only as an Indian and not for some obscure medal.
In the discharge of my duties, if I have to destroy your houses I will have no qualms.
Stop!
No one will touch him!
This is the day I have waited for.
Have you recognized me?
!
I still haven't been able to forget my brother's death!
...I'd have avenged his death on that very day by pulling out the intestines from your stomach!
But what could I do?
I was held firmly by the men in uniform!
But today... nobody will come between us.
It'll only be me... and you!
What had you said then?
Servant, eh?
A government-servant!
By saving that wretched Minister and by killing my brother, you've incurred my enemity!
Beginning with you and that Minister, I will wipe out the government too!
All three of you!
Mr. Jailer!
All hell's broken loose!
Come quickly!
Do something quickly, sir!
Get out, you swines!
You're always up to trouble!
Get out!
It's already Four... sit in the van.
We've to go the quarries.
Come on, leave him!
Take different routes.
We'll meet later in Bombay.
Before that, I have to complete an unfinished task.
The punk's dead!
- But how did they escape?
- They had a scuffle in the van and the van met with an accident.
Search every nook and corner of the city for them.
Regardless of whether the other prisoners are found or not I want Amar, in any condition.
Dead or alive.
You go that way.
All of you disperse in different directions.
Who is it?
- What happened?
- I've got a bullet wound.
- Should I call the doctor?
- No.
No one should know that I'm here.
May Amar Damji's soul rest in peace!
And may you be booted!
Address me with a little more respect.
The fact that I dress modestly doesn't make me effeminate!
Amar is dead;
I've fulfilled my vow.
Which is what you also wanted.
Did you find his body?
Tell them.
We combed the entire hilly terrain...
...we couldn't find his body.
Did you hear that?
He's a Rajput.
He will not die so easily.
What should we do now, sir?
Wear anklets on your feet and dance like a nautch-girl!
Go and look for him!
How does it feel now?
What?
Your face?
...or these eyes of yours?
- No, I was...
- Or your lips?
I was only asking about the pain.
- Pain?
- Yes.
It has now increased.
Have this.
You will like it.
No.
I got it for you.
It is said that "sharing" increases love between each other.
"I wonder what's happened to me..."
"ever since I saw you"
"Ever since I saw you"
"I have gone crazy..."
"ever since I saw you"
"Ever since I saw you"
"This pining is perhaps love"
"Love leads to desire"
"I love you so much"
"I'm afraid, I might lose you"
"In my breath lingers your fragrance"
"For you I wear kohl in my eyes"
"My life is for you"
"I've gone crazy..."
"ever since I've seen you"
"Ever since I've seen you"
"You are with me"
"And I am consumed by desire"
"I feel like holding you in an embrace"
"What magic have you worked on me?"
"I'm drunk on you"
"I live for you"
"I've gone crazy..."
"ever since I've seen you"
"Ever since I've seen you"
"Ever since I've seen you"
Get up.
Quick!
Now he can't escape from here.
Look for him!
- Did you find him?
- No.
Search for him.
He must be hiding somewhere around.
Where are you running away?
Come on!
Look here;
We couldn't find Amar Damji, but we got his girl.
Let go of me!
She must be knowing Amar Damji's whereabouts.
Where is he?
Where is Amar?
Tell me!
- I don't know!
- Speak up!
Don't act smart, else I'll ruin your face!
- Speak up!
- I'll tell you.
He's gone to Dr. Modi's house.
Where is Amar Damji?
Amar is not here.
But why do you ask?
Was he supposed to come here?
Okay, bitch!
Where is Amar?
- He was supposed to come here.
- You're lying!
She's speaking the truth.
- What do you mean?
- Amar is here in front of you.
Don't move!
Empty the ammo from your guns, else I'll blow off Shiva's head!
Empty the guns!
Come on!
Do as he says!
You can't get away alive from here, Amar Damji.
So, Amar?
Calm down!
You will get nothing from bloodshed.
You can talk to me.
Let me go!
I'm innocent.
Not you, it was I who was innocent.
You have ruined my reputation.
You will have to wash away the stigma attached to my name now.
Don't hit me...
I'm a very weak man.
I'll die!
I'm prepared to confess everything.
- Do you have a vehicle?
- Yes... why?
Listen to me, sir.
I haven't killed your daughter.
Somebody else did.
- He'll tell you the truth.
- I will listen to nothing!
Believe me, sir.
Why else would I personally come to you?
Tell him, how were my finger-prints found there.
Mr. Commissioner...
I designed Amar's finger-prints at Inspectors Deshpande and Jamdade's behest.
They threatened to kill me.
What could I do?
Look at this.
They threatened to kill me.
I'm innocent.
Which means that Deshpande and Jamdade killed my daughter.
No, sir.
They were at the Police Station at that time.
They haven't committed the murder;
but they surely know who did it.
- Yes?
- What is this?
Can you tell me, Deshpande?
Because of you, my daughter was murdered and Amar was punished!
I'll have you both hanged!
You'll do nothing of that sort.
Kill him!
Shoot, I say!
Amar Damji shot the Commissioner and Dr. Moghe.
Sharma, Mohite...
Come here quickly!
At least no one will come here to look for you.
Till when will we keep running like this, Amar?
Till such time as I prove my innocence.
Till I prove that I'm not the culprit, someone else is.
You will not get the opportunity to prove anything.
Do you know they have pasted your posters all over town?
The moment you step out, either the police will kill you or your enemies will gun you down!
What Uncle says is true, Amar.
You're also being accused for killing the Commissioner and Dr. Moghe now!
I think the rat will have to be lured not with bread now but with the goodies.
Goodies?
!
I had a six-hour long meeting with officials of the Gunstorm Company.
I've succeeded in knowing the names of those involved in the scandal.
I want to disclose the names before the people of my nation immediately on my arrival there.
You people will get to know the truth too.
Switch it off.
- What did you say?
- Switch it off!
Uncle... what will happen now?
This is the worst example of sadism!
We can even knock him off at the airport.
But what if he opens his mouth even before you get to him?
There are still 24 hours for him to arrive.
- But think of this...
...which is like unseasonable rain!
- What is this?
- Go ahead and read it.
"Messrs Deshpande and Jamdade, my name is Julie..."
"...and I'm capable of having you both hanged"
"I have proof against the one who killed Anjali Majumdar"
"You both are involved, too"
"The price for the evidence is 300,000"
"Come over to Kit Kat Club...
- Julie Braganza"
Now, who's this babe?
We haven't got rid of one problem and this...
Drag the bitch here by her hair!
After I've dealt with her, she won't even be able to write again!
Bring the bitch here!
Wait a minute...
All of you go with them.
"Who are you?
Tell us your name"
"Stop making us pine, darling"
"They call me Juliet in the West"
"In India, they call me Laila"
"In Punjab, they call me Heer"
"They're all crazy about me"
"Any other name?"
"Lover!"
"The heart sways...
tell us..."
"whose lover are you?"
"The heart sways..."
"I'm everybody's lover"
"The heart sways...
tell us..."
"whose lover are you?"
"My heart sways..."
"I'm everybody's lover"
"They are thousands after me...
they're crazy about me"
"They're after me...
lusting for me"
"There are thousands after me...
they're crazy about me"
"They're after me...
lusting for me"
"There are so many of them...
whom will I call my lover?"
"The heart sways...
tell us..."
"whose lover are you?"
"The heart sways..."
"I'm everybody's lover"
"They're obsessed with my beauty"
"and I drive them away"
"They're obsessed with my beauty"
"and I drive them away"
"There are so many of them...
whom do I call my lover?"
"The heart sways...
tell us..."
"whose lover are you?"
"The heart sways..."
"I'm everbody's lover"
"The heart sways..."
"I'm everybody's lover"
"Marilyn Monroe?
- No"
"Madonna?
- No"
"Madhubala?
- No"
"So who are you?"
"Lover, I'm a lover"
"My heart sways, O my heart says..."
"...you're the one...
you're my beloved indeed!"
My heart sways, too.
...but before my feet start kicking, get lost!
Have you both come by yourselves?
Haven't you brought your "father"?
Our fathers?
They died the moment we were born!
It's better to die than to be a father to people like you.
Just because we're speaking to you like gentlemen, it doesn't mean...
Only scoundrels enter this profession.
The gentlemen keep away.
And you, baldie...
I know very well who has raped and murdered the Commissioner's daughter.
Understand?
Who are you talking about?
Don't waste my time.
Cough up the money, else I'll telephone the Commissioner.
Please don't do that.
Actually, you'll have to come with us for the money.
Julie will not go anywhere!
The money will be brought here.
Else, I'll make a call!
Move a finger to dial, and we'll blow off your head!
If my finger now presses your finger what will happen of your head?
- No... no!
- Ms Julie, you'll get the money.
- Come with me.
- I agree, if you say so.
Because you're the sensible one.
Let's go.
By the way, what else does your boss do beside rape and murder?
You'll get to know everything.
Just come along.
Please come.
And where is your "father"?
Is this the noose then, that is going to hang me?
She's a terrific dancer, sir!
I see!
What is your name?
The name is Julie Braganza...
Dancing is a hobby and crushing snakes like you to death is my profession.
- Miss Julie!
- Yes?
I'm no snake...
I'm a snake-charmer.
And I love playing with a she-snake like you are!
- I don't follow?
- Don't you really?
I'll explain.
- Uncle...
- Shut up!
This is Aunt Julie;
greet her and get lost!
- Greetings, aunt.
- Get lost now!
- But...
- Get lost, I said!
Will you strip on your own now or will you make me do the hard work?
!
Will you violate my honor?
I will only violate it;
not distribute it!
Come to me, darling...
Actually, women are my weakness;
Otherwise, I'm not a bad man.
- Please help me!
- I'm not evil.
Come on!
You're like a brother to me!
Save me, please!
You look strong and able;
save me, please!
Save me, Jamdade!
How many people will you hide behind, dear?
Please don't do anything to her, sir.
Oh darling, where are you off to!
Where are you going...
Let me at least come in!
Know something?
You've found a great place to hide in!
This happens to be my den!
Rascal!
Don't you have womenfolk back home?
I do... but none like you.
You're Julie, or Bruce Lee?
Now come into my arms!
This bed is meant to be slept on.
Not danced on!
Now come to me, darling!
You keep jumping around and I'll get tired, okay?
- Don't make me lose my temper!
- Okay...
I'm ready... but turn away to that side.
- What!
- Turn your face away, please.
Oh God!
She's feeling shy!
Then say so!
I'll turn away!
May I take a look?
To tell you the truth this is the first time I've ever waited.
I knew it when I saw you that I'd make a trip to Heaven today!
Just satisfy me and you will own diamonds worth Rs.1.1 billion!
I've never fallen in love with a girl having an English name.
The silky darkness, indeed!
- Can I take a look now?
- Yes.
Go ahead.
Your trip to Heaven begins!
Shall we go now?
Move!
Not a soul will move!
Don't move... and drop your guns!
Drop them!
Drop them, I said!
- Hands up...
- Stick them up, idiot!
Drop your gun, else this girl will lose her life!
Drop it!
Bravo, Raghu you turned the tables on him.
I've never been beaten up the way you have thrashed me today!
I'll deal with you now, and rob you of your speech!
Uncle, listen to me...
- What is it?
Speak up!
- Come here then.
Congratulations, Mr. Amar!
You've been made in-charge of Mr. Vishwasrao's security!
So, there are changes in my plans of violence.
Bring her here, Mr. Raghu.
Will you?
Now look;
you love him, don't you?
So ask him to do as we say.
Speak up!
- No...
- What do you want?
Good...
You see, Mr. Vishwasrao is returning from America today.
He'll go straight to the Government building and disclose my name.
My men can't go to the airport with weapons, you see.
So, I want you to shoot Vishwasrao.
No...
I cannot do that.
It's terribly easy!
All you have to do is to lift the revolver and fire!
What's this you've done?
Why did you kill them?
Warrants have been issued in these fools' names!
The Commissioner they fired at has survived!
Had they been caught, I'd have been under fire!
What I've done, indeed...
Hurry now, there's little time decide on what you will do!
- I can never do this.
- But she can certainly die!
And before I kill her, I will haven't I said women are my weakness?
Make up your mind now!
Okay...
I'm ready to do it.
Have all the arrangements been made?
Yes.
The plane is about to land now.
Mr. Vishwasrao will be landing on Indian soil at any moment now.
He brings, hidden in his heart, the name of the traitor who has, for the sake of money, betrayed the nation and motherland.
How are you, Amar?
What is this you are doing?
What punishment does the traitor merit?
This is Kasim speaking.
Amar has killed Vishwasrao.
How can you say that the traitor does not belong to your party?
- You see...
- The mission is accomplished.
But how did this happen?
What's happened, Mr. Minister?
- Why don't you tell us what's wrong?
- There's bad news...
Somebody has shot dead Mr. Vishwasrao at the airport.
The Minister's on his way.
Keep the car ready.
Take them both in the jeep.
Where is the girl?
She's under Chaturvedi's feet.
She's in the very building where the minister is now headed.
And when Chaturvedi realizes that you have betrayed him you don't know what treatment your beloved will go through!
These traitors have pumped bullets not into the heart of Vishwasrao but into the heart of Mother India herself!
A decent daring man was Mr. Vishwasrao.
- Not "was".
He "is".
Please be seated.
The person involved in the pay-off of Gunstorm Company is none else, than my deputy, Chaturvedi!
But we were told that you were assassinated.
Your plan was very good, Chaturvedi.
But you made a mistake...
You entrusted the task of killing me to a man who would die himself but never betray his Motherland, like you have done.
Nobody will act smart...
or you're all dead-men!
And you shouldn't act smart at all!
Else, I'll make so many holes in your body that you'll be used for a flute, even after you die!
You have finished my political career.
Let alone a Minister, I can't even be a peon in the administration now.
That's fine; but you will help me in escaping from this place now.
I concede that Amar has not betrayed his nation but he has surely betrayed his lover.
- Bring that girl upstairs.
- Okay, sir.
Are you okay?
You men in uniform do not try to act smart.
We have the whole building under our control and also about 50 journalists as hostages.
Your beloved Minister Vishwasrao is also enjoying our hospitality.
This is Inspector Karan Sharma, Mr. Chaturvedi we have surrounded this building.
Nobody can escape us now.
Is that so?
Have you seen enough, or do you wish for some more?
Listen carefully now, to what I say no one will enter this building now.
My nephew will go to my house to fetch the diamonds.
He will not be stopped by anyone of you.
We need a helicopter to go to the airport where an aircraft should be arranged to fly us out of the nation.
Do you understand?
I've listened to your demands.
But I can't fulfill them.
Agree to his demands, Karan!
My seniors are not present here right now.
Why don't you speak to Karan on this walkie-talkie?
If I do that, Chaturvedi will know that I'm in the building and I don't want that at any cost!
Tell them to do as I say.
Go on.
I cannot do that.
Chaturvedi and some terrorists have taken over the building.
We don't know how far they have spread in the building.
But they're holding Mr. Vishwasrao and VIPs to ransom on the top floor.
Why are you playing with the lives of innocent people?
Speak to them... go on, or should I throw someone else now?
Do just as they are asking you to do.
To arrange the helicopter and the aircraft will take us an hour.
Not more than 30 minutes!
If you're any later than that, I'll throw people out of the window!
- Not more than 30 minutes!
- Okay, we'll do our best.
Why isn't the babe here?
Go and take a look.
- And nephew...
- Uncle?
Go home and bring the diamonds here.
Do you get it?
- The cops there...
- They'll treat you like a prince!
Speak up!
- What was that?
- That's Bitta's voice!
What's wrong with him?
- Harishankar and Bitta...
- What's happened to them?
Their corpses... they've been killed by someone.
- The girl's missing too.
- Who could have done this?
This could only be his doing.
Listen...
I know you've entered this building.
If you don't come here in 10 minutes I'll kill them all, one by one.
Do you hear me?
...That's okay.
I'll start the good work with Mr. Vishwasrao's P.A.
Could you hear that?
Will you come here now, or should I play some more "music"?
Look for him through out the building.
Get going!
Killing that rascal is no child's play!
Now either do something yourself, or kill me instead!
Keep this...
Check out your guns.
You stay here.
Nobody can harm you here.
Come out in the open, Amar Damji!
- We know you're here!
- Come out!
You won't escape, you swine!
You've dared to kill our friends.
We'll finish you!
Why hasn't the helicopter arrived?
It should be here in 15 minutes.
Why hasn't my nephew returned?
Try tricks and I'll fling all of them out of here!
No!
He should be here at any moment.
Only one of us will survive today!
Lt'll either be you, or me!
Come out!
Step out.
You're alright, aren't you?
- But I'm worried about Amar.
- Don't worry.
He'll be alright.
Uncle!
I've brought it!
- I've got it!
- Wonderful, my son!
You've acted like the true son of my sister!
How they glitter!
It's the whole lot, isn't it?
The whole lot indeed!
It's already 30 minutes, Mr. Commissioner but I still can't see your helicopter.
Try any tricks and I'll throw them all out of the window!
Don't do that!
The helicopter is on its way here.
All of you go down, but take the stairs!
Clobber the rascal!
Kill him!
What happened?
Get out.
How do you know that name which I had given up 17 years ago?
Because, before you did that, you killed two people.
- Who were they?
- Inspector Damji Kanwar Rathod and Shanti Rathod.
I still remember my mother's screams.
...and the sound of her breaking bangles.
I haven't forgotten.
The father whose finger I held while I walked the mother in whose arms I snuggled comfortably you snatched them both away from me.
Forgive me!
I admit that I killed your parents.
Look at these diamonds!
Worth a 1.10 million!
We'll share them!
Take the whole lot of it!
I beg of you...
Please don't kill me.
I am still your Deputy Minister!
You're a cop!
You cannot kill me.
I surrender myself to you.
You're a cop...
You cannot kill me!
You bloody cur!
You are unfortunate that you heard only your mother's screams...
Your father's cries were really worth listening to when his stomach was cut open and his intestines were dumped in the gutters.
Start singing the National Anthem.
Your end has come.
As usual, you've won.
Two degrees Celsius.
It dropped two degrees since yesterday.
Well, hopefully it will warm up a bit by midmorning.
Anybody miss the space stations yet?
Twenty-eight degrees Celsius year round.
I never knew what cold actually felt like.
My sleeping bag had ice on it this morning.
Hey, Danziger's back.
Let's see what he found.
Here you go, Dad.
Thanks.
It's worse to the south.
Higher elevations.
No place to hide in the wind.
And the snow's already about a meter deep.
Try southwest.
Don't get too far ahead of us.
If that storm blows in, it could be serious.
Alonzo-
Did you have any more dreams last night?
Same thing.
The Terrians showed me a night sky- two full moons crossing.
And they asked if our boy is ready.
Ready for what?
They don't say.
Be careful.
Day 61 on the new planet.
I knew Devon was worried about the Terrians... and what they had in mind for her son.
But I wasn't concerned right then about alien species.
At the moment, I thought our worst enemy was winter.
As usual, I was wrong.
Come on, Uly.
Up and at 'em.
But it's too cold.
It'll warm up once you start moving around, okay?
We have to pack up.
Find a good place to camp for winter.
No, we don't.
Yes, we do.
We're staying here.
That wouldn't be a very good idea, Uly.
When the snow blows in, we'll have no protection here.
We'll be safe in the garden.
What garden?
Mary's garden.
- It's warm there.
- What are you talking about, Uly?
I'll show you.
Uly
- Uly, wait.
Ul
- Uly!
Uly!
Uly, what are you doing?
Showing you where we'll camp.
Where are you going?
Uly.
Look!
What're you-
Anybody home?
I'd say nobody's been home for years.
Come on, Dad!
It's nice inside.
Uly, stay close.
Dad, it's hot in here.
Here.
Take that corner.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's fine.
Just leave it.
Danziger.
Yeah?
What do you think?
Could this have been built by penal colonists?
Well, whoever they were, they sure knew what they were doing.
This whole sphere's been on a self-perpetuating cycle for 15, maybe 20 years.
What about the occupants?
I don't know.
Maybe Yale could do a search for that logo.
John, come look.
We found the pieces to more prefab structures, some cold weather clothes.
Oh, boy, this place is looking better and better.
An ideal camp.
Yeah.
Just when we needed it.
He'll be back soon.
Alonzo.
What?
Are we all supposed to pretend we haven't noticed?
What about toxicity?
So far this dome seems perfectly habitable.
How did Uly know about it?
I don't know.
I can't get a straight answer.
Did it have to do with the Terrians?
How they've changed him genetically?
Look, the Terrians got what we promised them.
They healed Uly, and we helped them get rid of Gaal.
They have no right to expect anything else from us.
So, are we gonna stay here?
I think so.
At least until the weather changes.
You were very lucky to find this place.
What did you call it?
Uh, Mary's garden?
Mm-hmm.
Where did you get that name?
I don't know.
Uly, when we first landed here, and the Terrians took you- When they made me well?
Yeah.
I know we've talked before about that night.
I told you.
I woke up, and I was in a cave.
And Mr. Danziger came and got me.
But you d-you did say that... you remembered at one point you were in the ground.
Oh,yeah.
The Terrians were all around me, and I was sort of getting buried.
That must have been scary.
It was fun.
I wanted to stay.
You did?
Yeah, but they said it wasn't the right time.
I had to come back.
When?
When were you supposed to come back?
Mama.
Mama.
Mama.!
Mom?
You okay?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
It's okay.
Uly, what are you doing?
I woke up.
I think I was thirsty.
Why were you up there?
I, uh-
I thought I heard something.
Come on.
Let's, uh
- Let's go get you something to drink, okay?
What are you doing?
Let me go.!
Thanks.
What are you doing?
Saving you.
Who are you?
How did you get here?
What am I doing here?
Who are you?
Don't talk.
Dream.
Why did you attack me?
We didn't.
They were outcasts.
Outcasts?
What does that mean?
Is this about Uly?
It wasn't until later that I realized... this was what I had been dreaming about-
Moon Cross.
It was a special season when Terrians perform a ritual... they called "going in. "
Going back to the earth.
What we call dying, I guess.
But to them, it was heaven.
So what if the outcasts are coming?
No.
I dreamt with you.
Now you talk to me.
Why should I help?
Tell me.
Outcasts... will kill you.
What about them?
Can they help?
Moon Cross.
Moon Cross?
Here.
Yale?
Yale, are you okay?
Yale, are you okay?
I guess I could ask you the same.
Yeah.
Well I, uh-
I certainly didn't sleep very well last night.
Yale, I know that this place seems like a good place to bunker down for the bad weather-
That's cheating.!
No, it's not.
I got you.
Did not.
Hey, guys!
You're it.
You're it.
I was just it.
Yeah, and you didn't find me.
So you're it again.
Hey!
Hey, kids, what's the problem?
It's my turn to hide.
No, it isn't!
Tell you what.
Why don't you both hide, and I'll seek, okay?
All right.
I'll count to 50.
Ready, go!
Hurry up!
Let's hide.
Me first!
Oh, my God.
Yale, what is it?
What is it?
I was trying to- to search my mental files... for some reference to this structure's trademark.
I must have triggered an aversion mechanism- gave myself quite a shock.
Yale, there are certain parts of history you're blocked from referencing?
I guess I would be discouraged from inquiring about events that overlap in my own past, to prevent me from discovering my pre-wash identity.
Devon, the children.
Forty-eight, 49- Fifty!
I'm coming.
I can't fire one of these.
Are they dead?
They are not dead.
Th-Th-They cannot go in.
Go in what?
That pool in there?
Because they're outcasts.
What did they do wrong?
You ask so much.
Because I'm human, just like you are.
Yes, you are.
Gotcha.
Come on.
Let's go find True.
Okay.
I'll find her.
Mary?
Mary, where are you?
You gave it away, True.
I could hear you breathing.
You could not!
Yes, I could.
She found you first.
It took a few trips to the dream plane, but I got her to explain that these outcasts... wouldn't be a threat until midnight, when the two moons would rise.
Whatever crime they had committed, it was so heinous they had been banished... and forbidden from going into the pool.
They were sentenced to life without death, so to speak.
And it had driven these outcasts to more and more violence.
Now you go.
Get your boy.
Bring Uly here?
His mother might have something to say about that.
This is his mother.
Do you want to tell Devon that yourself?
Come on.
You can come back with me.
You might like it better than you think.
No.
We sleep now... until the m-moon comes up again.
So, now everyone rests?
And you do too.
Because you're one of them, almost.
You must have noticed, you're different.
You know how to speak.
You got these clothes somewhere.
Do you go into that pool in there?
What are you doin'?
I can't explain the feeling that came over me in that Terrian bed, but it's the closest thing to flying I've ever felt.
It helped me later, to understand her.
Why she did what she had to do.
Okay.
You made your point.
It's not half bad here.
But if you've got something to tell my people-
Maybe it's time you met them.
If you think I'm interesting, wait until you see them.
Back by Moon Cross?
No problem.
It is long walk?
We don't have to walk.
No, it's okay.
It won't bite.
Now, you can come here and sit down right here.
It's all right.
Just like that.
Just put your feet out.
Right.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Now, you want to hold on.
Hold on.
I'm telling you.
They want her.
Mary?
Mary.!
They want to take my child.
Wait.
Wait!
No.!
Not my baby.!
Devon, you all right?
Danziger, th-there's something wrong with this place.
Something terrible must have happened here.
You're right.
Come see what we found.
We were clearing out some dead vines and we found them.
It was hard to say what this woman was.
I mean, she was a woman.
That was obvious.
But she also was part child, part Terrian, part wild animal.
It wasn't going to be easy to introduce her to civilization, but I had to try.
Uh, I need a break, so-
Um, I'm gonna go stretch my legs, okay?
What i-is this?
This?
Uh, it's called, uh, hugging and, uh- and touching.
People- men and women, uh, do this when they know each other better.
This is- is h-human?
This feeling?
Uh
- Uh
- Uh, yeah.
Um, and-
People limit this to, uh, their friends and their family, you know?
M
- My family d-does not touch.
Well, th-the Terrians don't.
What about your- your real family?
Your father and your mother?
What about them?
Where are they?
Terrians are my family.
She understands us?
Yeah.
Do you need a coat?
It's okay.
She's a little shy right now, okay?
And this little thing saved you from renegade Terrians?
- Yeah.
- Well, it looks like she can handle that stick pretty well.
She says she needs to talk to us about Uly.
What about Uly?
What-What do you want?
It's okay.
Settle down.
It's all right.
Hello there.
I bet I know something you'd really like.
Come here.
It's okay.
Told you you'd like it.
Now let me get your back.
Hey, stop that.
This is for your own good.
Haven't you ever had a bath before?
It's okay.
We, uh
- We've rounded up some clothes that I think should fit you.
And, uh, this is Julia.
She's our doctor, and she's going to examine you... as soon as you've finished your bath.
I'm just gonna touch you with this glove.
It's gonna tell me all about your health.
Touch.
Alonzo show- show me touching.
You know, um, we don't know what to call you.
How about Mary?
Look.
This is you.
Mary.
Other people lived here before.
We don't know who they were or what happened to them.
Maybe you do.
She must be connected somehow... to whatever happened here with the original settlers, I just know it.
They were a group of radical biologists.
They were outlawed on the stations for proposing domes like this one... to preserve botanical species from Earth.
Yale, what is it?
Devon, this wasn't from my files.
This must be memory.
It's not as pronounced as Uly's change, but her D.N.A. has been altered.
If she was an early attempt at assimilation, they've improved their technique.
Well, what does she want?
Biologically, she's human.
Socially, she's bonded to the Terrians.
Although I'm sure that we could nurture her human side.
Devon, you always trusted the Terrians.
It seems the more we trust them, the more they want from us.
Devon!
Devon, you better come see this.
Did it hurt?
Only a little, like you said.
Uly-Aaah!
What're you doing with that thing, Uly?
Learning to stop outcasts.
You will never touch that thing again.
Do you understand me?
He needs to learn, to join us.
Uly is not joining anything.
He has to.
It is Moon Cross now.
It is time for him to go in.
That is why I came, to get him.
Get him?
You are not taking my son anywhere.
Let's hear her out.
Let's just all sit down and hear what she has to say.
Oh, she's welcome to say whatever she'd like.
But you will never take my son.
Do you understand that?
Mom!
Let her go.
Let her go.
What did she say?
She called you a human.
How could I shoot like that, Mom?
How could I do that?
I don't know.
I liked her
- Mary.
Didn't you?
I didn't like her wanting to take you.
But she was right, what she was thinking.
And what was that?
You know, Mom, it's all going to be all right.
I promise.
Look, it's bedtime, Uly.
Why don't you go get some sleep, okay?
Mary?
Mary?
Mary, where are you?
Mama?
Mama?
Mary?
Baby?
No.!
Mama.
Don't be scared.
I-I'm right here.
Shh.
Shh.
She was worried about me.
Now she knows I'm all right.
I know.
I know.
Do you remember?
You used to live here.
I don't know.
You were a little girl, and your parents fought with the Terrians.
No.
At first, w- we were all friends.
Then one day, my mama told me I had to stay away.
I must have been little.
I remember, I was learning... how to- to read.
And then one night... they came to get you.
They broke in.
That's what they did.
The outcasts.
They killed my mama and daddy.
Alonzo.
It's okay, Mary.
You're crying.
Hey, it's what humans do.
So the Terrians punished the outcasts, and they adopted you.
Th-The tribe... didn't want anyone hurt.
I know.
Please, let your boy go so it doesn't happen again.
Devon.!
It's Uly.
He's gone.
He took the A.T.V.
He doesn't have lightning.
Vehicle, halt.
Vehicle, confirm.
Previous trip reversed?
What's happening?
He's telling the tribe to let them pass.
It's time for the outcasts to be forgiven.
It's over now, he says.
They can stop fighting.
Uly.
And Moon Cross is over.
What's happening?
Did the Terrians help me again?
Actually, you helped the Terrians.
You helped all of us.
So, a small boy was initiated as the link between two species.
And he brought peace to the Terrians.
And a mother's fears were calmed.
For now, Uly would only be changed at Moon Cross.
Dream.
And Mary showed me, in a dream, why she had not become the Terrians'human link... when they had taken her in.
Mary hadn't only lost her parents, she had lost her connection to all humans.
Orphaned, she'd become too much like the Terrians... and couldn't be a link to humans.
You're not an orphan anymore, Mary.
Don't go.
Come with me.
This is my family.
I'm home.
We took comfort in knowing that in seeing Mary, the spirits ofher father and mother finally rested.
The outcast Terrians who had slaughtered them... could also finally rest.
And the chance for making a better home was where it belonged- in the hands of all living species who share this second Earth.

Are they dead?

Th-Th-They cannot go in.

Because I'm human, just like you are.

No.
We sleep now... until the m-moon comes up again.
So, now everyone rests?
And you do too.
Because you're one of them, almost.
You must have noticed, you're different.
You know how to speak.
You got these clothes somewhere.
Do you go into that pool in there?

Now, you want to hold on.
Hold on.
[ Whirring ]
[ Woman's Voice ] I'm telling you.
They want her.
[ Man's Voice ] Mary?

[ Woman's Voice ] They want to take my child.

[ Woman's Voice ] No.!

[ Gasps ] Devon, you all right?
Danziger, th-there's something wrong with this place.
Something terrible must have happened here.
You're right.
Come see what we found.
We were clearing out some dead vines and we found them.
[ Alonzo Narrating ] It was hard to say what this woman was.
I mean, she was a woman.
That was obvious.
But she also was part child, part Terrian, part wild animal.
It wasn't going to be easy to introduce her to civilization, but I had to try.
Uh, I need a break, so-
Um, I'm gonna go stretch my legs, okay?
What i-is this?
This?
Uh, it's called, uh, hugging and, uh- and touching.
People- men and women, uh, do this when they know each other better.
This is- is h-human?
This feeling?
Uh
- Uh
- Uh, yeah.
Um, and- [ Clears Throat ]
People limit this to, uh, their friends and their family, you know?
M-My family d-does not touch.
Well, th-the Terrians don't.
What about your- your real family?
Your father and your mother?
[ Trilling ] What about them?
Where are they?
[ Trilling ]
Terrians are my family.
She understands us?
[ Alonzo ] Yeah.
Do you need a coat?
[ Trilling ]
It's okay.
She's a little shy right now, okay?
And this little thing saved you from renegade Terrians?
- Yeah.
- Well, it looks like she can handle that stick pretty well.
She says she needs to talk to us about Uly.
What about Uly?
What-What do you want?
It's okay.
Settle down.
It's all right.
[ Trills ] Hello there.
I bet I know something you'd really like.
[ Trilling ]
Come here.
It's okay.
Told you you'd like it.
Now let me get your back.
Hey, stop that.
This is for your own good.
Haven't you ever had a bath before?
[ Trills ]
It's okay.
We, uh- We've rounded up some clothes that I think should fit you.
And, uh, this is Julia.
She's our doctor, and she's going to examine you... as soon as you've finished your bath.
I'm just gonna touch you with this glove.
It's gonna tell me all about your health.
[ Glove Whirring ]
Touch.
Alonzo show- show me touching.
You know, um, we don't know what to call you.
How about Mary?
Look.
This is you.
Mary.
Other people lived here before.
We don't know who they were or what happened to them.
Maybe you do.
[ Devon ] She must be connected somehow... to whatever happened here with the original settlers, I just know it.
They were a group of radical biologists.
They were outlawed on the stations for proposing domes like this one... to preserve botanical species from Earth.
Yale, what is it?
Devon, this wasn't from my files.
This must be memory.
[ Devon Sighs ]
It's not as pronounced as Uly's change, but her D.N.A. has been altered.
If she was an early attempt at assimilation, they've improved their technique.
Well, what does she want?
Biologically, she's human.
Socially, she's bonded to the Terrians.
Although I'm sure that we could nurture her human side.
Devon, you always trusted the Terrians.
It seems the more we trust them, the more they want from us.
Devon!
Devon, you better come see this.
Did it hurt?
Only a little, like you said.
Uly-Aaah!
What're you doing with that thing, Uly?
Learning to stop outcasts.
You will never touch that thing again.
Do you understand me?
He needs to learn, to join us.
Uly is not joining anything.
He has to.
It is Moon Cross now.
It is time for him to go in.
That is why I came, to get him.
Get him?
You are not taking my son anywhere.
Let's hear her out.
Let's just all sit down and hear what she has to say.
Oh, she's welcome to say whatever she'd like.
But you will never take my son.
Do you understand that?
[ Trilling ]
Mom!
Let her go.
Let her go.
What did she say?
She called you a human.
[ Uly ] How could I shoot like that, Mom?
How could I do that?
I don't know.
I liked her
- Mary.
Didn't you?
I didn't like her wanting to take you.
But she was right, what she was thinking.
And what was that?
You know, Mom, it's all going to be all right.
I promise.
Look, it's bedtime, Uly.
Why don't you go get some sleep, okay?
[ Sighs ]
[ Trilling ]
[ Woman's Voice ] Mary?
Mary?
Mary, where are you?
[ Mary ] Mama?
Mama?
[ Woman's Voice ] Mary?
Baby?
[ Woman Shouting ] No.!
[ Mary ] Mama.
Don't be scared.
I-I'm right here.
Shh.
Shh.
She was worried about me.
Now she knows I'm all right.
I know.
I know.
Do you remember?
You used to live here.
I don't know.
You were a little girl, and your parents fought with the Terrians.
No.
At first, w-we were all friends.
Then one day, my mama told me I had to stay away.
I must have been little.
I remember, I was learning... how to- to read.
And then one night... they came to get you.
They broke in.
That's what they did.
The outcasts.
They killed my mama and daddy.
[ Crying ]
Alonzo.
[ Whimpers ]
It's okay, Mary.
You're crying.
Hey, it's what humans do.
So the Terrians punished the outcasts, and they adopted you.
Th-The tribe... didn't want anyone hurt.
I know.
Please, let your boy go so it doesn't happen again.
[ Yale ] Devon.!
It's Uly.
He's gone.
He took the A.T.V.
He doesn't have lightning.
[ Uly ] Vehicle, halt.
Vehicle, confirm.
Previous trip reversed?
[ Beeping ]
[ Terrians Murmuring ]
[ Growling ]
- [ Trilling ]
- What's happening?
He's telling the tribe to let them pass.
[ Trilling Continues ]
[ Mary ] It's time for the outcasts to be forgiven.
[ Murmuring ]
[ Trilling ]
[ Trilling Continues ]
[ Mary ] It's over now, he says.
They can stop fighting.
[ Sighs ] Uly.
And Moon Cross is over.
What's happening?
Did the Terrians help me again?
[ Sighs ] Actually, you helped the Terrians.
You helped all of us.
[ Alonzo Narrating ] So, a small boy was initiated as the link between two species.
And he brought peace to the Terrians.
And a mother's fears were calmed.
For now, Uly would only be changed at Moon Cross.
Dream.
And Mary showed me, in a dream, why she had not become the Terrians'human link... when they had taken her in.
Mary hadn't only lost her parents, she had lost her connection to all humans.
Orphaned, she'd become too much like the Terrians... and couldn't be a link to humans.
You're not an orphan anymore, Mary.
Don't go.
Come with me.
This is my family.
I'm home.
[ Alonzo Narrating ] We took comfort in knowing that in seeing Mary, the spirits ofher father and mother finally rested.
The outcast Terrians who had slaughtered them... could also finally rest.
And the chance for making a better home was where it belonged- in the hands of all living species who share this second Earth.
[ Narrator ] Next on Earth 2.
I'm a Yale series tutor, an artificially rehabilitated criminal like all the others.
I know you, Yale!
You are a good man.
[ Bess Narrating ] Almost all the ex-convicts inducted into the Yale program... have mindwash failure before the recall.
Oh
- I am not gonna line Yale up and shoot him down like a rabid animal.
- I am not.!
- The Yales that they didn't catch in time became rabid animals.
[ Grunting ]
You're leaving?
But I thought you and I were forever?
I want you so badly.
- Morgan!
- But so does the Port Royal governor.
He will pay well for the capture of Morgan Adams, the pirate.
- You Knew who I was?
- All along.
Morgan!
Where are you?
You are heartless, Lieutenant.
My apologies, senorita.
But you are right.
I thought it was much more amusing this way also... since I Knew that you Knew.
By the way, that won't work.
See?
I took your balls.
What happened?
Your father sent for you two days ago.
I Know. I was coming.
He did not Know this.
He went looking for you.
That's when Dawg grabbed him.
Lord Knows what he does with him.
I took this from our brother Richard last week.
Unwillingly.
That's his blood on the borders.
With your piece, all I need is Mordachai's.
You're out of luck.
I don't have it.
Where is it?
With Morgan?
I haven't seen her.
I thinK you lie, Harry.
I hid it.
Progress.
Where?
Up here.
I always thought there was nothing in your head.
Come back on board.
I'm going to split you wide open.
Mr. Snelgrave.
I'll see ya in hell.
Father!
- Father, I've got you!
- Let go!
Let go!
Hold onto me!
- Let go!
- Never!
No!
Father!
Father!
Someone get a grappling hook!
Launch the cutter.
Heave!
Oh, Lord, what did I do in my life to get you?
Dawg will pay for this, I swear.
You leave Dawg be.
I will fly his bloody head as my banner!
You'll leave Dawg well to leeward.
There will be time for him.
Find your Uncle Mordachai.
take my crew.
make them yours.
Father, don't talk now.
I'll get you back to the ship.
I'll not see my ship again.
The Morning Star is yours.
Don't say that.
I've patched you with worse.
Get your Knife.
Shave my head.
- What?
- Shave my head.
For once in your life, Morgan... do as I tell you.
Lieutenant.
What is your name again?
Plopper?
Squinter?
Trotter, Your Excellency.
Miss Mandy RicKets is standing alone.
Her father brings a fortune in investments to the colony.
Dance with her.
She's rather homely, sir.
And you are not?
There you are.
You see?
Too late.
Some other fellow has taken the plunge.
There's every reason why I should be alone tonight... being a stranger here... but a woman with grace such as yours... should never be unattended.
My name is Shaw.
William Shaw.
But my friends call me Willy.
Do we Know him, sir?
We do not.
Are you at leisure, Mr. Shaw, or do you follow a profession?
Most serious one, ma'am.
I'm a medical man, a doctor.
Oh, my!
I studied at Leyden, then higher anatomy with Dreyfuss at Leipzig.
With higher anatomy, you must Know a great deal about the human body.
Indeed, madam.
Every bit of it.
All the ins and outs.
In medicine, it's our obligation to probe to the very bottom of things.
We must, in fact, explode ancient superstitions... shake truths violently from the body.
You, sir!
Forgive my rudeness.
Trotter's the name.
I'm with the regiment.
William Shaw.
Dr. Shaw, in fact.
Most happy.
What ship did you come in on, Doctor?
Was it the Bristol packet?
Bristol packet?
Bristol packet?
I believe that was it, although I can't be sure.
I'm all at sea when it comes to things nautical.
Very good.
No, the reason I asked... is the Bristol packet don't arrive until a week Wednesday.
That's him!
That man stole my diamond comb!
My pearls!
My pearl dangles!
My ruby necklace!
- Sergeant of the guard!
- Women!
Sergeant of the guard!
Good night, ladies!
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
His name's Shaw, sir.
I trust you'll enjoy life as a slave, Mr. Shaw.
Whoever you are.
That's good.
Tie it off!
Morgan, think of the freedom.
You can do anything you want now.
Come to London with me.
Come to London with me.
There's dukes there.
There's earls and parties.
It'll be fun.
think of how much fun it'd be.
Besides, these men aren't gonna take orders from you.
They will!
Watch.
You there.
Stand to.
Hoist my pennant.
Bring it here.
Mutiny, will ya?
I was hoping to find you sober.
I was hoping to be passed out by now, Mr. Glasspoole.
Important things go on overhead.
Morgan, you should be there.
Men, black Harry is gone.
I'm not one to speak ill of the dead... but for months he brought us nothing.
So now we can either sell this rotten bark and divvy up... or you can choose me captain.
I stand for captain.
My father wished it.
As he died, he gave me this.
He left it for all of you.
That's his bloody scalp.
It's a map to Cutthroat Island... the buried treasure of a Spanish gold ship.
More gold, jewels and plunder than you've ever dreamed of.
What does it say?
Aye.
It says--
You read it.
- l can't.
- Why not?
It's Latin.
Then I will have it translated at once.
There must be someone who Knows Latin at Port Royal.
My Uncle Mordachai holds a second piece at Spittlefield.
There's more than one piece?
Actually, there are three.
- Where's the third?
- Dawg Brown has it.
Oh, well!
It's practically in our pocket.
We'll fight him for it.
We'll join with Mordachai.
Two ships against one.
You should like them odds.
ask yourselves.
What would Harry have done?
This is our chance to seek some real fortune... and to pay back Dawg what we owe him.
What could be better than that?
Mr. Blair, you are quartermaster.
You decide.
Two days is all I need.
One to Port Royal, one to Spittlefield.
If Harry picked you, I'll give you a chance.
Let any man who would challenge me draw that.
I found him.
He's a prisoner inside.
He speaks Latin.
Good.
Let's break him out.
Unfortunately, Captain-- l mean, ma'am, he's about to be sold as a slave.
A slave.
They're hanging the pirates.
They're gonna find you out.
You worry too much.
Don't I look right?
You look beautiful.
It's just that I'm the only person here who has the slightest inkling... of how to act like a gentleperson, so I have to go with you.
- Then you shall come.
- But, unfortunately, I can't.
I have pressing business with my bookseller.
- The fat man is right.
- l'll see you at Spittlefield.
You must be at your best behavior.
Then, gallant sir, escort me thither.
Turn around.
- You.
On your feet.
- ask me politely.
You anticipate too much.
It's more like a fencing move.
Any fool can do it.
I hope you enjoy pain, slave.
Because I intend to buy you.
Good morning, madam.
As you can see, I'm young, in fine health. I Know horsemanship.
I write a fine hand.
I have it on authority that you are fluent in Latin.
Ah, Latin, the Romance language.
I can speak Latin like I was born in the ancient Senate.
A regular Cicero.
Why?
Do you have children who wish to learn?
I'd make a first-class teacher in a tasteful country house.
I can do most arithmetic, though I confess a weakness in long division.
Stop your chatter and say something Latinish.
What did you say?
You're a very beautiful woman.
I'd like to wash your feet.
You like to wash things, do you?
Start with your mouth.
Five pounds?
What?
No offers at all?
take him away and hang him.
Next!
Please!
Don't hang me!
Next!
Lot 22!
A colonist.
A doctor.
Being of value, I start the bidding at five pounds.
- l bid five pounds.
- Five pounds, sir.
Go on.
Any advance on five pounds?
He's of good physique.
- Ten pounds.
- Ten pounds!
- Any advance on ten pounds?
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen pounds, sir.
- Twenty pounds.
- Twenty pounds is the bid.
- Sir, a word to the wise.
- Let the young lady win.
- You won't get one like this.
- Being a doctor, he's--
- Go away!
That one is mine.
- Twenty-five pounds.
- Twenty-five pounds, sir.
Good teeth.
- Thirty pounds!
- Thirty pounds!
Madam, I will have this man at any price.
If you are buying him purely for pleasure... I will offer to do the same for you at no cost.
A doctor!
- Thirty-five pounds!
- Thirty-five pounds, sir.
A sensible choice, indeed.
Go on.
Captain, no!
Where's your sense of competition?
Come on!
Someone give me more than 35!
You, sir, you haven't bid.
look at him.
look at the quality.
And you, madam, another bid?
Any advance on 35.
I hope the lady is prepared to be a good loser.
What gave you the idea I was a lady?
Another bid, sir?
I see your lips moving.
Yes?
Are you trying to Kill me, madam?
Yes, that's why I'm aiming where your brains are.
Now leave this place and go far away.
Don't retreat now, sir.
Where are you going?
- Don't surrender this opportunity.
- Forty pounds to end the bidding.
Sold to the lady with the monkey.
take him away.
Go on!
Move!
Of course, I'm grateful, madam.
You picked a bargain.
I'm connected to all the great families of Europe.
- l have a natural pitch for music...
- Quiet!
and a pefrect taste in wine.
Enemy to leeward, Captain.
Starboard as well, Captain.
Time to leave.
You draw them away.
We'll meet at Dingley Crossroads.
- take King Charles.
Come on.
- Aye.
It's Morgan Adams!
She's at the auction!
Shoot to Kill!
If I am in some way the cause of all this, I apologize at once.
Here.
Come here.
Hold on there.
Hold on tight.
Try to Keep up with me.
I am not fond of heights!
Then let go!
Lieutenant Trotter!
What's going on?
Something with Mr. Shaw, I believe.
I'm in favor of exercise, but you owe me an explanation.
Come here.
Come on.
We have to climb down here.
Fast!
- Where'd they go?
- There!
Was that fast enough?
Come on!
Get the reins!
Grab them!
Come on!
Go!
Mr. Trotter!
That's my bloody carriage.
I'll have it back, if you please.
You, off.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, sir.
He won't get far.
Reload!
It's hard to imagine what part of your life would require Latin!
Reload!
- We've taken a passenger!
- Here!
You're hitting a woman!
Captain PerKins, sir!
- Yes?
- lt's her!
Morgan Adams!
You're more active than other women I've Known.
Morgan!
Watch your head!
Charge!
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Stop them!
I must visit that shop again when I have more time.
- Master gunner, fire at will.
- Run 'em up!
Fire!
A ship!
I find myself being fired upon by an entire ship!
Oh, my God.
You certainly left your mark on this town.
Hold on!
Whoa!
Trotter, do you want to spend the rest of your days on this poxy island?
- Who was that woman?
- Morgan Adams, sir.
You've 100 pounds on her head.
black Harry's girl.
Well, well.
She's made a proper fool of me, hasn't she?
Two hundred pounds and a captaincy for you if you find her for me.
Sir!
- Any difficulties?
- Nothing unusual.
Here.
Step down into the carriage.
- Will you take the reins?
- Aye.
We should make Spittlefield by dark.
What is your name anyway, slave?
Shaw.
William Shaw.
Dr. Shaw, actually.
Slave, I'm about to show you something.
Reveal it to any other man, and you will wish you were back at Port Royal... with your head on the block and the ax in the air.
thank you, but I've seen one before.
What is this?
A pigskin?
Translate what is written there.
Let's discuss terms first.
I do so, and you set me free.
That's tender.
It's about to become more tender.
They're backwards.
I assure you, ma'am, they're normal in every respect.
No, the words.
They're written backwards.
look.
Can you see?
"Cliffs of blood." Bless me.
You're right.
You tell Mr. SqueaKum's that I will send him a new chapter every month.
- Now, what's this all about?
- He's a great admirer of your books.
That makes me happy.
Which books has he read?
Did he mention?
His Excellency Governor Ainslee, John Reed, the author... currently the chronicler of piracy.
Step up, sir.
Always a pleasure to meet a literary man.
- l'd just as soon walk.
- l insist.
I can do that, you Know.
"When the earth and all its people quaKe-
- Psalm, number 75.
My bones suffer mortal agony.
Number 42."
- And?
- That's all.
- No position?
No parallel?
- l swear it, ma'am.
That's all that's here.
Piracy, Mr. Reed, is the scourge of these plantations.
I, therefore, give rather large rewards for the capture of pirates... including Morgan Adams.
I don't Know who she is.
Trotter tells me that you move throughout the pirate world... collecting your little tales.
Dangerous.
If by some chance you come across her, you might tell her on my behalf... that I offer her two alternatives.
One, an ignominious death on the gallows like these poor fellows here.
Please bear in mind that I could decide you're a pirate as well.
And the alternative?
She might cut me in for a share... of her grandfather's treasure... or she ends up as dinner for crows.
Pull up!
Good day, Mr. Reed.
Do you understand me, sir?
Here.
Here's a good one.
You blackguard!
Can you spare a little, lady?
Mordachai's up there, scared as a goose.
He's surrounded by guards, back to the wall, pistols out.
He's expecting Dawg.
If there are any of Dawg's men around, they will see you.
Mordachai's guards won't let you get close.
Wait a minute.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
How much?
- What?
- Come with me.
You stay put.
Where do you thinK you're going?
Tapster sent me.
Said the old turtle has his needs.
shake her down.
- Sweetheart, all that costs money.
- l have money.
I promise.
I will take care of you later.
Follow me.
You too.
Captain, you in the mood for a whore?
Show her in.
Wait a minute.
I recognize you.
You're not a whore.
Call your men, and it's the last sound you make.
You're Harry's girl.
You always was trouble.
Blast ya.
What do you want here, eh?
I've brought my father's map.
You have the map?
- What about the Morning Star, the ship?
- She's mine.
Here.
look what I'm doing.
Holy Virgin.
Harry's blessed head.
See?
is that not fine?
That's handsome of ya.
Mighty handsome.
But with you here, you bet your life Dawg's around somewhere.
I'm not afraid of Dawg. I'm half your age and nowhere near the sailor.
You shame me, lass.
I don't like that.
Then get up and fight!
Prove me wrong.
I've heard of Cutthroat Island.
I always thought it was a sailor's yarn.
Piles of skulls.
Reefs of sailors' drowned bones.
This treasure is ours.
Or would be... if you were an Adams.
There's no water in Adams blood.
I'll do it. I'll join with ya.
Just like Harry, mine's well hid.
Unfinished business from the other night, Morgan.
Let her stand, Mr. Snelgrave.
Morgan, what a woman you've become.
I Knew you'd bring him here, Morgan.
Blast ya!
Hello, brother Mordachai.
Morgan, in sweet memory... of bouncing you on my Knee as a little girl... I'm going to ask you just once for your daddy's piece of the map.
Would you settle for the point of my cutlass?
Somehow I Knew you would say something like that.
And then we'd fall to oaths and threats.
Let's cut through the talk, shall we?
I have just the thing for you, little niece.
This says it all, Morgan.
Pain.
Viciousness.
Mutilation.
All the good things in life.
My coat of arms.
Ugly, slippery and foul smelling.
- lt does say it all.
- Yes.
- And it looks like you.
- thank you.
We stay close together.
We're family.
- Captain!
- Bowen!
Get back to the ship!
Bring the men!
You think you might unlock these now?
.
Given the circumstances.
I don't have the Key here.
- Where is it?
- They never gave me one.
What?
The map.
Tell me where it is, or I'll run you through!
Hey!
You Killed my brother!
I saw that, little niece.
I remember when you were a little girl.
Always flinched when you saw your Uncle Douglas, didn't ya?
Give me the map!
Where's the map?
Give me the map!
Sweetheart, I promised I'd take care of you.
- Very pretty, Mr. Shaw.
- thank you, ma'am.
I had the good fortune to study with a grand master in Vienna.
Stop diddling and Kill the man.
Kill him?
Bless me.
We never got to that.
I see.
Come on!
I believe you have something of mine, Mr. Shaw.
Ma'am, I don't Know what you're talking about.
- Blair!
- This way, Morgan!
This does you no good on the ground, Mr. Bowen.
The numbers.
- What were the numbers?
- What numbers?
- The Psalms.
- 11, 75 and 42.
I figured it out.
It's the longitude.
- We must leave now.
- lt's the longitude.
- back to the ship.
- Move!
Hurry!
Come along, men.
Congratulations, madam.
There's another town you've destroyed.
Get along lively!
Heave!
Heave!
You've been in a fight.
You all right?
It's just a scratch.
Somebody, cut off his chains.
Nice ship.
Why aren't I moving?
Did you hear me, Mr. Bishop?
I said, why aren't I moving?
- The anchor's fouled, Captain.
- Cut it loose.
Aye, aye, sir.
quickly.
We can't leave yet, Captain.
We haven't put enough food on board.
We need less mouths.
Does no one hear me on this ship?
I distinctly said...
cut it loose!
75... 42... 1 1.
Keep her full!
Let me show you the chart.
The line I plotted runs here, through crooked Man Keys.
Cutthroat can't be far off.
look at the chart.
"Reef and coral heads."
Dawg outguns us, yes.
He's bigger.
But that means he's heavier, don't it?
He draws more water.
We lure him into the Keys and run him aground on the coral heads.
We'll Kill him there and take his map.
She has a wound.
We must get her below to the cabin.
It's festering.
That's why.
- Can you take the ball out?
- Hard to say.
Best I seal her side with this hot poker.
That's what we always do in such cases.
No offense, gentlemen, but given the circumstances... don't you thinK this calls for a professional?
It's all right.
Let him go.
He is a doctor.
I'll need surgeon's tools, hot water, sulfur and clean packing.
- Some rum might help her pain.
- Aye.
You as well, John.
- You clumsy swab!
- Sorry.
I was supposed to torture you.
Sorry.
- Do you see it yet?
- Close.
Another minute.
Your father and two uncles each had pieces of the map.
The treasure, it's large, I take it.
Largest ever taken.
Spanish gold ship.
Sorry.
And a third uncle, he chases you.
An unusual family.
Success.
I've treated you cruel, haven't I?
You've had a lot on your mind.
And you did help me at the prison.
The tavern.
Let's say, between us, just for argument's sake... that you have Mordachai's map.
But I don't.
No, I Know that, but pretend that you do.
I was willing to go halves with him and his.
I will do the same with you and yours.
You're saying... that if I show you mine, you'll share yours with me?
Give me the map.
Give me a Kiss first.
Sorry.
Map now.
You see, the thing is... I don't have it.
But that doesn't mean we can't Keep talking about it.
Mr. Blair's respects, Captain.
talk to yourself.
Yes, Mr. Bowen?
The Reaper's five miles off and closing.
You should stay down.
Mr. Bowen, see that Mr. Shaw gets a change of clothes.
- He's beginning to stink.
- Aye, Captain.
He has it.
She makes for crooked Man's Passage.
Yes.
She hopes to tear up our bottom on the coral.
looks like we're in for a blow.
Shall we attack her now?
.
No.
We'll go around the islands in the dark.
We'll ambush her on the other side at daybreak.
You are clever, Morgan, but I will catch you.
Uncle Dawg will have his day.
First Ainslee's chasing us.
Now your uncle is chasing us.
Now, everybody's chasing us.
I'm not so happy about this.
I mean, I'm using this piratical stuff to write a best-selling book.
I didn't want to put myself in any physical danger.
Put a stow in that sail, Mr. Blair.
We don't want to lose her.
- break fast the foresail!
- Aye, sir!
I cannot see the horizon.
There is a storm headed our way from the island.
- We'll hold this course.
- Aye.
- Put an extra man on the helm.
- Coxswain, up helm!
"May cruel death leave victims immortal."
M-C-D-L-V-l.
14-56.
1-4-5-6.
Fourteen degrees latitude... five minutes, six seconds north.
There's nothing there.
No, you were right.
It's not on any chart.
Where did you have it hidden?
In the boat, under the seaty thing.
I Knew you'd wind up here at some point... that being the cheese and you being the rat.
The thing is, ma'am, I'm basically a shallow man.
And no doctor.
Am I wrong?
No, not really.
I'm surprised you let me fiddle with your hip.
And no gentleman either.
I wanted to be.
The thing is, I was born poor.
My only choice was to become a thief and a liar.
Then since you lie so easily and are so shallow... I shall lie you in a shallow grave.
Mr. Blair!
Have you no charity, ma'am?
I brim with charity, Mr. Shaw.
I am charity's very soul.
Success, Mr. Blair.
My slave has found Cutthroat Island.
mark it on the chart.
And since I am so charitable... I will maroon you on a rock the size of this table... instead of splattering your brains across my bulkhead, as you deserve.
Let's take him below.
Pull!
Going up!
Pull the line, mate!
Tie it down!
Aye, aye, sir!
Tie it off!
Batten down the hatches!
Hold on!
I found it, Mr. Glasspoole!
I've fixed the island.
I Know where it is.
It lies through the storm.
You risk the ship if you head for it.
I risk Dawg if I turn back.
Shorten sail all you want, Mr. Blair.
We head straight through it.
Hold your course, men!
Have you ever seen anything like this?
Not so I'd remember.
I won't run!
look how close we are!
The rig, Morgan!
It can't take it!
It can !
We've been through worse with Harry.
Have faith, Mr. Blair!
Trust the ship!
We'll try it.
What is this?
I'll not die in a storm for your pleasure.
There are too many of them!
Tom Scully, there's no great love between us, but don't do this.
Not this close.
look!
There's the island!
It can't be more than two or three leagues off.
Away the longboat.
Clear the sweep!
Give us a compass, Scully!
You'll have no need of a compass where you're going!
You're going nowhere but down!
Pull!
Put your backs into it!
take up the stroke!
Somebody grab that bastard!
No!
ParKins!
Stop him!
Row hard!
It's our one hope!
Put your backs into it, men!
Pull!
Row hard, men!
Reef, men!
Reef!
White water ahead!
Row, men, row!
Bowen!
Bowen!
- Glasspoole, are you all right?
- Aye, Morgan.
- Bowen?
- Yes.
- Blair?
- Aye.
We've lost Hewitt and Ames.
look!
look!
The cliffs of blood!
It's Cutthroat!
It must be!
We are truly blessed.
We made it, Scully!
- We found it!
- We made it!
We found Cutthroat Island!
We need to find this trail.
- Can you tell where it begins?
- Not without the third piece.
We'll make for the high ground, get our bearings.
Mr. Bowen, bring that lizard.
We'll have it for dinner.
Gentlemen, we must thank Mr. Scully... for bringing us the chart.
But this piece is the only piece of the map... that shows the treasure site.
My piece.
- The Reaper.
- And the Morning Star.
She still swims.
Dawg must've caught Scully when he bore up in the storm.
That scoundrel must've made a deal with Dawg.
He betrayed my crew.
No sign of Shaw.
Spread out.
Search the whole island.
Find me this cove, these cliffs.
I'll wait ashore.
Go!
He makes to go ashore.
We'll follow him, get the map and find the treasure.
Find me a suitable campsite.
- l'm grateful to you, Mr. Scully.
- My pleasure.
But if you ever are disloyal to me the way you were to Morgan... it'll be my pleasure... to cook you alive and eat you.
Now get out of my eyes.
Morgan's here!
Bitch stole my map!
Find her, or you're all dead!
Spread out. lf he makes it out, we'll grab him.
I Know you're out there, Morgan.
I can smell you.
Where are you?
Damn you.
- Where?
- Help.
There he is.
Wait.
You wanna be careful.
It's quicksand.
Did you get Dawg's map, you bastard?
Hand it over, or you're a dead man.
Did you ever think that I might've taken it to give to you?
Not for a second.
sinking up to your waist, and still all you can do is lie.
It's completely true. I could no longer stand your opinion of me.
- Then give it over.
- l will, with all my heart... if you'd get me out first.
Do you thinK I was born last Wednesday?
Give it here, and then we will talk about rescue.
I see your point of view... but it works better for me if I'm on hard land first.
You're up to your chest.
What if I give it to you and you leave me here?
You spoke not long ago of marooning me.
What if I pull you out and you swallow it or run away?
You're beyond trusting.
That's the problem with being a thief.
Nobody Knows when you're telling the truth.
Give me the tip of your dagger.
What for?
Give it to me.
Don't argue.
There.
It's no Valentine, but it will have to do.
Now you have it all and I have nothing.
I'm in your command, Morgan.
Do with me what you will.
quickly.
Well... good luck.
Fish him out.
Hold tight.
That was quite a storm, wasn't it, boys?
We need to get around these hills... through this forest near the coast.
There.
There's our treasure.
Well, shall we?
What are the instructions from here?
Seventy-five paces from this pillar.
- Twelve.
- Twelve?
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen?
Fourteen.
Fifteen.
Sixteen.
Seventeen.
Eighteen.
Nineteen.
- Twenty.
- look!
- Seventy-five?
- That's what the map says.
- Well, you misread it.
- No, it's very clear.
"Seventy-five paces from the rock pillar."
- Then the other 55 are out there.
- Or...
look!
That could be the other 55 paces.
We found a cave in the cliff!
Aye!
If they catch us here, they'll find Morgan.
We must leave.
Dead men tell no tales.
What does it say?
"Mouth of darkness, teeth of stone... down the throat to the belly of gold... guarded by those who never grew old."
Well.
Watch your head here.
Here.
Don't do that!
Let's try this way.
Uh, but--
Down the throat to the belly of gold!
Hey!
Down the throat to the belly of gold!
Harry, I found it.
"Guarded by those who never grew old."
And your grandfather was the only one that came back.
We're rich!
Rich!
We'd best get these out.
Dawg can't be far behind.
Fetch the others. I'll start hauling this to the entrance.
Right.
Wait.
All right. I'm going.
But no tricks.
And hurry.
Anybody up there?
Morgan!
lucky me.
We was looking' all over for you.
That's your young friend from Spittlefield.
- What have you got there?
- Treasure!
Bags of it!
Be careful what you do!
You could lose a lot!
Put a ball between his eyes.
Go ahead!
It's about four million pounds!
No, wait!
That's a guess, but I can't be off by more than a million pounds.
Cut the rope, William!
Get away!
William!
Let's make a deal.
I can be reasonable.
Send Morgan down!
I'll send the treasure up, and we'll both have what we want!
All right, William.
We have a deal.
Here she comes.
I wish I'd never learned Latin.
Now we have both.
Haul them in.
Don't watch me fall.
- l'm coming with you.
- Don't be mad.
Why?
Don't argue.
Let's agree upon something for once.
All right.
On the count of three, then?
Come to me, Morgan.
- One more thing.
- What?
Considering everything, I really think that from now on... we should be full partners.
What do you say?
- Sixty-forty.
- Fifty-fifty.
Full partners.
Very well.
They have a lot to say to each other, don't they?
- Are you ready now?
.
- Ready.
One.
Two.
Now!
Love.
Who can explain it?
Come on.
Heave!
This is your future, men.
Heave!
- Have you seen Morgan?
- Yes, I did.
She helped me ashore, then sent me to find you.
thank God she's alive.
Where is she?
Where Dawg can't find her.
It's this way.
Follow me.
- How'd you get off Morgan's ship?
- Same as you, I jumped.
Fortunately, I'm an excellent swimmer.
- This seems rather far.
- lt's just a few more feet.
Raise musKets!
Aim!
Splendid.
Before we hang you in Port Royal, you've time to witness... an historic alliance.
Where's Morgan?
I don't think she made it.
Perhaps you're wondering how I come to be here.
A little bird told me.
Plump pigeon.
Courtesy of Mr. Reed.
All right, get up!
All right, you.
Come on!
There, sir!
Trotter!
Discretion dictates that I shall not load the treasure... out of the British man-of-war.
I shall go back to Port Royal with Captain Dawg.
But, sir--
You don't have much feel for these things.
One day, perhaps.
I hope so, sir.
That's it!
Got it!
take a few of the men and follow in the other pirate ship.
You'll get a share of the prize money-- a little here, a little there.
- lt all adds up.
- Yes, sir!
Now, sir, I shall go presently... and write for your royal pardon.
Privateer for the Crown.
Sounds so much better than "pirate," don't you thinK?
Why do you let that preening swab live?
I study him.
When I become governor of Jamaica... I will need a certain... style.
Trotter.
lock them below with the others.
They hang at Port Royal.
With pleasure, Your Honor.
- Welcome aboard my ship, gentlemen.
- Move along!
I trust you'll find your quarters to my liking.
Move on!
Below with ya!
Let's get down there!
We'll weigh anchor.
Rouse the watch forward.
There we go.
Square away the breakers!
- Stand by!
- Come on now.
Push!
Let go the footing!
I thought I should never see you again.
Yes, Mr. Glasspoole, it's me.
What do you say?
Shall we take back our ship?
On your word, Captain.
tackle's all right.
Cover it up.
The next one.
Mr. Coller!
I believe we can ease the main sheet a foot or two.
- Aye, sir!
- lt'll draw better for it.
Are you a good swimmer, Mr. Scully?
Let's find out, shall we?
Do you wish a compass, Scully?
take your closest friends with you!
There are islands close by!
You can make it if you swim slowly!
I'll get you!
I'll be back, Morgan, if it's the last thing I do!
King Charles?
Ease your topsail!
Are you in there?
Well, you've seen what another captain's like.
Will you take my orders now?
.
Smile, Mr. Trotter.
Good, Trotter.
Give me some more shot here.
We'll edge towards them, Mr. Blair.
Not so fast to alarm them.
Two points to starboard, and Keep her steady.
Two points starboard.
Keep her steady.
Trotter's closing on us.
is that so?
Doubtless wants advice.
Poor fool can't tie his shoelaces without instruction.
Let's let him catch us.
I hope Mr. Shaw's still alive.
General quarters, Mr. Snelgrave.
Powder to the guns, but softly.
What's going on?
Do what I tell you.
Governor.
Oblige me.
Let me hang Mr. Shaw now from my yardarm.
- This minute?
- Yes.
Might be rather amusing.
One doesn't often get the chance to see a hanging at sea.
Come on, you.
Present arms!
It's a long drop.
What is it?
It's not good.
Best take a look.
William Shaw, you've been found guilty... of piracy in the province of Jamaica.
By the authority of His Majesty the King... the penalty for piracy is death.
Pray, hangman, carry out the sentence!
He's testing us.
Prime your guns, men.
Are we prepared to fire, Mr. Snelgrave?
Bloody hell!
I Knew it.
- On command!
- Up ports!
Cannons forward!
Cannons ready!
Guns forward!
- Open fire!
- Fire!
Fire!
Hoist our colors!
Mr. Blair, close it quickly now!
Fire!
Oh, my God.
Blast 'em from the sea!
They want your treasure!
Will you let 'em take it?
- On your way.
- Aye.
knock 'em down!
Riflemen, prepare!
She means to board me!
Point her up!
Fire!
Sling your hooks!
Boarders aboard!
I love this.
I love it!
Who wants to die first?
Come on!
Kill 'em!
Kill 'em all!
Damn you!
They are so many.
We are so few!
Keep fighting.
Hold them back as long as you can.
Aye!
Where you go?
To blow out his bottom and get what we came for!
Separate the ships when I do!
Aye.
Die, Morgan, ya sea witch!
Morgan has done it!
You!
Cut us loose!
- What for?
- No future in the army, sir.
- What are you doing here?
- Not what you thinK.
There you are, Morgan!
Come to seek my treasure, have you?
Don't move. I'll be right down to help you count it.
- Let's finish this.
- Come up to Uncle!
Forgive me.
I will come back.
- l promise.
- The whole ship's going to blow!
That boy doesn't understand us.
But then, he's not family.
Come on!
You cut me, niece.
That was for Mordachai.
The next one is for Harry.
Be quick!
Undo my bonds!
Your father was nothing!
All my brothers were nothing.
You exceed them.
think how far we could go together.
You and me against the world.
Join me.
You don't have to die.
You do.
You've run out of world.
Can you hear me?
I'm coming for you.
Can you please hurry?
I'll give you this much.
You're harder to Kill than your father.
The odd thing is, I enjoyed it.
I never gave up.
Never gave in.
I regret it's finished.
Give my love to Harry when you see him.
It's over, Morgan.
You planning to fight me with that little stick?
No, Uncle.
With this!
Bad Dawg!
quick!
There's no time.
The ship's going to blow up.
Yes.
Go ahead.
Hurry!
It's too bad we'll have to leave all this behind.
Hurry!
There's no time for the treasure!
Yes!
Let's hurry!
Here!
Up here!
quickly!
Give me your hand!
Jump.
look!
They're alive!
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
You?
Fine.
Just a little poorer.
Well, it doesn't matter.
I'm alive, and you're alive and--
And we're alive together.
There will be other treasures.
Do you really feel that way?
Absolutely.
Then I guess you don't want your share.
- That's a barrel.
- On this end.
- On this end?
- Yes.
A marker barrel.
But on the other--
This is yours, men.
Every last doubloon.
No one ever fought harder for anything.
Mr. Glasspoole will divide it into equal shares for us.
You're all rich men now.
You're free to go your separate ways.
You could buy a little cottage in Bermuda... and drink camomile tea on the porch.
On the other hand, we could do what we were born to do.
Stay together and ride the early trades all the way to Madagascar... the best pirating waters in the world.
Well, what do you say?
Shall we add to this pile here on the deck?
Mr. Glasspoole, what say you?
It's just that it is such a large decision to make... in such a small amount of time.
Aye!
Mr. Blair?
I'd like to, but it's just-- l've always wanted to do a bit of farming.
Farming?
To the captain!
- Where to?
- l told you.
Madagascar.
But that's in Africa.
Then we'd best get busy.
Mr. Trotter, take the crow's nest watch for the next 12 hours.
Good as done, ma'am.
Mr. Blair, prepare to come about.
Steer south-southeast.
On to your stations, men.
Prepare to come about south-southeast.
And, Mr. Shaw.
I'd like to see you in my cabin immediately.

You're leaving?
But I thought you and I were forever?
I want you so badly.
- Morgan!
- But so does the Port Royal governor.
He will pay well for the capture of Morgan Adams, the pirate.
- You knew who I was?
- All along.
Morgan!
Where are you?
You are heartless, Lieutenant.
My apologies, senorita.
But you are right.
I thought it was much more amusing this way also... since I knew that you knew.
By the way, that won't work.
See?
I took your balls.
What happened?
Your father sent for you two days ago.
I know.
I was coming.
He did not know this.
He went looking for you.
That's when Dawg grabbed him.
Lord knows what he does with him.
I took this from our brother Richard last week.
Unwillingly.
That's his blood on the borders.
With your piece, all I need is Mordachai's.
You're out of luck.
I don't have it.
Where is it?
With Morgan?
I haven't seen her.
I think you lie, Harry.
I hid it.
Progress.
Where?
Up here.
I always thought there was nothing in your head.
Come back on board.
I'm going to split you wide open.
Mr. Snelgrave.
I'll see ya in hell.
Father!
- Father, I've got you!
- Let go!
Let go!
Hold onto me!
- Let go!
- Never!
No!
Father!
Father!
Someone get a grappling hook!
Launch the cutter.
Heave!
Oh, Lord, what did I do in my life to get you?
Dawg will pay for this, I swear.
You leave Dawg be.
I will fly his bloody head as my banner!
You'll leave Dawg well to leeward.
There will be time for him.
Find your Uncle Mordachai.
Take my crew.
Make them yours.
Father, don't talk now.
I'll get you back to the ship.
I'll not see my ship again.
The Morning Star is yours.
Don't say that.
I've patched you with worse.
Get your knife.
Shave my head.
- What?
- Shave my head.
For once in your life, Morgan... do as I tell you.
Lieutenant.
What is your name again?
Plopper?
Squinter?
Trotter, Your Excellency.
Miss Mandy Rickets is standing alone.
Her father brings a fortune in investments to the colony.
Dance with her.
She's rather homely, sir.
And you are not?
There you are.
You see?
Too late.
Some other fellow has taken the plunge.
There's every reason why I should be alone tonight... being a stranger here... but a woman with grace such as yours... should never be unattended.
My name is Shaw.
William Shaw.
But my friends call me Willy.
Do we know him, sir?
We do not.
Are you at leisure, Mr. Shaw, or do you follow a profession?
Most serious one, ma'am.
I'm a medical man, a doctor.
Oh, my!
I studied at Leyden, then higher anatomy with Dreyfuss at Leipzig.
With higher anatomy, you must know a great deal about the human body.
Indeed, madam.
Every bit of it.
All the ins and outs.
In medicine, it's our obligation to probe to the very bottom of things.
We must, in fact, explode ancient superstitions... shake truths violently from the body.
You, sir!
Forgive my rudeness.
Trotter's the name.
I'm with the regiment.
William Shaw.
Dr. Shaw, in fact.
Most happy.
What ship did you come in on, Doctor?
Was it the Bristol packet?
Bristol packet?
Bristol packet?
I believe that was it, although I can't be sure.
I'm all at sea when it comes to things nautical.
Very good.
No, the reason I asked... is the Bristol packet don't arrive until a week Wednesday.
That's him!
That man stole my diamond comb!
My pearls!
My pearl dangles!
My ruby necklace!
- Sergeant of the guard!
- Women!
Sergeant of the guard!
Good night, ladies!
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
His name's Shaw, sir.
I trust you'll enjoy life as a slave, Mr. Shaw.
Whoever you are.
That's good.
Tie it off!
Morgan, think of the freedom.
You can do anything you want now.
Come to London with me.
Come to London with me.
There are dukes there.
There are earls and parties.
It'll be fun.
Think of how much fun it'd be.
Besides, these men aren't gonna take orders from you.
They will!
Watch.
You there.
Stand to.
Hoist my pennant.
Bring it here.
Mutiny, will ya?
I was hoping to find you sober.
I was hoping to be passed out by now, Mr. Glasspoole.
Important things go on overhead.
Morgan, you should be there.
Men, Black Harry is gone.
I'm not one to speak ill of the dead... but for months he brought us nothing.
So now we can either sell this rotten bark and divvy up... or you can choose me captain.
I stand for captain.
My father wished it.
As he died, he gave me this.
He left it for all of you.
That's his bloody scalp.
It's a map to Cutthroat Island... the buried treasure of a Spanish gold ship.
More gold, jewels and plunder than you've ever dreamed of.
What does it say?
Aye.
It says--
You read it.
- I can't.
- Why not?
It's Latin.
Then I will have it translated at once.
There must be someone who knows Latin at Port Royal.
My Uncle Mordachai holds a second piece at Spittlefield.
There's more than one piece?
Actually, there are three.
- Where's the third?
- Dawg Brown has it.
Oh, well!
It's practically in our pocket.
We'll fight him for it.
We'll join with Mordachai.
Two ships against one.
You should like them odds.
Ask yourselves.
What would Harry have done?
This is our chance to seek some real fortune... and to pay back Dawg what we owe him.
What could be better than that?
Mr. Blair, you are quartermaster.
You decide.
Two days is all I need.
One to Port Royal, one to Spittlefield.
If Harry picked you, I'll give you a chance.
Let any man who would challenge me draw that.
I found him.
He's a prisoner inside.
He speaks Latin.
Good.
Let's break him out.
Unfortunately, Captain-
- I mean, ma'am, he's about to be sold as a slave.
A slave.
They're hanging the pirates.
They're gonna find you out.
You worry too much.
Don't I look right?
You look beautiful.
It's just that I'm the only person here who has the slightest inkling... of how to act like a gentleperson, so I have to go with you.
- Then you shall come.
- But, unfortunately, I can't.
I have pressing business with my bookseller.
- The fat man is right.
- I'll see you at Spittlefield.
You must be at your best behavior.
Then, gallant sir, escort me thither.
Turn around.
- You.
On your feet.
- Ask me politely.
You anticipate too much.
It's more like a fencing move.
Any fool can do it.
I hope you enjoy pain, slave.
Because I intend to buy you.
Good morning, madam.
As you can see, I'm young, in fine health.
I know horsemanship.
I write a fine hand.
I have it on authority that you are fluent in Latin.
Ah, Latin, the Romance language.
I can speak Latin like I was born in the ancient Senate.
A regular Cicero.
Why?
Do you have children who wish to learn?
I'd make a first-class teacher in a tasteful country house.
I can do most arithmetic, though I confess a weakness in long division.
Stop your chatter and say something Latinish.
What did you say?
You're a very beautiful woman.
I'd like to wash your feet.
You like to wash things, do you?
Start with your mouth.
Ten pounds?
Five pounds?
What?
No offers at all?
Take him away and hang him.
Next!
Please!
Don't hang me!
Next!
Lot 22!
A colonist.
A doctor.
Being of value, I start the bidding at five pounds.
- I bid five pounds.
- Five pounds, sir.
Go on.
Any advance on five pounds?
He's of good physique.
- Ten pounds.
- Ten pounds!
- Any advance on ten pounds?
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen pounds, sir.
- Twenty pounds.
- Twenty pounds is the bid.
- Sir, a word to the wise.
- Let the young lady win.
- You won't get one like this.
- Being a doctor, he's--
- Go away!
That one is mine.
- Twenty-five pounds.
- Twenty-five pounds, sir.
Good teeth.
- Thirty pounds!
- Thirty pounds!
Madam, I will have this man at any price.
If you are buying him purely for pleasure...
I will offer to do the same for you at no cost.
A doctor!
- Thirty-five pounds!
- Thirty-five pounds, sir.
A sensible choice, indeed.
Go on.
Captain, no!
Where's your sense of competition?
Come on!
Someone give me more than 35!
You, sir, you haven't bid.
Look at him.
Look at the quality.
And you, madam, another bid?
Any advance on 35.
I hope the lady is prepared to be a good loser.
What gave you the idea I was a lady?
Another bid, sir?
I see your lips moving.
Yes?
Are you trying to kill me, madam?
Yes, that's why I'm aiming where your brains are.
Now leave this place and go far away.
Don't retreat now, sir.
Where are you going?
- Don't surrender this opportunity.
- Forty pounds to end the bidding.
Sold to the lady with the monkey.
Take him away.
Go on!
Move!
Of course, I'm grateful, madam.
You picked a bargain.
I'm connected to all the great families of Europe.
- I have a natural pitch for music...
- Quiet!
and a perfect taste in wine.
Enemy to leeward, Captain.
Starboard as well, Captain.
Time to leave.
You draw them away.
We'll meet at Dingley Crossroads.
- Take King Charles.
Come on.
- Aye.
It's Morgan Adams!
She's at the auction!
Shoot to kill!
If I am in some way the cause of all this, I apologize at once.
Here.
Come here.
Hold on there.
Hold on tight.
Try to keep up with me.
I am not fond of heights!
Then let go!
Lieutenant Trotter!
What's going on?
Something with Mr. Shaw, I believe.
I'm in favor of exercise, but you owe me an explanation.
Come here.
Come on.
We have to climb down here.
Fast!
- Where'd they go?
- There!
Was that fast enough?
Come on!
Get the reins!
Grab them!
Come on!
Go!
Mr. Trotter!
That's my bloody carriage.
I'll have it back, if you please.
You, off.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, sir.
He won't get far.
Reload!
It's hard to imagine what part of your life would require Latin!
Reload!
- We've taken a passenger!
- Here!
You're hitting a woman!
Captain Perkins, sir!
- Yes?
- It's her!
Morgan Adams!
You're more active than other women I've known.
Morgan!
Watch your head!
Charge!
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Stop them!
I must visit that shop again when I have more time.
- Master gunner, fire at will.
- Run 'em up!
Fire!
A ship!
I find myself being fired upon by an entire ship!
Oh, my God.
You certainly left your mark on this town.
Hold on!
Whoa!
Trotter, do you want to spend the rest of your days on this poxy island?
- Who was that woman?
- Morgan Adams, sir.
You've 100 pounds on her head.
Black Harry's girl.
Well, well.
She's made a proper fool of me, hasn't she?
Two hundred pounds and a captaincy for you if you find her for me.
Sir!
- Any difficulties?
- Nothing unusual.
Here.
Step down into the carriage.
- Will you take the reins?
- Aye.
We should make Spittlefield by dark.
What is your name anyway, slave?
Shaw.
William Shaw.
Dr. Shaw, actually.
Slave, I'm about to show you something.
Reveal it to any other man, and you will wish you were back at Port Royal... with your head on the block and the ax in the air.
Thank you, but I've seen one before.
What is this?
A pigskin?
Translate what is written there.
Let's discuss terms first.
I do so, and you set me free.
That's tender.
It's about to become more tender.
They're backwards.
I assure you, ma'am, they're normal in every respect.
No, the words.
They're written backwards.
Look.
Can you see?
"Cliffs of blood." Bless me.
You're right.
You tell Mr. Squeakum's that I will send him a new chapter every month.
- Now, what's this all about?
- He's a great admirer of your books.
That makes me happy.
Which books has he read?
Did he mention?
His Excellency Governor Ainslee, John Reed, the author... currently the chronicler of piracy.
Step up, sir.
Always a pleasure to meet a literary man.
- I'd just as soon walk.
- I insist.
I can do that, you know.
"When the earth and all its people quake-
- Psalm, number 75.
My bones suffer mortal agony.
Number 42."
- And?
- That's all.
- No position?
No parallel?
- I swear it, ma'am.
That's all that's here.
Piracy, Mr. Reed, is the scourge of these plantations.
I, therefore, give rather large rewards for the capture of pirates... including Morgan Adams.
I don't know who she is.
Trotter tells me that you move throughout the pirate world... collecting your little tales.
Dangerous.
If by some chance you come across her, you might tell her on my behalf... that I offer her two alternatives.
One, an ignominious death on the gallows like these poor fellows here.
Please bear in mind that I could decide you're a pirate as well.
And the alternative?
She might cut me in for a share... of her grandfather's treasure... or she ends up as dinner for crows.
Pull up!
Good day, Mr. Reed.
Do you understand me, sir?
Here.
Here's a good one.
You blackguard!
Can you spare a little, lady?
Mordachai's up there, scared as a goose.
He's surrounded by guards, back to the wall, pistols out.
He's expecting Dawg.
If there are any of Dawg's men around, they will see you.
Mordachai's guards won't let you get close.
Wait a minute.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
How much?
- What?
- Come with me.
You stay put.
Where do you think you're going?
Tapster sent me.
Said the old turtle has his needs.
Shake her down.
- Sweetheart, all that costs money.
- I have money.
I promise.
I will take care of you later.
Follow me.
You too.
Captain, you in the mood for a whore?
Show her in.
Wait a minute.
I recognize you.
You're not a whore.
Call your men, and it's the last sound you make.
You're Harry's girl.
You always were trouble.
Blast ya.
What do you want here, eh?
I've brought my father's map.
You have the map?
- What about the Morning Star, the ship?
- She's mine.
Here.
Look what I'm doing.
Holy Virgin.
Harry's blessed head.
See?
Is that not fine?
That's handsome of ya.
Mighty handsome.
But with you here, you bet your life Dawg's around somewhere.
I'm not afraid of Dawg.
I'm half your age and nowhere near the sailor.
You shame me, lass.
I don't like that.
Then get up and fight!
Prove me wrong.
I've heard of Cutthroat Island.
I always thought it was a sailor's yarn.
Piles of skulls.
Reefs of sailors' drowned bones.
This treasure is ours.
Or would be... if you were an Adams.
There's no water in Adams blood.
I'll do it.
I'll join with ya.
Just like Harry, mine's well hid.
Unfinished business from the other night, Morgan.
Let her stand, Mr. Snelgrave.
Morgan, what a woman you've become.
I knew you'd bring him here, Morgan.
Blast ya!
Hello, brother Mordachai.
Morgan, in sweet memory... of bouncing you on my knee as a little girl...
I'm going to ask you just once for your daddy's piece of the map.
Would you settle for the point of my cutlass?
Somehow I knew you would say something like that.
And then we'd fall to oaths and threats.
Let's cut through the talk, shall we?
I have just the thing for you, little niece.
This says it all, Morgan.
Pain.
Viciousness.
Mutilation.
All the good things in life.
My coat of arms.
Ugly, slippery and foul smelling.
- It does say it all.
- Yes.
- And it looks like you.
- Thank you.
We stay close together.
We're family.
- Captain!
- Bowen!
Get back to the ship!
Bring the men!
You think you might unlock these now?
Given the circumstances.
I don't have the key here.
- Where is it?
- They never gave me one.
What?
The map.
Tell me where it is, or I'll run you through!
Hey!
You killed my brother!
I saw that, little niece.
I remember when you were a little girl.
Always flinched when you saw your Uncle Douglas, didn't ya?
Give me the map!
Where's the map?
Give me the map!
Sweetheart, I promised I'd take care of you.
- Very pretty, Mr. Shaw.
- Thank you, ma'am.
I had the good fortune to study with a grand master in Vienna.
Stop diddling and kill the man.
Kill him?
Bless me.
We never got to that.
I see.
Come on!
I believe you have something of mine, Mr. Shaw.
Ma'am, I don't know what you're talking about.
- Blair!
- This way, Morgan!
This does you no good on the ground, Mr. Bowen.
The numbers.
- What were the numbers?
- What numbers?
- The Psalms. - 11, 75 and 42.
I figured it out.
It's the longitude.
- We must leave now.
- It's the longitude.
- Back to the ship.
- Move!
Hurry!
Come along, men.
Congratulations, madam.
There's another town you've destroyed.
Get along lively!
Heave!
Heave!
You've been in a fight.
You all right?
It's just a scratch.
Somebody, cut off his chains.
Nice ship.
Why aren't I moving?
Did you hear me, Mr. Bishop?
I said, why aren't I moving?
- The anchors fouled, Captain.
- Cut it loose.
Aye, aye, sir.
Quickly.
We can't leave yet, Captain.
We haven't put enough food on board.
We need less mouths.
Does no one hear me on this ship?
I distinctly said... cut it loose!
75... 42... 11.
Keep her full!
Let me show you the chart.
The line I plotted runs here, through Crooked Man Keys.
Cutthroat can't be far off.
Look at the chart.
"Reef and coral heads."
Dawg outguns us, yes.
He's bigger.
But that means he's heavier, don't it?
He draws more water.
We lure him into the keys and run him aground on the coral heads.
We'll kill him there and take his map.
She has a wound.
We must get her below to the cabin.
It's festering.
That's why.
- Can you take the ball out?
- Hard to say.
Best I seal her side with this hot poker.
That's what we always do in such cases.
No offense, gentlemen, but given the circumstances... don't you think this calls for a professional?
It's all right.
Let him go.
He is a doctor.
I'll need surgeon's tools, hot water, sulfur and clean packing.
- Some rum might help her pain.
- Aye.
You as well, John.
- You clumsy swab!
- Sorry.
I was supposed to torture you.
Sorry.
- Do you see it yet?
- Close.
Another minute.
Your father and two uncles each had pieces of the map.
The treasure, it's large, I take it.
Largest ever taken.
Spanish gold ship.
Sorry.
And a third uncle, he chases you.
An unusual family.
Success.
I've treated you cruel, haven't I?
You've had a lot on your mind.
And you did help me at the prison.
The tavern.
Let's say, between us, just for argument's sake... that you have Mordachai's map.
But I don't.
No, I know that, but pretend that you do.
I was willing to go halves with him and his.
I will do the same with you and yours.
You're saying... that if I show you mine, you'll share yours with me?
Give me the map.
Give me a kiss first.
Sorry.
Map now.
You see, the thing is...
I don't have it.
But that doesn't mean we can't keep talking about it.
Mr. Blair's respects, Captain.
Talk to yourself.
Yes, Mr. Bowen?
The Reaper's five miles off and closing.
You should stay down.
Mr. Bowen, see that Mr. Shaw gets a change of clothes.
- He's beginning to stink.
- Aye, Captain.
He has it.
She makes for Crooked Man's Passage.
Yes.
She hopes to tear up our bottom on the coral.
Looks like we're in for a blow.
Shall we attack her now?
No.
We'll go around the islands in the dark.
We'll ambush her on the other side at daybreak.
You are clever, Morgan, but I will catch you.
Uncle Dawg will have his day.
First Ainslee's chasing us.
Now your uncle is chasing us.
Now, everybody's chasing us.
I'm not so happy about this.
I mean, I'm using this piratical stuff to write a best-selling book.
I didn't want to put myself in any physical danger.
Put a stow in that sail, Mr. Blair.
We don't want to lose her.
- Break fast the foresail!
- Aye, sir!
I cannot see the horizon.
There is a storm headed our way from the island.
- We'll hold this course.
- Aye.
- Put an extra man on the helm.
- Coxswain, up helm!
"May cruel death leave victims immortal."
M-C-D-L-V-l.
14-56.
1-4-5-6.
Fourteen degrees latitude... five minutes, six seconds north.
There's nothing there.
No, you were right.
It's not on any chart.
Where did you have it hidden?
In the boat, under the seaty thing.
I knew you'd wind up here at some point... that being the cheese and you being the rat.
The thing is, ma'am, I'm basically a shallow man.
And no doctor.
Am I wrong?
No, not really.
I'm surprised you let me fiddle with your hip.
And no gentleman either.
I wanted to be.
The thing is, I was born poor.
My only choice was to become a thief and a liar.
Then since you lie so easily and are so shallow...
I shall lie you in a shallow grave.
Mr. Blair!
Have you no charity, ma'am?
I brim with charity, Mr. Shaw.
I am charity's very soul.
Success, Mr. Blair.
My slave has found Cutthroat Island.
Mark it on the chart.
And since I am so charitable...
I will maroon you on a rock the size of this table... instead of splattering your brains across my bulkhead, as you deserve.
Let's take him below.
Pull!
Going up!
Pull the line, mate!
Tie it down!
Aye, aye, sir!
Tie it off!
Batten down the hatches!
Hold on!
I found it, Mr. Glasspoole!
I've fixed the island.
I know where it is.
It lies through the storm.
You risk the ship if you head for it.
I risk Dawg if I turn back.
Shorten sail all you want, Mr. Blair.
We head straight through it.
Hold your course, men!
Have you ever seen anything like this?
Not so I'd remember.
I won't run!
Look how close we are!
The rig, Morgan!
It can't take it!
It can !
We've been through worse with Harry.
Have faith, Mr. Blair!
Trust the ship!
We'll try it.
What is this?
I'll not die in a storm for your pleasure.
There are too many of them!
Tom Scully, there's no great love between us, but don't do this.
Not this close.
Look!
There's the island!
It can't be more than two or three leagues off.
Away the longboat.
Clear the sweep!
Give us a compass, Scully!
You'll have no need of a compass where you're going!
You're going nowhere but down!
Pull!
Put your backs into it!
Take up the stroke!
Somebody grab that bastard!
No!
Parkins!
Stop him!
Row hard!
It's our one hope!
Put your backs into it, men!
Pull!
Row hard, men!
Reef, men!
Reef!
White water ahead!
Row, men, row!
Bowen!
Bowen!
- Glasspoole, are you all right?
- Aye, Morgan.
- Bowen?
- Yes.
- Blair?
- Aye.
We've lost Hewitt and Ames.
Look!
Look!
The cliffs of blood!
It's Cutthroat!
It must be!
We are truly blessed.
We made it, Scully!
- We found it!
- We made it!
We found Cutthroat Island!
We need to find this trail.
- Can you tell where it begins?
- Not without the third piece.
We'll make for the high ground, get our bearings.
Mr. Bowen, bring that lizard.
We'll have it for dinner.
Gentlemen, we must thank Mr. Scully... for bringing us the chart.
But this piece is the only piece of the map... that shows the treasure site.
My piece.
- The Reaper.
- And the Morning Star.
She still swims.
Dawg must've caught Scully when he bore up in the storm.
That scoundrel must've made a deal with Dawg.
He betrayed my crew.
No sign of Shaw.
Spread out.
Search the whole island.
Find me this cove, these cliffs.
I'll wait ashore.
Go!
He makes to go ashore.
We'll follow him, get the map and find the treasure.
Find me a suitable campsite.
- I'm grateful to you, Mr. Scully.
- My pleasure.
But if you ever are disloyal to me the way you were to Morgan... it'll be my pleasure... to cook you alive and eat you.
Now get out of my eyes.
Morgan's here!
Bitch stole my map!
Find her, or you're all dead!
Spread out.
If he makes it out, we'll grab him.
I know you're out there, Morgan.
I can smell you.
Where are you?
Damn you.
- Where?
- Help.
There he is.
Wait.
You wanna be careful.
It's quicksand.
Did you get Dawg's map, you bastard?
Hand it over, or you're a dead man.
Did you ever think that I might've taken it to give to you?
Not for a second.
Sinking up to your waist, and still all you can do is lie.
It's completely true.
I could no longer stand your opinion of me.
- Then give it over.
- I will, with all my heart... if you'd get me out first.
Do you think I was born last Wednesday?
Give it here, and then we will talk about rescue.
I see your point of view... but it works better for me if I'm on hard land first.
You're up to your chest.
What if I give it to you and you leave me here?
You spoke not long ago of marooning me.
What if I pull you out and you swallow it or run away?
You're beyond trusting.
That's the problem with being a thief.
Nobody knows when you're telling the truth.
Give me the tip of your dagger.
What for?
Give it to me.
Don't argue.
There.
It's no Valentine, but it will have to do.
Now you have it all and I have nothing.
I'm in your command, Morgan.
Do with me what you will.
Quickly.
Well... good luck.
Fish him out.
Hold tight.
That was quite a storm, wasn't it, boys?
We need to get around these hills... through this forest near the coast.
There.
There's our treasure.
Well, shall we?
What are the instructions from here?
Seventy-five paces from this pillar.
- Twelve.
- Twelve?
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen?
Fourteen.
Fifteen.
Sixteen.
Seventeen.
Eighteen.
Nineteen.
- Twenty.
- Look!
- Seventy-five?
- That's what the map says.
- Well, you misread it.
- No, it's very clear.
"Seventy-five paces from the rock pillar."
- Then the other 55 are out there.
- Or...
Look!
That could be the other 55 paces.
We found a cave in the cliff!
Aye!
If they catch us here, they'll find Morgan.
We must leave.
Dead men tell no tales.
What does it say?
"Mouth of darkness, teeth of stone... down the throat to the belly of gold... guarded by those who never grew old."
Well.
Watch your head here.
Here.
Don't do that!
Let's try this way.
Uh, but--
Down the throat to the belly of gold!
Hey!
Down the throat to the belly of gold!
Harry, I found it.
"Guarded by those who never grew old."
And your grandfather was the only one that came back.
We're rich!
Rich!
We'd best get these out.
Dawg can't be far behind.
Fetch the others.
I'll start hauling this to the entrance.
Right.
Wait.
All right.
I'm going.
But no tricks.
And hurry.
Anybody up there?
Morgan!
Lucky me.
We were lookin' all over for you.
That's your young friend from Spittlefield.
- What have you got there?
- Treasure!
Bags of it!
Be careful what you do!
You could lose a lot!
Put a ball between his eyes.
Go ahead!
It's about four million pounds!
No, wait!
That's a guess, but I can't be off by more than a million pounds.
Cut the rope, William!
Get away!
William!
Let's make a deal.
I can be reasonable.
Send Morgan down!
I'll send the treasure up, and we'll both have what we want!
All right, William.
We have a deal.
Here she comes.
I wish I'd never learned Latin.
Now we have both.
Haul them in.
Don't watch me fall.
- I'm coming with you.
- Don't be mad.
Why?
Don't argue.
Let's agree upon something for once.
All right.
On the count of three, then?
Come to me, Morgan.
- One more thing.
- What?
Considering everything, I really think that from now on... we should be full partners.
What do you say?
- Sixty-forty.
- Fifty-fifty.
Full partners.
Very well.
They have a lot to say to each other, don't they?
- Are you ready now?
- Ready.
One.
Two.
Now!
Love.
Who can explain it?
Come on.
Heave!
This is your future, man.
Heave!
- Have you seen Morgan?
- Yes, I did.
She helped me ashore, then sent me to find you.
Thank God she's alive.
Where is she?
Where Dawg can't find her.
It's this way.
Follow me.
- How'd you get off Morgan's ship?
- Same as you, I jumped.
Fortunately, I'm an excellent swimmer.
- This seems rather far.
- It's just a few more feet.
Raise muskets!
Aim!
Splendid.
Before we hang you in Port Royal, you've time to witness... an historic alliance.
Where's Morgan?
I don't think she made it.
Perhaps you're wondering how I come to be here.
A little bird told me.
Plump pigeon.
Courtesy of Mr. Reed.
All right, get up!
All right, you.
Come on!
There, sir!
Trotter!
Discretion dictates that I shall not load the treasure... out of the British man-of-war.
I shall go back to Port Royal with Captain Dawg.
But, sir--
You don't have much feel for these things.
One day, perhaps.
I hope so, sir.
That's it!
Got it!
Take a few of the men and follow in the other pirate ship.
You'll get a share of the prize money-- a little here, a little there.
- It all adds up.
- Yes, sir!
Now, sir, I shall go presently... and write for your royal pardon.
Privateer for the Crown.
Sounds so much better than "pirate," don't you think?
Why do you let that preening swab live?
I study him.
When I become governor of Jamaica...
I will need a certain... style.
Trotter.
Lock them below with the others.
They hang at Port Royal.
With pleasure, Your Honor.
- Welcome aboard my ship, gentlemen.
- Move along!
I trust you'll find your quarters to my liking.
Move on!
Below with ya!
Let's get down there!
We'll weigh anchor.
Rouse the watch forward.
There we go.
Square away the breakers!
- Stand by!
- Come on now.
Push!
Let go the footing!
I thought I should never see you again.
Yes, Mr. Glasspoole, it's me.
What do you say?
Shall we take back our ship?
On your word, Captain.
Tackle's all right.
Cover it up.
The next one.
Mr. Coller!
I believe we can ease the main sheet a foot or two.
- Aye, sir!
- It'll draw better for it.
Are you a good swimmer, Mr. Scully?
Let's find out, shall we?
Do you wish a compass, Scully?
Take your closest friends with you!
There are islands close by!
You can make it if you swim slowly!
I'll get you!
I'll be back, Morgan, if it's the last thing I do!
King Charles?
Ease your topsail!
Are you in there?
Well, you've seen what another captain's like.
Will you take my orders now?
Smile, Mr. Trotter.
Good, Trotter.
Give me some more shot here.
We'll edge towards them, Mr. Blair.
Not so fast to alarm them.
Two points to starboard, and keep her steady.
Two points starboard.
Keep her steady.
Trotter's closing on us.
Is that so?
Doubtless wants advice.
Poor fool can't tie his shoelaces without instruction.
Let's let him catch us.
I hope Mr. Shaw's still alive.
General quarters, Mr. Snelgrave.
Powder to the guns, but softly.
What's going on?
Do what I tell you.
Governor.
Oblige me.
Let me hang Mr. Shaw now from my yardarm.
- This minute?
- Yes.
Might be rather amusing.
One doesn't often get the chance to see a hanging at sea.
Come on, you.
Present arms!
It's a long drop.
What is it?
It's not good.
Best take a look.
William Shaw, you've been found guilty... of piracy in the province of Jamaica.
By the authority of His Majesty the King... the penalty for piracy is death.
Pray, hangman, carry out the sentence!
He's testing us.
Prime your guns, men.
Are we prepared to fire, Mr. Snelgrave?
Bloody hell!
I knew it.
- On command!
- Up ports!
Cannons forward!
Cannons ready!
Guns forward!
- Open fire!
- Fire!
Fire!
Hoist our colors!
Mr. Blair, close it quickly now!
Fire!
Oh, my God.
Blast 'em from the sea!
They want your treasure!
Will you let 'em take it?
- On your way.
- Aye.
Knock 'em down!
Riflemen, prepare!
She means to board me!
Point her up!
Fire!
Sling your hooks!
Boarders aboard!
I love this.
I love it!
Who wants to die first?
Come on!
Kill 'em!
Kill 'em all!
Damn you!
They are so many.
We are so few!
Keep fighting.
Hold them back as long as you can.
Aye!
Where you go?
To blow out his bottom and get what we came for!
Separate the ships when I do!
Aye.
Die, Morgan, ya sea witch!
Morgan has done it!
You!
Cut us loose!
- What for?
- No future in the army, sir.
- What are you doing here?
- Not what you think.
There you are, Morgan!
Come to seek my treasure, have you?
Don't move.
I'll be right down to help you count it.
- Let's finish this.
- Come up to Uncle!
Forgive me.
I will come back.
- I promise.
- The whole ship's going to blow!
That boy doesn't understand us.
But then, he's not family.
Come on!
You cut me, niece.
That was for Mordachai.
The next one is for Harry.
Be quick!
Undo my bonds!
Your father was nothing!
All my brothers were nothing.
You exceed them.
Think how far we could go together.
You and me against the world.
Join me.
You don't have to die.
You do.
You've run out of world.
Can you hear me?
I'm coming for you.
Can you please hurry?
I'll give you this much.
You're harder to kill than your father.
The odd thing is, I enjoyed it.
I never gave up.
Never gave in.
I regret it's finished.
Give my love to Harry when you see him.
It's over, Morgan.
You planning to fight me with that little stick?
No, Uncle.
With this!
Bad Dawg!
Quick!
There's no time.
The ship's going to blow up.
Yes.
Go ahead.
Hurry!
It's too bad we'll have to leave all this behind.
Hurry!
There's no time for the treasure!
Yes!
Let's hurry!
Here!
Up here!
Quickly!
Give me your hand!
Jump.
Look!
They're alive!
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
You?
Fine.
Just a little poorer.
Well, it doesn't matter.
I'm alive, and you're alive and--
And we're alive together.
There will be other treasures.
Do you really feel that way?
Absolutely.
Then I guess you don't want your share.
- That's a barrel.
- On this end.
- On this end?
- Yes.
A marker barrel.
But on the other--
This is yours, men.
Every last doubloon.
No one ever fought harder for anything.
Mr. Glasspoole will divide it into equal shares for us.
You're all rich men now.
You're free to go your separate ways.
You could buy a little cottage in Bermuda... and drink camomile tea on the porch.
On the other hand, we could do what we were born to do.
Stay together and ride the early trades all the way to Madagascar... the best pirating waters in the world.
Well, what do you say?
Shall we add to this pile here on the deck?
Mr. Glasspoole, what say you?
It's just that it is such a large decision to make... in such a small amount of time.
Aye!
Mr. Blair?
I'd like to, but it's just--
I've always wanted to do a bit of farming.
Farming?
To the captain!
- Where to?
- I told you.
Madagascar.
But that's in Africa.
Then we'd best get busy.
Mr. Trotter, take the crow's nest watch for the next 12 hours.
Good as done, ma'am.
Mr. Blair, prepare to come about.
Steer south-southeast.
On to your stations, men.
Prepare to come about south-southeast.
And, Mr. Shaw.
I'd like to see you in my cabin immediately.
You're leaving?
But I thought you and I were forever?
I want you so badly.
- Morgan!
- But so does the Port Royal governor.
He will pay well for the capture of Morgan Adams, the pirate.
- You knew who I was?
- All along.
Morgan!
Where are you?
You are heartless, Lieutenant.
My apologies, senorita.
But you are right.
I thought it was much more amusing this way also... since I knew that you knew.
By the way, that won't work.
See?
I took your balls.
What happened?
Your father sent for you two days ago.
I know. I was coming.
He did not know this.
He went looking for you.
That's when Dawg grabbed him.
Lord knows what he does with him.
I took this from our brother Richard last week.
Unwillingly.
That's his blood on the borders.
With your piece, all I need is Mordachai's.
You're out of luck.
I don't have it.
Where is it?
With Morgan?
I haven't seen her.
I think you lie, Harry.
I hid it.
Progress.
Where?
Up here.
I always thought there was nothing in your head.
Come back on board.
I'm going to split you wide open.
Mr. Snelgrave.
I'll see ya in hell.
Father!
- Father, I've got you!
- Let go!
Let go!
Hold onto me!
- Let go!
- Never!
No!
Father!
Father!
Someone get a grappling hook!
Launch the cutter.
Heave!
Oh, Lord, what did I do in my life to get you?
Dawg will pay for this, I swear.
You leave Dawg be.
I will fly his bloody head as my banner!
You'll leave Dawg well to leeward.
There will be time for him.
Find your Uncle Mordachai.
Take my crew.
Make them yours.
Father, don't talk now.
I'll get you back to the ship.
I'll not see my ship again.
The Morning Star is yours.
Don't say that.
I've patched you with worse.
Get your knife.
Shave my head.
- What?
- Shave my head.
For once in your life, Morgan... do as I tell you.
Lieutenant.
What is your name again?
Plopper?
Squinter?
Trotter, Your Excellency.
Miss Mandy Rickets is standing alone.
Her father brings a fortune in investments to the colony.
Dance with her.
She's rather homely, sir.
And you are not?
There you are.
You see?
Too late.
Some other fellow has taken the plunge.
There's every reason why I should be alone tonight... being a stranger here... but a woman with grace such as yours... should never be unattended.
My name is Shaw.
William Shaw.
But my friends call me Willy.
Do we know him, sir?
We do not.
Are you at leisure, Mr. Shaw, or do you follow a profession?
Most serious one, ma'am.
I'm a medical man, a doctor.
Oh, my!
I studied at Leyden, then higher anatomy with Dreyfuss at Leipzig.
With higher anatomy, you must know a great deal about the human body.
Indeed, madam.
Every bit of it.
All the ins and outs.
In medicine, it's our obligation to probe to the very bottom of things.
We must, in fact, explode ancient superstitions... shake truths violently from the body.
You, sir!
Forgive my rudeness.
Trotter's the name.
I'm with the regiment.
William Shaw.
Dr. Shaw, in fact.
Most happy.
What ship did you come in on, Doctor?
Was it the Bristol packet?
Bristol packet?
Bristol packet?
I believe that was it, although I can't be sure.
I'm all at sea when it comes to things nautical.
Very good.
No, the reason I asked... is the Bristol packet don't arrive until a week Wednesday.
That's him!
That man stole my diamond comb!
My pearls!
My pearl dangles!
My ruby necklace!
- Sergeant of the guard!
- Women!
Sergeant of the guard!
Good night, ladies!
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
His name's Shaw, sir.
I trust you'll enjoy life as a slave, Mr. Shaw.
Whoever you are.
That's good.
Tie it off!
Morgan, think of the freedom.
You can do anything you want now.
Come to London with me.
Come to London with me.
There's dukes there.
There's earls and parties.
It'll be fun.
Think of how much fun it'd be.
Besides, these men aren't gonna take orders from you.
They will!
Watch.
You there.
Stand to.
Hoist my pennant.
Bring it here.
Mutiny, will ya?
I was hoping to find you sober.
I was hoping to be passed out by now, Mr. Glasspoole.
Important things go on overhead.
Morgan, you should be there.
Men, Black Harry is gone.
I'm not one to speak ill of the dead... but for months he brought us nothing.
So now we can either sell this rotten bark and divvy up... or you can choose me captain.
I stand for captain.
My father wished it.
As he died, he gave me this.
He left it for all of you.
That's his bloody scalp.
It's a map to Cutthroat Island... the buried treasure of a Spanish gold ship.
More gold, jewels and plunder than you've ever dreamed of.
What does it say?
Aye.
It says--
You read it.
- l can't.
- Why not?
It's Latin.
Then I will have it translated at once.
There must be someone who knows Latin at Port Royal.
My Uncle Mordachai holds a second piece at Spittlefield.
There's more than one piece?
Actually, there are three.
- Where's the third?
- Dawg Brown has it.
Oh, well!
It's practically in our pocket.
We'll fight him for it.
We'll join with Mordachai.
Two ships against one.
You should like them odds.
Ask yourselves.
What would Harry have done?
This is our chance to seek some real fortune... and to pay back Dawg what we owe him.
What could be better than that?
Mr. Blair, you are quartermaster.
You decide.
Two days is all I need.
One to Port Royal, one to Spittlefield.
If Harry picked you, I'll give you a chance.
Let any man who would challenge me draw that.
I found him.
He's a prisoner inside.
He speaks Latin.
Good.
Let's break him out.
Unfortunately, Captain-- l mean, ma'am, he's about to be sold as a slave.
A slave.
They're hanging the pirates.
They're gonna find you out.
You worry too much.
Don't I look right?
You look beautiful.
It's just that I'm the only person here who has the slightest inkling... of how to act like a gentleperson, so I have to go with you.
- Then you shall come.
- But, unfortunately, I can't.
I have pressing business with my bookseller.
- The fat man is right.
- l'll see you at Spittlefield.
You must be at your best behavior.
Then, gallant sir, escort me thither.
Turn around.
- You.
On your feet.
- Ask me politely.
You anticipate too much.
It's more like a fencing move.
Any fool can do it.
I hope you enjoy pain, slave.
Because I intend to buy you.
Good morning, madam.
As you can see, I'm young, in fine health. I know horsemanship.
I write a fine hand.
I have it on authority that you are fluent in Latin.
Ah, Latin, the Romance language.
I can speak Latin like I was born in the ancient Senate.
A regular Cicero.
Why?
Do you have children who wish to learn?
I'd make a first-class teacher in a tasteful country house.
I can do most arithmetic, though I confess a weakness in long division.
Stop your chatter and say something Latinish.
What did you say?
You're a very beautiful woman.
I'd like to wash your feet.
You like to wash things, do you?
Start with your mouth.
Ten pounds?
Five pounds?
What?
No offers at all?
Take him away and hang him.
Next!
Please!
Don't hang me!
Next!
Lot 22!
A colonist.
A doctor.
Being of value, I start the bidding at five pounds.
- l bid five pounds.
- Five pounds, sir.
Go on.
Any advance on five pounds?
He's of good physique.
- Ten pounds.
- Ten pounds!
- Any advance on ten pounds?
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen pounds, sir.
- Twenty pounds.
- Twenty pounds is the bid.
- Sir, a word to the wise.
- Let the young lady win.
- You won't get one like this.
- Being a doctor, he's--
- Go away!
That one is mine.
- Twenty-five pounds.
- Twenty-five pounds, sir.
Good teeth.
- Thirty pounds!
- Thirty pounds!
Madam, I will have this man at any price.
If you are buying him purely for pleasure... I will offer to do the same for you at no cost.
A doctor!
- Thirty-five pounds!
- Thirty-five pounds, sir.
A sensible choice, indeed.
Go on.
Captain, no!
Where's your sense of competition?
Come on!
Someone give me more than 35!
You, sir, you haven't bid.
Look at him.
Look at the quality.
And you, madam, another bid?
Any advance on 35.
I hope the lady is prepared to be a good loser.
What gave you the idea I was a lady?
Another bid, sir?
I see your lips moving.
Yes?
Are you trying to kill me, madam?
Yes, that's why I'm aiming where your brains are.
Now leave this place and go far away.
Don't retreat now, sir.
Where are you going?
- Don't surrender this opportunity.
- Forty pounds to end the bidding.
Sold to the lady with the monkey.
Take him away.
Go on!
Move!
Of course, I'm grateful, madam.
You picked a bargain.
I'm connected to all the great families of Europe.
- l have a natural pitch for music...
- Quiet!
and a perfect taste in wine.
Enemy to leeward, Captain.
Starboard as well, Captain.
Time to leave.
You draw them away.
We'll meet at Dingley Crossroads.
- Take King Charles.
Come on.
- Aye.
It's Morgan Adams!
She's at the auction!
Shoot to kill!
If I am in some way the cause of all this, I apologize at once.
Here.
Come here.
Hold on there.
Hold on tight.
Try to keep up with me.
I am not fond of heights!
Then let go!
Lieutenant Trotter!
What's going on?
Something with Mr. Shaw, I believe.
I'm in favor of exercise, but you owe me an explanation.
Come here.
Come on.
We have to climb down here.
Fast!
- Where'd they go?
- There!
Was that fast enough?
Come on!
Get the reins!
Grab them!
Come on!
Go!
Mr. Trotter!
That's my bloody carriage.
I'll have it back, if you please.
You, off.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, sir.
He won't get far.
Reload!
It's hard to imagine what part of your life would require Latin!
Reload!
- We've taken a passenger!
- Here!
You're hitting a woman!
Captain Perkins, sir!
- Yes?
- lt's her!
Morgan Adams!
You're more active than other women I've known.
Morgan!
Watch your head!
Charge!
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Stop them!
I must visit that shop again when I have more time.
- Master gunner, fire at will.
- Run 'em up!
Fire!
A ship!
I find myself being fired upon by an entire ship!
Oh, my God.
You certainly left your mark on this town.
Hold on!
Whoa!
Trotter, do you want to spend the rest of your days on this poxy island?
- Who was that woman?
- Morgan Adams, sir.
You've 100 pounds on her head.
Black Harry's girl.
Well, well.
She's made a proper fool of me, hasn't she?
Two hundred pounds and a captaincy for you if you find her for me.
Sir!
- Any difficulties?
- Nothing unusual.
Here.
Step down into the carriage.
- Will you take the reins?
- Aye.
We should make Spittlefield by dark.
What is your name anyway, slave?
Shaw.
William Shaw.
Dr. Shaw, actually.
Slave, I'm about to show you something.
Reveal it to any other man, and you will wish you were back at Port Royal... with your head on the block and the ax in the air.
Thank you, but I've seen one before.
What is this?
A pigskin?
Translate what is written there.
Let's discuss terms first.
I do so, and you set me free.
That's tender.
It's about to become more tender.
They're backwards.
I assure you, ma'am, they're normal in every respect.
No, the words.
They're written backwards.
Look.
Can you see?
"Cliffs of blood." Bless me.
You're right.
You tell Mr. Squeakum's that I will send him a new chapter every month.
- Now, what's this all about?
- He's a great admirer of your books.
That makes me happy.
Which books has he read?
Did he mention?
His Excellency Governor Ainslee, John Reed, the author... currently the chronicler of piracy.
Step up, sir.
Always a pleasure to meet a literary man.
- l'd just as soon walk.
- l insist.
I can do that, you know.
"When the earth and all its people quake-
- Psalm, number 75.
My bones suffer mortal agony.
Number 42."
- And?
- That's all.
- No position?
No parallel?
- l swear it, ma'am.
That's all that's here.
Piracy, Mr. Reed, is the scourge of these plantations.
I, therefore, give rather large rewards for the capture of pirates... including Morgan Adams.
I don't know who she is.
Trotter tells me that you move throughout the pirate world... collecting your little tales.
Dangerous.
If by some chance you come across her, you might tell her on my behalf... that I offer her two alternatives.
One, an ignominious death on the gallows like these poor fellows here.
Please bear in mind that I could decide you're a pirate as well.
And the alternative?
She might cut me in for a share... of her grandfather's treasure... or she ends up as dinner for crows.
Pull up!
Good day, Mr. Reed.
Do you understand me, sir?
Here.
Here's a good one.
You blackguard!
Can you spare a little, lady?
Mordachai's up there, scared as a goose.
He's surrounded by guards, back to the wall, pistols out.
He's expecting Dawg.
If there are any of Dawg's men around, they will see you.
Mordachai's guards won't let you get close.
Wait a minute.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
How much?
- What?
- Come with me.
You stay put.
Where do you think you're going?
Tapster sent me.
Said the old turtle has his needs.
Shake her down.
- Sweetheart, all that costs money.
- l have money.
I promise.
I will take care of you later.
Follow me.
You too.
Captain, you in the mood for a whore?
Show her in.
Wait a minute.
I recognize you.
You're not a whore.
Call your men, and it's the last sound you make.
You're Harry's girl.
You always was trouble.
Blast ya.
What do you want here, eh?
I've brought my father's map.
You have the map?
- What about the Morning Star, the ship?
- She's mine.
Here.
Look what I'm doing.
Holy Virgin.
Harry's blessed head.
See?
is that not fine?
That's handsome of ya.
Mighty handsome.
But with you here, you bet your life Dawg's around somewhere.
I'm not afraid of Dawg. I'm half your age and nowhere near the sailor.
You shame me, lass.
I don't like that.
Then get up and fight!
Prove me wrong.
I've heard of Cutthroat Island.
I always thought it was a sailor's yarn.
Piles of skulls.
Reefs of sailors' drowned bones.
This treasure is ours.
Or would be... if you were an Adams.
There's no water in Adams blood.
I'll do it. I'll join with ya.
Just like Harry, mine's well hid.
Unfinished business from the other night, Morgan.
Let her stand, Mr. Snelgrave.
Morgan, what a woman you've become.
I knew you'd bring him here, Morgan.
Blast ya!
Hello, brother Mordachai.
Morgan, in sweet memory... of bouncing you on my knee as a little girl... I'm going to ask you just once for your daddy's piece of the map.
Would you settle for the point of my cutlass?
Somehow I knew you would say something like that.
And then we'd fall to oaths and threats.
Let's cut through the talk, shall we?
I have just the thing for you, little niece.
This says it all, Morgan.
Pain.
Viciousness.
Mutilation.
All the good things in life.
My coat of arms.
Ugly, slippery and foul smelling.
- lt does say it all.
- Yes.
- And it looks like you.
- Thank you.
We stay close together.
We're family.
- Captain!
- Bowen!
Get back to the ship!
Bring the men!
You think you might unlock these now?
Given the circumstances.
I don't have the key here.
- Where is it?
- They never gave me one.
What?
The map.
Tell me where it is, or I'll run you through!
Hey!
You killed my brother!
I saw that, little niece.
I remember when you were a little girl.
Always flinched when you saw your Uncle Douglas, didn't ya?
Give me the map!
Where's the map?
Give me the map!
Sweetheart, I promised I'd take care of you.
- Very pretty, Mr. Shaw.
- Thank you, ma'am.
I had the good fortune to study with a grand master in Vienna.
Stop diddling and kill the man.
Kill him?
Bless me.
We never got to that.
I see.
Come on!
I believe you have something of mine, Mr. Shaw.
Ma'am, I don't know what you're talking about.
- Blair!
- This way, Morgan!
This does you no good on the ground, Mr. Bowen.
The numbers.
- What were the numbers?
- What numbers?
- The Psalms.
- 11, 75 and 42.
I figured it out.
It's the longitude.
- We must leave now.
- lt's the longitude.
- Back to the ship.
- Move!
Hurry!
Come along, men.
Congratulations, madam.
There's another town you've destroyed.
Get along lively!
Heave!
Heave!
You've been in a fight.
You all right?
It's just a scratch.
Somebody, cut off his chains.
Nice ship.
Why aren't I moving?
Did you hear me, Mr. Bishop?
I said, why aren't I moving?
- The anchor's fouled, Captain.
- Cut it loose.
Aye, aye, sir.
Quickly.
We can't leave yet, Captain.
We haven't put enough food on board.
We need less mouths.
Does no one hear me on this ship?
I distinctly said...
cut it loose!
75... 42... 1 1.
Keep her full!
Let me show you the chart.
The line I plotted runs here, through Crooked Man Keys.
Cutthroat can't be far off.
Look at the chart.
"Reef and coral heads."
Dawg outguns us, yes.
He's bigger.
But that means he's heavier, don't it?
He draws more water.
We lure him into the keys and run him aground on the coral heads.
We'll kill him there and take his map.
She has a wound.
We must get her below to the cabin.
It's festering.
That's why.
- Can you take the ball out?
- Hard to say.
Best I seal her side with this hot poker.
That's what we always do in such cases.
No offense, gentlemen, but given the circumstances... don't you think this calls for a professional?
It's all right.
Let him go.
He is a doctor.
I'll need surgeon's tools, hot water, sulfur and clean packing.
- Some rum might help her pain.
- Aye.
You as well, John.
- You clumsy swab!
- Sorry.
I was supposed to torture you.
Sorry.
- Do you see it yet?
- Close.
Another minute.
Your father and two uncles each had pieces of the map.
The treasure, it's large, I take it.
Largest ever taken.
Spanish gold ship.
Sorry.
And a third uncle, he chases you.
An unusual family.
Success.
I've treated you cruel, haven't I?
You've had a lot on your mind.
And you did help me at the prison.
The tavern.
Let's say, between us, just for argument's sake... that you have Mordachai's map.
But I don't.
No, I know that, but pretend that you do.
I was willing to go halves with him and his.
I will do the same with you and yours.
You're saying... that if I show you mine, you'll share yours with me?
Give me the map.
Give me a kiss first.
Sorry.
Map now.
You see, the thing is... I don't have it.
But that doesn't mean we can't keep talking about it.
Mr. Blair's respects, Captain.
Talk to yourself.
Yes, Mr. Bowen?
The Reaper's five miles off and closing.
You should stay down.
Mr. Bowen, see that Mr. Shaw gets a change of clothes.
- He's beginning to stink.
- Aye, Captain.
He has it.
She makes for Crooked Man's Passage.
Yes.
She hopes to tear up our bottom on the coral.
Looks like we're in for a blow.
Shall we attack her now?
No.
We'll go around the islands in the dark.
We'll ambush her on the other side at daybreak.
You are clever, Morgan, but I will catch you.
Uncle Dawg will have his day.
First Ainslee's chasing us.
Now your uncle is chasing us.
Now, everybody's chasing us.
I'm not so happy about this.
I mean, I'm using this piratical stuff to write a best-selling book.
I didn't want to put myself in any physical danger.
Put a stow in that sail, Mr. Blair.
We don't want to lose her.
- Break fast the foresail!
- Aye, sir!
I cannot see the horizon.
There is a storm headed our way from the island.
- We'll hold this course.
- Aye.
- Put an extra man on the helm.
- Coxswain, up helm!
"May cruel death leave victims immortal."
M-C-D-L-V-l.
14-56.
1-4-5-6.
Fourteen degrees latitude... five minutes, six seconds north.
There's nothing there.
No, you were right.
It's not on any chart.
Where did you have it hidden?
In the boat, under the seaty thing.
I knew you'd wind up here at some point... that being the cheese and you being the rat.
The thing is, ma'am, I'm basically a shallow man.
And no doctor.
Am I wrong?
No, not really.
I'm surprised you let me fiddle with your hip.
And no gentleman either.
I wanted to be.
The thing is, I was born poor.
My only choice was to become a thief and a liar.
Then since you lie so easily and are so shallow... I shall lie you in a shallow grave.
Mr. Blair!
Have you no charity, ma'am?
I brim with charity, Mr. Shaw.
I am charity's very soul.
Success, Mr. Blair.
My slave has found Cutthroat Island.
Mark it on the chart.
And since I am so charitable... I will maroon you on a rock the size of this table... instead of splattering your brains across my bulkhead, as you deserve.
Let's take him below.
Pull!
Going up!
Pull the line, mate!
Tie it down!
Aye, aye, sir!
Tie it off!
Batten down the hatches!
Hold on!
I found it, Mr. Glasspoole!
I've fixed the island.
I know where it is.
It lies through the storm.
You risk the ship if you head for it.
I risk Dawg if I turn back.
Shorten sail all you want, Mr. Blair.
We head straight through it.
Hold your course, men!
Have you ever seen anything like this?
Not so I'd remember.
I won't run!
Look how close we are!
The rig, Morgan!
It can't take it!
It can !
We've been through worse with Harry.
Have faith, Mr. Blair!
Trust the ship!
We'll try it.
What is this?
I'll not die in a storm for your pleasure.
There are too many of them!
Tom Scully, there's no great love between us, but don't do this.
Not this close.
Look!
There's the island!
It can't be more than two or three leagues off.
Away the longboat.
Clear the sweep!
Give us a compass, Scully!
You'll have no need of a compass where you're going!
You're going nowhere but down!
Pull!
Put your backs into it!
Take up the stroke!
Somebody grab that bastard!
No!
Parkins!
Stop him!
Row hard!
It's our one hope!
Put your backs into it, men!
Pull!
Row hard, men!
Reef, men!
Reef!
White water ahead!
Row, men, row!
Bowen!
Bowen!
- Glasspoole, are you all right?
- Aye, Morgan.
- Bowen?
- Yes.
- Blair?
- Aye.
We've lost Hewitt and Ames.
Look!
Look!
The cliffs of blood!
It's Cutthroat!
It must be!
We are truly blessed.
We made it, Scully!
- We found it!
- We made it!
We found Cutthroat Island!
We need to find this trail.
- Can you tell where it begins?
- Not without the third piece.
We'll make for the high ground, get our bearings.
Mr. Bowen, bring that lizard.
We'll have it for dinner.
Gentlemen, we must thank Mr. Scully... for bringing us the chart.
But this piece is the only piece of the map... that shows the treasure site.
My piece.
- The Reaper.
- And the Morning Star.
She still swims.
Dawg must've caught Scully when he bore up in the storm.
That scoundrel must've made a deal with Dawg.
He betrayed my crew.
No sign of Shaw.
Spread out.
Search the whole island.
Find me this cove, these cliffs.
I'll wait ashore.
Go!
He makes to go ashore.
We'll follow him, get the map and find the treasure.
Find me a suitable campsite.
- l'm grateful to you, Mr. Scully.
- My pleasure.
But if you ever are disloyal to me the way you were to Morgan... it'll be my pleasure... to cook you alive and eat you.
Now get out of my eyes.
Morgan's here!
Bitch stole my map!
Find her, or you're all dead!
Spread out. lf he makes it out, we'll grab him.
I know you're out there, Morgan.
I can smell you.
Where are you?
Damn you.
- Where?
- Help.
There he is.
Wait.
You wanna be careful.
It's quicksand.
Did you get Dawg's map, you bastard?
Hand it over, or you're a dead man.
Did you ever think that I might've taken it to give to you?
Not for a second.
Sinking up to your waist, and still all you can do is lie.
It's completely true. I could no longer stand your opinion of me.
- Then give it over.
- l will, with all my heart... if you'd get me out first.
Do you think I was born last Wednesday?
Give it here, and then we will talk about rescue.
I see your point of view... but it works better for me if I'm on hard land first.
You're up to your chest.
What if I give it to you and you leave me here?
You spoke not long ago of marooning me.
What if I pull you out and you swallow it or run away?
You're beyond trusting.
That's the problem with being a thief.
Nobody knows when you're telling the truth.
Give me the tip of your dagger.
What for?
Give it to me.
Don't argue.
There.
It's no Valentine, but it will have to do.
Now you have it all and I have nothing.
I'm in your command, Morgan.
Do with me what you will.
Quickly.
Well... good luck.
Fish him out.
Hold tight.
That was quite a storm, wasn't it, boys?
We need to get around these hills... through this forest near the coast.
There.
There's our treasure.
Well, shall we?
What are the instructions from here?
Seventy-five paces from this pillar.
- Twelve.
- Twelve?
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen?
Fourteen.
Fifteen.
Sixteen.
Seventeen.
Eighteen.
Nineteen.
- Twenty.
- Look!
- Seventy-five?
- That's what the map says.
- Well, you misread it.
- No, it's very clear.
"Seventy-five paces from the rock pillar."
- Then the other 55 are out there.
- Or...
Look!
That could be the other 55 paces.
We found a cave in the cliff!
Aye!
If they catch us here, they'll find Morgan.
We must leave.
Dead men tell no tales.
What does it say?
"Mouth of darkness, teeth of stone... down the throat to the belly of gold... guarded by those who never grew old."
Well.
Watch your head here.
Here.
Don't do that!
Let's try this way.
Uh, but--
Down the throat to the belly of gold!
Hey!
Down the throat to the belly of gold!
Harry, I found it.
"Guarded by those who never grew old."
And your grandfather was the only one that came back.
We're rich!
Rich!
We'd best get these out.
Dawg can't be far behind.
Fetch the others. I'll start hauling this to the entrance.
Right.
Wait.
All right. I'm going.
But no tricks.
And hurry.
Anybody up there?
Morgan!
Lucky me.
We was lookin' all over for you.
That's your young friend from Spittlefield.
- What have you got there?
- Treasure!
Bags of it!
Be careful what you do!
You could lose a lot!
Put a ball between his eyes.
Go ahead!
It's about four million pounds!
No, wait!
That's a guess, but I can't be off by more than a million pounds.
Cut the rope, William!
Get away!
William!
Let's make a deal.
I can be reasonable.
Send Morgan down!
I'll send the treasure up, and we'll both have what we want!
All right, William.
We have a deal.
Here she comes.
I wish I'd never learned Latin.
Now we have both.
Haul them in.
Don't watch me fall.
- l'm coming with you.
- Don't be mad.
Why?
Don't argue.
Let's agree upon something for once.
All right.
On the count of three, then?
Come to me, Morgan.
- One more thing.
- What?
Considering everything, I really think that from now on... we should be full partners.
What do you say?
- Sixty-forty.
- Fifty-fifty.
Full partners.
Very well.
They have a lot to say to each other, don't they?
- Are you ready now?
- Ready.
One.
Two.
Now!
Love.
Who can explain it?
Come on.
Heave!
This is your future, men.
Heave!
- Have you seen Morgan?
- Yes, I did.
She helped me ashore, then sent me to find you.
Thank God she's alive.
Where is she?
Where Dawg can't find her.
It's this way.
Follow me.
- How'd you get off Morgan's ship?
- Same as you, I jumped.
Fortunately, I'm an excellent swimmer.
- This seems rather far.
- lt's just a few more feet.
Raise muskets!
Aim!
Splendid.
Before we hang you in Port Royal, you've time to witness... an historic alliance.
Where's Morgan?
I don't think she made it.
Perhaps you're wondering how I come to be here.
A little bird told me.
Plump pigeon.
Courtesy of Mr. Reed.
All right, get up!
All right, you.
Come on!
There, sir!
Trotter!
Discretion dictates that I shall not load the treasure... out of the British man-of-war.
I shall go back to Port Royal with Captain Dawg.
But, sir--
You don't have much feel for these things.
One day, perhaps.
I hope so, sir.
That's it!
Got it!
Take a few of the men and follow in the other pirate ship.
You'll get a share of the prize money-- a little here, a little there.
- lt all adds up.
- Yes, sir!
Now, sir, I shall go presently... and write for your royal pardon.
Privateer for the Crown.
Sounds so much better than "pirate," don't you think?
Why do you let that preening swab live?
I study him.
When I become governor of Jamaica... I will need a certain... style.
Trotter.
Lock them below with the others.
They hang at Port Royal.
With pleasure, Your Honor.
- Welcome aboard my ship, gentlemen.
- Move along!
I trust you'll find your quarters to my liking.
Move on!
Below with ya!
Let's get down there!
We'll weigh anchor.
Rouse the watch forward.
There we go.
Square away the breakers!
- Stand by!
- Come on now.
Push!
Let go the footing!
I thought I should never see you again.
Yes, Mr. Glasspoole, it's me.
What do you say?
Shall we take back our ship?
On your word, Captain.
Tackle's all right.
Cover it up.
The next one.
Mr. Coller!
I believe we can ease the main sheet a foot or two.
- Aye, sir!
- lt'll draw better for it.
Are you a good swimmer, Mr. Scully?
Let's find out, shall we?
Do you wish a compass, Scully?
Take your closest friends with you!
There are islands close by!
You can make it if you swim slowly!
I'll get you!
I'll be back, Morgan, if it's the last thing I do!
King Charles?
Ease your topsail!
Are you in there?
Well, you've seen what another captain's like.
Will you take my orders now?
Smile, Mr. Trotter.
Good, Trotter.
Give me some more shot here.
We'll edge towards them, Mr. Blair.
Not so fast to alarm them.
Two points to starboard, and keep her steady.
Two points starboard.
Keep her steady.
Trotter's closing on us.
is that so?
Doubtless wants advice.
Poor fool can't tie his shoelaces without instruction.
Let's let him catch us.
I hope Mr. Shaw's still alive.
General quarters, Mr. Snelgrave.
Powder to the guns, but softly.
What's going on?
Do what I tell you.
Governor.
Oblige me.
Let me hang Mr. Shaw now from my yardarm.
- This minute?
- Yes.
Might be rather amusing.
One doesn't often get the chance to see a hanging at sea.
Come on, you.
Present arms!
It's a long drop.
What is it?
It's not good.
Best take a look.
William Shaw, you've been found guilty... of piracy in the province of Jamaica.
By the authority of His Majesty the King... the penalty for piracy is death.
Pray, hangman, carry out the sentence!
He's testing us.
Prime your guns, men.
Are we prepared to fire, Mr. Snelgrave?
Bloody hell!
I knew it.
- On command!
- Up ports!
Cannons forward!
Cannons ready!
Guns forward!
- Open fire!
- Fire!
Fire!
Hoist our colors!
Mr. Blair, close it quickly now!
Fire!
Oh, my God.
Blast 'em from the sea!
They want your treasure!
Will you let 'em take it?
- On your way.
- Aye.
Knock 'em down!
Riflemen, prepare!
She means to board me!
Point her up!
Fire!
Sling your hooks!
Boarders aboard!
I love this.
I love it!
Who wants to die first?
Come on!
Kill 'em!
Kill 'em all!
Damn you!
They are so many.
We are so few!
Keep fighting.
Hold them back as long as you can.
Aye!
Where you go?
To blow out his bottom and get what we came for!
Separate the ships when I do!
Aye.
Die, Morgan, ya sea witch!
Morgan has done it!
You!
Cut us loose!
- What for?
- No future in the army, sir.
- What are you doing here?
- Not what you think.
There you are, Morgan!
Come to seek my treasure, have you?
Don't move. I'll be right down to help you count it.
- Let's finish this.
- Come up to Uncle!
Forgive me.
I will come back.
- l promise.
- The whole ship's going to blow!
That boy doesn't understand us.
But then, he's not family.
Come on!
You cut me, niece.
That was for Mordachai.
The next one is for Harry.
Be quick!
Undo my bonds!
Your father was nothing!
All my brothers were nothing.
You exceed them.
Think how far we could go together.
You and me against the world.
Join me.
You don't have to die.
You do.
You've run out of world.
Can you hear me?
I'm coming for you.
Can you please hurry?
I'll give you this much.
You're harder to kill than your father.
The odd thing is, I enjoyed it.
I never gave up.
Never gave in.
I regret it's finished.
Give my love to Harry when you see him.
It's over, Morgan.
You planning to fight me with that little stick?
No, Uncle.
With this!
Bad Dawg!
Quick!
There's no time.
The ship's going to blow up.
Yes.
Go ahead.
Hurry!
It's too bad we'll have to leave all this behind.
Hurry!
There's no time for the treasure!
Yes!
Let's hurry!
Here!
Up here!
Quickly!
Give me your hand!
Jump.
Look!
They're alive!
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
You?
Fine.
Just a little poorer.
Well, it doesn't matter.
I'm alive, and you're alive and--
And we're alive together.
There will be other treasures.
Do you really feel that way?
Absolutely.
Then I guess you don't want your share.
- That's a barrel.
- On this end.
- On this end?
- Yes.
A marker barrel.
But on the other--
This is yours, men.
Every last doubloon.
No one ever fought harder for anything.
Mr. Glasspoole will divide it into equal shares for us.
You're all rich men now.
You're free to go your separate ways.
You could buy a little cottage in Bermuda... and drink camomile tea on the porch.
On the other hand, we could do what we were born to do.
Stay together and ride the early trades all the way to Madagascar... the best pirating waters in the world.
Well, what do you say?
Shall we add to this pile here on the deck?
Mr. Glasspoole, what say you?
It's just that it is such a large decision to make... in such a small amount of time.
Aye!
Mr. Blair?
I'd like to, but it's just-- l've always wanted to do a bit of farming.
Farming?
To the captain!
- Where to?
- l told you.
Madagascar.
But that's in Africa.
Then we'd best get busy.
Mr. Trotter, take the crow's nest watch for the next 12 hours.
Good as done, ma'am.
Mr. Blair, prepare to come about.
Steer south-southeast.
On to your stations, men.
Prepare to come about south-southeast.
And, Mr. Shaw.
I'd like to see you in my cabin immediately.
But I thought you and I were forever?
I want you so badly.
- Morgan!
- But so does the Port Royal governor.
He will pay well for the capture of Morgan Adams, the pirate.
- You knew who I was?
- All along.
Morgan!
Where are you?
You are heartless, Lieutenant.
My apologies, senorita.
But you are right.
I thought it was much more amusing this way also... since I knew that you knew.
By the way, that won't work.
See?
I took your balls.
What happened?
Your father sent for you two days ago.
I know.
I was coming.
He did not know this.
He went looking for you.
That's when Dawg grabbed him.
Lord knows what he does with him.
I took this from our brother Richard last week.
Unwillingly.
That's his blood on the borders.
With your piece, all I need is Mordachai's.
You're out of luck.
I don't have it.
Where is it?
With Morgan?
I haven't seen her.
I think you lie, Harry.
I hid it.
Progress.
Where?
Up here.
I always thought there was nothing in your head.
Come back on board.
I'm going to split you wide open.
Mr. Snelgrave.
I'll see ya in hell.
Father!
- Father, I've got you!
- Let go!
Let go!
Hold onto me!
- Let go!
- Never!
No!
Father!
Father!
Someone get a grappling hook!
Launch the cutter.
Heave!
Oh, Lord, what did I do in my life to get you?
Dawg will pay for this, I swear.
You leave Dawg be.
I will fly his bloody head as my banner!
You'll leave Dawg well to leeward.
There will be time for him.
Find your Uncle Mordachai.
Take my crew.
Make them yours.
Father, don't talk now.
I'll get you back to the ship.
I'll not see my ship again.
The Morning Star is yours.
Don't say that.
I've patched you with worse.
Get your knife.
Shave my head.
- What?
- Shave my head.
For once in your life, Morgan... do as I tell you.
Lieutenant.
What is your name again?
Plopper?
Squinter?
Trotter, Your Excellency.
Miss Mandy Rickets is standing alone.
Her father brings a fortune in investments to the colony.
Dance with her.
She's rather homely, sir.
And you are not?
There you are.
You see?
Too late.
Some other fellow has taken the plunge.
There's every reason why I should be alone tonight... being a stranger here... but a woman with grace such as yours... should never be unattended.
My name is Shaw.
William Shaw.
But my friends call me Willy.
Do we know him, sir?
We do not.
Are you at leisure, Mr. Shaw, or do you follow a profession?
Most serious one, ma'am.
I'm a medical man, a doctor.
Oh, my!
I studied at Leyden, then higher anatomy with Dreyfuss at Leipzig.
With higher anatomy, you must know a great deal about the human body.
Indeed, madam.
Every bit of it.
All the ins and outs.
In medicine, it's our obligation to probe to the very bottom of things.
We must, in fact, explode ancient superstitions... shake truths violently from the body.
You, sir!
Forgive my rudeness.
Trotter's the name.
I'm with the regiment.
William Shaw.
Dr. Shaw, in fact.
Most happy.
What ship did you come in on, Doctor?
Was it the Bristol packet?
Bristol packet?
Bristol packet?
I believe that was it, although I can't be sure.
I'm all at sea when it comes to things nautical.
Very good.
No, the reason I asked... is the Bristol packet don't arrive until a week Wednesday.
That's him!
That man stole my diamond comb!
My pearls!
My pearl dangles!
My ruby necklace!
- Sergeant of the guard!
- Women!
Sergeant of the guard!
Good night, ladies!
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
His name's Shaw, sir.
I trust you'll enjoy life as a slave, Mr. Shaw.
Whoever you are.
That's good.
Tie it off!
Morgan, think of the freedom.
You can do anything you want now.
Come to London with me.
Come to London with me.
There are dukes there.
There are earls and parties.
It'll be fun.
Think of how much fun it'd be.
Besides, these men aren't gonna take orders from you.
They will!
Watch.
You there.
Stand to.
Hoist my pennant.
Bring it here.
Mutiny, will ya?
I was hoping to find you sober.
I was hoping to be passed out by now, Mr. Glasspoole.
Important things go on overhead.
Morgan, you should be there.
Men, Black Harry is gone.
I'm not one to speak ill of the dead... but for months he brought us nothing.
So now we can either sell this rotten bark and divvy up... or you can choose me captain.
I stand for captain.
My father wished it.
As he died, he gave me this.
He left it for all of you.
That's his bloody scalp.
It's a map to Cutthroat Island... the buried treasure of a Spanish gold ship.
More gold, jewels and plunder than you've ever dreamed of.
What does it say?
Aye.
It says--
You read it.
- I can't.
- Why not?
It's Latin.
Then I will have it translated at once.
There must be someone who knows Latin at Port Royal.
My Uncle Mordachai holds a second piece at Spittlefield.
There's more than one piece?
Actually, there are three.
- Where's the third?
- Dawg Brown has it.
Oh, well!
It's practically in our pocket.
We'll fight him for it.
We'll join with Mordachai.
Two ships against one.
You should like them odds.
Ask yourselves.
What would Harry have done?
This is our chance to seek some real fortune... and to pay back Dawg what we owe him.
What could be better than that?
Mr. Blair, you are quartermaster.
You decide.
Two days is all I need.
One to Port Royal, one to Spittlefield.
If Harry picked you, I'll give you a chance.
Let any man who would challenge me draw that.
I found him.
He's a prisoner inside.
He speaks Latin.
Good.
Let's break him out.
Unfortunately, Captain-
- I mean, ma'am, he's about to be sold as a slave.
A slave.
They're hanging the pirates.
They're gonna find you out.
You worry too much.
Don't I look right?
You look beautiful.
It's just that I'm the only person here who has the slightest inkling... of how to act like a gentleperson, so I have to go with you.
- Then you shall come.
- But, unfortunately, I can't.
I have pressing business with my bookseller.
- The fat man is right.
- I'll see you at Spittlefield.
You must be at your best behavior.
Then, gallant sir, escort me thither.
Turn around.
- You.
On your feet.
- Ask me politely.
You anticipate too much.
It's more like a fencing move.
Any fool can do it.
I hope you enjoy pain, slave.
Because I intend to buy you.
Good morning, madam.
As you can see, I'm young, in fine health.
I know horsemanship.
I write a fine hand.
I have it on authority that you are fluent in Latin.
Ah, Latin, the Romance language.
I can speak Latin like I was born in the ancient Senate.
A regular Cicero.
Why?
Do you have children who wish to learn?
I'd make a first-class teacher in a tasteful country house.
I can do most arithmetic, though I confess a weakness in long division.
Stop your chatter and say something Latinish.
What did you say?
You're a very beautiful woman.
I'd like to wash your feet.
You like to wash things, do you?
Start with your mouth.
Ten pounds?
Five pounds?
What?
No offers at all?
Take him away and hang him.
Next!
Please!
Don't hang me!
Next!
Lot 22!
A colonist.
A doctor.
Being of value, I start the bidding at five pounds.
- I bid five pounds.
- Five pounds, sir.
Go on.
Any advance on five pounds?
He's of good physique.
- Ten pounds.
- Ten pounds!
- Any advance on ten pounds?
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen pounds, sir.
- Twenty pounds.
- Twenty pounds is the bid.
- Sir, a word to the wise.
- Let the young lady win.
- You won't get one like this.
- Being a doctor, he's--
- Go away!
That one is mine.
- Twenty-five pounds.
- Twenty-five pounds, sir.
Good teeth.
- Thirty pounds!
- Thirty pounds!
Madam, I will have this man at any price.
If you are buying him purely for pleasure...
I will offer to do the same for you at no cost.
A doctor!
- Thirty-five pounds!
- Thirty-five pounds, sir.
A sensible choice, indeed.
Go on.
Captain, no!
Where's your sense of competition?
Come on!
Someone give me more than 35!
You, sir, you haven't bid.
Look at him.
Look at the quality.
And you, madam, another bid?
Any advance on 35.
I hope the lady is prepared to be a good loser.
What gave you the idea I was a lady?
Another bid, sir?
I see your lips moving.
Yes?
Are you trying to kill me, madam?
Yes, that's why I'm aiming where your brains are.
Now leave this place and go far away.
Don't retreat now, sir.
Where are you going?
- Don't surrender this opportunity.
- Forty pounds to end the bidding.
Sold to the lady with the monkey.
Take him away.
Go on!
Move!
Of course, I'm grateful, madam.
You picked a bargain.
I'm connected to all the great families of Europe.
- I have a natural pitch for music...
- Quiet!
and a perfect taste in wine.
Enemy to leeward, Captain.
Starboard as well, Captain.
Time to leave.
You draw them away.
We'll meet at Dingley Crossroads.
- Take King Charles.
Come on.
- Aye.
It's Morgan Adams!
She's at the auction!
Shoot to kill!
If I am in some way the cause of all this, I apologize at once.
Here.
Come here.
Hold on there.
Hold on tight.
Try to keep up with me.
I am not fond of heights!
Then let go!
Lieutenant Trotter!
What's going on?
Something with Mr. Shaw, I believe.
I'm in favor of exercise, but you owe me an explanation.
Come here.
Come on.
We have to climb down here.
Fast!
- Where'd they go?
- There!
Was that fast enough?
Come on!
Get the reins!
Grab them!
Come on!
Go!
Mr. Trotter!
That's my bloody carriage.
I'll have it back, if you please.
You, off.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, sir.
He won't get far.
Reload!
It's hard to imagine what part of your life would require Latin!
Reload!
- We've taken a passenger!
- Here!
You're hitting a woman!
Captain Perkins, sir!
- Yes?
- It's her!
Morgan Adams!
You're more active than other women I've known.
Morgan!
Watch your head!
Charge!
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Stop them!
I must visit that shop again when I have more time.
- Master gunner, fire at will.
- Run 'em up!
Fire!
A ship!
I find myself being fired upon by an entire ship!
Oh, my God.
You certainly left your mark on this town.
Hold on!
Whoa!
Trotter, do you want to spend the rest of your days on this poxy island?
- Who was that woman?
- Morgan Adams, sir.
You've 100 pounds on her head.
Black Harry's girl.
Well, well.
She's made a proper fool of me, hasn't she?
Two hundred pounds and a captaincy for you if you find her for me.
Sir!
- Any difficulties?
- Nothing unusual.
Here.
Step down into the carriage.
- Will you take the reins?
- Aye.
We should make Spittlefield by dark.
What is your name anyway, slave?
Shaw.
William Shaw.
Dr. Shaw, actually.
Slave, I'm about to show you something.
Reveal it to any other man, and you will wish you were back at Port Royal... with your head on the block and the ax in the air.
Thank you, but I've seen one before.
What is this?
A pigskin?
Translate what is written there.
Let's discuss terms first.
I do so, and you set me free.
That's tender.
It's about to become more tender.
They're backwards.
I assure you, ma'am, they're normal in every respect.
No, the words.
They're written backwards.
Look.
Can you see?
"Cliffs of blood." Bless me.
You're right.
You tell Mr. Squeakum's that I will send him a new chapter every month.
- Now, what's this all about?
- He's a great admirer of your books.
That makes me happy.
Which books has he read?
Did he mention?
His Excellency Governor Ainslee, John Reed, the author... currently the chronicler of piracy.
Step up, sir.
Always a pleasure to meet a literary man.
- I'd just as soon walk.
- I insist.
I can do that, you know.
"When the earth and all its people quake-
- Psalm, number 75.
My bones suffer mortal agony.
Number 42."
- And?
- That's all.
- No position?
No parallel?
- I swear it, ma'am.
That's all that's here.
Piracy, Mr. Reed, is the scourge of these plantations.
I, therefore, give rather large rewards for the capture of pirates... including Morgan Adams.
I don't know who she is.
Trotter tells me that you move throughout the pirate world... collecting your little tales.
Dangerous.
If by some chance you come across her, you might tell her on my behalf... that I offer her two alternatives.
One, an ignominious death on the gallows like these poor fellows here.
Please bear in mind that I could decide you're a pirate as well.
And the alternative?
She might cut me in for a share... of her grandfather's treasure... or she ends up as dinner for crows.
Pull up!
Good day, Mr. Reed.
Do you understand me, sir?
Here.
Here's a good one.
You blackguard!
Can you spare a little, lady?
Mordachai's up there, scared as a goose.
He's surrounded by guards, back to the wall, pistols out.
He's expecting Dawg.
If there are any of Dawg's men around, they will see you.
Mordachai's guards won't let you get close.
Wait a minute.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
How much?
- What?
- Come with me.
You stay put.
Where do you think you're going?
Tapster sent me.
Said the old turtle has his needs.
Shake her down.
- Sweetheart, all that costs money.
- I have money.
I promise.
I will take care of you later.
Follow me.
You too.
Captain, you in the mood for a whore?
Show her in.
Wait a minute.
I recognize you.
You're not a whore.
Call your men, and it's the last sound you make.
You're Harry's girl.
You always were trouble.
Blast ya.
What do you want here, eh?
I've brought my father's map.
You have the map?
- What about the Morning Star, the ship?
- She's mine.
Here.
Look what I'm doing.
Holy Virgin.
Harry's blessed head.
See?
Is that not fine?
That's handsome of ya.
Mighty handsome.
But with you here, you bet your life Dawg's around somewhere.
I'm not afraid of Dawg.
I'm half your age and nowhere near the sailor.
You shame me, lass.
I don't like that.
Then get up and fight!
Prove me wrong.
I've heard of Cutthroat Island.
I always thought it was a sailor's yarn.
Piles of skulls.
Reefs of sailors' drowned bones.
This treasure is ours.
Or would be... if you were an Adams.
There's no water in Adams blood.
I'll do it.
I'll join with ya.
Just like Harry, mine's well hid.
Unfinished business from the other night, Morgan.
Let her stand, Mr. Snelgrave.
Morgan, what a woman you've become.
I knew you'd bring him here, Morgan.
Blast ya!
Hello, brother Mordachai.
Morgan, in sweet memory... of bouncing you on my knee as a little girl...
I'm going to ask you just once for your daddy's piece of the map.
Would you settle for the point of my cutlass?
Somehow I knew you would say something like that.
And then we'd fall to oaths and threats.
Let's cut through the talk, shall we?
I have just the thing for you, little niece.
This says it all, Morgan.
Pain.
Viciousness.
Mutilation.
All the good things in life.
My coat of arms.
Ugly, slippery and foul smelling.
- It does say it all.
- Yes.
- And it looks like you.
- Thank you.
We stay close together.
We're family.
- Captain!
- Bowen!
Get back to the ship!
Bring the men!
You think you might unlock these now?
Given the circumstances.
I don't have the key here.
- Where is it?
- They never gave me one.
What?
The map.
Tell me where it is, or I'll run you through!
Hey!
You killed my brother!
I saw that, little niece.
I remember when you were a little girl.
Always flinched when you saw your Uncle Douglas, didn't ya?
Give me the map!
Where's the map?
Give me the map!
Sweetheart, I promised I'd take care of you.
- Very pretty, Mr. Shaw.
- Thank you, ma'am.
I had the good fortune to study with a grand master in Vienna.
Stop diddling and kill the man.
Kill him?
Bless me.
We never got to that.
I see.
Come on!
I believe you have something of mine, Mr. Shaw.
Ma'am, I don't know what you're talking about.
- Blair!
- This way, Morgan!
This does you no good on the ground, Mr. Bowen.
The numbers.
- What were the numbers?
- What numbers?
- The Psalms. - 11, 75 and 42.
I figured it out.
It's the longitude.
- We must leave now.
- It's the longitude.
- Back to the ship.
- Move!
Hurry!
Come along, men.
Congratulations, madam.
There's another town you've destroyed.
Get along lively!
Heave!
Heave!
You've been in a fight.
You all right?
It's just a scratch.
Somebody, cut off his chains.
Nice ship.
Why aren't I moving?
Did you hear me, Mr. Bishop?
I said, why aren't I moving?
- The anchors fouled, Captain.
- Cut it loose.
Aye, aye, sir.
Quickly.
We can't leave yet, Captain.
We haven't put enough food on board.
We need less mouths.
Does no one hear me on this ship?
I distinctly said... cut it loose!
75... 42... 11.
Keep her full!
Let me show you the chart.
The line I plotted runs here, through Crooked Man Keys.
Cutthroat can't be far off.
Look at the chart.
"Reef and coral heads."
Dawg outguns us, yes.
He's bigger.
But that means he's heavier, don't it?
He draws more water.
We lure him into the keys and run him aground on the coral heads.
We'll kill him there and take his map.
She has a wound.
We must get her below to the cabin.
It's festering.
That's why.
- Can you take the ball out?
- Hard to say.
Best I seal her side with this hot poker.
That's what we always do in such cases.
No offense, gentlemen, but given the circumstances... don't you think this calls for a professional?
It's all right.
Let him go.
He is a doctor.
I'll need surgeon's tools, hot water, sulfur and clean packing.
- Some rum might help her pain.
- Aye.
You as well, John.
- You clumsy swab!
- Sorry.
I was supposed to torture you.
Sorry.
- Do you see it yet?
- Close.
Another minute.
Your father and two uncles each had pieces of the map.
The treasure, it's large, I take it.
Largest ever taken.
Spanish gold ship.
Sorry.
And a third uncle, he chases you.
An unusual family.
Success.
I've treated you cruel, haven't I?
You've had a lot on your mind.
And you did help me at the prison.
The tavern.
Let's say, between us, just for argument's sake... that you have Mordachai's map.
But I don't.
No, I know that, but pretend that you do.
I was willing to go halves with him and his.
I will do the same with you and yours.
You're saying... that if I show you mine, you'll share yours with me?
Give me the map.
Give me a kiss first.
Sorry.
Map now.
You see, the thing is...
I don't have it.
But that doesn't mean we can't keep talking about it.
Mr. Blair's respects, Captain.
Talk to yourself.
Yes, Mr. Bowen?
The Reaper's five miles off and closing.
You should stay down.
Mr. Bowen, see that Mr. Shaw gets a change of clothes.
- He's beginning to stink.
- Aye, Captain.
He has it.
She makes for Crooked Man's Passage.
Yes.
She hopes to tear up our bottom on the coral.
Looks like we're in for a blow.
Shall we attack her now?
No.
We'll go around the islands in the dark.
We'll ambush her on the other side at daybreak.
You are clever, Morgan, but I will catch you.
Uncle Dawg will have his day.
First Ainslee's chasing us.
Now your uncle is chasing us.
Now, everybody's chasing us.
I'm not so happy about this.
I mean, I'm using this piratical stuff to write a best-selling book.
I didn't want to put myself in any physical danger.
Put a stow in that sail, Mr. Blair.
We don't want to lose her.
- Break fast the foresail!
- Aye, sir!
I cannot see the horizon.
There is a storm headed our way from the island.
- We'll hold this course.
- Aye.
- Put an extra man on the helm.
- Coxswain, up helm!
"May cruel death leave victims immortal."
M-C-D-L-V-l.
14-56.
1-4-5-6.
Fourteen degrees latitude... five minutes, six seconds north.
There's nothing there.
No, you were right.
It's not on any chart.
Where did you have it hidden?
In the boat, under the seaty thing.
I knew you'd wind up here at some point... that being the cheese and you being the rat.
The thing is, ma'am, I'm basically a shallow man.
And no doctor.
Am I wrong?
No, not really.
I'm surprised you let me fiddle with your hip.
And no gentleman either.
I wanted to be.
The thing is, I was born poor.
My only choice was to become a thief and a liar.
Then since you lie so easily and are so shallow...
I shall lie you in a shallow grave.
Mr. Blair!
Have you no charity, ma'am?
I brim with charity, Mr. Shaw.
I am charity's very soul.
Success, Mr. Blair.
My slave has found Cutthroat Island.
Mark it on the chart.
And since I am so charitable...
I will maroon you on a rock the size of this table... instead of splattering your brains across my bulkhead, as you deserve.
Let's take him below.
Pull!
Going up!
Pull the line, mate!
Tie it down!
Aye, aye, sir!
Tie it off!
Batten down the hatches!
Hold on!
I found it, Mr. Glasspoole!
I've fixed the island.
I know where it is.
It lies through the storm.
You risk the ship if you head for it.
I risk Dawg if I turn back.
Shorten sail all you want, Mr. Blair.
We head straight through it.
Hold your course, men!
Have you ever seen anything like this?
Not so I'd remember.
I won't run!
Look how close we are!
The rig, Morgan!
It can't take it!
It can !
We've been through worse with Harry.
Have faith, Mr. Blair!
Trust the ship!
We'll try it.
What is this?
I'll not die in a storm for your pleasure.
There are too many of them!
Tom Scully, there's no great love between us, but don't do this.
Not this close.
Look!
There's the island!
It can't be more than two or three leagues off.
Away the longboat.
Clear the sweep!
Give us a compass, Scully!
You'll have no need of a compass where you're going!
You're going nowhere but down!
Pull!
Put your backs into it!
Take up the stroke!
Somebody grab that bastard!
No!
Parkins!
Stop him!
Row hard!
It's our one hope!
Put your backs into it, men!
Pull!
Row hard, men!
Reef, men!
Reef!
White water ahead!
Row, men, row!
Bowen!
Bowen!
- Glasspoole, are you all right?
- Aye, Morgan.
- Bowen?
- Yes.
- Blair?
- Aye.
We've lost Hewitt and Ames.
Look!
Look!
The cliffs of blood!
It's Cutthroat!
It must be!
We are truly blessed.
We made it, Scully!
- We found it!
- We made it!
We found Cutthroat Island!
We need to find this trail.
- Can you tell where it begins?
- Not without the third piece.
We'll make for the high ground, get our bearings.
Mr. Bowen, bring that lizard.
We'll have it for dinner.
Gentlemen, we must thank Mr. Scully... for bringing us the chart.
But this piece is the only piece of the map... that shows the treasure site.
My piece.
- The Reaper.
- And the Morning Star.
She still swims.
Dawg must've caught Scully when he bore up in the storm.
That scoundrel must've made a deal with Dawg.
He betrayed my crew.
No sign of Shaw.
Spread out.
Search the whole island.
Find me this cove, these cliffs.
I'll wait ashore.
Go!
He makes to go ashore.
We'll follow him, get the map and find the treasure.
Find me a suitable campsite.
- I'm grateful to you, Mr. Scully.
- My pleasure.
But if you ever are disloyal to me the way you were to Morgan... it'll be my pleasure... to cook you alive and eat you.
Now get out of my eyes.
Morgan's here!
Bitch stole my map!
Find her, or you're all dead!
Spread out.
If he makes it out, we'll grab him.
I know you're out there, Morgan.
I can smell you.
Where are you?
Damn you.
- Where?
- Help.
There he is.
Wait.
You wanna be careful.
It's quicksand.
Did you get Dawg's map, you bastard?
Hand it over, or you're a dead man.
Did you ever think that I might've taken it to give to you?
Not for a second.
Sinking up to your waist, and still all you can do is lie.
It's completely true.
I could no longer stand your opinion of me.
- Then give it over.
- I will, with all my heart... if you'd get me out first.
Do you think I was born last Wednesday?
Give it here, and then we will talk about rescue.
I see your point of view... but it works better for me if I'm on hard land first.
You're up to your chest.
What if I give it to you and you leave me here?
You spoke not long ago of marooning me.
What if I pull you out and you swallow it or run away?
You're beyond trusting.
That's the problem with being a thief.
Nobody knows when you're telling the truth.
Give me the tip of your dagger.
What for?
Give it to me.
Don't argue.
There.
It's no Valentine, but it will have to do.
Now you have it all and I have nothing.
I'm in your command, Morgan.
Do with me what you will.
Quickly.
Well... good luck.
Fish him out.
Hold tight.
That was quite a storm, wasn't it, boys?
We need to get around these hills... through this forest near the coast.
There.
There's our treasure.
Well, shall we?
What are the instructions from here?
Seventy-five paces from this pillar.
- Twelve.
- Twelve?
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen?
Fourteen.
Fifteen.
Sixteen.
Seventeen.
Eighteen.
Nineteen.
- Twenty.
- Look!
- Seventy-five?
- That's what the map says.
- Well, you misread it.
- No, it's very clear.
"Seventy-five paces from the rock pillar."
- Then the other 55 are out there.
- Or...
Look!
That could be the other 55 paces.
We found a cave in the cliff!
Aye!
If they catch us here, they'll find Morgan.
We must leave.
Dead men tell no tales.
What does it say?
"Mouth of darkness, teeth of stone... down the throat to the belly of gold... guarded by those who never grew old."
Well.
Watch your head here.
Here.
Don't do that!
Let's try this way.
Uh, but--
Down the throat to the belly of gold!
Hey!
Down the throat to the belly of gold!
Harry, I found it.
"Guarded by those who never grew old."
And your grandfather was the only one that came back.
We're rich!
Rich!
We'd best get these out.
Dawg can't be far behind.
Fetch the others.
I'll start hauling this to the entrance.
Right.
Wait.
All right.
I'm going.
But no tricks.
And hurry.
Anybody up there?
Morgan!
Lucky me.
We were lookin' all over for you.
That's your young friend from Spittlefield.
- What have you got there?
- Treasure!
Bags of it!
Be careful what you do!
You could lose a lot!
Put a ball between his eyes.
Go ahead!
It's about four million pounds!
No, wait!
That's a guess, but I can't be off by more than a million pounds.
Cut the rope, William!
Get away!
William!
Let's make a deal.
I can be reasonable.
Send Morgan down!
I'll send the treasure up, and we'll both have what we want!
All right, William.
We have a deal.
Here she comes.
I wish I'd never learned Latin.
Now we have both.
Haul them in.
Don't watch me fall.
- I'm coming with you.
- Don't be mad.
Why?
Don't argue.
Let's agree upon something for once.
All right.
On the count of three, then?
Come to me, Morgan.
- One more thing.
- What?
Considering everything, I really think that from now on... we should be full partners.
What do you say?
- Sixty-forty.
- Fifty-fifty.
Full partners.
Very well.
They have a lot to say to each other, don't they?
- Are you ready now?
- Ready.
One.
Two.
Now!
Love.
Who can explain it?
Come on.
Heave!
This is your future, man.
Heave!
- Have you seen Morgan?
- Yes, I did.
She helped me ashore, then sent me to find you.
Thank God she's alive.
Where is she?
Where Dawg can't find her.
It's this way.
Follow me.
- How'd you get off Morgan's ship?
- Same as you, I jumped.
Fortunately, I'm an excellent swimmer.
- This seems rather far.
- It's just a few more feet.
Raise muskets!
Aim!
Splendid.
Before we hang you in Port Royal, you've time to witness... an historic alliance.
Where's Morgan?
I don't think she made it.
Perhaps you're wondering how I come to be here.
A little bird told me.
Plump pigeon.
Courtesy of Mr. Reed.
All right, get up!
All right, you.
Come on!
There, sir!
Trotter!
Discretion dictates that I shall not load the treasure... out of the British man-of-war.
I shall go back to Port Royal with Captain Dawg.
But, sir--
You don't have much feel for these things.
One day, perhaps.
I hope so, sir.
That's it!
Got it!
Take a few of the men and follow in the other pirate ship.
You'll get a share of the prize money-- a little here, a little there.
- It all adds up.
- Yes, sir!
Now, sir, I shall go presently... and write for your royal pardon.
Privateer for the Crown.
Sounds so much better than "pirate," don't you think?
Why do you let that preening swab live?
I study him.
When I become governor of Jamaica...
I will need a certain... style.
Trotter.
Lock them below with the others.
They hang at Port Royal.
With pleasure, Your Honor.
- Welcome aboard my ship, gentlemen.
- Move along!
I trust you'll find your quarters to my liking.
Move on!
Below with ya!
Let's get down there!
We'll weigh anchor.
Rouse the watch forward.
There we go.
Square away the breakers!
- Stand by!
- Come on now.
Push!
Let go the footing!
I thought I should never see you again.
Yes, Mr. Glasspoole, it's me.
What do you say?
Shall we take back our ship?
On your word, Captain.
Tackle's all right.
Cover it up.
The next one.
Mr. Coller!
I believe we can ease the main sheet a foot or two.
- Aye, sir!
- It'll draw better for it.
Are you a good swimmer, Mr. Scully?
Let's find out, shall we?
Do you wish a compass, Scully?
Take your closest friends with you!
There are islands close by!
You can make it if you swim slowly!
I'll get you!
I'll be back, Morgan, if it's the last thing I do!
King Charles?
Ease your topsail!
Are you in there?
Well, you've seen what another captain's like.
Will you take my orders now?
Smile, Mr. Trotter.
Good, Trotter.
Give me some more shot here.
We'll edge towards them, Mr. Blair.
Not so fast to alarm them.
Two points to starboard, and keep her steady.
Two points starboard.
Keep her steady.
Trotter's closing on us.
Is that so?
Doubtless wants advice.
Poor fool can't tie his shoelaces without instruction.
Let's let him catch us.
I hope Mr. Shaw's still alive.
General quarters, Mr. Snelgrave.
Powder to the guns, but softly.
What's going on?
Do what I tell you.
Governor.
Oblige me.
Let me hang Mr. Shaw now from my yardarm.
- This minute?
- Yes.
Might be rather amusing.
One doesn't often get the chance to see a hanging at sea.
Come on, you.
Present arms!
It's a long drop.
What is it?
It's not good.
Best take a look.
William Shaw, you've been found guilty... of piracy in the province of Jamaica.
By the authority of His Majesty the King... the penalty for piracy is death.
Pray, hangman, carry out the sentence!
He's testing us.
Prime your guns, men.
Are we prepared to fire, Mr. Snelgrave?
Bloody hell!
I knew it.
- On command!
- Up ports!
Cannons forward!
Cannons ready!
Guns forward!
- Open fire!
- Fire!
Fire!
Hoist our colors!
Mr. Blair, close it quickly now!
Fire!
Oh, my God.
Blast 'em from the sea!
They want your treasure!
Will you let 'em take it?
- On your way.
- Aye.
Knock 'em down!
Riflemen, prepare!
She means to board me!
Point her up!
Fire!
Sling your hooks!
Boarders aboard!
I love this.
I love it!
Who wants to die first?
Come on!
Kill 'em!
Kill 'em all!
Damn you!
They are so many.
We are so few!
Keep fighting.
Hold them back as long as you can.
Aye!
Where you go?
To blow out his bottom and get what we came for!
Separate the ships when I do!
Aye.
Die, Morgan, ya sea witch!
Morgan has done it!
You!
Cut us loose!
- What for?
- No future in the army, sir.
- What are you doing here?
- Not what you think.
There you are, Morgan!
Come to seek my treasure, have you?
Don't move.
I'll be right down to help you count it.
- Let's finish this.
- Come up to Uncle!
Forgive me.
I will come back.
- I promise.
- The whole ship's going to blow!
That boy doesn't understand us.
But then, he's not family.
Come on!
You cut me, niece.
That was for Mordachai.
The next one is for Harry.
Be quick!
Undo my bonds!
Your father was nothing!
All my brothers were nothing.
You exceed them.
Think how far we could go together.
You and me against the world.
Join me.
You don't have to die.
You do.
You've run out of world.
Can you hear me?
I'm coming for you.
Can you please hurry?
I'll give you this much.
You're harder to kill than your father.
The odd thing is, I enjoyed it.
I never gave up.
Never gave in.
I regret it's finished.
Give my love to Harry when you see him.
It's over, Morgan.
You planning to fight me with that little stick?
No, Uncle.
With this!
Bad Dawg!
Quick!
There's no time.
The ship's going to blow up.
Yes.
Go ahead.
Hurry!
It's too bad we'll have to leave all this behind.
Hurry!
There's no time for the treasure!
Yes!
Let's hurry!
Here!
Up here!
Quickly!
Give me your hand!
Jump.
Look!
They're alive!
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
You?
Fine.
Just a little poorer.
Well, it doesn't matter.
I'm alive, and you're alive and--
And we're alive together.
There will be other treasures.
Do you really feel that way?
Absolutely.
Then I guess you don't want your share.
- That's a barrel.
- On this end.
- On this end?
- Yes.
A marker barrel.
But on the other--
This is yours, men.
Every last doubloon.
No one ever fought harder for anything.
Mr. Glasspoole will divide it into equal shares for us.
You're all rich men now.
You're free to go your separate ways.
You could buy a little cottage in Bermuda... and drink camomile tea on the porch.
On the other hand, we could do what we were born to do.
Stay together and ride the early trades all the way to Madagascar... the best pirating waters in the world.
Well, what do you say?
Shall we add to this pile here on the deck?
Mr. Glasspoole, what say you?
It's just that it is such a large decision to make... in such a small amount of time.
Aye!
Mr. Blair?
I'd like to, but it's just--
I've always wanted to do a bit of farming.
Farming?
To the captain!
- Where to?
- I told you.
Madagascar.
But that's in Africa.
Then we'd best get busy.
Mr. Trotter, take the crow's nest watch for the next 12 hours.
Good as done, ma'am.
Mr. Blair, prepare to come about.
Steer south-southeast.
On to your stations, men.
Prepare to come about south-southeast.
And, Mr. Shaw.
I'd like to see you in my cabin immediately.
Subtitles ripped by Tim Yunaev
You're leaving?
But I thought you and I were forever?
I want you so badly.
- Morgan!
- But so does the Port Royal governor.
He will pay well for the capture of Morgan Adams, the pirate.
- You knew who I was?
- All along.
Morgan!
Where are you?
You are heartless, Lieutenant.
My apologies, senorita.
But you are right.
I thought it was much more amusing this way also... since I knew that you knew.
By the way, that won't work.
See?
I took your balls.
What happened?
Your father sent for you two days ago.
I know.
I was coming.
He did not know this.
He went looking for you.
That's when Dawg grabbed him.
Lord knows what he does with him.
I took this from our brother Richard last week.
Unwillingly.
That's his blood on the borders.
With your piece, all I need is Mordachai's.
You're out of luck.
I don't have it.
Where is it?
With Morgan?
I haven't seen her.
I think you lie, Harry.
I hid it.
Progress.
Where?
Up here.
I always thought there was nothing in your head.
Come back on board.
I'm going to split you wide open.
Mr. Snelgrave.
I'll see ya in hell.
Father!
- Father, I've got you!
- Let go!
Let go!
Hold onto me!
- Let go!
- Never!
No!
Father!
Father!
Someone get a grappling hook!
Launch the cutter.
Heave!
Oh, Lord, what did I do in my life to get you?
Dawg will pay for this, I swear.
You leave Dawg be.
I will fly his bloody head as my banner!
You'll leave Dawg well to leeward.
There will be time for him.
Find your Uncle Mordachai.
Take my crew.
Make them yours.
Father, don't talk now.
I'll get you back to the ship.
I'll not see my ship again.
The Morning Star is yours.
Don't say that.
I've patched you with worse.
Get your knife.
Shave my head.
- What?
- Shave my head.
For once in your life, Morgan... do as I tell you.
Lieutenant.
What is your name again?
Plopper?
Squinter?
Trotter, Your Excellency.
Miss Mandy Rickets is standing alone.
Her father brings a fortune in investments to the colony.
Dance with her.
She's rather homely, sir.
And you are not?
There you are.
You see?
Too late.
Some other fellow has taken the plunge.
There's every reason why I should be alone tonight... being a stranger here... but a woman with grace such as yours... should never be unattended.
My name is Shaw.
William Shaw.
But my friends call me Willy.
Do we know him, sir?
We do not.
Are you at leisure, Mr. Shaw, or do you follow a profession?
Most serious one, ma'am.
I'm a medical man, a doctor.
Oh, my!
I studied at Leyden, then higher anatomy with Dreyfuss at Leipzig.
With higher anatomy, you must know a great deal about the human body.
Indeed, madam.
Every bit of it.
All the ins and outs.
In medicine, it's our obligation to probe to the very bottom of things.
We must, in fact, explode ancient superstitions... shake truths violently from the body.
You, sir!
Forgive my rudeness.
Trotter's the name.
I'm with the regiment.
William Shaw.
Dr. Shaw, in fact.
Most happy.
What ship did you come in on, Doctor?
Was it the Bristol packet?
Bristol packet?
Bristol packet?
I believe that was it, although I can't be sure.
I'm all at sea when it comes to things nautical.
Very good.
No, the reason I asked... is the Bristol packet don't arrive until a week Wednesday.
That's him!
That man stole my diamond comb!
My pearls!
My pearl dangles!
My ruby necklace!
- Sergeant of the guard!
- Women!
Sergeant of the guard!
Good night, ladies!
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
His name's Shaw, sir.
I trust you'll enjoy life as a slave, Mr. Shaw.
Whoever you are.
That's good.
Tie it off!
Morgan, think of the freedom.
You can do anything you want now.
Come to London with me.
Come to London with me.
There are dukes there.
There are earls and parties.
It'll be fun.
Think of how much fun it'd be.
Besides, these men aren't gonna take orders from you.
They will!
Watch.
You there.
Stand to.
Hoist my pennant.
Bring it here.
Mutiny, will ya?
I was hoping to find you sober.
I was hoping to be passed out by now, Mr. Glasspoole.
Important things go on overhead.
Morgan, you should be there.
Men, Black Harry is gone.
I'm not one to speak ill of the dead... but for months he brought us nothing.
So now we can either sell this rotten bark and divvy up... or you can choose me captain.
I stand for captain.
My father wished it.
As he died, he gave me this.
He left it for all of you.
That's his bloody scalp.
It's a map to Cutthroat Island... the buried treasure of a Spanish gold ship.
More gold, jewels and plunder than you've ever dreamed of.
What does it say?
Aye.
It says--
You read it.
- I can't.
- Why not?
It's Latin.
Then I will have it translated at once.
There must be someone who knows Latin at Port Royal.
My Uncle Mordachai holds a second piece at Spittlefield.
There's more than one piece?
Actually, there are three.
- Where's the third?
- Dawg Brown has it.
Oh, well!
It's practically in our pocket.
We'll fight him for it.
We'll join with Mordachai.
Two ships against one.
You should like them odds.
Ask yourselves.
What would Harry have done?
This is our chance to seek some real fortune... and to pay back Dawg what we owe him.
What could be better than that?
Mr. Blair, you are quartermaster.
You decide.
Two days is all I need.
One to Port Royal, one to Spittlefield.
If Harry picked you, I'll give you a chance.
Let any man who would challenge me draw that.
I found him.
He's a prisoner inside.
He speaks Latin.
Good.
Let's break him out.
Unfortunately, Captain-
- I mean, ma'am, he's about to be sold as a slave.
A slave.
They're hanging the pirates.
They're gonna find you out.
You worry too much.
Don't I look right?
You look beautiful.
It's just that I'm the only person here who has the slightest inkling... of how to act like a gentleperson, so I have to go with you.
- Then you shall come.
- But, unfortunately, I can't.
I have pressing business with my bookseller.
- The fat man is right.
- I'll see you at Spittlefield.
You must be at your best behavior.
Then, gallant sir, escort me thither.
Turn around.
- You.
On your feet.
- Ask me politely.
You anticipate too much.
It's more like a fencing move.
Any fool can do it.
I hope you enjoy pain, slave.
Because I intend to buy you.
Good morning, madam.
As you can see, I'm young, in fine health.
I know horsemanship.
I write a fine hand.
I have it on authority that you are fluent in Latin.
Ah, Latin, the Romance language.
I can speak Latin like I was born in the ancient Senate.
A regular Cicero.
Why?
Do you have children who wish to learn?
I'd make a first-class teacher in a tasteful country house.
I can do most arithmetic, though I confess a weakness in long division.
Stop your chatter and say something Latinish.
What did you say?
You're a very beautiful woman.
I'd like to wash your feet.
You like to wash things, do you?
Start with your mouth.
Ten pounds?
Five pounds?
What?
No offers at all?
Take him away and hang him.
Next!
Please!
Don't hang me!
Next!
Lot 22!
A colonist.
A doctor.
Being of value, I start the bidding at five pounds.
- I bid five pounds.
- Five pounds, sir.
Go on.
Any advance on five pounds?
He's of good physique.
- Ten pounds.
- Ten pounds!
- Any advance on ten pounds?
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen pounds, sir.
- Twenty pounds.
- Twenty pounds is the bid.
- Sir, a word to the wise.
- Let the young lady win.
- You won't get one like this.
- Being a doctor, he's--
- Go away!
That one is mine.
- Twenty-five pounds.
- Twenty-five pounds, sir.
Good teeth.
- Thirty pounds!
- Thirty pounds!
Madam, I will have this man at any price.
If you are buying him purely for pleasure...
I will offer to do the same for you at no cost.
A doctor!
- Thirty-five pounds!
- Thirty-five pounds, sir.
A sensible choice, indeed.
Go on.
Captain, no!
Where's your sense of competition?
Come on!
Someone give me more than 35!
You, sir, you haven't bid.
Look at him.
Look at the quality.
And you, madam, another bid?
Any advance on 35.
I hope the lady is prepared to be a good loser.
What gave you the idea I was a lady?
Another bid, sir?
I see your lips moving.
Yes?
Are you trying to kill me, madam?
Yes, that's why I'm aiming where your brains are.
Now leave this place and go far away.
Don't retreat now, sir.
Where are you going?
- Don't surrender this opportunity.
- Forty pounds to end the bidding.
Sold to the lady with the monkey.
Take him away.
Go on!
Move!
Of course, I'm grateful, madam.
You picked a bargain.
I'm connected to all the great families of Europe.
- I have a natural pitch for music...
- Quiet!
and a perfect taste in wine.
Enemy to leeward, Captain.
Starboard as well, Captain.
Time to leave.
You draw them away.
We'll meet at Dingley Crossroads.
- Take King Charles.
Come on.
- Aye.
It's Morgan Adams!
She's at the auction!
Shoot to kill!
If I am in some way the cause of all this, I apologize at once.
Here.
Come here.
Hold on there.
Hold on tight.
Try to keep up with me.
I am not fond of heights!
Then let go!
Lieutenant Trotter!
What's going on?
Something with Mr. Shaw, I believe.
I'm in favor of exercise, but you owe me an explanation.
Come here.
Come on.
We have to climb down here.
Fast!
- Where'd they go?
- There!
Was that fast enough?
Come on!
Get the reins!
Grab them!
Come on!
Go!
Mr. Trotter!
That's my bloody carriage.
I'll have it back, if you please.
You, off.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, sir.
He won't get far.
Reload!
It's hard to imagine what part of your life would require Latin!
Reload!
- We've taken a passenger!
- Here!
You're hitting a woman!
Captain Perkins, sir!
- Yes?
- It's her!
Morgan Adams!
You're more active than other women I've known.
Morgan!
Watch your head!
Charge!
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Stop them!
I must visit that shop again when I have more time.
- Master gunner, fire at will.
- Run 'em up!
Fire!
A ship!
I find myself being fired upon by an entire ship!
Oh, my God.
You certainly left your mark on this town.
Hold on!
Whoa!
Trotter, do you want to spend the rest of your days on this poxy island?
- Who was that woman?
- Morgan Adams, sir.
You've 100 pounds on her head.
Black Harry's girl.
Well, well.
She's made a proper fool of me, hasn't she?
Two hundred pounds and a captaincy for you if you find her for me.
Sir!
- Any difficulties?
- Nothing unusual.
Here.
Step down into the carriage.
- Will you take the reins?
- Aye.
We should make Spittlefield by dark.
What is your name anyway, slave?
Shaw.
William Shaw.
Dr. Shaw, actually.
Slave, I'm about to show you something.
Reveal it to any other man, and you will wish you were back at Port Royal... with your head on the block and the ax in the air.
Thank you, but I've seen one before.
What is this?
A pigskin?
Translate what is written there.
Let's discuss terms first.
I do so, and you set me free.
That's tender.
It's about to become more tender.
They're backwards.
I assure you, ma'am, they're normal in every respect.
No, the words.
They're written backwards.
Look.
Can you see?
"Cliffs of blood." Bless me.
You're right.
You tell Mr. Squeakum's that I will send him a new chapter every month.
- Now, what's this all about?
- He's a great admirer of your books.
That makes me happy.
Which books has he read?
Did he mention?
His Excellency Governor Ainslee, John Reed, the author... currently the chronicler of piracy.
Step up, sir.
Always a pleasure to meet a literary man.
- I'd just as soon walk.
- I insist.
I can do that, you know.
"When the earth and all its people quake-
- Psalm, number 75.
My bones suffer mortal agony.
Number 42."
- And?
- That's all.
- No position?
No parallel?
- I swear it, ma'am.
That's all that's here.
Piracy, Mr. Reed, is the scourge of these plantations.
I, therefore, give rather large rewards for the capture of pirates... including Morgan Adams.
I don't know who she is.
Trotter tells me that you move throughout the pirate world... collecting your little tales.
Dangerous.
If by some chance you come across her, you might tell her on my behalf... that I offer her two alternatives.
One, an ignominious death on the gallows like these poor fellows here.
Please bear in mind that I could decide you're a pirate as well.
And the alternative?
She might cut me in for a share... of her grandfather's treasure... or she ends up as dinner for crows.
Pull up!
Good day, Mr. Reed.
Do you understand me, sir?
Here.
Here's a good one.
You blackguard!
Can you spare a little, lady?
Mordachai's up there, scared as a goose.
He's surrounded by guards, back to the wall, pistols out.
He's expecting Dawg.
If there are any of Dawg's men around, they will see you.
Mordachai's guards won't let you get close.
Wait a minute.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
How much?
- What?
- Come with me.
You stay put.
Where do you think you're going?
Tapster sent me.
Said the old turtle has his needs.
Shake her down.
- Sweetheart, all that costs money.
- I have money.
I promise.
I will take care of you later.
Follow me.
You too.
Captain, you in the mood for a whore?
Show her in.
Wait a minute.
I recognize you.
You're not a whore.
Call your men, and it's the last sound you make.
You're Harry's girl.
You always were trouble.
Blast ya.
What do you want here, eh?
I've brought my father's map.
You have the map?
- What about the Morning Star, the ship?
- She's mine.
Here.
Look what I'm doing.
Holy Virgin.
Harry's blessed head.
See?
Is that not fine?
That's handsome of ya.
Mighty handsome.
But with you here, you bet your life Dawg's around somewhere.
I'm not afraid of Dawg.
I'm half your age and nowhere near the sailor.
You shame me, lass.
I don't like that.
Then get up and fight!
Prove me wrong.
I've heard of Cutthroat Island.
I always thought it was a sailor's yarn.
Piles of skulls.
Reefs of sailors' drowned bones.
This treasure is ours.
Or would be... if you were an Adams.
There's no water in Adams blood.
I'll do it.
I'll join with ya.
Just like Harry, mine's well hid.
Unfinished business from the other night, Morgan.
Let her stand, Mr. Snelgrave.
Morgan, what a woman you've become.
I knew you'd bring him here, Morgan.
Blast ya!
Hello, brother Mordachai.
Morgan, in sweet memory... of bouncing you on my knee as a little girl...
I'm going to ask you just once for your daddy's piece of the map.
Would you settle for the point of my cutlass?
Somehow I knew you would say something like that.
And then we'd fall to oaths and threats.
Let's cut through the talk, shall we?
I have just the thing for you, little niece.
This says it all, Morgan.
Pain.
Viciousness.
Mutilation.
All the good things in life.
My coat of arms.
Ugly, slippery and foul smelling.
- It does say it all.
- Yes.
- And it looks like you.
- Thank you.
We stay close together.
We're family.
- Captain!
- Bowen!
Get back to the ship!
Bring the men!
You think you might unlock these now?
Given the circumstances.
I don't have the key here.
- Where is it?
- They never gave me one.
What?
The map.
Tell me where it is, or I'll run you through!
Hey!
You killed my brother!
I saw that, little niece.
I remember when you were a little girl.
Always flinched when you saw your Uncle Douglas, didn't ya?
Give me the map!
Where's the map?
Give me the map!
Sweetheart, I promised I'd take care of you.
- Very pretty, Mr. Shaw.
- Thank you, ma'am.
I had the good fortune to study with a grand master in Vienna.
Stop diddling and kill the man.
Kill him?
Bless me.
We never got to that.
I see.
Come on!
I believe you have something of mine, Mr. Shaw.
Ma'am, I don't know what you're talking about.
- Blair!
- This way, Morgan!
This does you no good on the ground, Mr. Bowen.
The numbers.
- What were the numbers?
- What numbers?
- The Psalms. - 11, 75 and 42.
I figured it out.
It's the longitude.
- We must leave now.
- It's the longitude.
- Back to the ship.
- Move!
Hurry!
Come along, men.
Congratulations, madam.
There's another town you've destroyed.
Get along lively!
Heave!
Heave!
You've been in a fight.
You all right?
It's just a scratch.
Somebody, cut off his chains.
Nice ship.
Why aren't I moving?
Did you hear me, Mr. Bishop?
I said, why aren't I moving?
- The anchors fouled, Captain.
- Cut it loose.
Aye, aye, sir.
Quickly.
We can't leave yet, Captain.
We haven't put enough food on board.
We need less mouths.
Does no one hear me on this ship?
I distinctly said... cut it loose!
75... 42... 11.
Keep her full!
Let me show you the chart.
The line I plotted runs here, through Crooked Man Keys.
Cutthroat can't be far off.
Look at the chart.
"Reef and coral heads."
Dawg outguns us, yes.
He's bigger.
But that means he's heavier, don't it?
He draws more water.
We lure him into the keys and run him aground on the coral heads.
We'll kill him there and take his map.
She has a wound.
We must get her below to the cabin.
It's festering.
That's why.
- Can you take the ball out?
- Hard to say.
Best I seal her side with this hot poker.
That's what we always do in such cases.
No offense, gentlemen, but given the circumstances... don't you think this calls for a professional?
It's all right.
Let him go.
He is a doctor.
I'll need surgeon's tools, hot water, sulfur and clean packing.
- Some rum might help her pain.
- Aye.
You as well, John.
- You clumsy swab!
- Sorry.
I was supposed to torture you.
Sorry.
- Do you see it yet?
- Close.
Another minute.
Your father and two uncles each had pieces of the map.
The treasure, it's large, I take it.
Largest ever taken.
Spanish gold ship.
Sorry.
And a third uncle, he chases you.
An unusual family.
Success.
I've treated you cruel, haven't I?
You've had a lot on your mind.
And you did help me at the prison.
The tavern.
Let's say, between us, just for argument's sake... that you have Mordachai's map.
But I don't.
No, I know that, but pretend that you do.
I was willing to go halves with him and his.
I will do the same with you and yours.
You're saying... that if I show you mine, you'll share yours with me?
Give me the map.
Give me a kiss first.
Sorry.
Map now.
You see, the thing is...
I don't have it.
But that doesn't mean we can't keep talking about it.
Mr. Blair's respects, Captain.
Talk to yourself.
Yes, Mr. Bowen?
The Reaper's five miles off and closing.
You should stay down.
Mr. Bowen, see that Mr. Shaw gets a change of clothes.
- He's beginning to stink.
- Aye, Captain.
He has it.
She makes for Crooked Man's Passage.
Yes.
She hopes to tear up our bottom on the coral.
Looks like we're in for a blow.
Shall we attack her now?
No.
We'll go around the islands in the dark.
We'll ambush her on the other side at daybreak.
You are clever, Morgan, but I will catch you.
Uncle Dawg will have his day.
First Ainslee's chasing us.
Now your uncle is chasing us.
Now, everybody's chasing us.
I'm not so happy about this.
I mean, I'm using this piratical stuff to write a best-selling book.
I didn't want to put myself in any physical danger.
Put a stow in that sail, Mr. Blair.
We don't want to lose her.
- Break fast the foresail!
- Aye, sir!
I cannot see the horizon.
There is a storm headed our way from the island.
- We'll hold this course.
- Aye.
- Put an extra man on the helm.
- Coxswain, up helm!
"May cruel death leave victims immortal."
M-C-D-L-V-l.
14-56.
1-4-5-6.
Fourteen degrees latitude... five minutes, six seconds north.
There's nothing there.
No, you were right.
It's not on any chart.
Where did you have it hidden?
In the boat, under the seaty thing.
I knew you'd wind up here at some point... that being the cheese and you being the rat.
The thing is, ma'am, I'm basically a shallow man.
And no doctor.
Am I wrong?
No, not really.
I'm surprised you let me fiddle with your hip.
And no gentleman either.
I wanted to be.
The thing is, I was born poor.
My only choice was to become a thief and a liar.
Then since you lie so easily and are so shallow...
I shall lie you in a shallow grave.
Mr. Blair!
Have you no charity, ma'am?
I brim with charity, Mr. Shaw.
I am charity's very soul.
Success, Mr. Blair.
My slave has found Cutthroat Island.
Mark it on the chart.
And since I am so charitable...
I will maroon you on a rock the size of this table... instead of splattering your brains across my bulkhead, as you deserve.
Let's take him below.
Pull!
Going up!
Pull the line, mate!
Tie it down!
Aye, aye, sir!
Tie it off!
Batten down the hatches!
Hold on!
I found it, Mr. Glasspoole!
I've fixed the island.
I know where it is.
It lies through the storm.
You risk the ship if you head for it.
I risk Dawg if I turn back.
Shorten sail all you want, Mr. Blair.
We head straight through it.
Hold your course, men!
Have you ever seen anything like this?
Not so I'd remember.
I won't run!
Look how close we are!
The rig, Morgan!
It can't take it!
It can !
We've been through worse with Harry.
Have faith, Mr. Blair!
Trust the ship!
We'll try it.
What is this?
I'll not die in a storm for your pleasure.
There are too many of them!
Tom Scully, there's no great love between us, but don't do this.
Not this close.
Look!
There's the island!
It can't be more than two or three leagues off.
Away the longboat.
Clear the sweep!
Give us a compass, Scully!
You'll have no need of a compass where you're going!
You're going nowhere but down!
Pull!
Put your backs into it!
Take up the stroke!
Somebody grab that bastard!
No!
Parkins!
Stop him!
Row hard!
It's our one hope!
Put your backs into it, men!
Pull!
Row hard, men!
Reef, men!
Reef!
White water ahead!
Row, men, row!
Bowen!
Bowen!
- Glasspoole, are you all right?
- Aye, Morgan.
- Bowen?
- Yes.
- Blair?
- Aye.
We've lost Hewitt and Ames.
Look!
Look!
The cliffs of blood!
It's Cutthroat!
It must be!
We are truly blessed.
We made it, Scully!
- We found it!
- We made it!
We found Cutthroat Island!
We need to find this trail.
- Can you tell where it begins?
- Not without the third piece.
We'll make for the high ground, get our bearings.
Mr. Bowen, bring that lizard.
We'll have it for dinner.
Gentlemen, we must thank Mr. Scully... for bringing us the chart.
But this piece is the only piece of the map... that shows the treasure site.
My piece.
- The Reaper.
- And the Morning Star.
She still swims.
Dawg must've caught Scully when he bore up in the storm.
That scoundrel must've made a deal with Dawg.
He betrayed my crew.
No sign of Shaw.
Spread out.
Search the whole island.
Find me this cove, these cliffs.
I'll wait ashore.
Go!
He makes to go ashore.
We'll follow him, get the map and find the treasure.
Find me a suitable campsite.
- I'm grateful to you, Mr. Scully.
- My pleasure.
But if you ever are disloyal to me the way you were to Morgan... it'll be my pleasure... to cook you alive and eat you.
Now get out of my eyes.
Morgan's here!
Bitch stole my map!
Find her, or you're all dead!
Spread out.
If he makes it out, we'll grab him.
I know you're out there, Morgan.
I can smell you.
Where are you?
Damn you.
- Where?
- Help.
There he is.
Wait.
You wanna be careful.
It's quicksand.
Did you get Dawg's map, you bastard?
Hand it over, or you're a dead man.
Did you ever think that I might've taken it to give to you?
Not for a second.
Sinking up to your waist, and still all you can do is lie.
It's completely true.
I could no longer stand your opinion of me.
- Then give it over.
- I will, with all my heart... if you'd get me out first.
Do you think I was born last Wednesday?
Give it here, and then we will talk about rescue.
I see your point of view... but it works better for me if I'm on hard land first.
You're up to your chest.
What if I give it to you and you leave me here?
You spoke not long ago of marooning me.
What if I pull you out and you swallow it or run away?
You're beyond trusting.
That's the problem with being a thief.
Nobody knows when you're telling the truth.
Give me the tip of your dagger.
What for?
Give it to me.
Don't argue.
There.
It's no Valentine, but it will have to do.
Now you have it all and I have nothing.
I'm in your command, Morgan.
Do with me what you will.
Quickly.
Well... good luck.
Fish him out.
Hold tight.
That was quite a storm, wasn't it, boys?
We need to get around these hills... through this forest near the coast.
There.
There's our treasure.
Well, shall we?
What are the instructions from here?
Seventy-five paces from this pillar.
- Twelve.
- Twelve?
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen?
Fourteen.
Fifteen.
Sixteen.
Seventeen.
Eighteen.
Nineteen.
- Twenty.
- Look!
- Seventy-five?
- That's what the map says.
- Well, you misread it.
- No, it's very clear.
"Seventy-five paces from the rock pillar."
- Then the other 55 are out there.
- Or...
Look!
That could be the other 55 paces.
We found a cave in the cliff!
Aye!
If they catch us here, they'll find Morgan.
We must leave.
Dead men tell no tales.
What does it say?
"Mouth of darkness, teeth of stone... down the throat to the belly of gold... guarded by those who never grew old."
Well.
Watch your head here.
Here.
Don't do that!
Let's try this way.
Uh, but--
Down the throat to the belly of gold!
Hey!
Down the throat to the belly of gold!
Harry, I found it.
"Guarded by those who never grew old."
And your grandfather was the only one that came back.
We're rich!
Rich!
We'd best get these out.
Dawg can't be far behind.
Fetch the others.
I'll start hauling this to the entrance.
Right.
Wait.
All right.
I'm going.
But no tricks.
And hurry.
Anybody up there?
Morgan!
Lucky me.
We were lookin' all over for you.
That's your young friend from Spittlefield.
- What have you got there?
- Treasure!
Bags of it!
Be careful what you do!
You could lose a lot!
Put a ball between his eyes.
Go ahead!
It's about four million pounds!
No, wait!
That's a guess, but I can't be off by more than a million pounds.
Cut the rope, William!
Get away!
William!
Let's make a deal.
I can be reasonable.
Send Morgan down!
I'll send the treasure up, and we'll both have what we want!
All right, William.
We have a deal.
Here she comes.
I wish I'd never learned Latin.
Now we have both.
Haul them in.
Don't watch me fall.
- I'm coming with you.
- Don't be mad.
Why?
Don't argue.
Let's agree upon something for once.
All right.
On the count of three, then?
Come to me, Morgan.
- One more thing.
- What?
Considering everything, I really think that from now on... we should be full partners.
What do you say?
- Sixty-forty.
- Fifty-fifty.
Full partners.
Very well.
They have a lot to say to each other, don't they?
- Are you ready now?
- Ready.
One.
Two.
Now!
Love.
Who can explain it?
Come on.
Heave!
This is your future, man.
Heave!
- Have you seen Morgan?
- Yes, I did.
She helped me ashore, then sent me to find you.
Thank God she's alive.
Where is she?
Where Dawg can't find her.
It's this way.
Follow me.
- How'd you get off Morgan's ship?
- Same as you, I jumped.
Fortunately, I'm an excellent swimmer.
- This seems rather far.
- It's just a few more feet.
Raise muskets!
Aim!
Splendid.
Before we hang you in Port Royal, you've time to witness... an historic alliance.
Where's Morgan?
I don't think she made it.
Perhaps you're wondering how I come to be here.
A little bird told me.
Plump pigeon.
Courtesy of Mr. Reed.
All right, get up!
All right, you.
Come on!
There, sir!
Trotter!
Discretion dictates that I shall not load the treasure... out of the British man-of-war.
I shall go back to Port Royal with Captain Dawg.
But, sir--
You don't have much feel for these things.
One day, perhaps.
I hope so, sir.
That's it!
Got it!
Take a few of the men and follow in the other pirate ship.
You'll get a share of the prize money-- a little here, a little there.
- It all adds up.
- Yes, sir!
Now, sir, I shall go presently... and write for your royal pardon.
Privateer for the Crown.
Sounds so much better than "pirate," don't you think?
Why do you let that preening swab live?
I study him.
When I become governor of Jamaica...
I will need a certain... style.
Trotter.
Lock them below with the others.
They hang at Port Royal.
With pleasure, Your Honor.
- Welcome aboard my ship, gentlemen.
- Move along!
I trust you'll find your quarters to my liking.
Move on!
Below with ya!
Let's get down there!
We'll weigh anchor.
Rouse the watch forward.
There we go.
Square away the breakers!
- Stand by!
- Come on now.
Push!
Let go the footing!
I thought I should never see you again.
Yes, Mr. Glasspoole, it's me.
What do you say?
Shall we take back our ship?
On your word, Captain.
Tackle's all right.
Cover it up.
The next one.
Mr. Coller!
I believe we can ease the main sheet a foot or two.
- Aye, sir!
- It'll draw better for it.
Are you a good swimmer, Mr. Scully?
Let's find out, shall we?
Do you wish a compass, Scully?
Take your closest friends with you!
There are islands close by!
You can make it if you swim slowly!
I'll get you!
I'll be back, Morgan, if it's the last thing I do!
King Charles?
Ease your topsail!
Are you in there?
Well, you've seen what another captain's like.
Will you take my orders now?
Smile, Mr. Trotter.
Good, Trotter.
Give me some more shot here.
We'll edge towards them, Mr. Blair.
Not so fast to alarm them.
Two points to starboard, and keep her steady.
Two points starboard.
Keep her steady.
Trotter's closing on us.
Is that so?
Doubtless wants advice.
Poor fool can't tie his shoelaces without instruction.
Let's let him catch us.
I hope Mr. Shaw's still alive.
General quarters, Mr. Snelgrave.
Powder to the guns, but softly.
What's going on?
Do what I tell you.
Governor.
Oblige me.
Let me hang Mr. Shaw now from my yardarm.
- This minute?
- Yes.
Might be rather amusing.
One doesn't often get the chance to see a hanging at sea.
Come on, you.
Present arms!
It's a long drop.
What is it?
It's not good.
Best take a look.
William Shaw, you've been found guilty... of piracy in the province of Jamaica.
By the authority of His Majesty the King... the penalty for piracy is death.
Pray, hangman, carry out the sentence!
He's testing us.
Prime your guns, men.
Are we prepared to fire, Mr. Snelgrave?
Bloody hell!
I knew it.
- On command!
- Up ports!
Cannons forward!
Cannons ready!
Guns forward!
- Open fire!
- Fire!
Fire!
Hoist our colors!
Mr. Blair, close it quickly now!
Fire!
Oh, my God.
Blast 'em from the sea!
They want your treasure!
Will you let 'em take it?
- On your way.
- Aye.
Knock 'em down!
Riflemen, prepare!
She means to board me!
Point her up!
Fire!
Sling your hooks!
Boarders aboard!
I love this.
I love it!
Who wants to die first?
Come on!
Kill 'em!
Kill 'em all!
Damn you!
They are so many.
We are so few!
Keep fighting.
Hold them back as long as you can.
Aye!
Where you go?
To blow out his bottom and get what we came for!
Separate the ships when I do!
Aye.
Die, Morgan, ya sea witch!
Morgan has done it!
You!
Cut us loose!
- What for?
- No future in the army, sir.
- What are you doing here?
- Not what you think.
There you are, Morgan!
Come to seek my treasure, have you?
Don't move.
I'll be right down to help you count it.
- Let's finish this.
- Come up to Uncle!
Forgive me.
I will come back.
- I promise.
- The whole ship's going to blow!
That boy doesn't understand us.
But then, he's not family.
Come on!
You cut me, niece.
That was for Mordachai.
The next one is for Harry.
Be quick!
Undo my bonds!
Your father was nothing!
All my brothers were nothing.
You exceed them.
Think how far we could go together.
You and me against the world.
Join me.
You don't have to die.
You do.
You've run out of world.
Can you hear me?
I'm coming for you.
Can you please hurry?
I'll give you this much.
You're harder to kill than your father.
The odd thing is, I enjoyed it.
I never gave up.
Never gave in.
I regret it's finished.
Give my love to Harry when you see him.
It's over, Morgan.
You planning to fight me with that little stick?
No, Uncle.
With this!
Bad Dawg!
Quick!
There's no time.
The ship's going to blow up.
Yes.
Go ahead.
Hurry!
It's too bad we'll have to leave all this behind.
Hurry!
There's no time for the treasure!
Yes!
Let's hurry!
Here!
Up here!
Quickly!
Give me your hand!
Jump.
Look!
They're alive!
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
You?
Fine.
Just a little poorer.
Well, it doesn't matter.
I'm alive, and you're alive and--
And we're alive together.
There will be other treasures.
Do you really feel that way?
Absolutely.
Then I guess you don't want your share.
- That's a barrel.
- On this end.
- On this end?
- Yes.
A marker barrel.
But on the other--
This is yours, men.
Every last doubloon.
No one ever fought harder for anything.
Mr. Glasspoole will divide it into equal shares for us.
You're all rich men now.
You're free to go your separate ways.
You could buy a little cottage in Bermuda... and drink camomile tea on the porch.
On the other hand, we could do what we were born to do.
Stay together and ride the early trades all the way to Madagascar... the best pirating waters in the world.
Well, what do you say?
Shall we add to this pile here on the deck?
Mr. Glasspoole, what say you?
It's just that it is such a large decision to make... in such a small amount of time.
Aye!
Mr. Blair?
I'd like to, but it's just--
I've always wanted to do a bit of farming.
Farming?
To the captain!
- Where to?
- I told you.
Madagascar.
But that's in Africa.
Then we'd best get busy.
Mr. Trotter, take the crow's nest watch for the next 12 hours.
Good as done, ma'am.
Mr. Blair, prepare to come about.
Steer south-southeast.
On to your stations, men.
Prepare to come about south-southeast.
And, Mr. Shaw.
I'd like to see you in my cabin immediately.
Subtitles ripped by Tim Yunaev
But I thought you and I were forever?
I want you so badly.
- Morgan!
- But so does the Port Royal governor.
He will pay well for the capture of Morgan Adams, the pirate.
- You knew who I was?
- All along.
Morgan!
Where are you?
You are heartless, Lieutenant.
My apologies, senorita.
But you are right.
I thought it was much more amusing this way also... since I knew that you knew.
By the way, that won't work.
See?
I took your balls.
What happened?
Your father sent for you two days ago.
I know.
I was coming.
He did not know this.
He went looking for you.
That's when Dawg grabbed him.
Lord knows what he does with him.
I took this from our brother Richard last week.
Unwillingly.
That's his blood on the borders.
With your piece, all I need is Mordachai's.
You're out of luck.
I don't have it.
Where is it?
With Morgan?
I haven't seen her.
I think you lie, Harry.
I hid it.
Progress.
Where?
Up here.
I always thought there was nothing in your head.
Come back on board.
I'm going to split you wide open.
Mr. Snelgrave.
I'll see ya in hell.
Father!
- Father, I've got you!
- Let go!
Let go!
Hold onto me!
- Let go!
- Never!
No!
Father!
Father!
Someone get a grappling hook!
Launch the cutter.
Heave!
Oh, Lord, what did I do in my life to get you?
Dawg will pay for this, I swear.
You leave Dawg be.
I will fly his bloody head as my banner!
You'll leave Dawg well to leeward.
There will be time for him.
Find your Uncle Mordachai.
Take my crew.
Make them yours.
Father, don't talk now.
I'll get you back to the ship.
I'll not see my ship again.
The Morning Star is yours.
Don't say that.
I've patched you with worse.
Get your knife.
Shave my head.
- What?
- Shave my head.
For once in your life, Morgan... do as I tell you.
Lieutenant.
What is your name again?
Plopper?
Squinter?
Trotter, Your Excellency.
Miss Mandy Rickets is standing alone.
Her father brings a fortune in investments to the colony.
Dance with her.
She's rather homely, sir.
And you are not?
There you are.
You see?
Too late.
Some other fellow has taken the plunge.
There's every reason why I should be alone tonight... being a stranger here... but a woman with grace such as yours... should never be unattended.
My name is Shaw.
William Shaw.
But my friends call me Willy.
Do we know him, sir?
We do not.
Are you at leisure, Mr. Shaw, or do you follow a profession?
Most serious one, ma'am.
I'm a medical man, a doctor.
Oh, my!
I studied at Leyden, then higher anatomy with Dreyfuss at Leipzig.
With higher anatomy, you must know a great deal about the human body.
Indeed, madam.
Every bit of it.
All the ins and outs.
In medicine, it's our obligation to probe to the very bottom of things.
We must, in fact, explode ancient superstitions... shake truths violently from the body.
You, sir!
Forgive my rudeness.
Trotter's the name.
I'm with the regiment.
William Shaw.
Dr. Shaw, in fact.
Most happy.
What ship did you come in on, Doctor?
Was it the Bristol packet?
Bristol packet?
Bristol packet?
I believe that was it, although I can't be sure.
I'm all at sea when it comes to things nautical.
Very good.
No, the reason I asked... is the Bristol packet don't arrive until a week Wednesday.
That's him!
That man stole my diamond comb!
My pearls!
My pearl dangles!
My ruby necklace!
- Sergeant of the guard!
- Women!
Sergeant of the guard!
Good night, ladies!
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
His name's Shaw, sir.
I trust you'll enjoy life as a slave, Mr. Shaw.
Whoever you are.
That's good.
Tie it off!
Morgan, think of the freedom.
You can do anything you want now.
Come to London with me.
Come to London with me.
There's dukes there.
There's earls and parties.
It'll be fun.
Think of how much fun it'd be.
Besides, these men aren't gonna take orders from you.
They will!
Watch.
You there.
Stand to.
Hoist my pennant.
Bring it here.
Mutiny, will ya?
I was hoping to find you sober.
I was hoping to be passed out by now, Mr. Glasspoole.
Important things go on overhead.
Morgan, you should be there.
Men, Black Harry is gone.
I'm not one to speak ill of the dead... but for months he brought us nothing.
So now we can either sell this rotten bark and divvy up... or you can choose me captain.
I stand for captain.
My father wished it.
As he died, he gave me this.
He left it for all of you.
That's his bloody scalp.
It's a map to Cutthroat Island... the buried treasure of a Spanish gold ship.
More gold, jewels and plunder than you've ever dreamed of.
What does it say?
Aye.
It says--
You read it.
- I can't.
- Why not?
It's Latin.
Then I will have it translated at once.
There must be someone who knows Latin at Port Royal.
My Uncle Mordachai holds a second piece at Spittlefield.
There's more than one piece?
Actually, there are three.
- Where's the third?
- Dawg Brown has it.
Oh, well!
It's practically in our pocket.
We'll fight him for it.
We'll join with Mordachai.
Two ships against one.
You should like them odds.
Ask yourselves.
What would Harry have done?
This is our chance to seek some real fortune... and to pay back Dawg what we owe him.
What could be better than that?
Mr. Blair, you are quartermaster.
You decide.
Two days is all I need.
One to Port Royal, one to Spittlefield.
If Harry picked you, I'll give you a chance.
Let any man who would challenge me draw that.
I found him.
He's a prisoner inside.
He speaks Latin.
Good.
Let's break him out.
Unfortunately, Captain-
- I mean, ma'am, he's about to be sold as a slave.
A slave.
They're hanging the pirates.
They're gonna find you out.
You worry too much.
Don't I look right?
You look beautiful.
It's just that I'm the only person here who has the slightest inkling... of how to act like a gentleperson, so I have to go with you.
- Then you shall come.
- But, unfortunately, I can't.
I have pressing business with my bookseller.
- The fat man is right.
- I'll see you at Spittlefield.
You must be at your best behavior.
Then, gallant sir, escort me thither.
Turn around.
- You.
On your feet.
- Ask me politely.
You anticipate too much.
It's more like a fencing move.
Any fool can do it.
I hope you enjoy pain, slave.
Because I intend to buy you.
Good morning, madam.
As you can see, I'm young, in fine health.
I know horsemanship.
I write a fine hand.
I have it on authority that you are fluent in Latin.
Ah, Latin, the Romance language.
I can speak Latin like I was born in the ancient Senate.
A regular Cicero.
Why?
Do you have children who wish to learn?
I'd make a first-class teacher in a tasteful country house.
I can do most arithmetic, though I confess a weakness in long division.
Stop your chatter and say something Latinish.
What did you say?
You're a very beautiful woman.
I'd like to wash your feet.
You like to wash things, do you?
Start with your mouth.
Ten pounds?
Five pounds?
What?
No offers at all?
Take him away and hang him.
Next!
Please!
Don't hang me!
Next!
Lot 22!
A colonist.
A doctor.
Being of value, I start the bidding at five pounds.
- I bid five pounds.
- Five pounds, sir.
Go on.
Any advance on five pounds?
He's of good physique.
- Ten pounds.
- Ten pounds!
- Any advance on ten pounds?
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen pounds, sir.
- Twenty pounds.
- Twenty pounds is the bid.
- Sir, a word to the wise.
- Let the young lady win.
- You won't get one like this.
- Being a doctor, he's--
- Go away!
That one is mine.
- Twenty-five pounds.
- Twenty-five pounds, sir.
Good teeth.
- Thirty pounds!
- Thirty pounds!
Madam, I will have this man at any price.
If you are buying him purely for pleasure...
I will offer to do the same for you at no cost.
A doctor!
- Thirty-five pounds!
- Thirty-five pounds, sir.
A sensible choice, indeed.
Go on.
Captain, no!
Where's your sense of competition?
Come on!
Someone give me more than 35!
You, sir, you haven't bid.
Look at him.
Look at the quality.
And you, madam, another bid?
Any advance on 35.
I hope the lady is prepared to be a good loser.
What gave you the idea I was a lady?
Another bid, sir?
I see your lips moving.
Yes?
Are you trying to kill me, madam?
Yes, that's why I'm aiming where your brains are.
Now leave this place and go far away.
Don't retreat now, sir.
Where are you going?
- Don't surrender this opportunity.
- Forty pounds to end the bidding.
Sold to the lady with the monkey.
Take him away.
Go on!
Move!
Of course, I'm grateful, madam.
You picked a bargain.
I'm connected to all the great families of Europe.
- I have a natural pitch for music...
- Quiet!
and a perfect taste in wine.
Enemy to leeward, Captain.
Starboard as well, Captain.
Time to leave.
You draw them away.
We'll meet at Dingley Crossroads.
- Take King Charles.
Come on.
- Aye.
It's Morgan Adams!
She's at the auction!
Shoot to kill!
If I am in some way the cause of all this, I apologize at once.
Here.
Come here.
Hold on there.
Hold on tight.
Try to keep up with me.
I am not fond of heights!
Then let go!
Lieutenant Trotter!
What's going on?
Something with Mr. Shaw, I believe.
I'm in favor of exercise, but you owe me an explanation.
Come here.
Come on.
We have to climb down here.
Fast!
- Where'd they go?
- There!
Was that fast enough?
Come on!
Get the reins!
Grab them!
Come on!
Go!
Mr. Trotter!
That's my bloody carriage.
I'll have it back, if you please.
You, off.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, sir.
He won't get far.
Reload!
It's hard to imagine what part of your life would require Latin!
Reload!
- We've taken a passenger!
- Here!
You're hitting a woman!
Captain Perkins, sir!
- Yes?
- It's her!
Morgan Adams!
You're more active than other women I've known.
Morgan!
Watch your head!
Charge!
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Stop them!
I must visit that shop again when I have more time.
- Master gunner, fire at will.
- Run 'em up!
Fire!
A ship!
I find myself being fired upon by an entire ship!
Oh, my God.
You certainly left your mark on this town.
Hold on!
Whoa!
Trotter, do you want to spend the rest of your days on this poxy island?
- Who was that woman?
- Morgan Adams, sir.
You've 100 pounds on her head.
Black Harry's girl.
Well, well.
She's made a proper fool of me, hasn't she?
Two hundred pounds and a captaincy for you if you find her for me.
Sir!
- Any difficulties?
- Nothing unusual.
Here.
Step down into the carriage.
- Will you take the reins?
- Aye.
We should make Spittlefield by dark.
What is your name anyway, slave?
Shaw.
William Shaw.
Dr. Shaw, actually.
Slave, I'm about to show you something.
Reveal it to any other man, and you will wish you were back at Port Royal... with your head on the block and the ax in the air.
Thank you, but I've seen one before.
What is this?
A pigskin?
Translate what is written there.
Let's discuss terms first.
I do so, and you set me free.
That's tender.
It's about to become more tender.
They're backwards.
I assure you, ma'am, they're normal in every respect.
No, the words.
They're written backwards.
Look.
Can you see?
"Cliffs of blood." Bless me.
You're right.
You tell Mr. Squeakum's that I will send him a new chapter every month.
- Now, what's this all about?
- He's a great admirer of your books.
That makes me happy.
Which books has he read?
Did he mention?
His Excellency Governor Ainslee, John Reed, the author... currently the chronicler of piracy.
Step up, sir.
Always a pleasure to meet a literary man.
- I'd just as soon walk.
- I insist.
I can do that, you know.
"When the earth and all its people quake-
- Psalm, number 75.
My bones suffer mortal agony.
Number 42."
- And?
- That's all.
- No position?
No parallel?
- I swear it, ma'am.
That's all that's here.
Piracy, Mr. Reed, is the scourge of these plantations.
I, therefore, give rather large rewards for the capture of pirates... including Morgan Adams.
I don't know who she is.
Trotter tells me that you move throughout the pirate world... collecting your little tales.
Dangerous.
If by some chance you come across her, you might tell her on my behalf... that I offer her two alternatives.
One, an ignominious death on the gallows like these poor fellows here.
Please bear in mind that I could decide you're a pirate as well.
And the alternative?
She might cut me in for a share... of her grandfather's treasure... or she ends up as dinner for crows.
Pull up!
Good day, Mr. Reed.
Do you understand me, sir?
Here.
Here's a good one.
You blackguard!
Can you spare a little, lady?
Mordachai's up there, scared as a goose.
He's surrounded by guards, back to the wall, pistols out.
He's expecting Dawg.
If there are any of Dawg's men around, they will see you.
Mordachai's guards won't let you get close.
Wait a minute.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
How much?
- What?
- Come with me.
You stay put.
Where do you think you're going?
Tapster sent me.
Said the old turtle has his needs.
Shake her down.
- Sweetheart, all that costs money.
- I have money.
I promise.
I will take care of you later.
Follow me.
You too.
Captain, you in the mood for a whore?
Show her in.
Wait a minute.
I recognize you.
You're not a whore.
Call your men, and it's the last sound you make.
You're Harry's girl.
You always was trouble.
Blast ya.
What do you want here, eh?
I've brought my father's map.
You have the map?
- What about the Morning Star, the ship?
- She's mine.
Here.
Look what I'm doing.
Holy Virgin.
Harry's blessed head.
See?
ls that not fine?
That's handsome of ya.
Mighty handsome.
But with you here, you bet your life Dawg's around somewhere.
I'm not afraid of Dawg.
I'm half your age and nowhere near the sailor.
You shame me, lass.
I don't like that.
Then get up and fight!
Prove me wrong.
I've heard of Cutthroat Island.
I always thought it was a sailor's yarn.
Piles of skulls.
Reefs of sailors' drowned bones.
This treasure is ours.
Or would be... if you were an Adams.
There's no water in Adams blood.
I'll do it.
I'll join with ya.
Just like Harry, mine's well hid.
Unfinished business from the other night, Morgan.
Let her stand, Mr. Snelgrave.
Morgan, what a woman you've become.
I knew you'd bring him here, Morgan.
Blast ya!
Hello, brother Mordachai.
Morgan, in sweet memory... of bouncing you on my knee as a little girl...
I'm going to ask you just once for your daddy's piece of the map.
Would you settle for the point of my cutlass?
Somehow I knew you would say something like that.
And then we'd fall to oaths and threats.
Let's cut through the talk, shall we?
I have just the thing for you, little niece.
This says it all, Morgan.
Pain.
Viciousness.
Mutilation.
All the good things in life.
My coat of arms.
Ugly, slippery and foul smelling.
- It does say it all.
- Yes.
- And it looks like you.
- Thank you.
We stay close together.
We're family.
- Captain!
- Bowen!
Get back to the ship!
Bring the men!
You think you might unlock these now?
Given the circumstances.
I don't have the key here.
- Where is it?
- They never gave me one.
What?
The map.
Tell me where it is, or I'll run you through!
Hey!
You killed my brother!
I saw that, little niece.
I remember when you were a little girl.
Always flinched when you saw your Uncle Douglas, didn't ya?
Give me the map!
Where's the map?
Give me the map!
Sweetheart, I promised I'd take care of you.
- Very pretty, Mr. Shaw.
- Thank you, ma'am.
I had the good fortune to study with a grand master in Vienna.
Stop diddling and kill the man.
Kill him?
Bless me.
We never got to that.
I see.
Come on!
I believe you have something of mine, Mr. Shaw.
Ma'am, I don't know what you're talking about.
- Blair!
- This way, Morgan!
This does you no good on the ground, Mr. Bowen.
The numbers.
- What were the numbers?
- What numbers?
- The Psalms.
- 11, 75 and 42.
I figured it out.
It's the longitude.
- We must leave now.
- It's the longitude.
- Back to the ship.
- Move!
Hurry!
Come along, men.
Congratulations, madam.
There's another town you've destroyed.
Get along lively!
Heave!
Heave!
You've been in a fight.
You all right?
It's just a scratch.
Somebody, cut off his chains.
Nice ship.
Why aren't I moving?
Did you hear me, Mr. Bishop?
I said, why aren't I moving?
- The anchor's fouled, Captain.
- Cut it loose.
Aye, aye, sir.
Quickly.
We can't leave yet, Captain.
We haven't put enough food on board.
We need less mouths.
Does no one hear me on this ship?
I distinctly said...
cut it loose!
75... 42... 1 1.
Keep her full!
Let me show you the chart.
The line I plotted runs here, through Crooked Man Keys.
Cutthroat can't be far off.
Look at the chart.
"Reef and coral heads."
Dawg outguns us, yes.
He's bigger.
But that means he's heavier, don't it?
He draws more water.
We lure him into the keys and run him aground on the coral heads.
We'll kill him there and take his map.
She has a wound.
We must get her below to the cabin.
It's festering.
That's why.
- Can you take the ball out?
- Hard to say.
Best I seal her side with this hot poker.
That's what we always do in such cases.
No offense, gentlemen, but given the circumstances... don't you think this calls for a professional?
It's all right.
Let him go.
He is a doctor.
I'll need surgeon's tools, hot water, sulfur and clean packing.
- Some rum might help her pain.
- Aye.
You as well, John.
- You clumsy swab!
- Sorry.
I was supposed to torture you.
Sorry.
- Do you see it yet?
- Close.
Another minute.
Your father and two uncles each had pieces of the map.
The treasure, it's large, I take it.
Largest ever taken.
Spanish gold ship.
Sorry.
And a third uncle, he chases you.
An unusual family.
Success.
I've treated you cruel, haven't I?
You've had a lot on your mind.
And you did help me at the prison.
The tavern.
Let's say, between us, just for argument's sake... that you have Mordachai's map.
But I don't.
No, I know that, but pretend that you do.
I was willing to go halves with him and his.
I will do the same with you and yours.
You're saying... that if I show you mine, you'll share yours with me?
Give me the map.
Give me a kiss first.
Sorry.
Map now.
You see, the thing is...
I don't have it.
But that doesn't mean we can't keep talking about it.
Mr. Blair's respects, Captain.
Talk to yourself.
Yes, Mr. Bowen?
The Reaper's five miles off and closing.
You should stay down.
Mr. Bowen, see that Mr. Shaw gets a change of clothes.
- He's beginning to stink.
- Aye, Captain.
He has it.
She makes for Crooked Man's Passage.
Yes.
She hopes to tear up our bottom on the coral.
Looks like we're in for a blow.
Shall we attack her now?
No.
We'll go around the islands in the dark.
We'll ambush her on the other side at daybreak.
You are clever, Morgan, but I will catch you.
Uncle Dawg will have his day.
First Ainslee's chasing us.
Now your uncle is chasing us.
Now, everybody's chasing us.
I'm not so happy about this.
I mean, I'm using this piratical stuff to write a best-selling book.
I didn't want to put myself in any physical danger.
Put a stow in that sail, Mr. Blair.
We don't want to lose her.
- Break fast the foresail!
- Aye, sir!
I cannot see the horizon.
There is a storm headed our way from the island.
- We'll hold this course.
- Aye.
- Put an extra man on the helm.
- Coxswain, up helm!
"May cruel death leave victims immortal."
M-C-D-L-V-l.
14-56.
1-4-5-6.
Fourteen degrees latitude... five minutes, six seconds north.
There's nothing there.
No, you were right.
It's not on any chart.
Where did you have it hidden?
In the boat, under the seaty thing.
I knew you'd wind up here at some point... that being the cheese and you being the rat.
The thing is, ma'am, I'm basically a shallow man.
And no doctor.
Am I wrong?
No, not really.
I'm surprised you let me fiddle with your hip.
And no gentleman either.
I wanted to be.
The thing is, I was born poor.
My only choice was to become a thief and a liar.
Then since you lie so easily and are so shallow...
I shall lie you in a shallow grave.
Mr. Blair!
Have you no charity, ma'am?
I brim with charity, Mr. Shaw.
I am charity's very soul.
Success, Mr. Blair.
My slave has found Cutthroat Island.
Mark it on the chart.
And since I am so charitable...
I will maroon you on a rock the size of this table... instead of splattering your brains across my bulkhead, as you deserve.
Let's take him below.
Pull!
Going up!
Pull the line, mate!
Tie it down!
Aye, aye, sir!
Tie it off!
Batten down the hatches!
Hold on!
I found it, Mr. Glasspoole!
I've fixed the island.
I know where it is.
It lies through the storm.
You risk the ship if you head for it.
I risk Dawg if I turn back.
Shorten sail all you want, Mr. Blair.
We head straight through it.
Hold your course, men!
Have you ever seen anything like this?
Not so I'd remember.
I won't run!
Look how close we are!
The rig, Morgan!
It can't take it!
It can !
We've been through worse with Harry.
Have faith, Mr. Blair!
Trust the ship!
We'll try it.
What is this?
I'll not die in a storm for your pleasure.
There are too many of them!
Tom Scully, there's no great love between us, but don't do this.
Not this close.
Look!
There's the island!
It can't be more than two or three leagues off.
Away the longboat.
Clear the sweep!
Give us a compass, Scully!
You'll have no need of a compass where you're going!
You're going nowhere but down!
Pull!
Put your backs into it!
Take up the stroke!
Somebody grab that bastard!
No!
Parkins!
Stop him!
Row hard!
It's our one hope!
Put your backs into it, men!
Pull!
Row hard, men!
Reef, men!
Reef!
White water ahead!
Row, men, row!
Bowen!
Bowen!
- Glasspoole, are you all right?
- Aye, Morgan.
- Bowen?
- Yes.
- Blair?
- Aye.
We've lost Hewitt and Ames.
Look!
Look!
The cliffs of blood!
It's Cutthroat!
It must be!
We are truly blessed.
We made it, Scully!
- We found it!
- We made it!
We found Cutthroat Island!
We need to find this trail.
- Can you tell where it begins?
- Not without the third piece.
We'll make for the high ground, get our bearings.
Mr. Bowen, bring that lizard.
We'll have it for dinner.
Gentlemen, we must thank Mr. Scully... for bringing us the chart.
But this piece is the only piece of the map... that shows the treasure site.
My piece.
- The Reaper.
- And the Morning Star.
She still swims.
Dawg must've caught Scully when he bore up in the storm.
That scoundrel must've made a deal with Dawg.
He betrayed my crew.
No sign of Shaw.
Spread out.
Search the whole island.
Find me this cove, these cliffs.
I'll wait ashore.
Go!
He makes to go ashore.
We'll follow him, get the map and find the treasure.
Find me a suitable campsite.
- I'm grateful to you, Mr. Scully.
- My pleasure.
But if you ever are disloyal to me the way you were to Morgan... it'll be my pleasure... to cook you alive and eat you.
Now get out of my eyes.
Morgan's here!
Bitch stole my map!
Find her, or you're all dead!
Spread out.
If he makes it out, we'll grab him.
I know you're out there, Morgan.
I can smell you.
Where are you?
Damn you.
- Where?
- Help.
There he is.
Wait.
You wanna be careful.
It's quicksand.
Did you get Dawg's map, you bastard?
Hand it over, or you're a dead man.
Did you ever think that I might've taken it to give to you?
Not for a second.
Sinking up to your waist, and still all you can do is lie.
It's completely true.
I could no longer stand your opinion of me.
- Then give it over.
- I will, with all my heart... if you'd get me out first.
Do you think I was born last Wednesday?
Give it here, and then we will talk about rescue.
I see your point of view... but it works better for me if I'm on hard land first.
You're up to your chest.
What if I give it to you and you leave me here?
You spoke not long ago of marooning me.
What if I pull you out and you swallow it or run away?
You're beyond trusting.
That's the problem with being a thief.
Nobody knows when you're telling the truth.
Give me the tip of your dagger.
What for?
Give it to me.
Don't argue.
There.
It's no Valentine, but it will have to do.
Now you have it all and I have nothing.
I'm in your command, Morgan.
Do with me what you will.
Quickly.
Well... good luck.
Fish him out.
Hold tight.
That was quite a storm, wasn't it, boys?
We need to get around these hills... through this forest near the coast.
There.
There's our treasure.
Well, shall we?
What are the instructions from here?
Seventy-five paces from this pillar.
- Twelve.
- Twelve?
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen?
Fourteen.
Fifteen.
Sixteen.
Seventeen.
Eighteen.
Nineteen.
- Twenty.
- Look!
- Seventy-five?
- That's what the map says.
- Well, you misread it.
- No, it's very clear.
"Seventy-five paces from the rock pillar."
- Then the other 55 are out there.
- Or...
Look!
That could be the other 55 paces.
We found a cave in the cliff!
Aye!
If they catch us here, they'll find Morgan.
We must leave.
Dead men tell no tales.
What does it say?
"Mouth of darkness, teeth of stone... down the throat to the belly of gold... guarded by those who never grew old."
Well.
Watch your head here.
Here.
Don't do that!
Let's try this way.
Uh, but--
Down the throat to the belly of gold!
Hey!
Down the throat to the belly of gold!
Harry, I found it.
"Guarded by those who never grew old."
And your grandfather was the only one that came back.
We're rich!
Rich!
We'd best get these out.
Dawg can't be far behind.
Fetch the others.
I'll start hauling this to the entrance.
Right.
Wait.
All right.
I'm going.
But no tricks.
And hurry.
Anybody up there?
Morgan!
Lucky me.
We was lookin' all over for you.
That's your young friend from Spittlefield.
- What have you got there?
- Treasure!
Bags of it!
Be careful what you do!
You could lose a lot!
Put a ball between his eyes.
Go ahead!
It's about four million pounds!
No, wait!
That's a guess, but I can't be off by more than a million pounds.
Cut the rope, William!
Get away!
William!
Let's make a deal.
I can be reasonable.
Send Morgan down!
I'll send the treasure up, and we'll both have what we want!
All right, William.
We have a deal.
Here she comes.
I wish I'd never learned Latin.
Now we have both.
Haul them in.
Don't watch me fall.
- I'm coming with you.
- Don't be mad.
Why?
Don't argue.
Let's agree upon something for once.
All right.
On the count of three, then?
Come to me, Morgan.
- One more thing.
- What?
Considering everything, I really think that from now on... we should be full partners.
What do you say?
- Sixty-forty.
- Fifty-fifty.
Full partners.
Very well.
They have a lot to say to each other, don't they?
- Are you ready now?
- Ready.
One.
Two.
Now!
Love.
Who can explain it?
Come on.
Heave!
This is your future, men.
Heave!
- Have you seen Morgan?
- Yes, I did.
She helped me ashore, then sent me to find you.
Thank God she's alive.
Where is she?
Where Dawg can't find her.
It's this way.
Follow me.
- How'd you get off Morgan's ship?
- Same as you, I jumped.
Fortunately, I'm an excellent swimmer.
- This seems rather far.
- It's just a few more feet.
Raise muskets!
Aim!
Splendid.
Before we hang you in Port Royal, you've time to witness... an historic alliance.
Where's Morgan?
I don't think she made it.
Perhaps you're wondering how I come to be here.
A little bird told me.
Plump pigeon.
Courtesy of Mr. Reed.
All right, get up!
All right, you.
Come on!
There, sir!
Trotter!
Discretion dictates that I shall not load the treasure... out of the British man-of-war.
I shall go back to Port Royal with Captain Dawg.
But, sir--
You don't have much feel for these things.
One day, perhaps.
I hope so, sir.
That's it!
Got it!
Take a few of the men and follow in the other pirate ship.
You'll get a share of the prize money-- a little here, a little there.
- It all adds up.
- Yes, sir!
Now, sir, I shall go presently... and write for your royal pardon.
Privateer for the Crown.
Sounds so much better than "pirate," don't you think?
Why do you let that preening swab live?
I study him.
When I become governor of Jamaica...
I will need a certain... style.
Trotter.
Lock them below with the others.
They hang at Port Royal.
With pleasure, Your Honor.
- Welcome aboard my ship, gentlemen.
- Move along!
I trust you'll find your quarters to my liking.
Move on!
Below with ya!
Let's get down there!
We'll weigh anchor.
Rouse the watch forward.
There we go.
Square away the breakers!
- Stand by!
- Come on now.
Push!
Let go the footing!
I thought I should never see you again.
Yes, Mr. Glasspoole, it's me.
What do you say?
Shall we take back our ship?
On your word, Captain.
Tackle's all right.
Cover it up.
The next one.
Mr. Coller!
I believe we can ease the main sheet a foot or two.
- Aye, sir!
- It'll draw better for it.
Are you a good swimmer, Mr. Scully?
Let's find out, shall we?
Do you wish a compass, Scully?
Take your closest friends with you!
There are islands close by!
You can make it if you swim slowly!
I'll get you!
I'll be back, Morgan, if it's the last thing I do!
King Charles?
Ease your topsail!
Are you in there?
Well, you've seen what another captain's like.
Will you take my orders now?
Smile, Mr. Trotter.
Good, Trotter.
Give me some more shot here.
We'll edge towards them, Mr. Blair.
Not so fast to alarm them.
Two points to starboard, and keep her steady.
Two points starboard.
Keep her steady.
Trotter's closing on us.
Is that so?
Doubtless wants advice.
Poor fool can't tie his shoelaces without instruction.
Let's let him catch us.
I hope Mr. Shaw's still alive.
General quarters, Mr. Snelgrave.
Powder to the guns, but softly.
What's going on?
Do what I tell you.
Governor.
Oblige me.
Let me hang Mr. Shaw now from my yardarm.
- This minute?
- Yes.
Might be rather amusing.
One doesn't often get the chance to see a hanging at sea.
Come on, you.
Present arms!
It's a long drop.
What is it?
It's not good.
Best take a look.
William Shaw, you've been found guilty... of piracy in the province of Jamaica.
By the authority of His Majesty the King... the penalty for piracy is death.
Pray, hangman, carry out the sentence!
He's testing us.
Prime your guns, men.
Are we prepared to fire, Mr. Snelgrave?
Bloody hell!
I knew it.
- On command!
- Up ports!
Cannons forward!
Cannons ready!
Guns forward!
- Open fire!
- Fire!
Fire!
Hoist our colors!
Mr. Blair, close it quickly now!
Fire!
Oh, my God.
Blast 'em from the sea!
They want your treasure!
Will you let 'em take it?
- On your way.
- Aye.
Knock 'em down!
Riflemen, prepare!
She means to board me!
Point her up!
Fire!
Sling your hooks!
Boarders aboard!
I love this.
I love it!
Who wants to die first?
Come on!
Kill 'em!
Kill 'em all!
Damn you!
They are so many.
We are so few!
Keep fighting.
Hold them back as long as you can.
Aye!
Where you go?
To blow out his bottom and get what we came for!
Separate the ships when I do!
Aye.
Die, Morgan, ya sea witch!
Morgan has done it!
You!
Cut us loose!
- What for?
- No future in the army, sir.
- What are you doing here?
- Not what you think.
There you are, Morgan!
Come to seek my treasure, have you?
Don't move.
I'll be right down to help you count it.
- Let's finish this.
- Come up to Uncle!
Forgive me.
I will come back.
- I promise.
- The whole ship's going to blow!
That boy doesn't understand us.
But then, he's not family.
Come on!
You cut me, niece.
That was for Mordachai.
The next one is for Harry.
Be quick!
Undo my bonds!
Your father was nothing!
All my brothers were nothing.
You exceed them.
Think how far we could go together.
You and me against the world.
Join me.
You don't have to die.
You do.
You've run out of world.
Can you hear me?
I'm coming for you.
Can you please hurry?
I'll give you this much.
You're harder to kill than your father.
The odd thing is, I enjoyed it.
I never gave up.
Never gave in.
I regret it's finished.
Give my love to Harry when you see him.
It's over, Morgan.
You planning to fight me with that little stick?
No, Uncle.
With this!
Bad Dawg!
Quick!
There's no time.
The ship's going to blow up.
Yes.
Go ahead.
Hurry!
It's too bad we'll have to leave all this behind.
Hurry!
There's no time for the treasure!
Yes!
Let's hurry!
Here!
Up here!
Quickly!
Give me your hand!
Jump.
Look!
They're alive!
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
You?
Fine.
Just a little poorer.
Well, it doesn't matter.
I'm alive, and you're alive and--
And we're alive together.
There will be other treasures.
Do you really feel that way?
Absolutely.
Then I guess you don't want your share.
- That's a barrel.
- On this end.
- On this end?
- Yes.
A marker barrel.
But on the other--
This is yours, men.
Every last doubloon.
No one ever fought harder for anything.
Mr. Glasspoole will divide it into equal shares for us.
You're all rich men now.
You're free to go your separate ways.
You could buy a little cottage in Bermuda... and drink camomile tea on the porch.
On the other hand, we could do what we were born to do.
Stay together and ride the early trades all the way to Madagascar... the best pirating waters in the world.
Well, what do you say?
Shall we add to this pile here on the deck?
Mr. Glasspoole, what say you?
It's just that it is such a large decision to make... in such a small amount of time.
Aye!
Mr. Blair?
I'd like to, but it's just--
I've always wanted to do a bit of farming.
Farming?
To the captain!
- Where to?
- I told you.
Madagascar.
But that's in Africa.
Then we'd best get busy.
Mr. Trotter, take the crow's nest watch for the next 12 hours.
Good as done, ma'am.
Mr. Blair, prepare to come about.
Steer south-southeast.
On to your stations, men.
Prepare to come about south-southeast.
And, Mr. Shaw.
I'd like to see you in my cabin immediately.
You're leaving?
But I thought you and I were forever, huh?
- I want you so badly.
- Morgan!
But then, so does the governor of Port royal.
- Morgan!
- And he will pay well for the capture of Morgan Adams the pirate.
- You knew who I was?
- All along.
Morgan!
Where are you?
You are heartless, lieutenant.
My apologies, senorita.
But you are right.
I thought it was much more amusing this way also since I knew that you knew.
By the way, that won't work.
See?
I took your balls.
- What happened?
- Your father sent for you two days ago.
I know.
I was coming.
He did not know this.
He went looking for you.
And that's when Dawg grabbed him.
Lord knows what he does with him.
I took this from our brother Richard last week unwillingly.
That's his blood on the borders.
With your piece, all I need is Mordachai's.
Well, you're out of luck.
I don't...
I don't have it.
Where is it?
With Morgan?
I haven't seen her.
I think you lie, Harry.
- I hid it.
- Progress.
Where?
Up here.
I always thought there was nothing in your head, Harry.
Come back onboard.
I'm gonna split you wide open.
Mr. Snelgrave.
I'll see you in hell.
Father!
- Father, I've got you.
- Let go.
Let go.
- Hold onto me.
- Bring them in.
- Let go.
- Never.
Morgan.
I got one.
No, Father!
Someone get a grappling hook.
Launch the cutter.
Heave.
Oh, Lord, what did I do in my life to get you?
- Dawg will pay for this, I swear.
- You leave Dawg be.
I will fly his bloody head as my banner.
You'II leave Dawg well to leeward.
There'll be time for him.
Find your uncle Mordachai.
Take my crew.
Make them yours.
Father, don't talk now.
I'll get you back to the ship.
I'll not see my ship again.
The Morning Star is yours.
No, don't say that.
I've patched you with worse.
Get your knife.
Shave my head.
What?
Shave my head.
For once in your life, Morgan, do as I tell you.
Lieutenant.
What is your name again?
Plopper?
Squinter?
Trotter, Your Excellency.
Miss Mandy Rickets is standing alone.
Her father brings a fortune in investments to the colony.
Dance with her.
She's rather homely, sir.
And you are not?
There you are.
You see?
Too late.
Some fellow has taken the plunge.
There's every reason why I should be alone tonight being a stranger here.
But a woman with grace such as yours should never be unattended.
My name is Shaw.
William Shaw.
But my friends call me Willy.
Do we know him, sir?
We do not.
Are you at leisure, Mr. Shaw?
Do you follow a profession?
A most serious one, ma'am.
I'm a medical man, a doctor.
Oh, my.
I studied at Leiden then higher anatomy with Dreyfuss at Leipzig.
With higher anatomy, you must know a great deal about the human body.
Indeed, madame.
Every bit of it.
All the ins and outs.
In medicine, it's our obligation to probe to the very bottom of things.
We must, in fact, explode ancient superstitions.
Shake truths violently from the body.
You, sir.
Forgive my rudeness.
Trotter's the name.
I'm with the regiment.
William Shaw.
Dr. Shaw, in fact.
Most happy.
What ship did you come in on, doctor?
Was it the bristol Packet?
bristol packet, bristol packet.
I believe that was it, although I can't be sure.
I'm all at sea when it comes to things nautical.
Very good.
No, the reason I asked is the bristol Packet don't arrive until a week Wednesday.
That's him.
That man stole my diamond comb.
My pearls.
My pearl dangle.
- My ruby.
My ruby necklace.
- Sergeant of the guards!
Women.
Sergeant of the guards.
Guard.
Good night, ladies.
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
His name's Shaw, sir.
I trust you'll enjoy life as a slave, Mr. Shaw.
Whoever you are.
That's good.
Tie it off.
Morgan, think of the freedom.
You can do anything you want now.
Come to London with me.
There's dukes there.
There's earls and parties.
It'd be fun.
Think of how much fun it'd be.
Besides, these men aren't gonna take orders from you.
They will.
Watch.
You there.
Stand to.
Hoist my pennant.
Bring it here.
Oh, mutiny, will you?
Morgan.
I was hoping to find you sober.
I was hoping to be passed out by now, Mr. Glasspoole.
Important things go on overhead.
Morgan, you should be there.
Men, Black Harry is gone and I'm not one to speak ill of the dead.
But for months, he brought us nothing.
So now we can either sell this rotten bark and divvy up or you can choose me captain.
I stand for captain.
My father wished it.
As he died, he gave me this.
He left it for all of you.
That's his bloody scalp.
It's a map to Cutthroat Island.
The buried treasure of a Spanish gold ship.
More gold, jewels and plunder than you've ever dreamed of.
What does it say?
Aye.
It says...
You read it.
- I can't.
- Why not?
It's Latin.
Then I will have it translated at once.
There must be someone who knows Latin at Port royal.
My uncle Mordachai holds a second piece at Spittlefield.
There's more than one piece?
Actually, there are three.
Where's the third?
Dawg Brown has it.
Oh, well, it's practically in our pocket.
We'll fight him for it.
We'll join with Mordachai.
Two ships against one.
You should like them odds.
Ask yourselves, "What would Harry have done?"
This is our chance to seek some real fortune and to pay back Dawg what we owe him.
What could be better than that?
Mr. Blair, you are quartermaster.
You decide.
Two days is all I need.
One to Port royal, one to Spittlefield.
If Harry picked you, I'll give you a chance.
Let any man who would challenge me draw that.
I found him.
He's a prisoner inside.
He speaks Latin.
Good, let's break him out.
Unfortunately, captain...
I mean, ma'am.
...he's about to be sold as a slave.
A slave?
They're hanging the pirates.
They're gonna find you out.
Oh, you worry too much.
- Don't I look right?
- You look beautiful.
It's just I'm the only person who has the slightest inkling of how to act like a gentleperson.
- So I have to go with you.
- Excellent.
Then you shall come.
But unfortunately I can't.
I have some pressing business with my bookseller.
- The fat man is right.
- I'll see you at Spittlefield.
You must be at your best behavior.
Then, gallant sir, escort me thither.
Come on, will you?
Turn around.
- You, on your feet.
- Ask me politely.
You anticipate too much.
It's more like a fencing move.
Any fool can do it.
I hope you enjoy pain, slave.
Because I intend to buy you.
Good morning, madame.
As you can see, I'm young, in fine health.
I know horsemanship.
I write a fine hand.
I have it on authority that you are fluent in Latin.
Latin, the romance language.
I can speak Latin like I was born in the ancient senate.
A regular Cicero.
Why, do you have children who wish to learn?
I'd make a first-class teacher in a tasteful house.
I can do most arithmetic, though I do confess a weakness in long division.
Stop your chatter and say something Latinish.
What did you say?
You're a very beautiful woman.
I'd like to wash your feet.
You like to wash things, do you?
Start with your mouth.
Ten pounds?
Five pounds?
What, no offers at all?
Take him away and hang him.
No!
No!
Please, don't hang me!
Next.
Lot 22.
A colonist, a doctor.
Being of value, I start the bidding at 5 pounds.
I bid 5 pounds.
Five pounds, sir.
Come on, any advance on 5 pounds?
As you can see, he's of good physique.
- Ten pounds.
- Ten pounds.
Ten pounds?
Any advance on 10 pounds?
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen pounds, sir.
- Twenty pounds.
- Twenty pounds.
- Twenty pounds is the bid.
- Sir, a word to the wise.
- Let the young lady win.
- You won't get one like this.
- Being a doctor, he's...
- Go away.
That one is mine.
- Twenty-five pounds.
- Twenty-five pounds, sir.
- Good teeth.
- Thirty pounds.
- Thirty pounds.
- Madame I will have this man at any price.
If you are buying him purely for pleasure I will offer to do the same for you at no cost.
- Thirty-five pounds.
- Thirty-five pounds, sir.
A sensible choice indeed.
- Come on.
- Captain, no.
Where's your sense of competition?
Come on, someone will give me more than 35.
You, sir.
You haven't bid.
Look at him.
Look at the quality.
And you, madam, at the side here.
Another bid in the advance of 35?
I hope the lady is prepared to be a good loser.
What gave you the idea I was a lady?
Another bid, sir?
I see your lips moving.
Yes?
- Are you trying to kill me?
- Yes.
That's why I'm aiming where your brains are.
Now, leave this place and go far away.
Don't retreat now, sir.
Where are you going?
- Don't surrender this opportunity.
- Forty pounds to end the bidding.
Sold to the lady with the monkey.
Take him away.
- Come on.
- Move.
Of course, I'm grateful, madame, but I must admit you picked a bargain.
I'm connected to all the great families of Europe.
I have a natural pitch for music...
- Quiet.
- ... and a perfect taste in wine.
Enemy to leeward, captain.
- Starboard as well, captain.
- Keep moving.
Time to leave.
You draw them away.
We'll meet at Dingley crossroads.
- Take King Charles.
- Aye.
Come on.
It's Morgan Adams.
She's at the auction.
Shoot to kill.
If I am in some way the cause of all this, I apologize at once.
Here, come here.
Hold on there.
Hold on tight.
And try to keep up with me.
I am not fond of heights.
Then let go.
Lieutenant Trotter.
What's going on?
Something with Mr. Shaw, I believe.
I'm in favor of exercise, but you owe me an explanation.
Come here.
Come on.
We have to climb down here.
Fast.
- Where'd they go?
- Hurry up there.
Was that fast enough?
Come on.
Get the reins.
Grab them.
Come on.
Mr. Trotter.
That's my bloody carriage.
I'll have it back, if you please.
You, off.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, sir.
It won't get far.
Reload.
It's hard to imagine what part of your life...
- ... would require me to speak Latin.
- Reload.
- We've taken a passenger.
- Here.
You're hitting a woman!
Captain Perkins, sir.
- Captain Perkins, sir.
- Yes?
It's her.
Morgan Adams.
You're more active than other women I've known.
Morgan!
Watch your head!
Morgan!
Charge!
Excuse me.
Stop them!
I must visit that shop again when I have more time.
Master gunner, fire at will.
Run them up.
Fire!
A ship.
I find myself being fired upon by an entire ship.
Oh, my God.
You certainly left your mark on this town.
Hold on.
Trotter, do you want to spend the rest of your days on this poxy island?
- Who was that woman?
- Morgan Adams, sir.
You've a hundred pounds on her head.
Black Harry's girl.
Well, well.
Well, she's made a proper fool of me, hasn't she?
Two hundred pounds and a captaincy for you if you find her for me.
Sir.
- Any difficulties?
- Nothing unusual.
Here, step down into the carriage.
Will you take the reins, Mr. Glasspoole?
We should make Spittlefield by dark.
What is your name anyway, slave?
Shaw.
William Shaw.
Dr. Shaw, actually.
Slave, I'm about to show you something.
reveal it to any other man and you will wish you were back at Port royal with your head on the block and the ax in the air.
Thank you, but I've seen one before.
What is this, a pigskin?
Translate what is written there.
Let's discuss terms first.
I do so and you set me free.
That's tender.
It's about to become more tender.
They're backwards.
I assure you, they're normal in every respect.
No, the words.
They're written backwards.
Look.
Can you see?
"Cliffs of blood. "
Bless me.
You're right.
No, no.
You tell Mr. Squeakums that I will send him a new chapter every month.
- Now, what's this all about?
- He's a great admirer of your books.
That makes me happy.
Which books has he read?
Did he mention, or...?
His Excellency Governor Ainslee, John Reed, the author.
- Currently the chronicler of piracy.
- Step up, sir.
Always a pleasure to meet a literary man.
- Oh, I'd just as soon walk.
- Oh, I insist.
I can do that, you know.
"When the earth and all its people quake psalm number 75, my bones suffer mortal agony...
- ... number 42."
- And?
- That's all.
- No.
No position?
No parallel?
I swear it, ma'am.
That's all that's here.
Piracy, Mr. Reed, is the scourge of these plantations.
I therefore give rather large rewards for the capture of pirates including Morgan Adams.
I don't know who she is.
Trotter tells me that you move throughout the pirate world collecting your little tales.
Dangerous.
If by some chance you come across her you might tell her on my behalf that I offer her two alternatives.
One, an ignominious death on the gallows like these poor fellows here.
Please bear in mind that I could decide that you're a pirate as well.
And the alternative?
She might cut me in for a share of her grandfather's treasure.
Or she ends up as dinner for crows.
Pull up.
Good day, Mr. Reed.
Do you understand me, sir?
Yeah.
There's a good one.
You vagabond.
Could you spare a little, lady?
Mordachai's up there scared as a goose.
He's surrounded by guards, back to the wall, pistols out.
He's expecting Dawg.
If there are any of Dawg's men around, they will see you.
Mordachai's guards won't let you get close.
Wait a minute.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
- How much?
- What?
Come with me.
You stay put.
- Where do you think you're going?
- Tapster sent me.
Said the old turtle has his needs.
Shake her down.
Hey, sweetheart.
All that costs money.
- I have money.
- Well, I promise.
I will take care of you later.
Follow me.
You too.
Captain, you in the mood for a whore?
Show her in.
Wait a minute.
I recognize you.
You're not a whore.
Call your men and it's the last sound you make.
You're Harry's girl.
Yeah.
You always was trouble, blast you.
What do you want here, eh?
- I've brought my father's map.
- You have the map?
What about the Morning Star, the ship?
She's mine.
Here.
Look what I'm doing.
Holy virgin.
Harry's blessed head.
See?
Is that not fine?
That's handsome of you, mighty handsome.
But with you here, you bet your life Dawg's around somewhere.
I'm not afraid of Dawg, and I'm half your age and nowhere near the sailor.
You shame me, lass.
- I don't like that.
- Then get up and fight.
- Prove me wrong.
- I've heard of Cutthroat Island.
I always thought it was a sailor's yarn.
Piles of skulls, reefs of sailors' drowned bones.
This treasure is ours.
Or would be if you were an Adams.
There's no water in Adams' blood.
I'll do it.
I'll join with you.
Just like Harry, mine's well hid.
Unfinished business from the other night, Morgan.
Let her stand, Mr. Snelgrave.
Morgan.
What a woman you've become.
I knew you'd bring him here, Morgan.
Blast you.
Hello, brother Mordachai.
Morgan in sweet memory of bouncing you on my knee as a little girl I'm gonna ask you just once for your daddy's piece of the map.
Would you settle for the point of my cutlass?
Somehow I knew you would say something like that.
And then we'd fall to oaths and threats.
Well, let's cut through the talk, shall we?
I have just the thing for you, little niece.
This says it all, Morgan.
Pain, viciousness, mutilation.
All the good things in life.
My coat of arms.
Ugly, slippery and fouI-smelling.
It does say it all.
- Yes.
- And it looks like you.
Thank you.
We stay close together.
We're family.
- Captain.
- Bowen, get back to the ship.
Bring the men.
Morgan.
Do you think you might unlock these now?
Given the circumstances.
- I don't have the key here.
- Where is it?
- They never gave me one.
- What?
The map.
Tell me where it is or I'll run you through.
Hey.
You killed my brother.
I saw that, little niece.
I remember when you were a little girl.
Always flinched when you saw your uncle Douglas, didn't you?
Give me the map.
Give me the map.
Where's the map?
Give me the map!
Sweetheart, I promised I'd take care of you.
- Very pretty, Mr. Shaw.
- Thank you, ma'am.
I had the good fortune to study with a grand master in Vienna.
- Glasspoole.
- Aye.
Now stop diddling and kill the man.
Kill him?
Bless me.
We never got to that.
I see.
Come on.
I believe you have something of mine.
Ma'am, I don't know what you're talking about.
There she is.
- Blair.
- This way, Morgan.
This does you no good on the ground, Mr. Bowen.
The numbers.
What were the numbers?
- What numbers?
- The psalms.
Eleven, 75 and 42.
I figured it out.
It's the longitude.
- We must leave now.
- It's the longitude.
- Back to the ship.
- Move.
Hurry.
- Come along, men.
- Congratulations, madam.
There's another town you've destroyed.
Get along lively.
Heave.
You've been in a fight.
Are you all right?
It's just a scratch.
Somebody cut off his chains.
Nice ship.
Why aren't I moving?
Did you hear me, Mr. Bishop?
I said why aren't I moving?
- The anchor's fouled.
- Cut it loose.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Quickly.
We can't leave yet, captain.
We haven't put enough food onboard.
We need less mouths.
Does no one hear me on this ship?
I distinctly said cut it loose!
Seventy-five.
Forty-two.
Eleven.
Keep her full.
Let me show you the chart.
The line I plotted runs here through Crooked Man Keys.
Cutthroat can't be far off.
Look at the chart.
"Reef and coral heads. "
Dawg outguns us, yes.
He's bigger.
But that means he's heavier, don't it?
He draws more water.
We lure him into the keys and run him aground on the coral heads.
- We'll kill him there and take his map.
- Aye.
She has a wound.
We must get her below to the cabin.
- It's festering, that's why.
- Can you take the ball out?
Hard to say.
Best I seal her side with this hot poker.
That's what we always do in such cases.
No offense, gentlemen, but given the circumstances don't you think this calls for a professional?
It's all right.
Let him go.
He is a doctor.
I'll need surgeon's tools.
Hot water, sulfur and clean packing.
- Some rum might help her pain.
- Aye.
You as well, John.
- Clumsy swab.
- Sorry.
I was supposed to torture you.
- Sorry.
- Do you see it yet?
Close.
Another minute.
Your father and two uncles.
Each had pieces of the map.
The treasure, it's large, I take it.
Largest ever taken.
Spanish gold ship.
Sorry.
And a third uncle, he chases you.
An unusual family.
Success.
I've treated you cruel, haven't I?
You've had a lot on your mind.
And you did help me at the prison.
The tavern.
Let's say, between us, just for argument's sake that you have Mordachai's map.
- But I don't.
- No, I know that.
But pretend that you do.
I was willing to go halves with him and his.
I will do the same with you and yours.
You're saying that if I show you mine, you'll share yours with me?
Give me the map.
Give me a kiss first.
Sorry.
Map now.
You see, the thing is, I don't have it.
But that doesn't mean we can't keep talking about it.
Mr. Blair's respects, captain.
Talk to yourself.
Yes, Mr. Bowen?
The Reaper's five miles off and closing.
You should stay down.
Mr. Bowen, see that Mr. Shaw gets a change of clothes.
- He's beginning to stink.
- Aye, captain.
He has it.
She makes for Crooked Man's Passage.
Yes.
She hopes to tear up our bottom on the coral.
Looks like we're in for a blow.
Shall we attack her now?
No.
We'll go around the islands in the dark.
We'll ambush her on the other side at daybreak.
You are clever, Morgan, but I will catch you.
Uncle Dawg will have his day.
First Ainslee's chasing us, now your uncle is chasing us.
Now, everybody's chasing us.
I'm not so happy about this.
I mean, I'm using this piratical stuff to write a bestselling book.
I didn't wanna put myself in any physical danger.
Put a stow on that sail, Mr. Blair.
We don't wanna lose her.
- Break fast the foresail.
- Aye, sir.
Morgan, I cannot see the horizon.
There is a storm headed our way from the island.
- We'll hold this course.
- Aye.
Mr. Blair, put an extra man on the helm.
Coxswain, up helm.
Clear the scuppers.
"May cruel death leave victims immortal."
"M-C-D-L-V-I."
1456.
One, four, five, six.
Fourteen degrees latitude, five minutes, six seconds north.
There's nothing there.
No, you were right.
It's not on any chart.
Where did you have it hidden?
In the boat.
Under the seaty thing.
I knew you'd wind up here at some point.
That being the cheese and you being the rat.
Thing is, ma'am, I'm basically a shallow man.
And no doctor.
Am I wrong?
No, not really.
I'm surprised you let me fiddle with your hip.
- And no gentleman either.
- I wanted to be.
The thing is, I was born poor.
My only choice was to become a thief and a liar.
Then since you lie so easily, and since you are so shallow I shall lie you in a shallow grave.
- Mr. Blair.
- Have you no charity, ma'am?
I brim with charity, Mr. Shaw.
I am charity's very soul.
Success, Mr. Blair.
My slave has found Cutthroat Island.
Mark it on the chart.
And since I am so charitable I will maroon you on a rock the size of this table instead of splattering your brains across my bulkhead, as you deserve.
Let's take him below.
Going up.
- Pull the front line, mate.
Tie it down.
- Aye, aye, sir.
I found it, Mr. Glasspoole.
I've fixed the island.
I know where it is.
It lies through the storm.
- You risk the ship if you head for it.
- I risk Dawg if I turn back.
Shorten sail all you want, Mr. Blair.
We head straight through it.
Hold your course, men.
Have you ever seen anything like this?
Not so I'd remember.
I won't run.
Look how close we are.
The rig, Morgan.
It can't take it.
It can.
We've been through worse with Harry.
Have faith, Mr. Blair, and trust the ship.
We'll try it.
What is this?
I'll not die in this storm for your pleasure, Morgan.
Morgan.
There are too many of them.
Tom Scully, there's no great love between us, but don't do this.
Not this close.
Look.
There's the island.
It can't be more than two or three leagues off.
Away the longboat.
Clear the sweep!
At least give us a compass, Scully!
You'll have no need of a compass where you're going!
You're going nowhere but down!
Put your backs into it!
Morgan!
Take up the stroke.
Somebody grab that bastard!
No!
Get him!
Stop him!
Row hard, men, it's our one hope.
Put your backs into it, men!
Morgan!
Row!
Row hard, men!
- Reef, men, reef.
- White water ahead.
Row, men, row.
Bowen.
Bowen.
- Glasspoole, are you all right?
- Aye, Morgan.
- Bowen?
- Yes.
- Blair?
- Aye.
We've lost Hewitt and Ames.
Morgan.
Look.
Look!
The cliffs of blood.
It's Cutthroat.
It must be.
We are truly blessed.
We made it, Scully!
- We found it.
- We made it!
We found it.
We found Cutthroat Island.
We need to find this trail.
- Can you tell where it begins?
- Not without the third piece.
We'll make for the high ground, get our bearings.
Mr. Bowen, bring that lizard.
We'll have it for dinner.
Gentlemen, we must thank Mr. Scully for bringing us the chart.
But this piece is the only piece of the map that shows the treasure site.
My piece.
- The Reaper.
- And the Morning Star.
She still swims.
Dawg must have caught Scully when he bore up in the storm.
That scoundrel must have made a deal with Dawg.
He betrayed my crew.
No sign of Shaw.
Spread out.
Search the whole island.
Find me this cove, these cliffs.
I'll wait ashore.
Go!
He makes to go ashore.
We'll follow him, get the map and find the treasure.
Find me a suitable campsite.
- I'm grateful to you, Mr. Scully.
- My pleasure.
But if you ever are disloyal to me the way you were to Morgan it'll be my pleasure to cook you alive and eat you.
Now, get out of my eyes.
Morgan!
Morgan's here!
Bitch stole my map!
Find her, or you're all dead!
Shaw.
Spread out.
If he makes it out, we'll grab him.
Shaw.
I know you're out there, Morgan.
I can smell you.
Morgan!
Shaw, where are you?
Damn you.
Morgan.
Morgan.
- Where?
- Help.
There he is.
Wait.
You wanna be careful.
It's quicksand.
Did you get Dawg's map, you bastard?
Yes.
Hand it over or you're a dead man.
Did you think I might have taken it to give to you?
Not for a second.
Sinking up to your waist, and all you can do is lie.
Well, it's completely true.
I could no longer stand your opinion of me.
Then give it over.
I will, at once, with all my heart if you'd be so kind as to get me out first.
Do you think I was born last Wednesday?
Give it here, and then we will talk about rescue.
I of course see your point of view but it works better for me if I'm on the hard part of the land first.
You're up to your chest.
What if I give it to you and you leave me here?
It wasn't long ago you spoke of marooning me.
What if you swallow it or run away?
You're beyond trusting.
That's the problem with being a thief.
Nobody knows when you're telling the truth.
Give me the tip of your dagger.
- What for?
- Give it to me.
Don't argue.
There.
It's no valentine, but it will have to do.
Now you have it all and I have nothing.
I'm in your command, Morgan.
Do with me what you will.
Quickly.
Well good luck.
Morgan?
Oh, fish him out.
Hold tight.
That was quite a storm, wasn't it, boys?
Dawg...
Yes.
We need to get around these hills through this forest near the coast.
There is our treasure.
Well, shall we?
- What are the instructions from here?
- Seventy-five paces from this pillar.
- Twelve.
- Twelve.
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen.
- Fourteen.
- Fourteen.
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen.
- Sixteen.
- Sixteen.
- Seventeen.
- Seventeen.
- Eighteen.
- Eighteen.
- Nineteen.
- Nineteen.
- Twenty.
- Twenty.
Look.
- Seventy-five?
- That's what the map says.
- Well, you misread it.
- No.
It's very clear.
"Seventy-five paces from the rock pillar. "
Well, then the other 55 are out there.
Or...
Look.
That could be the other 55 paces.
We found a cave in the cliff.
Aye!
If they catch us here, they'll find Morgan.
We must leave.
Dead men tell no tales.
What does it say?
"Mouth of darkness, teeth of stone down the throat to the belly of gold guarded by those who never grew old. "
Well...
Watch your head here.
Here.
Don't do that.
Let's try this way.
But...
Down the throat to the belly of gold.
Hey.
Down the throat to the belly of gold.
Harry, I found it.
Guarded by those who never grew old.
And your grandfather was the only one that came back.
We're rich.
Rich!
We'd best get these out.
Dawg can't be far behind.
Right.
Fetch the others.
- I'll start hauling this to the entrance.
- Right.
Wait.
All right, I'm going.
But no tricks.
And hurry.
Blair?
Glasspoole?
Blair?
Morgan?
Anybody up there?
Morgan.
Lucky me.
We was looking all over for you.
That's your young friend from Spittlefield.
What have you got there?
Treasure.
Bags of it.
Be careful what you do.
You could lose a lot.
- Put a ball between his eyes.
- No.
No.
Go ahead.
It's about 4 million pounds.
No, wait.
That's a guess, but I can't be off by more than a million pounds or so.
Cut the rope, William.
Get away.
William, let's make a deal.
I can be reasonable.
Send Morgan down.
I'll send the treasure up and we'll both have what we want.
All right, William.
We have a deal.
Here she comes.
No!
I wish I'd never learned Latin.
Now we have both.
haul them in.
Don't watch me fall.
- I'm coming with you.
- Don't be mad.
Why?
Don't argue.
Let's agree upon something for once.
All right, ready.
On the count of three then?
Come to me, Morgan.
- One...
- Hey, one more thing.
- What?
- Considering everything I really think that from now on, we should be partners.
Full partners.
What do you say?
- Sixty-forty.
- Fifty-fifty.
- Full partners.
- Very well.
They have a lot to say to each other, don't they?
- Are you ready now?
- Ready.
One.
Two.
Now!
Love.
Who can explain it?
Come on, heave.
This is your future, men.
Heave.
Shaw.
Shaw.
Morgan.
- Have you seen Morgan?
- Yes, I did.
She helped me ashore.
- Then she sent me to find you.
- Thank God she's alive.
Where is she?
Where Dawg can't find her.
It's this way.
Follow me.
- How'd you get off Morgan's ship?
- Same as you, I jumped.
Fortunately, I'm an excellent swimmer.
- This seems rather far.
- It's just a few more feet.
Raise muskets.
Aim.
Mr. Shaw.
Splendid.
Before we hang you in Port royal you've time to witness an historic alliance.
Where's Morgan?
I don't think she made it.
Perhaps you were wondering how I come to be here.
A little bird told me.

All right, get him up.
- Come on, you.
- Come on.
There, sir.
Shaw.
Trotter.
Discretion dictates I should not load the treasure onto the British man-of-war.
I shall go back to Port royal with Captain Dawg.
- But, sir...
- Trotter you don't have much feel for these things.
- One day, perhaps.
- I hope so, sir.
- That's it.
- Trotter.
Got it.
Take a few of the men and follow in the other pirate ship.
I'll see you get a share of the money.
Little here, a little there.
It all adds up.
Yes, sir.
Now, sir, I shall go presently and write for your royal pardon.
Privateer for the Crown.
Sounds so much better than "pirate," don't you think?
Why do you let that preening swab live?
I study him.
When I become governor of Jamaica, I will need a certain style.
"Trotter. "
Lock them below with the others.
They hang at Port royal.
With pleasure, Your Honor.
Welcome aboard my ship, gentlemen.
I trust you'll find your quarters to my liking.
Come along now.
Hey, hey, hey.
- Come on.
- Below with you.
Get down there.
We'll weigh anchor.
Rouse the watch forward.
There we go.
Square away the breakers.
Stand by.
Push.
Morgan.
- I thought I to never see you again.
- Yes, Mr. Glasspoole, it's me.
What do you say, men?
Shall we take back our ship?
On your word, captain.
- Tackle's all right.
- Cover it up.
Mr. Coller.
I believe we can ease the main sheet a foot or two.
- Aye, captain.
- It'll draw better for it.
Are you a good swimmer, Mr. Scully?
Let's find out, shall we?
- Do you wish a compass, Scully?
- Take your closest friends with you.
There are islands close by.
I believe you can make it if you swim slowly.
I'll get you!
I'll be back, Morgan, if it's the last thing I do!
King Charles?
Ease your topsaiI.
King Charles?
Are you in there?
Well, you've seen what another captain's like.
Will you take my orders now?
Here you go.
Smile, Mr. Trotter.
Good, Trotter.
Good.
Give me some more shot here.
We'll edge towards them, Mr. Blair.
Not so fast to alarm him.
Two points to starboard, and keep her steady.
Two points starboard.
Keep her steady.
Trotter's closing on us.
Is that so?
Doubtless wants advice.
Poor fool can't tie his shoelaces without instruction.
Let's let him catch us.
I hope Mr. Shaw's still alive.
general quarters, Mr. Snelgrave.
Powder to the guns, but softly.
- What's going on?
- Do what I tell you.
Governor, oblige me.
Let me hang Mr. Shaw now from my yardarm.
- This minute?
- Yes.
Might be rather amusing.
One doesn't often get the chance to see a hanging at sea.
Come on, you.
Present arms.
It's a long drop.
- What is it?
- It's not good.
You best take a look.
William Shaw, you've been found guilty of piracy in the province of Jamaica.
By the authority of His Majesty the King, the penalty is death.
Pray, hangman, carry out the sentence.
He's testing us.
Prime your guns, men.
Are we prepared to fire, Mr. Snelgrave?
- Bloody hell.
- I knew it.
On command!
- Up ports.
- Cannons forward!
- Cannons ready.
- Cannons ready.
- Guns forward.
- Guns forward.
- Open fire.
- Fire!
- Fire!
- Fire!
Hoist our colors.
Mr. Blair, close in quickly now.
Fire!
- Fire!
- Fire!
Oh, my God.
Fire!
Blast them from the sea!
They want your treasure!
Will you let them take it?
Fire!
- On your way.
- Aye.
Knock them down!
Riflemen, prepare.
She means to board me.
Point her up.
Fire!
Sling your hooks!
Boarders aboard!
I love this.
I love it!
Who wants to die first?
Come on.
Kill them!
Kill them all!
Damn you.
They are so many, we are so few.
Keep fighting.
Hold them back as long as you can.
Where you go?
To blow out his bottom and get what we came for.
Separate the ships when I do.
Aye.
Die, Morgan, you sea witch!
Morgan has done it!
You, cut us loose!
I have no future in the army, sir.
William?
- What are you doing here?
- Not what you think.
There you are, Morgan.
Come to seek my treasure, have you?
Don't move.
I'll be right down to help you count it.
- Let's finish this.
- Come up!
Come up to uncle!
Forgive me.
I will come back.
- I promise.
- Morgan!
The whole ship's going to blow.
Morgan!
That boy doesn't understand us, Morgan.
But then, he's not family.
Come on.
- You cut me, niece.
- That was for Mordachai.
The next one is for Harry.
Be quick.
Undo my bonds.
Your father was nothing.
All my brothers were nothing.
You exceed them.
Think how far we could go together, Morgan.
You and me against the world.
Join me.
You don't have to die.
You do.
You've run out of world, Morgan.
William.
William, can you hear me?
Yes!
I'm coming for you, William.
Can you please hurry?
I'll give you this much, Morgan.
You're harder to kill than your father.
The odd thing is, I enjoyed it.
I never gave up.
Never gave in.
I regret it's finished.
Give my love to Harry when you see him.
It's over, Morgan.
You planning to fight me with that little stick?
No, uncle.
With this.
Bad Dawg.
William.
Quick, there's no time.
The ship's going to blow up.
Yes.
Go ahead.
Hurry.
It's too bad we'll have to leave all this behind.
Morgan!
- Yes.
- Hurry.
- There's no time for the treasure.
- Yes, let's hurry.
Hurry.
Quickly.
Here.
Up here.
Quickly, give me your hand.
Jump.
Look.
- They're alive.
- Morgan!
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
- You?
- Fine.
Just a little poorer.
Yeah, Morgan!
Blair.
Glasspoole!
Well, it doesn't matter.
I'm alive and you're alive and...
And we're alive together.
There'll be other treasures.
- Do you really feel that way?
- Absolutely.
Then I guess you don't want your share.
- That's a barrel.
- On this end.
- "On this end"?
- Yes.
A marker barrel.
But on the other...
This is yours, men.
Every last doubloon.
No one ever fought harder for anything.
Mr. Glasspoole will divide it into equal shares for us.
You're all rich men now.
And you're free to go your separate ways.
You could buy a little cottage in Bermuda and drink chamomile tea on the porch.
On the other hand, we could do what we were born to do:
Stay together and ride the early trades all the way to Madagascar the best pirating waters in the world.
Well, what do you say?
Shall we add to this pile here on the deck?
Mr. Glasspoole?
What say you?
It's just that it is such a large decision to make in such a small amount of time.
- Aye.
- Aye.
Mr. Blair?
Well, I'd like to, Morgan, but It's just...
I've always wanted to do a bit of farming.
Farming?
- To the captain!
- The captain!
- To the captain!
- To the captain!
- Where to, Morgan?
- I told you, Madagascar.
But that's in Africa.
Then we'd best get busy.
Mr. Trotter, take the crow's nest watch for the next 12 hours.
Good as done, ma'am.
Mr. Blair, prepare to come about.
Steer south-southeast.
Onto your stations, men.
Prepare to come about south-southeast.
Rewire ship.
And Mr. Shaw, I'd like to see you in my cabin immediately.
You're leaving?
But I thought you and I were forever?
I want you so badly.
- Morgan!
- But so does the Port Royal governor.
He will pay well for the capture of Morgan Adams, the pirate.
- You knew who I was?
- All along.
Morgan!
Where are you?
You are heartless, Lieutenant.
My apologies, senorita.
But you are right.
I thought it was much more amusing this way also... since I knew that you knew.
By the way, that won't work.
See?
I took your balls.
What happened?
Your father sent for you two days ago.
I know.
I was coming.
He did not know this.
He went looking for you.
That's when Dawg grabbed him.
Lord knows what he does with him.
I took this from our brother Richard last week.
Unwillingly.
That's his blood on the borders.
With your piece, all I need is Mordachai's.
You're out of luck.
I don't have it.
Where is it?
With Morgan?
I haven't seen her.
I think you lie, Harry.
I hid it.
Progress.
Where?
Up here.
I always thought there was nothing in your head.
Come back on board.
I'm going to split you wide open.
Mr. Snelgrave.
I'll see ya in hell.
Father!
- Father, I've got you!
- Let go!
Let go!
Hold onto me!
- Let go!
- Never!
No!
Father!
Father!
Someone get a grappling hook!
Launch the cutter.
Heave!
Oh, Lord, what did I do in my life to get you?
Dawg will pay for this, I swear.
You leave Dawg be.
I will fly his bloody head as my banner!
You'll leave Dawg well to leeward.
There will be time for him.
Find your Uncle Mordachai.
Take my crew.
Make them yours.
Father, don't talk now.
I'll get you back to the ship.
I'll not see my ship again.
The Morning Star is yours.
Don't say that.
I've patched you with worse.
Get your knife.
Shave my head.
- What?
- Shave my head.
For once in your life, Morgan... do as I tell you.
Lieutenant.
What is your name again?
Plopper?
Squinter?
Trotter, Your Excellency.
Miss Mandy Rickets is standing alone.
Her father brings a fortune in investments to the colony.
Dance with her.
She's rather homely, sir.
And you are not?
There you are.
You see?
Too late.
Some other fellow has taken the plunge.
There's every reason why I should be alone tonight... being a stranger here... but a woman with grace such as yours... should never be unattended.
My name is Shaw.
William Shaw.
But my friends call me Willy.
Do we know him, sir?
We do not.
Are you at leisure, Mr. Shaw, or do you follow a profession?
Most serious one, ma'am.
I'm a medical man, a doctor.
Oh, my!
I studied at Leyden, then higher anatomy with Dreyfuss at Leipzig.
With higher anatomy, you must know a great deal about the human body.
Indeed, madam.
Every bit of it.
All the ins and outs.
In medicine, it's our obligation to probe to the very bottom of things.
We must, in fact, explode ancient superstitions... shake truths violently from the body.
You, sir!
Forgive my rudeness.
Trotter's the name.
I'm with the regiment.
William Shaw.
Dr. Shaw, in fact.
Most happy.
What ship did you come in on, Doctor?
Was it the Bristol packet?
Bristol packet?
Bristol packet?
I believe that was it, although I can't be sure.
I'm all at sea when it comes to things nautical.
Very good.
No, the reason I asked... is the Bristol packet don't arrive until a week Wednesday.
That's him!
That man stole my diamond comb!
My pearls!
My pearl dangles!
My ruby necklace!
- Sergeant of the guard!
- Women!
Sergeant of the guard!
Good night, ladies!
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
His name's Shaw, sir.
I trust you'll enjoy life as a slave, Mr. Shaw.
Whoever you are.
That's good.
Tie it off!
Morgan, think of the freedom.
You can do anything you want now.
Come to London with me.
Come to London with me.
There are dukes there.
There are earls and parties.
It'll be fun.
Think of how much fun it'd be.
Besides, these men aren't gonna take orders from you.
They will!
Watch.
You there.
Stand to.
Hoist my pennant.
Bring it here.
Mutiny, will ya?
I was hoping to find you sober.
I was hoping to be passed out by now, Mr. Glasspoole.
Important things go on overhead.
Morgan, you should be there.
Men, Black Harry is gone.
I'm not one to speak ill of the dead... but for months he brought us nothing.
So now we can either sell this rotten bark and divvy up... or you can choose me captain.
I stand for captain.
My father wished it.
As he died, he gave me this.
He left it for all of you.
That's his bloody scalp.
It's a map to Cutthroat Island... the buried treasure of a Spanish gold ship.
More gold, jewels and plunder than you've ever dreamed of.
What does it say?
Aye.
It says--
You read it.
- I can't.
- Why not?
It's Latin.
Then I will have it translated at once.
There must be someone who knows Latin at Port Royal.
My Uncle Mordachai holds a second piece at Spittlefield.
There's more than one piece?
Actually, there are three.
- Where's the third?
- Dawg Brown has it.
Oh, well!
It's practically in our pocket.
We'll fight him for it.
We'll join with Mordachai.
Two ships against one.
You should like them odds.
Ask yourselves.
What would Harry have done?
This is our chance to seek some real fortune... and to pay back Dawg what we owe him.
What could be better than that?
Mr. Blair, you are quartermaster.
You decide.
Two days is all I need.
One to Port Royal, one to Spittlefield.
If Harry picked you, I'll give you a chance.
Let any man who would challenge me draw that.
I found him.
He's a prisoner inside.
He speaks Latin.
Good.
Let's break him out.
Unfortunately, Captain-
- I mean, ma'am, he's about to be sold as a slave.
A slave.
They're hanging the pirates.
They're gonna find you out.
You worry too much.
Don't I look right?
You look beautiful.
It's just that I'm the only person here who has the slightest inkling... of how to act like a gentleperson, so I have to go with you.
- Then you shall come.
- But, unfortunately, I can't.
I have pressing business with my bookseller.
- The fat man is right.
- I'll see you at Spittlefield.
You must be at your best behavior.
Then, gallant sir, escort me thither.
Turn around.
- You.
On your feet.
- Ask me politely.
You anticipate too much.
It's more like a fencing move.
Any fool can do it.
I hope you enjoy pain, slave.
Because I intend to buy you.
Good morning, madam.
As you can see, I'm young, in fine health.
I know horsemanship.
I write a fine hand.
I have it on authority that you are fluent in Latin.
Ah, Latin, the Romance language.
I can speak Latin like I was born in the ancient Senate.
A regular Cicero.
Why?
Do you have children who wish to learn?
I'd make a first-class teacher in a tasteful country house.
I can do most arithmetic, though I confess a weakness in long division.
Stop your chatter and say something Latinish.
What did you say?
You're a very beautiful woman.
I'd like to wash your feet.
You like to wash things, do you?
Start with your mouth.
Ten pounds?
Five pounds?
What?
No offers at all?
Take him away and hang him.
Next!
Please!
Don't hang me!
Next!
Lot 22!
A colonist.
A doctor.
Being of value, I start the bidding at five pounds.
- I bid five pounds.
- Five pounds, sir.
Go on.
Any advance on five pounds?
He's of good physique.
- Ten pounds.
- Ten pounds!
- Any advance on ten pounds?
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen pounds, sir.
- Twenty pounds.
- Twenty pounds is the bid.
- Sir, a word to the wise.
- Let the young lady win.
- You won't get one like this.
- Being a doctor, he's--
- Go away!
That one is mine.
- Twenty-five pounds.
- Twenty-five pounds, sir.
Good teeth.
- Thirty pounds!
- Thirty pounds!
Madam, I will have this man at any price.
If you are buying him purely for pleasure...
I will offer to do the same for you at no cost.
A doctor!
- Thirty-five pounds!
- Thirty-five pounds, sir.
A sensible choice, indeed.
Go on.
Captain, no!
Where's your sense of competition?
Come on!
Someone give me more than 35!
You, sir, you haven't bid.
Look at him.
Look at the quality.
And you, madam, another bid?
Any advance on 35.
I hope the lady is prepared to be a good loser.
What gave you the idea I was a lady?
Another bid, sir?
I see your lips moving.
Yes?
Are you trying to kill me, madam?
Yes, that's why I'm aiming where your brains are.
Now leave this place and go far away.
Don't retreat now, sir.
Where are you going?
- Don't surrender this opportunity.
- Forty pounds to end the bidding.
Sold to the lady with the monkey.
Take him away.
Go on!
Move!
Of course, I'm grateful, madam.
You picked a bargain.
I'm connected to all the great families of Europe.
- I have a natural pitch for music...
- Quiet!
and a perfect taste in wine.
Enemy to leeward, Captain.
Starboard as well, Captain.
Time to leave.
You draw them away.
We'll meet at Dingley Crossroads.
- Take King Charles.
Come on.
- Aye.
It's Morgan Adams!
She's at the auction!
Shoot to kill!
If I am in some way the cause of all this, I apologize at once.
Here.
Come here.
Hold on there.
Hold on tight.
Try to keep up with me.
I am not fond of heights!
Then let go!
Lieutenant Trotter!
What's going on?
Something with Mr. Shaw, I believe.
I'm in favor of exercise, but you owe me an explanation.
Come here.
Come on.
We have to climb down here.
Fast!
- Where'd they go?
- There!
Was that fast enough?
Come on!
Get the reins!
Grab them!
Come on!
Go!
Mr. Trotter!
That's my bloody carriage.
I'll have it back, if you please.
You, off.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, sir.
He won't get far.
Reload!
It's hard to imagine what part of your life would require Latin!
Reload!
- We've taken a passenger!
- Here!
You're hitting a woman!
Captain Perkins, sir!
- Yes?
- It's her!
Morgan Adams!
You're more active than other women I've known.
Morgan!
Watch your head!
Charge!
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Stop them!
I must visit that shop again when I have more time.
- Master gunner, fire at will.
- Run 'em up!
Fire!
A ship!
I find myself being fired upon by an entire ship!
Oh, my God.
You certainly left your mark on this town.
Hold on!
Whoa!
Trotter, do you want to spend the rest of your days on this poxy island?
- Who was that woman?
- Morgan Adams, sir.
You've 100 pounds on her head.
Black Harry's girl.
Well, well.
She's made a proper fool of me, hasn't she?
Two hundred pounds and a captaincy for you if you find her for me.
Sir!
- Any difficulties?
- Nothing unusual.
Here.
Step down into the carriage.
- Will you take the reins?
- Aye.
We should make Spittlefield by dark.
What is your name anyway, slave?
Shaw.
William Shaw.
Dr. Shaw, actually.
Slave, I'm about to show you something.
Reveal it to any other man, and you will wish you were back at Port Royal... with your head on the block and the ax in the air.
Thank you, but I've seen one before.
What is this?
A pigskin?
Translate what is written there.
Let's discuss terms first.
I do so, and you set me free.
That's tender.
It's about to become more tender.
They're backwards.
I assure you, ma'am, they're normal in every respect.
No, the words.
They're written backwards.
Look.
Can you see?
"Cliffs of blood." Bless me.
You're right.
You tell Mr. Squeakum's that I will send him a new chapter every month.
- Now, what's this all about?
- He's a great admirer of your books.
That makes me happy.
Which books has he read?
Did he mention?
His Excellency Governor Ainslee, John Reed, the author... currently the chronicler of piracy.
Step up, sir.
Always a pleasure to meet a literary man.
- I'd just as soon walk.
- I insist.
I can do that, you know.
"When the earth and all its people quake-
- Psalm, number 75.
My bones suffer mortal agony.
Number 42."
- And?
- That's all.
- No position?
No parallel?
- I swear it, ma'am.
That's all that's here.
Piracy, Mr. Reed, is the scourge of these plantations.
I, therefore, give rather large rewards for the capture of pirates... including Morgan Adams.
I don't know who she is.
Trotter tells me that you move throughout the pirate world... collecting your little tales.
Dangerous.
If by some chance you come across her, you might tell her on my behalf... that I offer her two alternatives.
One, an ignominious death on the gallows like these poor fellows here.
Please bear in mind that I could decide you're a pirate as well.
And the alternative?
She might cut me in for a share... of her grandfather's treasure... or she ends up as dinner for crows.
Pull up!
Good day, Mr. Reed.
Do you understand me, sir?
Here.
Here's a good one.
You blackguard!
Can you spare a little, lady?
Mordachai's up there, scared as a goose.
He's surrounded by guards, back to the wall, pistols out.
He's expecting Dawg.
If there are any of Dawg's men around, they will see you.
Mordachai's guards won't let you get close.
Wait a minute.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
How much?
- What?
- Come with me.
You stay put.
Where do you think you're going?
Tapster sent me.
Said the old turtle has his needs.
Shake her down.
- Sweetheart, all that costs money.
- I have money.
I promise.
I will take care of you later.
Follow me.
You too.
Captain, you in the mood for a whore?
Show her in.
Wait a minute.
I recognize you.
You're not a whore.
Call your men, and it's the last sound you make.
You're Harry's girl.
You always were trouble.
Blast ya.
What do you want here, eh?
I've brought my father's map.
You have the map?
- What about the Morning Star, the ship?
- She's mine.
Here.
Look what I'm doing.
Holy Virgin.
Harry's blessed head.
See?
Is that not fine?
That's handsome of ya.
Mighty handsome.
But with you here, you bet your life Dawg's around somewhere.
I'm not afraid of Dawg.
I'm half your age and nowhere near the sailor.
You shame me, lass.
I don't like that.
Then get up and fight!
Prove me wrong.
I've heard of Cutthroat Island.
I always thought it was a sailor's yarn.
Piles of skulls.
Reefs of sailors' drowned bones.
This treasure is ours.
Or would be... if you were an Adams.
There's no water in Adams blood.
I'll do it.
I'll join with ya.
Just like Harry, mine's well hid.
Unfinished business from the other night, Morgan.
Let her stand, Mr. Snelgrave.
Morgan, what a woman you've become.
I knew you'd bring him here, Morgan.
Blast ya!
Hello, brother Mordachai.
Morgan, in sweet memory... of bouncing you on my knee as a little girl...
I'm going to ask you just once for your daddy's piece of the map.
Would you settle for the point of my cutlass?
Somehow I knew you would say something like that.
And then we'd fall to oaths and threats.
Let's cut through the talk, shall we?
I have just the thing for you, little niece.
This says it all, Morgan.
Pain.
Viciousness.
Mutilation.
All the good things in life.
My coat of arms.
Ugly, slippery and foul smelling.
- It does say it all.
- Yes.
- And it looks like you.
- Thank you.
We stay close together.
We're family.
- Captain!
- Bowen!
Get back to the ship!
Bring the men!
You think you might unlock these now?
Given the circumstances.
I don't have the key here.
- Where is it?
- They never gave me one.
What?
The map.
Tell me where it is, or I'll run you through!
Hey!
You killed my brother!
I saw that, little niece.
I remember when you were a little girl.
Always flinched when you saw your Uncle Douglas, didn't ya?
Give me the map!
Where's the map?
Give me the map!
Sweetheart, I promised I'd take care of you.
- Very pretty, Mr. Shaw.
- Thank you, ma'am.
I had the good fortune to study with a grand master in Vienna.
Stop diddling and kill the man.
Kill him?
Bless me.
We never got to that.
I see.
Come on!
I believe you have something of mine, Mr. Shaw.
Ma'am, I don't know what you're talking about.
- Blair!
- This way, Morgan!
This does you no good on the ground, Mr. Bowen.
The numbers.
- What were the numbers?
- What numbers?
- The Psalms. - 11, 75 and 42.
I figured it out.
It's the longitude.
- We must leave now.
- It's the longitude.
- Back to the ship.
- Move!
Hurry!
Come along, men.
Congratulations, madam.
There's another town you've destroyed.
Get along lively!
Heave!
Heave!
You've been in a fight.
You all right?
It's just a scratch.
Somebody, cut off his chains.
Nice ship.
Why aren't I moving?
Did you hear me, Mr. Bishop?
I said, why aren't I moving?
- The anchors fouled, Captain.
- Cut it loose.
Aye, aye, sir.
Quickly.
We can't leave yet, Captain.
We haven't put enough food on board.
We need less mouths.
Does no one hear me on this ship?
I distinctly said... cut it loose!
75... 42... 11.
Keep her full!
Let me show you the chart.
The line I plotted runs here, through Crooked Man Keys.
Cutthroat can't be far off.
Look at the chart.
"Reef and coral heads."
Dawg outguns us, yes.
He's bigger.
But that means he's heavier, don't it?
He draws more water.
We lure him into the keys and run him aground on the coral heads.
We'll kill him there and take his map.
She has a wound.
We must get her below to the cabin.
It's festering.
That's why.
- Can you take the ball out?
- Hard to say.
Best I seal her side with this hot poker.
That's what we always do in such cases.
No offense, gentlemen, but given the circumstances... don't you think this calls for a professional?
It's all right.
Let him go.
He is a doctor.
I'll need surgeon's tools, hot water, sulfur and clean packing.
- Some rum might help her pain.
- Aye.
You as well, John.
- You clumsy swab!
- Sorry.
I was supposed to torture you.
Sorry.
- Do you see it yet?
- Close.
Another minute.
Your father and two uncles each had pieces of the map.
The treasure, it's large, I take it.
Largest ever taken.
Spanish gold ship.
Sorry.
And a third uncle, he chases you.
An unusual family.
Success.
I've treated you cruel, haven't I?
You've had a lot on your mind.
And you did help me at the prison.
The tavern.
Let's say, between us, just for argument's sake... that you have Mordachai's map.
But I don't.
No, I know that, but pretend that you do.
I was willing to go halves with him and his.
I will do the same with you and yours.
You're saying... that if I show you mine, you'll share yours with me?
Give me the map.
Give me a kiss first.
Sorry.
Map now.
You see, the thing is...
I don't have it.
But that doesn't mean we can't keep talking about it.
Mr. Blair's respects, Captain.
Talk to yourself.
Yes, Mr. Bowen?
The Reaper's five miles off and closing.
You should stay down.
Mr. Bowen, see that Mr. Shaw gets a change of clothes.
- He's beginning to stink.
- Aye, Captain.
He has it.
She makes for Crooked Man's Passage.
Yes.
She hopes to tear up our bottom on the coral.
Looks like we're in for a blow.
Shall we attack her now?
No.
We'll go around the islands in the dark.
We'll ambush her on the other side at daybreak.
You are clever, Morgan, but I will catch you.
Uncle Dawg will have his day.
First Ainslee's chasing us.
Now your uncle is chasing us.
Now, everybody's chasing us.
I'm not so happy about this.
I mean, I'm using this piratical stuff to write a best-selling book.
I didn't want to put myself in any physical danger.
Put a stow in that sail, Mr. Blair.
We don't want to lose her.
- Break fast the foresail!
- Aye, sir!
I cannot see the horizon.
There is a storm headed our way from the island.
- We'll hold this course.
- Aye.
- Put an extra man on the helm.
- Coxswain, up helm!
"May cruel death leave victims immortal."
M-C-D-L-V-l.
14-56.
1-4-5-6.
Fourteen degrees latitude... five minutes, six seconds north.
There's nothing there.
No, you were right.
It's not on any chart.
Where did you have it hidden?
In the boat, under the seaty thing.
I knew you'd wind up here at some point... that being the cheese and you being the rat.
The thing is, ma'am, I'm basically a shallow man.
And no doctor.
Am I wrong?
No, not really.
I'm surprised you let me fiddle with your hip.
And no gentleman either.
I wanted to be.
The thing is, I was born poor.
My only choice was to become a thief and a liar.
Then since you lie so easily and are so shallow...
I shall lie you in a shallow grave.
Mr. Blair!
Have you no charity, ma'am?
I brim with charity, Mr. Shaw.
I am charity's very soul.
Success, Mr. Blair.
My slave has found Cutthroat Island.
Mark it on the chart.
And since I am so charitable...
I will maroon you on a rock the size of this table... instead of splattering your brains across my bulkhead, as you deserve.
Let's take him below.
Pull!
Going up!
Pull the line, mate!
Tie it down!
Aye, aye, sir!
Tie it off!
Batten down the hatches!
Hold on!
I found it, Mr. Glasspoole!
I've fixed the island.
I know where it is.
It lies through the storm.
You risk the ship if you head for it.
I risk Dawg if I turn back.
Shorten sail all you want, Mr. Blair.
We head straight through it.
Hold your course, men!
Have you ever seen anything like this?
Not so I'd remember.
I won't run!
Look how close we are!
The rig, Morgan!
It can't take it!
It can !
We've been through worse with Harry.
Have faith, Mr. Blair!
Trust the ship!
We'll try it.
What is this?
I'll not die in a storm for your pleasure.
There are too many of them!
Tom Scully, there's no great love between us, but don't do this.
Not this close.
Look!
There's the island!
It can't be more than two or three leagues off.
Away the longboat.
Clear the sweep!
Give us a compass, Scully!
You'll have no need of a compass where you're going!
You're going nowhere but down!
Pull!
Put your backs into it!
Take up the stroke!
Somebody grab that bastard!
No!
Parkins!
Stop him!
Row hard!
It's our one hope!
Put your backs into it, men!
Pull!
Row hard, men!
Reef, men!
Reef!
White water ahead!
Row, men, row!
Bowen!
Bowen!
- Glasspoole, are you all right?
- Aye, Morgan.
- Bowen?
- Yes.
- Blair?
- Aye.
We've lost Hewitt and Ames.
Look!
Look!
The cliffs of blood!
It's Cutthroat!
It must be!
We are truly blessed.
We made it, Scully!
- We found it!
- We made it!
We found Cutthroat Island!
We need to find this trail.
- Can you tell where it begins?
- Not without the third piece.
We'll make for the high ground, get our bearings.
Mr. Bowen, bring that lizard.
We'll have it for dinner.
Gentlemen, we must thank Mr. Scully... for bringing us the chart.
But this piece is the only piece of the map... that shows the treasure site.
My piece.
- The Reaper.
- And the Morning Star.
She still swims.
Dawg must've caught Scully when he bore up in the storm.
That scoundrel must've made a deal with Dawg.
He betrayed my crew.
No sign of Shaw.
Spread out.
Search the whole island.
Find me this cove, these cliffs.
I'll wait ashore.
Go!
He makes to go ashore.
We'll follow him, get the map and find the treasure.
Find me a suitable campsite.
- I'm grateful to you, Mr. Scully.
- My pleasure.
But if you ever are disloyal to me the way you were to Morgan... it'll be my pleasure... to cook you alive and eat you.
Now get out of my eyes.
Morgan's here!
Bitch stole my map!
Find her, or you're all dead!
Spread out.
If he makes it out, we'll grab him.
I know you're out there, Morgan.
I can smell you.
Where are you?
Damn you.
- Where?
- Help.
There he is.
Wait.
You wanna be careful.
It's quicksand.
Did you get Dawg's map, you bastard?
Hand it over, or you're a dead man.
Did you ever think that I might've taken it to give to you?
Not for a second.
Sinking up to your waist, and still all you can do is lie.
It's completely true.
I could no longer stand your opinion of me.
- Then give it over.
- I will, with all my heart... if you'd get me out first.
Do you think I was born last Wednesday?
Give it here, and then we will talk about rescue.
I see your point of view... but it works better for me if I'm on hard land first.
You're up to your chest.
What if I give it to you and you leave me here?
You spoke not long ago of marooning me.
What if I pull you out and you swallow it or run away?
You're beyond trusting.
That's the problem with being a thief.
Nobody knows when you're telling the truth.
Give me the tip of your dagger.
What for?
Give it to me.
Don't argue.
There.
It's no Valentine, but it will have to do.
Now you have it all and I have nothing.
I'm in your command, Morgan.
Do with me what you will.
Quickly.
Well... good luck.
Fish him out.
Hold tight.
That was quite a storm, wasn't it, boys?
We need to get around these hills... through this forest near the coast.
There.
There's our treasure.
Well, shall we?
What are the instructions from here?
Seventy-five paces from this pillar.
- Twelve.
- Twelve?
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen?
Fourteen.
Fifteen.
Sixteen.
Seventeen.
Eighteen.
Nineteen.
- Twenty.
- Look!
- Seventy-five?
- That's what the map says.
- Well, you misread it.
- No, it's very clear.
"Seventy-five paces from the rock pillar."
- Then the other 55 are out there.
- Or...
Look!
That could be the other 55 paces.
We found a cave in the cliff!
Aye!
If they catch us here, they'll find Morgan.
We must leave.
Dead men tell no tales.
What does it say?
"Mouth of darkness, teeth of stone... down the throat to the belly of gold... guarded by those who never grew old."
Well.
Watch your head here.
Here.
Don't do that!
Let's try this way.
Uh, but--
Down the throat to the belly of gold!
Hey!
Down the throat to the belly of gold!
Harry, I found it.
"Guarded by those who never grew old."
And your grandfather was the only one that came back.
We're rich!
Rich!
We'd best get these out.
Dawg can't be far behind.
Fetch the others.
I'll start hauling this to the entrance.
Right.
Wait.
All right.
I'm going.
But no tricks.
And hurry.
Anybody up there?
Morgan!
Lucky me.
We were lookin' all over for you.
That's your young friend from Spittlefield.
- What have you got there?
- Treasure!
Bags of it!
Be careful what you do!
You could lose a lot!
Put a ball between his eyes.
Go ahead!
It's about four million pounds!
No, wait!
That's a guess, but I can't be off by more than a million pounds.
Cut the rope, William!
Get away!
William!
Let's make a deal.
I can be reasonable.
Send Morgan down!
I'll send the treasure up, and we'll both have what we want!
All right, William.
We have a deal.
Here she comes.
I wish I'd never learned Latin.
Now we have both.
Haul them in.
Don't watch me fall.
- I'm coming with you.
- Don't be mad.
Why?
Don't argue.
Let's agree upon something for once.
All right.
On the count of three, then?
Come to me, Morgan.
- One more thing.
- What?
Considering everything, I really think that from now on... we should be full partners.
What do you say?
- Sixty-forty.
- Fifty-fifty.
Full partners.
Very well.
They have a lot to say to each other, don't they?
- Are you ready now?
- Ready.
One.
Two.
Now!
Love.
Who can explain it?
Come on.
Heave!
This is your future, man.
Heave!
- Have you seen Morgan?
- Yes, I did.
She helped me ashore, then sent me to find you.
Thank God she's alive.
Where is she?
Where Dawg can't find her.
It's this way.
Follow me.
- How'd you get off Morgan's ship?
- Same as you, I jumped.
Fortunately, I'm an excellent swimmer.
- This seems rather far.
- It's just a few more feet.
Raise muskets!
Aim!
Splendid.
Before we hang you in Port Royal, you've time to witness... an historic alliance.
Where's Morgan?
I don't think she made it.
Perhaps you're wondering how I come to be here.
A little bird told me.
Plump pigeon.
Courtesy of Mr. Reed.
All right, get up!
All right, you.
Come on!
There, sir!
Trotter!
Discretion dictates that I shall not load the treasure... out of the British man-of-war.
I shall go back to Port Royal with Captain Dawg.
But, sir--
You don't have much feel for these things.
One day, perhaps.
I hope so, sir.
That's it!
Got it!
Take a few of the men and follow in the other pirate ship.
You'll get a share of the prize money-- a little here, a little there.
- It all adds up.
- Yes, sir!
Now, sir, I shall go presently... and write for your royal pardon.
Privateer for the Crown.
Sounds so much better than "pirate," don't you think?
Why do you let that preening swab live?
I study him.
When I become governor of Jamaica...
I will need a certain... style.
Trotter.
Lock them below with the others.
They hang at Port Royal.
With pleasure, Your Honor.
- Welcome aboard my ship, gentlemen.
- Move along!
I trust you'll find your quarters to my liking.
Move on!
Below with ya!
Let's get down there!
We'll weigh anchor.
Rouse the watch forward.
There we go.
Square away the breakers!
- Stand by!
- Come on now.
Push!
Let go the footing!
I thought I should never see you again.
Yes, Mr. Glasspoole, it's me.
What do you say?
Shall we take back our ship?
On your word, Captain.
Tackle's all right.
Cover it up.
The next one.
Mr. Coller!
I believe we can ease the main sheet a foot or two.
- Aye, sir!
- It'll draw better for it.
Are you a good swimmer, Mr. Scully?
Let's find out, shall we?
Do you wish a compass, Scully?
Take your closest friends with you!
There are islands close by!
You can make it if you swim slowly!
I'll get you!
I'll be back, Morgan, if it's the last thing I do!
King Charles?
Ease your topsail!
Are you in there?
Well, you've seen what another captain's like.
Will you take my orders now?
Smile, Mr. Trotter.
Good, Trotter.
Give me some more shot here.
We'll edge towards them, Mr. Blair.
Not so fast to alarm them.
Two points to starboard, and keep her steady.
Two points starboard.
Keep her steady.
Trotter's closing on us.
Is that so?
Doubtless wants advice.
Poor fool can't tie his shoelaces without instruction.
Let's let him catch us.
I hope Mr. Shaw's still alive.
General quarters, Mr. Snelgrave.
Powder to the guns, but softly.
What's going on?
Do what I tell you.
Governor.
Oblige me.
Let me hang Mr. Shaw now from my yardarm.
- This minute?
- Yes.
Might be rather amusing.
One doesn't often get the chance to see a hanging at sea.
Come on, you.
Present arms!
It's a long drop.
What is it?
It's not good.
Best take a look.
William Shaw, you've been found guilty... of piracy in the province of Jamaica.
By the authority of His Majesty the King... the penalty for piracy is death.
Pray, hangman, carry out the sentence!
He's testing us.
Prime your guns, men.
Are we prepared to fire, Mr. Snelgrave?
Bloody hell!
I knew it.
- On command!
- Up ports!
Cannons forward!
Cannons ready!
Guns forward!
- Open fire!
- Fire!
Fire!
Hoist our colors!
Mr. Blair, close it quickly now!
Fire!
Oh, my God.
Blast 'em from the sea!
They want your treasure!
Will you let 'em take it?
- On your way.
- Aye.
Knock 'em down!
Riflemen, prepare!
She means to board me!
Point her up!
Fire!
Sling your hooks!
Boarders aboard!
I love this.
I love it!
Who wants to die first?
Come on!
Kill 'em!
Kill 'em all!
Damn you!
They are so many.
We are so few!
Keep fighting.
Hold them back as long as you can.
Aye!
Where you go?
To blow out his bottom and get what we came for!
Separate the ships when I do!
Aye.
Die, Morgan, ya sea witch!
Morgan has done it!
You!
Cut us loose!
- What for?
- No future in the army, sir.
- What are you doing here?
- Not what you think.
There you are, Morgan!
Come to seek my treasure, have you?
Don't move.
I'll be right down to help you count it.
- Let's finish this.
- Come up to Uncle!
Forgive me.
I will come back.
- I promise.
- The whole ship's going to blow!
That boy doesn't understand us.
But then, he's not family.
Come on!
You cut me, niece.
That was for Mordachai.
The next one is for Harry.
Be quick!
Undo my bonds!
Your father was nothing!
All my brothers were nothing.
You exceed them.
Think how far we could go together.
You and me against the world.
Join me.
You don't have to die.
You do.
You've run out of world.
Can you hear me?
I'm coming for you.
Can you please hurry?
I'll give you this much.
You're harder to kill than your father.
The odd thing is, I enjoyed it.
I never gave up.
Never gave in.
I regret it's finished.
Give my love to Harry when you see him.
It's over, Morgan.
You planning to fight me with that little stick?
No, Uncle.
With this!
Bad Dawg!
Quick!
There's no time.
The ship's going to blow up.
Yes.
Go ahead.
Hurry!
It's too bad we'll have to leave all this behind.
Hurry!
There's no time for the treasure!
Yes!
Let's hurry!
Here!
Up here!
Quickly!
Give me your hand!
Jump.
Look!
They're alive!
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
You?
Fine.
Just a little poorer.
Well, it doesn't matter.
I'm alive, and you're alive and--
And we're alive together.
There will be other treasures.
Do you really feel that way?
Absolutely.
Then I guess you don't want your share.
- That's a barrel.
- On this end.
- On this end?
- Yes.
A marker barrel.
But on the other--
This is yours, men.
Every last doubloon.
No one ever fought harder for anything.
Mr. Glasspoole will divide it into equal shares for us.
You're all rich men now.
You're free to go your separate ways.
You could buy a little cottage in Bermuda... and drink camomile tea on the porch.
On the other hand, we could do what we were born to do.
Stay together and ride the early trades all the way to Madagascar... the best pirating waters in the world.
Well, what do you say?
Shall we add to this pile here on the deck?
Mr. Glasspoole, what say you?
It's just that it is such a large decision to make... in such a small amount of time.
Aye!
Mr. Blair?
I'd like to, but it's just--
I've always wanted to do a bit of farming.
Farming?
To the captain!
- Where to?
- I told you.
Madagascar.
But that's in Africa.
Then we'd best get busy.
Mr. Trotter, take the crow's nest watch for the next 12 hours.
Good as done, ma'am.
Mr. Blair, prepare to come about.
Steer south-southeast.
On to your stations, men.
Prepare to come about south-southeast.
And, Mr. Shaw.
I'd like to see you in my cabin immediately.
You're leaving?
But I thought you and I were forever?
I want you so badly.
- Morgan!
- But so does the Port Royal governor.
He will pay well for the capture of Morgan Adams, the pirate.
- You knew who I was?
- All along.
Morgan!
Where are you?
You are heartless, Lieutenant.
My apologies, senorita.
But you are right.
I thought it was much more amusing this way also... since I knew that you knew.
By the way, that won't work.
See?
I took your balls.
What happened?
Your father sent for you two days ago.
I know.
I was coming.
He did not know this.
He went looking for you.
That's when Dawg grabbed him.
Lord knows what he does with him.
I took this from our brother Richard last week.
Unwillingly.
That's his blood on the borders.
With your piece, all I need is Mordachai's.
You're out of luck.
I don't have it.
Where is it?
With Morgan?
I haven't seen her.
I think you lie, Harry.
I hid it.
Progress.
Where?
Up here.
I always thought there was nothing in your head.
Come back on board.
I'm going to split you wide open.
Mr. Snelgrave.
I'll see ya in hell.
Father!
- Father, I've got you!
- Let go!
Let go!
Hold onto me!
- Let go!
- Never!
No!
Father!
Father!
Someone get a grappling hook!
Launch the cutter.
Heave!
Oh, Lord, what did I do in my life to get you?
Dawg will pay for this, I swear.
You leave Dawg be.
I will fly his bloody head as my banner!
You'll leave Dawg well to leeward.
There will be time for him.
Find your Uncle Mordachai.
Take my crew.
Make them yours.
Father, don't talk now.
I'll get you back to the ship.
I'll not see my ship again.
The Morning Star is yours.
Don't say that.
I've patched you with worse.
Get your knife.
Shave my head.
- What?
- Shave my head.
For once in your life, Morgan... do as I tell you.
Lieutenant.
What is your name again?
Plopper?
Squinter?
Trotter, Your Excellency.
Miss Mandy Rickets is standing alone.
Her father brings a fortune in investments to the colony.
Dance with her.
She's rather homely, sir.
And you are not?
There you are.
You see?
Too late.
Some other fellow has taken the plunge.
There's every reason why I should be alone tonight... being a stranger here... but a woman with grace such as yours... should never be unattended.
My name is Shaw.
William Shaw.
But my friends call me Willy.
Do we know him, sir?
We do not.
Are you at leisure, Mr. Shaw, or do you follow a profession?
Most serious one, ma'am.
I'm a medical man, a doctor.
Oh, my!
I studied at Leyden, then higher anatomy with Dreyfuss at Leipzig.
With higher anatomy, you must know a great deal about the human body.
Indeed, madam.
Every bit of it.
All the ins and outs.
In medicine, it's our obligation to probe to the very bottom of things.
We must, in fact, explode ancient superstitions... shake truths violently from the body.
You, sir!
Forgive my rudeness.
Trotter's the name.
I'm with the regiment.
William Shaw.
Dr. Shaw, in fact.
Most happy.
What ship did you come in on, Doctor?
Was it the Bristol packet?
Bristol packet?
Bristol packet?
I believe that was it, although I can't be sure.
I'm all at sea when it comes to things nautical.
Very good.
No, the reason I asked... is the Bristol packet don't arrive until a week Wednesday.
That's him!
That man stole my diamond comb!
My pearls!
My pearl dangles!
My ruby necklace!
- Sergeant of the guard!
- Women!
Sergeant of the guard!
Good night, ladies!
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
His name's Shaw, sir.
I trust you'll enjoy life as a slave, Mr. Shaw.
Whoever you are.
That's good.
Tie it off!
Morgan, think of the freedom.
You can do anything you want now.
Come to London with me.
Come to London with me.
There are dukes there.
There are earls and parties.
It'll be fun.
Think of how much fun it'd be.
Besides, these men aren't gonna take orders from you.
They will!
Watch.
You there.
Stand to.
Hoist my pennant.
Bring it here.
Mutiny, will ya?
I was hoping to find you sober.
I was hoping to be passed out by now, Mr. Glasspoole.
Important things go on overhead.
Morgan, you should be there.
Men, Black Harry is gone.
I'm not one to speak ill of the dead... but for months he brought us nothing.
So now we can either sell this rotten bark and divvy up... or you can choose me captain.
I stand for captain.
My father wished it.
As he died, he gave me this.
He left it for all of you.
That's his bloody scalp.
It's a map to Cutthroat Island... the buried treasure of a Spanish gold ship.
More gold, jewels and plunder than you've ever dreamed of.
What does it say?
Aye.
It says--
You read it.
- I can't.
- Why not?
It's Latin.
Then I will have it translated at once.
There must be someone who knows Latin at Port Royal.
My Uncle Mordachai holds a second piece at Spittlefield.
There's more than one piece?
Actually, there are three.
- Where's the third?
- Dawg Brown has it.
Oh, well!
It's practically in our pocket.
We'll fight him for it.
We'll join with Mordachai.
Two ships against one.
You should like them odds.
Ask yourselves.
What would Harry have done?
This is our chance to seek some real fortune... and to pay back Dawg what we owe him.
What could be better than that?
Mr. Blair, you are quartermaster.
You decide.
Two days is all I need.
One to Port Royal, one to Spittlefield.
If Harry picked you, I'll give you a chance.
Let any man who would challenge me draw that.
I found him.
He's a prisoner inside.
He speaks Latin.
Good.
Let's break him out.
Unfortunately, Captain-
- I mean, ma'am, he's about to be sold as a slave.
A slave.
They're hanging the pirates.
They're gonna find you out.
You worry too much.
Don't I look right?
You look beautiful.
It's just that I'm the only person here who has the slightest inkling... of how to act like a gentleperson, so I have to go with you.
- Then you shall come.
- But, unfortunately, I can't.
I have pressing business with my bookseller.
- The fat man is right.
- I'll see you at Spittlefield.
You must be at your best behavior.
Then, gallant sir, escort me thither.
Turn around.
- You.
On your feet.
- Ask me politely.
You anticipate too much.
It's more like a fencing move.
Any fool can do it.
I hope you enjoy pain, slave.
Because I intend to buy you.
Good morning, madam.
As you can see, I'm young, in fine health.
I know horsemanship.
I write a fine hand.
I have it on authority that you are fluent in Latin.
Ah, Latin, the Romance language.
I can speak Latin like I was born in the ancient Senate.
A regular Cicero.
Why?
Do you have children who wish to learn?
I'd make a first-class teacher in a tasteful country house.
I can do most arithmetic, though I confess a weakness in long division.
Stop your chatter and say something Latinish.
What did you say?
You're a very beautiful woman.
I'd like to wash your feet.
You like to wash things, do you?
Start with your mouth.
Ten pounds?
Five pounds?
What?
No offers at all?
Take him away and hang him.
Next!
Please!
Don't hang me!
Next!
Lot 22!
A colonist.
A doctor.
Being of value, I start the bidding at five pounds.
- I bid five pounds.
- Five pounds, sir.
Go on.
Any advance on five pounds?
He's of good physique.
- Ten pounds.
- Ten pounds!
- Any advance on ten pounds?
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen pounds, sir.
- Twenty pounds.
- Twenty pounds is the bid.
- Sir, a word to the wise.
- Let the young lady win.
- You won't get one like this.
- Being a doctor, he's--
- Go away!
That one is mine.
- Twenty-five pounds.
- Twenty-five pounds, sir.
Good teeth.
- Thirty pounds!
- Thirty pounds!
Madam, I will have this man at any price.
If you are buying him purely for pleasure...
I will offer to do the same for you at no cost.
A doctor!
- Thirty-five pounds!
- Thirty-five pounds, sir.
A sensible choice, indeed.
Go on.
Captain, no!
Where's your sense of competition?
Come on!
Someone give me more than 35!
You, sir, you haven't bid.
Look at him.
Look at the quality.
And you, madam, another bid?
Any advance on 35.
I hope the lady is prepared to be a good loser.
What gave you the idea I was a lady?
Another bid, sir?
I see your lips moving.
Yes?
Are you trying to kill me, madam?
Yes, that's why I'm aiming where your brains are.
Now leave this place and go far away.
Don't retreat now, sir.
Where are you going?
- Don't surrender this opportunity.
- Forty pounds to end the bidding.
Sold to the lady with the monkey.
Take him away.
Go on!
Move!
Of course, I'm grateful, madam.
You picked a bargain.
I'm connected to all the great families of Europe.
- I have a natural pitch for music...
- Quiet!
and a perfect taste in wine.
Enemy to leeward, Captain.
Starboard as well, Captain.
Time to leave.
You draw them away.
We'll meet at Dingley Crossroads.
- Take King Charles.
Come on.
- Aye.
It's Morgan Adams!
She's at the auction!
Shoot to kill!
If I am in some way the cause of all this, I apologize at once.
Here.
Come here.
Hold on there.
Hold on tight.
Try to keep up with me.
I am not fond of heights!
Then let go!
Lieutenant Trotter!
What's going on?
Something with Mr. Shaw, I believe.
I'm in favor of exercise, but you owe me an explanation.
Come here.
Come on.
We have to climb down here.
Fast!
- Where'd they go?
- There!
Was that fast enough?
Come on!
Get the reins!
Grab them!
Come on!
Go!
Mr. Trotter!
That's my bloody carriage.
I'll have it back, if you please.
You, off.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, sir.
He won't get far.
Reload!
It's hard to imagine what part of your life would require Latin!
Reload!
- We've taken a passenger!
- Here!
You're hitting a woman!
Captain Perkins, sir!
- Yes?
- It's her!
Morgan Adams!
You're more active than other women I've known.
Morgan!
Watch your head!
Charge!
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Stop them!
I must visit that shop again when I have more time.
- Master gunner, fire at will.
- Run 'em up!
Fire!
A ship!
I find myself being fired upon by an entire ship!
Oh, my God.
You certainly left your mark on this town.
Hold on!
Whoa!
Trotter, do you want to spend the rest of your days on this poxy island?
- Who was that woman?
- Morgan Adams, sir.
You've 100 pounds on her head.
Black Harry's girl.
Well, well.
She's made a proper fool of me, hasn't she?
Two hundred pounds and a captaincy for you if you find her for me.
Sir!
- Any difficulties?
- Nothing unusual.
Here.
Step down into the carriage.
- Will you take the reins?
- Aye.
We should make Spittlefield by dark.
What is your name anyway, slave?
Shaw.
William Shaw.
Dr. Shaw, actually.
Slave, I'm about to show you something.
Reveal it to any other man, and you will wish you were back at Port Royal... with your head on the block and the ax in the air.
Thank you, but I've seen one before.
What is this?
A pigskin?
Translate what is written there.
Let's discuss terms first.
I do so, and you set me free.
That's tender.
It's about to become more tender.
They're backwards.
I assure you, ma'am, they're normal in every respect.
No, the words.
They're written backwards.
Look.
Can you see?
"Cliffs of blood." Bless me.
You're right.
You tell Mr. Squeakum's that I will send him a new chapter every month.
- Now, what's this all about?
- He's a great admirer of your books.
That makes me happy.
Which books has he read?
Did he mention?
His Excellency Governor Ainslee, John Reed, the author... currently the chronicler of piracy.
Step up, sir.
Always a pleasure to meet a literary man.
- I'd just as soon walk.
- I insist.
I can do that, you know.
"When the earth and all its people quake-
- Psalm, number 75.
My bones suffer mortal agony.
Number 42."
- And?
- That's all.
- No position?
No parallel?
- I swear it, ma'am.
That's all that's here.
Piracy, Mr. Reed, is the scourge of these plantations.
I, therefore, give rather large rewards for the capture of pirates... including Morgan Adams.
I don't know who she is.
Trotter tells me that you move throughout the pirate world... collecting your little tales.
Dangerous.
If by some chance you come across her, you might tell her on my behalf... that I offer her two alternatives.
One, an ignominious death on the gallows like these poor fellows here.
Please bear in mind that I could decide you're a pirate as well.
And the alternative?
She might cut me in for a share... of her grandfather's treasure... or she ends up as dinner for crows.
Pull up!
Good day, Mr. Reed.
Do you understand me, sir?
Here.
Here's a good one.
You blackguard!
Can you spare a little, lady?
Mordachai's up there, scared as a goose.
He's surrounded by guards, back to the wall, pistols out.
He's expecting Dawg.
If there are any of Dawg's men around, they will see you.
Mordachai's guards won't let you get close.
Wait a minute.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
How much?
- What?
- Come with me.
You stay put.
Where do you think you're going?
Tapster sent me.
Said the old turtle has his needs.
Shake her down.
- Sweetheart, all that costs money.
- I have money.
I promise.
I will take care of you later.
Follow me.
You too.
Captain, you in the mood for a whore?
Show her in.
Wait a minute.
I recognize you.
You're not a whore.
Call your men, and it's the last sound you make.
You're Harry's girl.
You always were trouble.
Blast ya.
What do you want here, eh?
I've brought my father's map.
You have the map?
- What about the Morning Star, the ship?
- She's mine.
Here.
Look what I'm doing.
Holy Virgin.
Harry's blessed head.
See?
Is that not fine?
That's handsome of ya.
Mighty handsome.
But with you here, you bet your life Dawg's around somewhere.
I'm not afraid of Dawg.
I'm half your age and nowhere near the sailor.
You shame me, lass.
I don't like that.
Then get up and fight!
Prove me wrong.
I've heard of Cutthroat Island.
I always thought it was a sailor's yarn.
Piles of skulls.
Reefs of sailors' drowned bones.
This treasure is ours.
Or would be... if you were an Adams.
There's no water in Adams blood.
I'll do it.
I'll join with ya.
Just like Harry, mine's well hid.
Unfinished business from the other night, Morgan.
Let her stand, Mr. Snelgrave.
Morgan, what a woman you've become.
I knew you'd bring him here, Morgan.
Blast ya!
Hello, brother Mordachai.
Morgan, in sweet memory... of bouncing you on my knee as a little girl...
I'm going to ask you just once for your daddy's piece of the map.
Would you settle for the point of my cutlass?
Somehow I knew you would say something like that.
And then we'd fall to oaths and threats.
Let's cut through the talk, shall we?
I have just the thing for you, little niece.
This says it all, Morgan.
Pain.
Viciousness.
Mutilation.
All the good things in life.
My coat of arms.
Ugly, slippery and foul smelling.
- It does say it all.
- Yes.
- And it looks like you.
- Thank you.
We stay close together.
We're family.
- Captain!
- Bowen!
Get back to the ship!
Bring the men!
You think you might unlock these now?
Given the circumstances.
I don't have the key here.
- Where is it?
- They never gave me one.
What?
The map.
Tell me where it is, or I'll run you through!
Hey!
You killed my brother!
I saw that, little niece.
I remember when you were a little girl.
Always flinched when you saw your Uncle Douglas, didn't ya?
Give me the map!
Where's the map?
Give me the map!
Sweetheart, I promised I'd take care of you.
- Very pretty, Mr. Shaw.
- Thank you, ma'am.
I had the good fortune to study with a grand master in Vienna.
Stop diddling and kill the man.
Kill him?
Bless me.
We never got to that.
I see.
Come on!
I believe you have something of mine, Mr. Shaw.
Ma'am, I don't know what you're talking about.
- Blair!
- This way, Morgan!
This does you no good on the ground, Mr. Bowen.
The numbers.
- What were the numbers?
- What numbers?
- The Psalms. - 11, 75 and 42.
I figured it out.
It's the longitude.
- We must leave now.
- It's the longitude.
- Back to the ship.
- Move!
Hurry!
Come along, men.
Congratulations, madam.
There's another town you've destroyed.
Get along lively!
Heave!
Heave!
You've been in a fight.
You all right?
It's just a scratch.
Somebody, cut off his chains.
Nice ship.
Why aren't I moving?
Did you hear me, Mr. Bishop?
I said, why aren't I moving?
- The anchors fouled, Captain.
- Cut it loose.
Aye, aye, sir.
Quickly.
We can't leave yet, Captain.
We haven't put enough food on board.
We need less mouths.
Does no one hear me on this ship?
I distinctly said... cut it loose!
75... 42... 11.
Keep her full!
Let me show you the chart.
The line I plotted runs here, through Crooked Man Keys.
Cutthroat can't be far off.
Look at the chart.
"Reef and coral heads."
Dawg outguns us, yes.
He's bigger.
But that means he's heavier, don't it?
He draws more water.
We lure him into the keys and run him aground on the coral heads.
We'll kill him there and take his map.
She has a wound.
We must get her below to the cabin.
It's festering.
That's why.
- Can you take the ball out?
- Hard to say.
Best I seal her side with this hot poker.
That's what we always do in such cases.
No offense, gentlemen, but given the circumstances... don't you think this calls for a professional?
It's all right.
Let him go.
He is a doctor.
I'll need surgeon's tools, hot water, sulfur and clean packing.
- Some rum might help her pain.
- Aye.
You as well, John.
- You clumsy swab!
- Sorry.
I was supposed to torture you.
Sorry.
- Do you see it yet?
- Close.
Another minute.
Your father and two uncles each had pieces of the map.
The treasure, it's large, I take it.
Largest ever taken.
Spanish gold ship.
Sorry.
And a third uncle, he chases you.
An unusual family.
Success.
I've treated you cruel, haven't I?
You've had a lot on your mind.
And you did help me at the prison.
The tavern.
Let's say, between us, just for argument's sake... that you have Mordachai's map.
But I don't.
No, I know that, but pretend that you do.
I was willing to go halves with him and his.
I will do the same with you and yours.
You're saying... that if I show you mine, you'll share yours with me?
Give me the map.
Give me a kiss first.
Sorry.
Map now.
You see, the thing is...
I don't have it.
But that doesn't mean we can't keep talking about it.
Mr. Blair's respects, Captain.
Talk to yourself.
Yes, Mr. Bowen?
The Reaper's five miles off and closing.
You should stay down.
Mr. Bowen, see that Mr. Shaw gets a change of clothes.
- He's beginning to stink.
- Aye, Captain.
He has it.
She makes for Crooked Man's Passage.
Yes.
She hopes to tear up our bottom on the coral.
Looks like we're in for a blow.
Shall we attack her now?
No.
We'll go around the islands in the dark.
We'll ambush her on the other side at daybreak.
You are clever, Morgan, but I will catch you.
Uncle Dawg will have his day.
First Ainslee's chasing us.
Now your uncle is chasing us.
Now, everybody's chasing us.
I'm not so happy about this.
I mean, I'm using this piratical stuff to write a best-selling book.
I didn't want to put myself in any physical danger.
Put a stow in that sail, Mr. Blair.
We don't want to lose her.
- Break fast the foresail!
- Aye, sir!
I cannot see the horizon.
There is a storm headed our way from the island.
- We'll hold this course.
- Aye.
- Put an extra man on the helm.
- Coxswain, up helm!
"May cruel death leave victims immortal."
M-C-D-L-V-l.
14-56.
1-4-5-6.
Fourteen degrees latitude... five minutes, six seconds north.
There's nothing there.
No, you were right.
It's not on any chart.
Where did you have it hidden?
In the boat, under the seaty thing.
I knew you'd wind up here at some point... that being the cheese and you being the rat.
The thing is, ma'am, I'm basically a shallow man.
And no doctor.
Am I wrong?
No, not really.
I'm surprised you let me fiddle with your hip.
And no gentleman either.
I wanted to be.
The thing is, I was born poor.
My only choice was to become a thief and a liar.
Then since you lie so easily and are so shallow...
I shall lie you in a shallow grave.
Mr. Blair!
Have you no charity, ma'am?
I brim with charity, Mr. Shaw.
I am charity's very soul.
Success, Mr. Blair.
My slave has found Cutthroat Island.
Mark it on the chart.
And since I am so charitable...
I will maroon you on a rock the size of this table... instead of splattering your brains across my bulkhead, as you deserve.
Let's take him below.
Pull!
Going up!
Pull the line, mate!
Tie it down!
Aye, aye, sir!
Tie it off!
Batten down the hatches!
Hold on!
I found it, Mr. Glasspoole!
I've fixed the island.
I know where it is.
It lies through the storm.
You risk the ship if you head for it.
I risk Dawg if I turn back.
Shorten sail all you want, Mr. Blair.
We head straight through it.
Hold your course, men!
Have you ever seen anything like this?
Not so I'd remember.
I won't run!
Look how close we are!
The rig, Morgan!
It can't take it!
It can !
We've been through worse with Harry.
Have faith, Mr. Blair!
Trust the ship!
We'll try it.
What is this?
I'll not die in a storm for your pleasure.
There are too many of them!
Tom Scully, there's no great love between us, but don't do this.
Not this close.
Look!
There's the island!
It can't be more than two or three leagues off.
Away the longboat.
Clear the sweep!
Give us a compass, Scully!
You'll have no need of a compass where you're going!
You're going nowhere but down!
Pull!
Put your backs into it!
Take up the stroke!
Somebody grab that bastard!
No!
Parkins!
Stop him!
Row hard!
It's our one hope!
Put your backs into it, men!
Pull!
Row hard, men!
Reef, men!
Reef!
White water ahead!
Row, men, row!
Bowen!
Bowen!
- Glasspoole, are you all right?
- Aye, Morgan.
- Bowen?
- Yes.
- Blair?
- Aye.
We've lost Hewitt and Ames.
Look!
Look!
The cliffs of blood!
It's Cutthroat!
It must be!
We are truly blessed.
We made it, Scully!
- We found it!
- We made it!
We found Cutthroat Island!
We need to find this trail.
- Can you tell where it begins?
- Not without the third piece.
We'll make for the high ground, get our bearings.
Mr. Bowen, bring that lizard.
We'll have it for dinner.
Gentlemen, we must thank Mr. Scully... for bringing us the chart.
But this piece is the only piece of the map... that shows the treasure site.
My piece.
- The Reaper.
- And the Morning Star.
She still swims.
Dawg must've caught Scully when he bore up in the storm.
That scoundrel must've made a deal with Dawg.
He betrayed my crew.
No sign of Shaw.
Spread out.
Search the whole island.
Find me this cove, these cliffs.
I'll wait ashore.
Go!
He makes to go ashore.
We'll follow him, get the map and find the treasure.
Find me a suitable campsite.
- I'm grateful to you, Mr. Scully.
- My pleasure.
But if you ever are disloyal to me the way you were to Morgan... it'll be my pleasure... to cook you alive and eat you.
Now get out of my eyes.
Morgan's here!
Bitch stole my map!
Find her, or you're all dead!
Spread out.
If he makes it out, we'll grab him.
I know you're out there, Morgan.
I can smell you.
Where are you?
Damn you.
- Where?
- Help.
There he is.
Wait.
You wanna be careful.
It's quicksand.
Did you get Dawg's map, you bastard?
Hand it over, or you're a dead man.
Did you ever think that I might've taken it to give to you?
Not for a second.
Sinking up to your waist, and still all you can do is lie.
It's completely true.
I could no longer stand your opinion of me.
- Then give it over.
- I will, with all my heart... if you'd get me out first.
Do you think I was born last Wednesday?
Give it here, and then we will talk about rescue.
I see your point of view... but it works better for me if I'm on hard land first.
You're up to your chest.
What if I give it to you and you leave me here?
You spoke not long ago of marooning me.
What if I pull you out and you swallow it or run away?
You're beyond trusting.
That's the problem with being a thief.
Nobody knows when you're telling the truth.
Give me the tip of your dagger.
What for?
Give it to me.
Don't argue.
There.
It's no Valentine, but it will have to do.
Now you have it all and I have nothing.
I'm in your command, Morgan.
Do with me what you will.
Quickly.
Well... good luck.
Fish him out.
Hold tight.
That was quite a storm, wasn't it, boys?
We need to get around these hills... through this forest near the coast.
There.
There's our treasure.
Well, shall we?
What are the instructions from here?
Seventy-five paces from this pillar.
- Twelve.
- Twelve?
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen?
Fourteen.
Fifteen.
Sixteen.
Seventeen.
Eighteen.
Nineteen.
- Twenty.
- Look!
- Seventy-five?
- That's what the map says.
- Well, you misread it.
- No, it's very clear.
"Seventy-five paces from the rock pillar."
- Then the other 55 are out there.
- Or...
Look!
That could be the other 55 paces.
We found a cave in the cliff!
Aye!
If they catch us here, they'll find Morgan.
We must leave.
Dead men tell no tales.
What does it say?
"Mouth of darkness, teeth of stone... down the throat to the belly of gold... guarded by those who never grew old."
Well.
Watch your head here.
Here.
Don't do that!
Let's try this way.
Uh, but--
Down the throat to the belly of gold!
Hey!
Down the throat to the belly of gold!
Harry, I found it.
"Guarded by those who never grew old."
And your grandfather was the only one that came back.
We're rich!
Rich!
We'd best get these out.
Dawg can't be far behind.
Fetch the others.
I'll start hauling this to the entrance.
Right.
Wait.
All right.
I'm going.
But no tricks.
And hurry.
Anybody up there?
Morgan!
Lucky me.
We were lookin' all over for you.
That's your young friend from Spittlefield.
- What have you got there?
- Treasure!
Bags of it!
Be careful what you do!
You could lose a lot!
Put a ball between his eyes.
Go ahead!
It's about four million pounds!
No, wait!
That's a guess, but I can't be off by more than a million pounds.
Cut the rope, William!
Get away!
William!
Let's make a deal.
I can be reasonable.
Send Morgan down!
I'll send the treasure up, and we'll both have what we want!
All right, William.
We have a deal.
Here she comes.
I wish I'd never learned Latin.
Now we have both.
Haul them in.
Don't watch me fall.
- I'm coming with you.
- Don't be mad.
Why?
Don't argue.
Let's agree upon something for once.
All right.
On the count of three, then?
Come to me, Morgan.
- One more thing.
- What?
Considering everything, I really think that from now on... we should be full partners.
What do you say?
- Sixty-forty.
- Fifty-fifty.
Full partners.
Very well.
They have a lot to say to each other, don't they?
- Are you ready now?
- Ready.
One.
Two.
Now!
Love.
Who can explain it?
Come on.
Heave!
This is your future, man.
Heave!
- Have you seen Morgan?
- Yes, I did.
She helped me ashore, then sent me to find you.
Thank God she's alive.
Where is she?
Where Dawg can't find her.
It's this way.
Follow me.
- How'd you get off Morgan's ship?
- Same as you, I jumped.
Fortunately, I'm an excellent swimmer.
- This seems rather far.
- It's just a few more feet.
Raise muskets!
Aim!
Splendid.
Before we hang you in Port Royal, you've time to witness... an historic alliance.
Where's Morgan?
I don't think she made it.
Perhaps you're wondering how I come to be here.
A little bird told me.
Plump pigeon.
Courtesy of Mr. Reed.
All right, get up!
All right, you.
Come on!
There, sir!
Trotter!
Discretion dictates that I shall not load the treasure... out of the British man-of-war.
I shall go back to Port Royal with Captain Dawg.
But, sir--
You don't have much feel for these things.
One day, perhaps.
I hope so, sir.
That's it!
Got it!
Take a few of the men and follow in the other pirate ship.
You'll get a share of the prize money-- a little here, a little there.
- It all adds up.
- Yes, sir!
Now, sir, I shall go presently... and write for your royal pardon.
Privateer for the Crown.
Sounds so much better than "pirate," don't you think?
Why do you let that preening swab live?
I study him.
When I become governor of Jamaica...
I will need a certain... style.
Trotter.
Lock them below with the others.
They hang at Port Royal.
With pleasure, Your Honor.
- Welcome aboard my ship, gentlemen.
- Move along!
I trust you'll find your quarters to my liking.
Move on!
Below with ya!
Let's get down there!
We'll weigh anchor.
Rouse the watch forward.
There we go.
Square away the breakers!
- Stand by!
- Come on now.
Push!
Let go the footing!
I thought I should never see you again.
Yes, Mr. Glasspoole, it's me.
What do you say?
Shall we take back our ship?
On your word, Captain.
Tackle's all right.
Cover it up.
The next one.
Mr. Coller!
I believe we can ease the main sheet a foot or two.
- Aye, sir!
- It'll draw better for it.
Are you a good swimmer, Mr. Scully?
Let's find out, shall we?
Do you wish a compass, Scully?
Take your closest friends with you!
There are islands close by!
You can make it if you swim slowly!
I'll get you!
I'll be back, Morgan, if it's the last thing I do!
King Charles?
Ease your topsail!
Are you in there?
Well, you've seen what another captain's like.
Will you take my orders now?
Smile, Mr. Trotter.
Good, Trotter.
Give me some more shot here.
We'll edge towards them, Mr. Blair.
Not so fast to alarm them.
Two points to starboard, and keep her steady.
Two points starboard.
Keep her steady.
Trotter's closing on us.
Is that so?
Doubtless wants advice.
Poor fool can't tie his shoelaces without instruction.
Let's let him catch us.
I hope Mr. Shaw's still alive.
General quarters, Mr. Snelgrave.
Powder to the guns, but softly.
What's going on?
Do what I tell you.
Governor.
Oblige me.
Let me hang Mr. Shaw now from my yardarm.
- This minute?
- Yes.
Might be rather amusing.
One doesn't often get the chance to see a hanging at sea.
Come on, you.
Present arms!
It's a long drop.
What is it?
It's not good.
Best take a look.
William Shaw, you've been found guilty... of piracy in the province of Jamaica.
By the authority of His Majesty the King... the penalty for piracy is death.
Pray, hangman, carry out the sentence!
He's testing us.
Prime your guns, men.
Are we prepared to fire, Mr. Snelgrave?
Bloody hell!
I knew it.
- On command!
- Up ports!
Cannons forward!
Cannons ready!
Guns forward!
- Open fire!
- Fire!
Fire!
Hoist our colors!
Mr. Blair, close it quickly now!
Fire!
Oh, my God.
Blast 'em from the sea!
They want your treasure!
Will you let 'em take it?
- On your way.
- Aye.
Knock 'em down!
Riflemen, prepare!
She means to board me!
Point her up!
Fire!
Sling your hooks!
Boarders aboard!
I love this.
I love it!
Who wants to die first?
Come on!
Kill 'em!
Kill 'em all!
Damn you!
They are so many.
We are so few!
Keep fighting.
Hold them back as long as you can.
Aye!
Where you go?
To blow out his bottom and get what we came for!
Separate the ships when I do!
Aye.
Die, Morgan, ya sea witch!
Morgan has done it!
You!
Cut us loose!
- What for?
- No future in the army, sir.
- What are you doing here?
- Not what you think.
There you are, Morgan!
Come to seek my treasure, have you?
Don't move.
I'll be right down to help you count it.
- Let's finish this.
- Come up to Uncle!
Forgive me.
I will come back.
- I promise.
- The whole ship's going to blow!
That boy doesn't understand us.
But then, he's not family.
Come on!
You cut me, niece.
That was for Mordachai.
The next one is for Harry.
Be quick!
Undo my bonds!
Your father was nothing!
All my brothers were nothing.
You exceed them.
Think how far we could go together.
You and me against the world.
Join me.
You don't have to die.
You do.
You've run out of world.
Can you hear me?
I'm coming for you.
Can you please hurry?
I'll give you this much.
You're harder to kill than your father.
The odd thing is, I enjoyed it.
I never gave up.
Never gave in.
I regret it's finished.
Give my love to Harry when you see him.
It's over, Morgan.
You planning to fight me with that little stick?
No, Uncle.
With this!
Bad Dawg!
Quick!
There's no time.
The ship's going to blow up.
Yes.
Go ahead.
Hurry!
It's too bad we'll have to leave all this behind.
Hurry!
There's no time for the treasure!
Yes!
Let's hurry!
Here!
Up here!
Quickly!
Give me your hand!
Jump.
Look!
They're alive!
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
You?
Fine.
Just a little poorer.
Well, it doesn't matter.
I'm alive, and you're alive and--
And we're alive together.
There will be other treasures.
Do you really feel that way?
Absolutely.
Then I guess you don't want your share.
- That's a barrel.
- On this end.
- On this end?
- Yes.
A marker barrel.
But on the other--
This is yours, men.
Every last doubloon.
No one ever fought harder for anything.
Mr. Glasspoole will divide it into equal shares for us.
You're all rich men now.
You're free to go your separate ways.
You could buy a little cottage in Bermuda... and drink camomile tea on the porch.
On the other hand, we could do what we were born to do.
Stay together and ride the early trades all the way to Madagascar... the best pirating waters in the world.
Well, what do you say?
Shall we add to this pile here on the deck?
Mr. Glasspoole, what say you?
It's just that it is such a large decision to make... in such a small amount of time.
Aye!
Mr. Blair?
I'd like to, but it's just--
I've always wanted to do a bit of farming.
Farming?
To the captain!
- Where to?
- I told you.
Madagascar.
But that's in Africa.
Then we'd best get busy.
Mr. Trotter, take the crow's nest watch for the next 12 hours.
Good as done, ma'am.
Mr. Blair, prepare to come about.
Steer south-southeast.
On to your stations, men.
Prepare to come about south-southeast.
And, Mr. Shaw.
I'd like to see you in my cabin immediately.
You're leaving?
But I thought you and I were forever, huh?
- I want you so badly.
- Morgan!
But then, so does the governor of Port Royal.
- Morgan!
- And he will pay well for the capture of Morgan Adams the pirate.
- You knew who I was?
- All along.
Morgan!
Where are you?
You are heartless, lieutenant.
My apologies, señorita.
But you are right.
I thought it was much more amusing this way also since I knew that you knew.
By the way, that won't work.
See?
I took your balls.
- What happened?
- Your father sent for you two days ago.
I know.
I was coming.
He did not know this.
He went looking for you.
And that's when Dawg grabbed him.
Lord knows what he does with him.
I took this from our brother Richard last week unwillingly.
That's his blood on the borders.
With your piece, all I need is Mordachai's.
Well, you're out of luck.
I don't...
I don't have it.
Where is it?
With Morgan?
I haven't seen her.
I think you lie, Harry.
- I hid it.
- Progress.
Where?
Up here.
I always thought there was nothing in your head, Harry.
Come back onboard.
I'm gonna split you wide open.
Mr. Snelgrave.
I'll see you in hell.
Father!
- Father, I've got you.
- Let go.
Let go.
- Hold onto me.
- Bring them in.
- Let go.
- Never.
Morgan.
I got one.
No, Father!
Someone get a grappling hook.
Launch the cutter.
Heave.
Oh, Lord, what did I do in my life to get you?
- Dawg will pay for this, I swear.
- You leave Dawg be.
I will fly his bloody head as my banner.
You'll leave Dawg well to leeward.
There'll be time for him.
Find your uncle Mordachai.
Take my crew.
Make them yours.
Father, don't talk now.
I'll get you back to the ship.
I'll not see my ship again.
The Morning Star is yours.
No, don't say that.
I've patched you with worse.
Get your knife.
Shave my head.
What?
Shave my head.
For once in your life, Morgan, do as I tell you.
Lieutenant.
What is your name again?
Plopper?
Squinter?
Trotter, Your Excellency.
Miss Mandy Rickets is standing alone.
Her father brings a fortune in investments to the colony.
Dance with her.
She's rather homely, sir.
And you are not?
There you are.
You see?
Too late.
Some fellow has taken the plunge.
There's every reason why I should be alone tonight being a stranger here.
But a woman with grace such as yours should never be unattended.
My name is Shaw.
William Shaw.
But my friends call me Willy.
Do we know him, sir?
We do not.
Are you at leisure, Mr. Shaw?
Do you follow a profession?
A most serious one, ma'am.
I'm a medical man, a doctor.
Oh, my.
I studied at Leiden then higher anatomy with Dreyfuss at Leipzig.
With higher anatomy, you must know a great deal about the human body.
Indeed, madame.
Every bit of it.
All the ins and outs.
In medicine, it's our obligation to probe to the very bottom of things.
We must, in fact, explode ancient superstitions.
Shake truths violently from the body.
You, sir.
Forgive my rudeness.
Trotter's the name.
I'm with the regiment.
William Shaw.
Dr. Shaw, in fact.
Most happy.
What ship did you come in on, doctor?
Was it the Bristol Packet?
Bristol packet, Bristol packet.
I believe that was it, although I can't be sure.
I'm all at sea when it comes to things nautical.
Very good.
No, the reason I asked is the Bristol Packet don't arrive until a week Wednesday.
That's him.
That man stole my diamond comb.
My pearls.
My pearl dangle.
- My ruby.
My ruby necklace.
- Sergeant of the guards!
Women.
Sergeant of the guards.
Guard.
Good night, ladies.
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
His name's Shaw, sir.
I trust you'll enjoy life as a slave, Mr. Shaw.
Whoever you are.
That's good.
Tie it off.
Morgan, think of the freedom.
You can do anything you want now.
Come to London with me.
There's dukes there.
There's earls and parties.
It'd be fun.
Think of how much fun it'd be.
Besides, these men aren't gonna take orders from you.
They will.
Watch.
You there.
Stand to.
Hoist my pennant.
Bring it here.
Oh, mutiny, will you?
Morgan.
I was hoping to find you sober.
I was hoping to be passed out by now, Mr. Glasspoole.
Important things go on overhead.
Morgan, you should be there.
Men, Black Harry is gone and I'm not one to speak ill of the dead.
But for months, he brought us nothing.
So now we can either sell this rotten bark and divvy up or you can choose me captain.
I stand for captain.
My father wished it.
As he died, he gave me this.
He left it for all of you.
That's his bloody scalp.
It's a map to Cutthroat Island.
The buried treasure of a Spanish gold ship.
More gold, jewels and plunder than you've ever dreamed of.
What does it say?
Aye.
It says....
You read it.
- I can't.
- Why not?
It's Latin.
Then I will have it translated at once.
There must be someone who knows Latin at Port Royal.
My uncle Mordachai holds a second piece at Spittlefield.
There's more than one piece?
Actually, there are three.
Where's the third?
Dawg Brown has it.
Oh, well, it's practically in our pocket.
We'll fight him for it.
We'll join with Mordachai.
Two ships against one.
You should like them odds.
Ask yourselves, "What would Harry have done?"
This is our chance to seek some real fortune and to pay back Dawg what we owe him.
What could be better than that?
Mr. Blair, you are quartermaster.
You decide.
Two days is all I need.
One to Port Royal, one to Spittlefield.
If Harry picked you, I'll give you a chance.
Let any man who would challenge me draw that.
I found him.
He's a prisoner inside.
He speaks Latin.
Good, let's break him out.
Unfortunately, captain...
I mean, ma'am.
...he's about to be sold as a slave.
A slave?
They're hanging the pirates.
They're gonna find you out.
Oh, you worry too much.
- Don't I look right?
- You look beautiful.
It's just I'm the only person who has the slightest inkling of how to act like a gentleperson.
- So I have to go with you.
- Excellent.
Then you shall come.
But unfortunately I can't.
I have some pressing business with my bookseller.
- The fat man is right.
- I'll see you at Spittlefield.
You must be at your best behavior.
Then, gallant sir, escort me thither.
Come on, will you?
Turn around.
- You, on your feet.
- Ask me politely.
You anticipate too much.
It's more like a fencing move.
Any fool can do it.
I hope you enjoy pain, slave.
Because I intend to buy you.
Good morning, madame.
As you can see, I'm young, in fine health.
I know horsemanship.
I write a fine hand.
I have it on authority that you are fluent in Latin.
Latin, the romance language.
I can speak Latin like I was born in the ancient senate.
A regular Cicero.
Why, do you have children who wish to learn?
I'd make a first-class teacher in a tasteful house.
I can do most arithmetic, though I do confess a weakness in long division.
Stop your chatter and say something Latinish.
What did you say?
You're a very beautiful woman.
I'd like to wash your feet.
You like to wash things, do you?
Start with your mouth.
Ten pounds?
Five pounds?
What, no offers at all?
Take him away and hang him.
No!
No!
Please, don't hang me!
Next.
Lot 22.
A colonist, a doctor.
Being of value, I start the bidding at 5 pounds.
I bid 5 pounds.
Five pounds, sir.
Come on, any advance on 5 pounds?
As you can see, he's of good physique.
- Ten pounds.
- Ten pounds.
Ten pounds?
Any advance on 10 pounds?
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen pounds, sir.
- Twenty pounds.
- Twenty pounds.
- Twenty pounds is the bid.
- Sir, a word to the wise.
- Let the young lady win.
- You won't get one like this.
- Being a doctor, he's...
- Go away.
That one is mine.
- Twenty-five pounds.
- Twenty-five pounds, sir.
- Good teeth.
- Thirty pounds.
- Thirty pounds.
- Madame I will have this man at any price.
If you are buying him purely for pleasure I will offer to do the same for you at no cost.
- Thirty-five pounds.
- Thirty-five pounds, sir.
A sensible choice indeed.
- Come on.
- Captain, no.
Where's your sense of competition?
Come on, someone will give me more than 35.
You, sir.
You haven't bid.
Look at him.
Look at the quality.
And you, madam, at the side here.
Another bid in the advance of 35?
I hope the lady is prepared to be a good loser.
What gave you the idea I was a lady?
Another bid, sir?
I see your lips moving.
Yes?
- Are you trying to kill me?
- Yes.
That's why I'm aiming where your brains are.
Now, leave this place and go far away.
Don't retreat now, sir.
Where are you going?
- Don't surrender this opportunity.
- Forty pounds to end the bidding.
Sold to the lady with the monkey.
Take him away.
- Come on.
- Move.
Of course, I'm grateful, madame, but I must admit you picked a bargain.
I'm connected to all the great families of Europe.
I have a natural pitch for music...
- Quiet.
- ...and a perfect taste in wine.
Enemy to leeward, captain.
- Starboard as well, captain.
- Keep moving.
Time to leave.
You draw them away.
We'll meet at Dingley crossroads.
- Take King Charles.
- Aye.
Come on.
It's Morgan Adams.
She's at the auction.
Shoot to kill.
If I am in some way the cause of all this, I apologize at once.
Here, come here.
Hold on there.
Hold on tight.
And try to keep up with me.
I am not fond of heights.
Then let go.
Lieutenant Trotter.
What's going on?
Something with Mr. Shaw, I believe.
I'm in favor of exercise, but you owe me an explanation.
Come here.
Come on.
We have to climb down here.
Fast.
- Where'd they go?
- Hurry up there.
Was that fast enough?
Come on.
Get the reins.
Grab them.
Come on.
Mr. Trotter.
That's my bloody carriage.
I'll have it back, if you please.
You, off.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, sir.
It won't get far.
Reload.
It's hard to imagine what part of your life...
- ...would require me to speak Latin.
- Reload.
- We've taken a passenger.
- Here.
You're hitting a woman!
Captain Perkins, sir.
- Captain Perkins, sir.
- Yes?
It's her.
Morgan Adams.
You're more active than other women I've known.
Morgan!
Watch your head!
Morgan!
Charge!
Excuse me.
Stop them!
I must visit that shop again when I have more time.
Master gunner, fire at will.
Run them up.
Fire!
A ship.
I find myself being fired upon by an entire ship.
Oh, my God.
You certainly left your mark on this town.
Hold on.
Trotter, do you want to spend the rest of your days on this poxy island?
- Who was that woman?
- Morgan Adams, sir.
You've a hundred pounds on her head.
Black Harry's girl.
Well, well.
Well, she's made a proper fool of me, hasn't she?
Two hundred pounds and a captaincy for you if you find her for me.
Sir.
- Any difficulties?
- Nothing unusual.
Here, step down into the carriage.
Will you take the reins, Mr. Glasspoole?
We should make Spittlefield by dark.
What is your name anyway, slave?
Shaw.
William Shaw.
Dr. Shaw, actually.
Slave, I'm about to show you something.
Reveal it to any other man and you will wish you were back at Port Royal with your head on the block and the ax in the air.
Thank you, but I've seen one before.
What is this, a pigskin?
Translate what is written there.
Let's discuss terms first.
I do so and you set me free.
That's tender.
It's about to become more tender.
They're backwards.
I assure you, they're normal in every respect.
No, the words.
They're written backwards.
Look.
Can you see?
"Cliffs of blood."
Bless me.
You're right.
No, no.
You tell Mr. Squeakums that I will send him a new chapter every month.
- Now, what's this all about?
- He's a great admirer of your books.
That makes me happy.
Which books has he read?
Did he mention, or...?
His Excellency Governor Ainslee, John Reed, the author.
- Currently the chronicler of piracy.
- Step up, sir.
Always a pleasure to meet a literary man.
- Oh, I'd just as soon walk.
- Oh, I insist.
I can do that, you know.
"When the earth and all its people quake psalm number 75, my bones suffer mortal agony...
- ...number 42."
- And?
- That's all.
- No.
No position?
No parallel?
I swear it, ma'am.
That's all that's here.
Piracy, Mr. Reed, is the scourge of these plantations.
I therefore give rather large rewards for the capture of pirates including Morgan Adams.
I don't know who she is.
Trotter tells me that you move throughout the pirate world collecting your little tales.
Dangerous.
If by some chance you come across her you might tell her on my behalf that I offer her two alternatives.
One, an ignominious death on the gallows like these poor fellows here.
Please bear in mind that I could decide that you're a pirate as well.
And the alternative?
She might cut me in for a share of her grandfather's treasure.
Or she ends up as dinner for crows.
Pull up.
Good day, Mr. Reed.
Do you understand me, sir?
Yeah.
There's a good one.
You vagabond.
Could you spare a little, lady?
Mordachai's up there scared as a goose.
He's surrounded by guards, back to the wall, pistols out.
He's expecting Dawg.
If there are any of Dawg's men around, they will see you.
Mordachai's guards won't let you get close.
Wait a minute.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
- How much?
- What?
Come with me.
You stay put.
- Where do you think you're going?
- Tapster sent me.
Said the old turtle has his needs.
Shake her down.
Hey, sweetheart.
All that costs money.
- I have money.
- Well, I promise.
I will take care of you later.
Follow me.
You too.
Captain, you in the mood for a whore?
Show her in.
Wait a minute.
I recognize you.
You're not a whore.
Call your men and it's the last sound you make.
You're Harry's girl.
Yeah.
You always was trouble, blast you.
What do you want here, eh?
- I've brought my father's map.
- You have the map?
What about the Morning Star, the ship?
She's mine.
Here.
Look what I'm doing.
Holy virgin.
Harry's blessed head.
See?
Is that not fine?
That's handsome of you, mighty handsome.
But with you here, you bet your life Dawg's around somewhere.
I'm not afraid of Dawg, and I'm half your age and nowhere near the sailor.
You shame me, lass.
- I don't like that.
- Then get up and fight.
- Prove me wrong.
- I've heard of Cutthroat Island.
I always thought it was a sailor's yarn.
Piles of skulls, reefs of sailors' drowned bones.
This treasure is ours.
Or would be if you were an Adams.
There's no water in Adams' blood.
I'll do it.
I'll join with you.
Just like Harry, mine's well hid.
Unfinished business from the other night, Morgan.
Let her stand, Mr. Snelgrave.
Morgan.
What a woman you've become.
I knew you'd bring him here, Morgan.
Blast you.
Hello, brother Mordachai.
Morgan in sweet memory of bouncing you on my knee as a little girl I'm gonna ask you just once for your daddy's piece of the map.
Would you settle for the point of my cutlass?
Somehow I knew you would say something like that.
And then we'd fall to oaths and threats.
Well, let's cut through the talk, shall we?
I have just the thing for you, little niece.
This says it all, Morgan.
Pain, viciousness, mutilation.
All the good things in life.
My coat of arms.
Ugly, slippery and foul-smelling.
It does say it all.
- Yes.
- And it looks like you.
Thank you.
We stay close together.
We're family.
- Captain.
- Bowen, get back to the ship.
Bring the men.
Morgan.
Do you think you might unlock these now?
Given the circumstances.
- I don't have the key here.
- Where is it?
- They never gave me one.
- What?
The map.
Tell me where it is or I'll run you through.
Hey.
You killed my brother.
I saw that, little niece.
I remember when you were a little girl.
Always flinched when you saw your uncle Douglas, didn't you?
Give me the map.
Give me the map.
Where's the map?
Give me the map!
Sweetheart, I promised I'd take care of you.
- Very pretty, Mr. Shaw.
- Thank you, ma'am.
I had the good fortune to study with a grand master in Vienna.
- Glasspoole.
- Aye.
Now stop diddling and kill the man.
Kill him?
Bless me.
We never got to that.
I see.
Come on.
I believe you have something of mine.
Ma'am, I don't know what you're talking about.
There she is.
- Blair.
- This way, Morgan.
This does you no good on the ground, Mr. Bowen.
The numbers.
What were the numbers?
- What numbers?
- The psalms.
Eleven, 75 and 42.
I figured it out.
It's the longitude.
- We must leave now.
- It's the longitude.
- Back to the ship.
- Move.
Hurry.
- Come along, men.
- Congratulations, madam.
There's another town you've destroyed.
Get along lively.
Heave.
You've been in a fight.
Are you all right?
It's just a scratch.
Somebody cut off his chains.
Nice ship.
Why aren't I moving?
Did you hear me, Mr. Bishop?
I said why aren't I moving?
- The anchor's fouled.
- Cut it loose.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Quickly.
We can't leave yet, captain.
We haven't put enough food onboard.
We need less mouths.
Does no one hear me on this ship?
I distinctly said cut it loose!
Seventy-five.
Forty-two.
Eleven.
Keep her full.
Let me show you the chart.
The line I plotted runs here through Crooked Man Keys.
Cutthroat can't be far off.
Look at the chart.
"Reef and coral heads."
Dawg outguns us, yes.
He's bigger.
But that means he's heavier, don't it?
He draws more water.
We lure him into the keys and run him aground on the coral heads.
- We'll kill him there and take his map.
- Aye.
She has a wound.
We must get her below to the cabin.
- It's festering, that's why.
- Can you take the ball out?
Hard to say.
Best I seal her side with this hot poker.
That's what we always do in such cases.
No offense, gentlemen, but given the circumstances don't you think this calls for a professional?
It's all right.
Let him go.
He is a doctor.
I'll need surgeon's tools.
Hot water, sulfur and clean packing.
- Some rum might help her pain.
- Aye.
You as well, John.
- Clumsy swab.
- Sorry.
I was supposed to torture you.
- Sorry.
- Do you see it yet?
Close.
Another minute.
Your father and two uncles.
Each had pieces of the map.
The treasure, it's large, I take it.
Largest ever taken.
Spanish gold ship.
Sorry.
And a third uncle, he chases you.
An unusual family.
Success.
I've treated you cruel, haven't I?
You've had a lot on your mind.
And you did help me at the prison.
The tavern.
Let's say, between us, just for argument's sake that you have Mordachai's map.
- But I don't.
- No, I know that.
But pretend that you do.
I was willing to go halves with him and his.
I will do the same with you and yours.
You're saying that if I show you mine, you'll share yours with me?
Give me the map.
Give me a kiss first.
Sorry.
Map now.
You see, the thing is, I don't have it.
But that doesn't mean we can't keep talking about it.
Mr. Blair's respects, captain.
Talk to yourself.
Yes, Mr. Bowen?
The Reaper's five miles off and closing.
You should stay down.
Mr. Bowen, see that Mr. Shaw gets a change of clothes.
- He's beginning to stink.
- Aye, captain.
He has it.
She makes for Crooked Man's Passage.
Yes.
She hopes to tear up our bottom on the coral.
Looks like we're in for a blow.
Shall we attack her now?
No.
We'll go around the islands in the dark.
We'll ambush her on the other side at daybreak.
You are clever, Morgan, but I will catch you.
Uncle Dawg will have his day.
First Ainslee's chasing us, now your uncle is chasing us.
Now, everybody's chasing us.
I'm not so happy about this.
I mean, I'm using this piratical stuff to write a bestselling book.
I didn't wanna put myself in any physical danger.
Put a stow on that sail, Mr. Blair.
We don't wanna lose her.
- Break fast the foresail.
- Aye, sir.
Morgan, I cannot see the horizon.
There is a storm headed our way from the island.
- We'll hold this course.
- Aye.
Mr. Blair, put an extra man on the helm.
Coxswain, up helm.
Clear the scuppers.
"May cruel death leave victims immortal."
"M-C-D-L-V-I."
1456.
One, four, five, six.
Fourteen degrees latitude, five minutes, six seconds north.
There's nothing there.
No, you were right.
It's not on any chart.
Where did you have it hidden?
In the boat.
Under the seaty thing.
I knew you'd wind up here at some point.
That being the cheese and you being the rat.
Thing is, ma'am, I'm basically a shallow man.
And no doctor.
Am I wrong?
No, not really.
I'm surprised you let me fiddle with your hip.
- And no gentleman either.
- I wanted to be.
The thing is, I was born poor.
My only choice was to become a thief and a liar.
Then since you lie so easily, and since you are so shallow I shall lie you in a shallow grave.
- Mr. Blair.
- Have you no charity, ma'am?
I brim with charity, Mr. Shaw.
I am charity's very soul.
Success, Mr. Blair.
My slave has found Cutthroat Island.
Mark it on the chart.
And since I am so charitable I will maroon you on a rock the size of this table instead of splattering your brains across my bulkhead, as you deserve.
Let's take him below.
Going up.
- Pull the front line, mate.
Tie it down.
- Aye, aye, sir.
I found it, Mr. Glasspoole.
I've fixed the island.
I know where it is.
It lies through the storm.
- You risk the ship if you head for it.
- I risk Dawg if I turn back.
Shorten sail all you want, Mr. Blair.
We head straight through it.
Hold your course, men.
Have you ever seen anything like this?
Not so I'd remember.
I won't run.
Look how close we are.
The rig, Morgan.
It can't take it.
It can.
We've been through worse with Harry.
Have faith, Mr. Blair, and trust the ship.
We'll try it.
What is this?
I'll not die in this storm for your pleasure, Morgan.
Morgan.
There are too many of them.
Tom Scully, there's no great love between us, but don't do this.
Not this close.
Look.
There's the island.
It can't be more than two or three leagues off.
Away the longboat.
Clear the sweep!
At least give us a compass, Scully!
You'll have no need of a compass where you're going!
You're going nowhere but down!
Put your backs into it!
Morgan!
Take up the stroke.
Somebody grab that bastard!
No!
Get him!
Stop him!
Row hard, men, it's our one hope.
Put your backs into it, men!
Morgan!
Row!
Row hard, men!
- Reef, men, reef.
- White water ahead.
Row, men, row.
Bowen.
Bowen.
- Glasspoole, are you all right?
- Aye, Morgan.
- Bowen?
- Yes.
- Blair?
- Aye.
We've lost Hewitt and Ames.
Morgan.
Look.
Look!
The cliffs of blood.
It's Cutthroat.
It must be.
We are truly blessed.
We made it, Scully!
- We found it.
- We made it!
We found it.
We found Cutthroat Island.
We need to find this trail.
- Can you tell where it begins?
- Not without the third piece.
We'll make for the high ground, get our bearings.
Mr. Bowen, bring that lizard.
We'll have it for dinner.
Gentlemen, we must thank Mr. Scully for bringing us the chart.
But this piece is the only piece of the map that shows the treasure site.
My piece.
- The Reaper.
- And the Morning Star.
She still swims.
Dawg must have caught Scully when he bore up in the storm.
That scoundrel must have made a deal with Dawg.
He betrayed my crew.
No sign of Shaw.
Spread out.
Search the whole island.
Find me this cove, these cliffs.
I'll wait ashore.
Go!
He makes to go ashore.
We'll follow him, get the map and find the treasure.
Find me a suitable campsite.
- I'm grateful to you, Mr. Scully.
- My pleasure.
But if you ever are disloyal to me the way you were to Morgan it'll be my pleasure to cook you alive and eat you.
Now, get out of my eyes.
Morgan!
Morgan's here!
Bitch stole my map!
Find her, or you're all dead!
Shaw.
Spread out.
If he makes it out, we'll grab him.
Shaw.
I know you're out there, Morgan.
I can smell you.
Morgan!
Shaw, where are you?
Damn you.
Morgan.
Morgan.
- Where?
- Help.
There he is.
Wait.
You wanna be careful.
It's quicksand.
Did you get Dawg's map, you bastard?
Yes.
Hand it over or you're a dead man.
Did you think I might have taken it to give to you?
Not for a second.
Sinking up to your waist, and all you can do is lie.
Well, it's completely true.
I could no longer stand your opinion of me.
Then give it over.
I will, at once, with all my heart if you'd be so kind as to get me out first.
Do you think I was born last Wednesday?
Give it here, and then we will talk about rescue.
I of course see your point of view but it works better for me if I'm on the hard part of the land first.
You're up to your chest.
What if I give it to you and you leave me here?
It wasn't long ago you spoke of marooning me.
What if you swallow it or run away?
You're beyond trusting.
That's the problem with being a thief.
Nobody knows when you're telling the truth.
Give me the tip of your dagger.
- What for?
- Give it to me.
Don't argue.
There.
It's no valentine, but it will have to do.
Now you have it all and I have nothing.
I'm in your command, Morgan.
Do with me what you will.
Quickly.
Well good luck.
Morgan?
Oh, fish him out.
Hold tight.
That was quite a storm, wasn't it, boys?
Dawg...
Yes.
We need to get around these hills through this forest near the coast.
There is our treasure.
Well, shall we?
- What are the instructions from here?
- Seventy-five paces from this pillar.
- Twelve.
- Twelve.
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen.
- Fourteen.
- Fourteen.
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen.
- Sixteen.
- Sixteen.
- Seventeen.
- Seventeen.
- Eighteen.
- Eighteen.
- Nineteen.
- Nineteen.
- Twenty.
- Twenty.
Look.
- Seventy-five?
- That's what the map says.
- Well, you misread it.
- No.
It's very clear.
"Seventy-five paces from the rock pillar."
Well, then the other 55 are out there.
Or....
Look.
That could be the other 55 paces.
We found a cave in the cliff.
Aye!
If they catch us here, they'll find Morgan.
We must leave.
Dead men tell no tales.
What does it say?
"Mouth of darkness, teeth of stone down the throat to the belly of gold guarded by those who never grew old."
Well....
Watch your head here.
Here.
Don't do that.
Let's try this way.
But...
Down the throat to the belly of gold.
Hey.
Down the throat to the belly of gold.
Harry, I found it.
Guarded by those who never grew old.
And your grandfather was the only one that came back.
We're rich.
Rich!
We'd best get these out.
Dawg can't be far behind.
Right.
Fetch the others.
- I'll start hauling this to the entrance.
- Right.
Wait.
All right, I'm going.
But no tricks.
And hurry.
Blair?
Glasspoole?
Blair?
Morgan?
Anybody up there?
Morgan.
Lucky me.
We was looking all over for you.
That's your young friend from Spittlefield.
What have you got there?
Treasure.
Bags of it.
Be careful what you do.
You could lose a lot.
- Put a ball between his eyes.
- No.
No.
Go ahead.
It's about 4 million pounds.
No, wait.
That's a guess, but I can't be off by more than a million pounds or so.
Cut the rope, William.
Get away.
William, let's make a deal.
I can be reasonable.
Send Morgan down.
I'll send the treasure up and we'll both have what we want.
All right, William.
We have a deal.
Here she comes.
No!
I wish I'd never learned Latin.
Now we have both.
Haul them in.
Don't watch me fall.
- I'm coming with you.
- Don't be mad.
Why?
Don't argue.
Let's agree upon something for once.
All right, ready.
On the count of three then?
Come to me, Morgan.
- One...
- Hey, one more thing.
- What?
- Considering everything I really think that from now on, we should be partners.
Full partners.
What do you say?
- Sixty-forty.
- Fifty-fifty.
- Full partners.
- Very well.
They have a lot to say to each other, don't they?
- Are you ready now?
- Ready.
One.
Two.
Now!
Love.
Who can explain it?
Come on, heave.
This is your future, men.
Heave.
Shaw.
Shaw.
Morgan.
- Have you seen Morgan?
- Yes, I did.
She helped me ashore.
- Then she sent me to find you.
- Thank God she's alive.
Where is she?
Where Dawg can't find her.
It's this way.
Follow me.
- How'd you get off Morgan's ship?
- Same as you, I jumped.
Fortunately, I'm an excellent swimmer.
- This seems rather far.
- It's just a few more feet.
Raise muskets.
Aim.
Mr. Shaw.
Splendid.
Before we hang you in Port Royal you've time to witness an historic alliance.
Where's Morgan?
I don't think she made it.
Perhaps you were wondering how I come to be here.
A little bird told me.
Plump pigeon, courtesy of Mr. Reed.
All right, get him up.
- Come on, you.
- Come on.
There, sir.
Shaw.
Trotter.
Discretion dictates I should not load the treasure onto the British man-of-war.
I shall go back to Port Royal with Captain Dawg.
- But, sir...
- Trotter you don't have much feel for these things.
- One day, perhaps.
- I hope so, sir.
- That's it.
- Trotter.
Got it.
Take a few of the men and follow in the other pirate ship.
I'll see you get a share of the money.
Little here, a little there.
It all adds up.
Yes, sir.
Now, sir, I shall go presently and write for your royal pardon.
Privateer for the Crown.
Sounds so much better than "pirate," don't you think?
Why do you let that preening swab live?
I study him.
When I become governor of Jamaica, I will need a certain style.
"Trotter."
Lock them below with the others.
They hang at Port Royal.
With pleasure, Your Honor.
Welcome aboard my ship, gentlemen.
I trust you'll find your quarters to my liking.
Come along now.
Hey, hey, hey.
- Come on.
- Below with you.
Get down there.
We'll weigh anchor.
Rouse the watch forward.
There we go.
Square away the breakers.
Stand by.
Push.
Morgan.
- I thought I to never see you again.
- Yes, Mr. Glasspoole, it's me.
What do you say, men?
Shall we take back our ship?
On your word, captain.
- Tackle's all right.
- Cover it up.
Mr. Coller.
I believe we can ease the main sheet a foot or two.
- Aye, captain.
- It'll draw better for it.
Are you a good swimmer, Mr. Scully?
Let's find out, shall we?
- Do you wish a compass, Scully?
- Take your closest friends with you.
There are islands close by.
I believe you can make it if you swim slowly.
I'll get you!
I'll be back, Morgan, if it's the last thing I do!
King Charles?
Ease your topsail.
King Charles?
Are you in there?
Well, you've seen what another captain's like.
Will you take my orders now?
Here you go.
Smile, Mr. Trotter.
Good, Trotter.
Good.
Give me some more shot here.
We'll edge towards them, Mr. Blair.
Not so fast to alarm him.
Two points to starboard, and keep her steady.
Two points starboard.
Keep her steady.
Trotter's closing on us.
Is that so?
Doubtless wants advice.
Poor fool can't tie his shoelaces without instruction.
Let's let him catch us.
I hope Mr. Shaw's still alive.
General quarters, Mr. Snelgrave.
Powder to the guns, but softly.
- What's going on?
- Do what I tell you.
Governor, oblige me.
Let me hang Mr. Shaw now from my yardarm.
- This minute?
- Yes.
Might be rather amusing.
One doesn't often get the chance to see a hanging at sea.
Come on, you.
Present arms.
It's a long drop.
- What is it?
- It's not good.
You best take a look.
William Shaw, you've been found guilty of piracy in the province of Jamaica.
By the authority of His Majesty the King, the penalty is death.
Pray, hangman, carry out the sentence.
He's testing us.
Prime your guns, men.
Are we prepared to fire, Mr. Snelgrave?
- Bloody hell.
- I knew it.
On command!
- Up ports.
- Cannons forward!
- Cannons ready.
- Cannons ready.
- Guns forward.
- Guns forward.
- Open fire.
- Fire!
- Fire!
- Fire!
Hoist our colors.
Mr. Blair, close in quickly now.
Fire!
- Fire!
- Fire!
Oh, my God.
Fire!
Blast them from the sea!
They want your treasure!
Will you let them take it?
Fire!
- On your way.
- Aye.
Knock them down!
Riflemen, prepare.
She means to board me.
Point her up.
Fire!
Sling your hooks!
Boarders aboard!
I love this.
I love it!
Who wants to die first?
Come on.
Kill them!
Kill them all!
Damn you.
They are so many, we are so few.
Keep fighting.
Hold them back as long as you can.
Where you go?
To blow out his bottom and get what we came for.
Separate the ships when I do.
Aye.
Die, Morgan, you sea witch!
Morgan has done it!
You, cut us loose!
I have no future in the army, sir.
William?
- What are you doing here?
- Not what you think.
There you are, Morgan.
Come to seek my treasure, have you?
Don't move.
I'll be right down to help you count it.
- Let's finish this.
- Come up!
Come up to uncle!
Forgive me.
I will come back.
- I promise.
- Morgan!
The whole ship's going to blow.
Morgan!
That boy doesn't understand us, Morgan.
But then, he's not family.
Come on.
- You cut me, niece.
- That was for Mordachai.
The next one is for Harry.
Be quick.
Undo my bonds.
Your father was nothing.
All my brothers were nothing.
You exceed them.
Think how far we could go together, Morgan.
You and me against the world.
Join me.
You don't have to die.
You do.
You've run out of world, Morgan.
William.
William, can you hear me?
Yes!
I'm coming for you, William.
Can you please hurry?
I'll give you this much, Morgan.
You're harder to kill than your father.
The odd thing is, I enjoyed it.
I never gave up.
Never gave in.
I regret it's finished.
Give my love to Harry when you see him.
It's over, Morgan.
You planning to fight me with that little stick?
No, uncle.
With this.
Bad Dawg.
William.
Quick, there's no time.
The ship's going to blow up.
Yes.
Go ahead.
Hurry.
It's too bad we'll have to leave all this behind.
Morgan!
- Yes.
- Hurry.
- There's no time for the treasure.
- Yes, let's hurry.
Hurry.
Quickly.
Here.
Up here.
Quickly, give me your hand.
Jump.
Look.
- They're alive.
- Morgan!
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
- You?
- Fine.
Just a little poorer.
Yeah, Morgan!
Blair.
Glasspoole!
Well, it doesn't matter.
I'm alive and you're alive and...
And we're alive together.
There'll be other treasures.
- Do you really feel that way?
- Absolutely.
Then I guess you don't want your share.
- That's a barrel.
- On this end.
- "On this end"?
- Yes.
A marker barrel.
But on the other....
This is yours, men.
Every last doubloon.
No one ever fought harder for anything.
Mr. Glasspoole will divide it into equal shares for us.
You're all rich men now.
And you're free to go your separate ways.
You could buy a little cottage in Bermuda and drink chamomile tea on the porch.
On the other hand, we could do what we were born to do:
Stay together and ride the early trades all the way to Madagascar the best pirating waters in the world.
Well, what do you say?
Shall we add to this pile here on the deck?
Mr. Glasspoole?
What say you?
It's just that it is such a large decision to make in such a small amount of time.
- Aye.
- Aye.
Mr. Blair?
Well, I'd like to, Morgan, but It's just....
I've always wanted to do a bit of farming.
Farming?
- To the captain!
- The captain!
- To the captain!
- To the captain!
- Where to, Morgan?
- I told you, Madagascar.
But that's in Africa.
Then we'd best get busy.
Mr. Trotter, take the crow's nest watch for the next 12 hours.
Good as done, ma'am.
Mr. Blair, prepare to come about.
Steer south-southeast.
Onto your stations, men.
Prepare to come about south-southeast.
Rewire ship.
And Mr. Shaw, I'd like to see you in my cabin immediately.
Look, Carlton, for the last time, no.
I do not want a hypnotist at my bachelor party.
But, Will, you don't know how incredibly cool it is.
I don't want cool, fool.
I want something simple.
Just me and my boys barking like seals at naked women.
[BARKING]
But, Will, that's so politically incorrect.
No one likes naked women anymore, believe me.
Tell me again, why did I make you my best man?
You said I'm like the brother you never had.
No, no, I said you like the brother I never wanted.
Look, Will, I put a lot of thought into this.
The least you can do is keep an open mind.
[WILL SIGHS]
All right, all right, fine.
Maybe there is something to this hypnotism stuff.
You are getting shorter.
When you wake up, you will be very, very short.
Damn, see, that stuff does work.
[SINGING "THE FRESH PRINCE OF BEL-AIR" THEME]
Here are the directions to the Crescent Rock School.
Now, you have to have Nicky there for his interview by 10 a. m.
That interview was today?
Philip, don't tell me you...
- Well, uh...
Uh...
WILL:
Hmm.
[IN NATIVE AMERICAN ACCENT] Distant drums say man with giant pants forget important interview.
Will, this is serious.
This is one of the top two schools in L.A.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Oh.
I was just playing, Aunt Viv.
It's cool, relax.
I'll take Nicky.
- What are you doing in about two hours?
- Sorry, Dad, I have a hair appointment.
Well, can't you cancel it?
[LAUGHING]
Good one, Daddy.
Ha.
Uh...
Hello.
I said I'll take him, Uncle Phil.
Carlton.
Got a class.
Uh, Will Smith's in the house.
- Hello.
- Geoffrey.
Certainly, sir.
I'll just have to make this triple fudge bundt cake tomorrow.
- Mm.
Geoffrey's out.
- Geoffrey's out.
Ashley, can you drive him?
Sure, my bike has a basket.
Well, Uncle Phil, it looks like it's down to me.
Or that weird dude that be vacuuming our pool.
- Oh, Gus is here?
- Uncle Phil.
Look.
Oh, all right.
All right, you can...
You can take him.
All right.
- Big mistake.
- Hey, what are you talking about?
What, you think I don't want Nicky to get into a good school?
Education is very important to me.
Say, don't you have a class now?
Oh, that's not important.
All right, suppose they ask you why you wanna go to their school.
- What do you tell them?
- I don't know.
Of course you do.
Say, "I think this school has a nurturing environment which will best realize my education potential. "
Or you could say, "In two years, I'll be bigger than you. "
Will, if you don't mind I'm trying to get Nicky ready for his interview.
Well, you need to stop pressuring him.
You treat him like a ventriloquist's dummy.
That's not what I'm doing.
Nicky, what school do you wanna go to?
NICKY:
The best school in L.A. Crescent Rock School.
Yeah, I was wrong, Carlton.
You're the dummy.
Hey, Nicky, check it out.
Yo, post up, post up, post up.
Ooh.
Hey, are you all right?
Hey, look.
Now, Nicky, I don't want you to be nervous, all right?
I want you to ignore everything that Carlton said.
Just be yourself, all right?
[GRUNTING]
Now I know what Uncle Phil must feel like in a Miata.
Hi, I'm Penny Abigail Jillette.
This school has a warm, nurturing atmosphere.
I'm Nicky.
Is there any apple juice?
Hi, I'm Ruby Jillette.
I'm Penny's mom.
- Oh, hey.
Hi, I'm Will.
I'm Nicky's cousin.
- Ah.
That may be why the other adults were standing.
[CHUCKLES]
Uh, well, Penny seems to be a really bright little girl.
- Sorry.
- Uh...
Um, yes, she is.
She started writing poetry at age 3.
Now she's publishing a little magazine for the kids on the Internet.
Yeah, well, you know, Nicky be writing too.
You know, yeah.
You know, he...
He just wrote, produced, directed his first screenplay.
The Forest Gumby.
Look, I can make myself dizzy.
Nick...
Nicky...
[WILL CHUCKLES]
That's a part of his comedy act.
Heh.
Yeah, that one killed them at Def Jam, Junior.
Ha, ha.
Nicky, why don't you sit?
Ooh.
[CHUCKLES]
Hi, I'm Miss Jansen, one of the kindergarten teachers.
- Basically, we're just observing the kids.
- Mm-hm.
Seeing how they play, how they interact with one another.
Oh, hey, well, Nicky here is a big interacter.
You might call him the last interaction hero, you know.
It looks like we've got a couple of sculptors.
I made an Arabian stallion.
That's remarkable.
Well, wait till y'all see what Nicky made.
Shoot, it's...
Uh...
This...
This is a...
It looks like a rock.
This is that mountain from Hawaii, Mount Kichikichiyayadada.
It's really a turtle.
He's inside his shell.
Is he hiding because he's nervous about going to a new school?
No, he's watching Power Rangers.
[JANSEN WILL CHUCKLE]
Well, that's great.
I've gotta go now and set up your snacks.
Can I help?
Sure you can, Nicky.
Come on.
[SCOFFS]
What you making now?
What, an artificial heart valve?
So how'd the interview go?
Oh, great.
You know, I mean, not "great" great, you know.
But it was good.
It was good.
You know.
You know, not that good, you know.
But...
What is the word I'm looking for?
- Bad?
- Worse than that, but I'll go with bad.
Oh, Will.
Look, come on, it wasn't Nicky's fault.
NICKY:
That's right.
Will's the one that got yelled at for stealing.
Look.
Well, she had it coming after the way she talked about your mountain.
It was a turtle.
Nicky, go make yourself dizzy.
Nicky, Nicky, Nicky.
Stop, stop, look.
Just sit down.
Sit here.
Ah.
Nice work, Will.
You'd better hope that he gets into the Considine School.
The head of admissions is coming to interview the entire family and, unfortunately, that includes you.
CARLTON:
Ho, ho.
Hold the phone, big guy.
Will and I have a magical evening planned.
Are you sure that while Aunt Viv was pregnant with Carlton she wasn't, you know?
You promised we'd go see the hypnotist, remember?
[WILL SIGHS]
Oh, look at this.
Tippy The Drunken Penguin is his opening act.
Ooh, you think we could get him for my bachelor party?
I wish.
Do whatever you want.
Just be sure you're back here promptly at 8.
We're going to show those people from Considine that we're a warm, caring loving family or I'm going to kill you.
Oh, come on, Uncle Phil, hasn't there been enough black-on-black violence?
Man, I will see you at 8.
At the sound of the bell, you will awaken from your trance.
However, you will think that you are naked.
Three, two...
[RINGS]
[SIGHS]
[GASPS THEN SCREAMS]
Look, Will, she thinks she's naked.
Isn't this exciting?
Carlton, are you sure Aunt Viv didn't?
Now, who would like to be my next volunteer?
Someone who doesn't embarrass easily.
Pick me, oh, Great Mentos, pick me.
Ooh.
Shoot me, oh, Great Mentos, shoot me.
Uhh...
How about you?
[SIGHS]
GREAT MENTOS:
You are in a state of full relaxation.
The sound of my voice is very soothing.
And you will accept any suggestion that I make.
I want to take you back.
At the sound of the bell, you will be 4 years old.
CARLTON:
Will, wake up.
The show is almost over and you haven't even touched your pie.
Pie.
Oh, my God, Uncle Phil.
Carlton, we were supposed to be back at the house at 8:00.
Come on, I'm gonna go get our coats.
Remember, at the sound of the bell, you will be 4 years old.
[DINGS]
[MUMBLING]
[GIGGLING]
[DINGS]
Can I help you?
Could I have my coat?
My fault.
WILL:
Hey, hey.
- Well, it's about time.
Man from Considine School's gonna be here any minute.
Hey, look, I'm sorry we're late, Uncle Phil.
And you just forget it.
There's no way I'm humiliating myself by having some corny loser at my bachelor party.
Hey, don't talk about The Great Mentos like that.
I wasn't.
All right, just settle down.
Is everything ready, Ashley?
I think so.
I've replaced all the video tapes with insect documentaries.
Good Lord, Hilary.
What are you reading?
The Victoria's Secret catalog.
It's their end-of-the-season thong blowout.
Ha, ha.
Ooh.
That's a good issue too.
Everything in there is half off.
You know what I'm saying?
That is not the kind of image we wanna present.
Give me that.
Or better yet, give me that.
PHIL:
Oh, there you are.
There's my little man.
Come on, sweetheart, have a seat right here.
Philip, this is ridiculous.
I hate pretending to be something we're not.
Oh.
Well, fine, Vivian, so Nicky doesn't get into a good school this year.
He can stay home with Will watching Power Rangers and making himself dizzy.
Honey, here, just hold this.
And try to stay awake.
Whoa, G, man, something smells good.
Aren't you glad I use Dial?
Oh, you meant the crab puffs.
Yeah, man, these things is kind of tiny.
I seen Uncle Phil pick bigger chunks of food out of his teeth.
Ha, ha.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Come in.
That never works.
He's here.
We better get out there.
[WILL GRUNTS]
What the heck is wrong with you?
[IN CHILD'S VOICE] I gotta go potty.
Well, what are you telling me for?
You gotta take me, please?
Come on.
Hey, the buddy system stops at the pool, mister.
Look, come on, I gotta go.
Come on, come on, come on.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Come on, what are you tripping for?
Uncle Phil's in there, let's go.
Will's acting kind of weird.
It must be all that rap music.
I'd like to strangle the man who invented the doorbell.
The bell, that's it.
Geoffrey, Will's been hypnotized.
The Great Mentos made him think he's 4 years old.
Can he make me think I care?
Will, Will.
And this is our son, Carlton.
Ha-ha-ha.
Well, and this must be Nicholas.
Yes, stand up, Nicholas and shake Mr. Spiegel's hand.
I can't, my legs are numb.
Oh.
Oh.
Look at that, the boy would rather read than walk.
Isn't that beautiful?
Heh.
So who's the musician?
Oh, that would be me.
Ha.
I play a little cello.
But this is a bass.
Well, the cello's in the shop, this is a loaner.
Oh, the World of Discovery series.
This one is marvelous.
The Ant, Nature's Busiest Worker.
Oh, yes.
Ants are extremely intelligent.
I still can't believe they run their own farms.
- Ha, ha.
VIVIAN:
Well, yes.
Mr. Spiegel.
Won't you try one of our crab puffs?
I got the recipe from our favorite little bistro in Paris, Le Bistro.
Actually, madam, I got it from the Gary Coleman Cookbook.
Hope you like short ribs.
[OVEN TIMER RINGS]
Ah, I hear the little guys now.
Ha-ha-ha.
- So is that a Princeton tie you're wearing?
- Mm-hm.
Oh, I'm a Princeton man, class of '69.
- You're kidding, class of '73.
- Ha-ha-ha.
[IN CHILD'S VOICE] You like seafood?
Of course.
See, food.
[SINGING] Crash through the line of blue
And send the backs on 'round the end
Fight, fight for every yard Princeton's honor to defend
Rah, rah, rah
PHIL SPIEGEL:
Argh!
[PHIL LAUGHING]
- Come on, Will, let's go in the kitchen.
- I don't want to.
No.
- I'll give you a snickerdoodle.
- Okay.
Certainly is great to have another Princeton Tiger in the house.
Ha, ha.
I need something that rings.
Oh, I know, the oven timer.
Oh, H-E-double-toothpicks.
Ooh.
Geoffrey, do you have anything with bells on it?
Why, certainly, Master Carlton.
I just happen to have a trolley in my trousers.
CARLTON:
Whoa!
I need you to stay put, young man.
Do you understand?
Yes.
Okay, I'm gonna go look for something with a bell.
You're not gonna move, right?
- No.
- Good.
Simon says, "Freeze. "
That's it.
Little boys who don't behave go to the pool house.
Make me.
Ha, ha.
My pleasure, you little rug rat.
Ooh, ooh.
Stop, I'm gonna tell.
Stop, I'm gonna tell.
Help!
Help!
That's it.
You're on a time out, mister.
Now, come on.
You're sitting in the comer.
What the hell is going on in here?
He can't talk to you, Dad, he's in time out.
I don't care what kind of shenanigans you two are trying to pull here.
We're not pulling anything, Dad.
Will's been hypnotized.
He'll snap out of it if I find a bell, but I can't find one to ring.
I'll ring your head like a bell if you don't get in there.
When I first read the brochure for Considine School I knew it was the perfect...
Somebody wanna hear a joke?
Excuse me, Will, I'm talking here.
So I decided...
Okay.
What's the most musical part of your body?
I don't know.
Your nose because you can pick it and blow it.
Ha-ha-ha.
I don't get it.
Okay, I got another one.
I got another one.
Could I speak to you for a minute?
Pick it and blow it, oh, I get it.
Ha.
Excuse me, mister, I'll shine your head for a nickel.
Ha-ha-ha.
Will.
Over here.
Now.
He's a little high-strung, isn't he?
Oh, look what you did to the poor little fella.
For the love of God, does nobody have a bell?
Obviously, you're in some sort of a family crisis here and I think it's best if I just be going.
Uh...
Uh...
Oh, no, please.
Mr. Spiegel.
I can explain the entire situation.
I'm sure you can.
To another school.
Good luck.
I found a bell.
[RINGS]
[IN NORMAL VOICE] What the hell is in those crab puffs?
Well, that hypnotist certainly can put on a show.
Yeah, I'm just glad he unhypnotized me.
Too bad we got stuck behind that ice cream truck on the way there.
Yeah, those bells turned you into a raving maniac.
Hey, I missed dinner, okay?
Philip, you'll never guess what happened.
The Crescent Rock School called, they've accepted Nicky.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Oh, put it there, my man.
BOTH:
Pssh!
Ha-ha-ha.
They said it was his sincerity that impressed them the most.
- They liked that he was just being himself.
- That's what Will told me to do.
Oh, you preach it there, little bro.
That's what I'm talking about.
You know, it just seems to me that there might be a cash gift involved here somewhere, I don't know.
Well, I'll settle for just a hearty handshake.
Psh, psh.
All right, bro.
- Don't push it.
- Come on.
I know you're not still mad at me about last night.
I was hypnotized.
I couldn't help it.
No, I suppose not.
I guess weak-willed individuals like you are just susceptible to that kind of mental manipulation.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
[BARKING]
Hey, hey, hey.
Look, I'll walk him, but somebody else gonna have to pooper scoop.
Look, Carlton, for the last time, no.
I do not want a hypnotist at my bachelor party.
But, Will, you don't know how incredibly cool it is.
I don't want cool, fool.
I want something simple.
Just me and my boys barking like seals at naked women.
[BARKING]
But, Will, that's so politically incorrect.
No one likes naked women anymore, believe me.
Tell me again, why did I make you my best man?
You said I'm like the brother you never had.
No, no, I said you like the brother I never wanted.
Look, Will, I put a lot of thought into this.
The least you can do is keep an open mind.
[WILL SIGHS]
All right, all right, fine.
Maybe there is something to this hypnotism stuff.
You are getting shorter.
When you wake up, you will be very, very short.
Damn, see, that stuff does work.
[SINGING "THE FRESH PRINCE OF BEL-AIR" THEME]
Here are the directions to the Crescent Rock School.
Now, you have to have Nicky there for his interview by 10 a. m.
That interview was today?
Philip, don't tell me you...
- Well, uh...
Uh...
WILL:
Hmm.
[IN NATIVE AMERICAN ACCENT] Distant drums say man with giant pants forget important interview.
Will, this is serious.
This is one of the top two schools in L.A.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Oh.
I was just playing, Aunt Viv.
It's cool, relax.
I'll take Nicky.
- What are you doing in about two hours?
- Sorry, Dad, I have a hair appointment.
Well, can't you cancel it?
[LAUGHING]
Good one, Daddy.
Ha.
Uh...
Hello.
I said I'll take him, Uncle Phil.
Carlton.
Got a class.
Uh, Will Smith's in the house.
- Hello.
- Geoffrey.
Certainly, sir.
I'll just have to make this triple fudge bundt cake tomorrow.
- Mm.
Geoffrey's out.
- Geoffrey's out.
Ashley, can you drive him?
Sure, my bike has a basket.
Well, Uncle Phil, it looks like it's down to me.
Or that weird dude that be vacuuming our pool.
- Oh, Gus is here?
- Uncle Phil.
Look.
Oh, all right.
All right, you can...
You can take him.
All right.
- Big mistake.
- Hey, what are you talking about?
What, you think I don't want Nicky to get into a good school?
Education is very important to me.
Say, don't you have a class now?
Oh, that's not important.
All right, suppose they ask you why you wanna go to their school.
- What do you tell them?
- I don't know.
Of course you do.
Say, "I think this school has a nurturing environment which will best realize my education potential. "
Or you could say, "In two years, I'll be bigger than you. "
Will, if you don't mind I'm trying to get Nicky ready for his interview.
Well, you need to stop pressuring him.
You treat him like a ventriloquist's dummy.
That's not what I'm doing.
Nicky, what school do you wanna go to?
NICKY:
The best school in L.A. Crescent Rock School.
Yeah, I was wrong, Carlton.
You're the dummy.
Hey, Nicky, check it out.
Yo, post up, post up, post up.
Ooh.
Hey, are you all right?
Hey, look.
Now, Nicky, I don't want you to be nervous, all right?
I want you to ignore everything that Carlton said.
Just be yourself, all right?
[GRUNTING]
Now I know what Uncle Phil must feel like in a Miata.
Hi, I'm Penny Abigail Jillette.
This school has a warm, nurturing atmosphere.
I'm Nicky.
Is there any apple juice?
Hi, I'm Ruby Jillette.
I'm Penny's mom.
- Oh, hey.
Hi, I'm Will.
I'm Nicky's cousin.
- Ah.
That may be why the other adults were standing.
[CHUCKLES]
Uh, well, Penny seems to be a really bright little girl.
- Sorry.
- Uh...
Um, yes, she is.
She started writing poetry at age 3.
Now she's publishing a little magazine for the kids on the Internet.
Yeah, well, you know, Nicky be writing too.
You know, yeah.
You know, he...
He just wrote, produced, directed his first screenplay.
The Forest Gumby.
Look, I can make myself dizzy.
Nick...
Nicky...
[WILL CHUCKLES]
That's a part of his comedy act.
Heh.
Yeah, that one killed them at Def Jam, Junior.
Ha, ha.
Nicky, why don't you sit?
Ooh.
[CHUCKLES]
Hi, I'm Miss Jansen, one of the kindergarten teachers.
- Basically, we're just observing the kids.
- Mm-hm.
Seeing how they play, how they interact with one another.
Oh, hey, well, Nicky here is a big interacter.
You might call him the last interaction hero, you know.
It looks like we've got a couple of sculptors.
I made an Arabian stallion.
That's remarkable.
Well, wait till y'all see what Nicky made.
Shoot, it's...
Uh...
This...
This is a...
It looks like a rock.
This is that mountain from Hawaii, Mount Kichikichiyayadada.
It's really a turtle.
He's inside his shell.
Is he hiding because he's nervous about going to a new school?
No, he's watching Power Rangers.
[JANSEN WILL CHUCKLE]
Well, that's great.
I've gotta go now and set up your snacks.
Can I help?
Sure you can, Nicky.
Come on.
[SCOFFS]
What you making now?
What, an artificial heart valve?
So how'd the interview go?
Oh, great.
You know, I mean, not "great" great, you know.
But it was good.
It was good.
You know.
You know, not that good, you know.
But...
What is the word I'm looking for?
- Bad?
- Worse than that, but I'll go with bad.
Oh, Will.
Look, come on, it wasn't Nicky's fault.
NICKY:
That's right.
Will's the one that got yelled at for stealing.
Look.
Well, she had it coming after the way she talked about your mountain.
It was a turtle.
Nicky, go make yourself dizzy.
Nicky, Nicky, Nicky.
Stop, stop, look.
Just sit down.
Sit here.
Ah.
Nice work, Will.
You'd better hope that he gets into the Considine School.
The head of admissions is coming to interview the entire family and, unfortunately, that includes you.
CARLTON:
Ho, ho.
Hold the phone, big guy.
Will and I have a magical evening planned.
Are you sure that while Aunt Viv was pregnant with Carlton she wasn't, you know?
You promised we'd go see the hypnotist, remember?
[WILL SIGHS]
Oh, look at this.
Tippy The Drunken Penguin is his opening act.
Ooh, you think we could get him for my bachelor party?
I wish.
Do whatever you want.
Just be sure you're back here promptly at 8.
We're going to show those people from Considine that we're a warm, caring loving family or I'm going to kill you.
Oh, come on, Uncle Phil, hasn't there been enough black-on-black violence?
Man, I will see you at 8.
At the sound of the bell, you will awaken from your trance.
However, you will think that you are naked.
Three, two...
[RINGS]
[SIGHS]
[GASPS THEN SCREAMS]
Look, Will, she thinks she's naked.
Isn't this exciting?
Carlton, are you sure Aunt Viv didn't?
Now, who would like to be my next volunteer?
Someone who doesn't embarrass easily.
Pick me, oh, Great Mentos, pick me.
Ooh.
Shoot me, oh, Great Mentos, shoot me.
Uhh...
How about you?
[SIGHS]
GREAT MENTOS:
You are in a state of full relaxation.
The sound of my voice is very soothing.
And you will accept any suggestion that I make.
I want to take you back.
At the sound of the bell, you will be 4 years old.
CARLTON:
Will, wake up.
The show is almost over and you haven't even touched your pie.
Pie.
Oh, my God, Uncle Phil.
Carlton, we were supposed to be back at the house at 8:00.
Come on, I'm gonna go get our coats.
Remember, at the sound of the bell, you will be 4 years old.
[DINGS]
[MUMBLING]
[GIGGLING]
[DINGS]
Can I help you?
Could I have my coat?
My fault.
WILL:
Hey, hey.
- Well, it's about time.
Man from Considine School's gonna be here any minute.
Hey, look, I'm sorry we're late, Uncle Phil.
And you just forget it.
There's no way I'm humiliating myself by having some corny loser at my bachelor party.
Hey, don't talk about The Great Mentos like that.
I wasn't.
All right, just settle down.
Is everything ready, Ashley?
I think so.
I've replaced all the video tapes with insect documentaries.
Good Lord, Hilary.
What are you reading?
The Victoria's Secret catalog.
It's their end-of-the-season thong blowout.
Ha, ha.
Ooh.
That's a good issue too.
Everything in there is half off.
You know what I'm saying?
That is not the kind of image we wanna present.
Give me that.
Or better yet, give me that.
PHIL:
Oh, there you are.
There's my little man.
Come on, sweetheart, have a seat right here.
Philip, this is ridiculous.
I hate pretending to be something we're not.
Oh.
Well, fine, Vivian, so Nicky doesn't get into a good school this year.
He can stay home with Will watching Power Rangers and making himself dizzy.
Honey, here, just hold this.
And try to stay awake.
Whoa, G, man, something smells good.
Aren't you glad I use Dial?
Oh, you meant the crab puffs.
Yeah, man, these things is kind of tiny.
I seen Uncle Phil pick bigger chunks of food out of his teeth.
Ha, ha.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Come in.
That never works.
He's here.
We better get out there.
[WILL GRUNTS]
What the heck is wrong with you?
[IN CHILD'S VOICE] I gotta go potty.
Well, what are you telling me for?
You gotta take me, please?
Come on.
Hey, the buddy system stops at the pool, mister.
Look, come on, I gotta go.
Come on, come on, come on.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Come on, what are you tripping for?
Uncle Phil's in there, let's go.
Will's acting kind of weird.
It must be all that rap music.
I'd like to strangle the man who invented the doorbell.
The bell, that's it.
Geoffrey, Will's been hypnotized.
The Great Mentos made him think he's 4 years old.
Can he make me think I care?
Will, Will.
And this is our son, Carlton.
Ha-ha-ha.
Well, and this must be Nicholas.
Yes, stand up, Nicholas and shake Mr. Spiegel's hand.
I can't, my legs are numb.
Oh.
Oh.
Look at that, the boy would rather read than walk.
Isn't that beautiful?
Heh.
So who's the musician?
Oh, that would be me.
Ha.
I play a little cello.
But this is a bass.
Well, the cello's in the shop, this is a loaner.
Oh, the World of Discovery series.
This one is marvelous.
The Ant, Nature's Busiest Worker.
Oh, yes.
Ants are extremely intelligent.
I still can't believe they run their own farms.
- Ha, ha.
VIVIAN:
Well, yes.
Mr. Spiegel.
Won't you try one of our crab puffs?
I got the recipe from our favorite little bistro in Paris, Le Bistro.
Actually, madam, I got it from the Gary Coleman Cookbook.
Hope you like short ribs.
[OVEN TIMER RINGS]
Ah, I hear the little guys now.
Ha-ha-ha.
- So is that a Princeton tie you're wearing?
- Mm-hm.
Oh, I'm a Princeton man, class of '69.

- Come on, Will, let's go in the kitchen.
- I don't want to.
No.
- I'll give you a snickerdoodle.
- Okay.
Certainly is great to have another Princeton Tiger in the house.
Ha, ha.
I need something that rings.
Oh, I know, the oven timer.
Oh, H-E-double-toothpicks.
Ooh.
Geoffrey, do you have anything with bells on it?
Why, certainly, Master Carlton.
I just happen to have a trolley in my trousers.
CARLTON:
Whoa!
I need you to stay put, young man.
Do you understand?
Yes.
Okay, I'm gonna go look for something with a bell.
You're not gonna move, right?
- No.
- Good.
Simon says, "Freeze. "
That's it.
Little boys who don't behave go to the pool house.
Make me.
Ha, ha.
My pleasure, you little rug rat.
Ooh, ooh.
Stop, I'm gonna tell.
Stop, I'm gonna tell.
Help!
Help!
That's it.
You're on a time out, mister.
Now, come on.
You're sitting in the comer.
What the hell is going on in here?
He can't talk to you, Dad, he's in time out.
I don't care what kind of shenanigans you two are trying to pull here.
We're not pulling anything, Dad.
Will's been hypnotized.
He'll snap out of it if I find a bell, but I can't find one to ring.
I'll ring your head like a bell if you don't get in there.
When I first read the brochure for Considine School I knew it was the perfect...
Somebody wanna hear a joke?
Excuse me, Will, I'm talking here.
So I decided...
Okay.
What's the most musical part of your body?

I don't get it.
Okay, I got another one.
I got another one.
Could I speak to you for a minute?
Pick it and blow it, oh, I get it.
Ha.
Excuse me, mister, I'll shine your head for a nickel.
Ha-ha-ha.
Will.
Over here.
Now.
He's a little high-strung, isn't he?
Oh, look what you did to the poor little fella.
For the love of God, does nobody have a bell?
Obviously, you're in some sort of a family crisis here and I think it's best if I just be going.
Uh...
Uh...
Oh, no, please.
Mr. Spiegel.
I can explain the entire situation.
I'm sure you can.
To another school.
Good luck.
I found a bell.
[RINGS]
[IN NORMAL VOICE] What the hell is in those crab puffs?
Well, that hypnotist certainly can put on a show.
Yeah, I'm just glad he unhypnotized me.
Too bad we got stuck behind that ice cream truck on the way there.
Yeah, those bells turned you into a raving maniac.
Hey, I missed dinner, okay?
Philip, you'll never guess what happened.
The Crescent Rock School called, they've accepted Nicky.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Oh, put it there, my man.
BOTH:
Pssh!
Ha-ha-ha.
They said it was his sincerity that impressed them the most.

Oh, you preach it there, little bro.
That's what I'm talking about.
You know, it just seems to me that there might be a cash gift involved here somewhere, I don't know.
Well, I'll settle for just a hearty handshake.
Psh, psh.
All right, bro.
- Don't push it.
- Come on.
I know you're not still mad at me about last night.
I was hypnotized.
I couldn't help it.
No, I suppose not.
I guess weak-willed individuals like you are just susceptible to that kind of mental manipulation.

Yes, he could be playing with himself.
Yes, I'll ask.
Dade, you like girls, don't you?
Yeah.
I just haven't found one as charming as you.
You haven't done anything stupid, right?

'Of all the things I've lost, I miss my mind the most'.
Ozzy Osbourne.
You.
What is your name?
Emmanuel Goldstein, sir.
You, however, are not on my list.
This isn't wood shop class?
Class crashing.
Come on.
Now get out.
Thank you, sir.
How was school?
- What did we learn in school today?
- Revenge.
Ahh.
Did we meet someone special?
No.
No-one special.
I have to get back to work.
Would you please try to fill these out?
Don't worry, it's only the rest of your life.
Anything else?
Want me to mow the lawn?
Oops, I forgot.
New York, no grass.
And unpack.
You can sit at home and do absolutely nothing and your name goes through 17 computers a day.
'1984'?
Yeah, right.
That's a typo.
Orwell's here and living large.
We have no names, man.
No names!
Can I score a fry?
Meet Cereal Killer.
As in Fruit Loops.
But he does know things.
Anyway, guys, listen.
I'm in this computer, right?
I'm looking around...
You got those Crayola books?
Yeah, technicolour rainbow.
Green one.
What is that?
Let me see?
- What are these?
- International UNIX environments.
Luscious orange.
Computer security criteria...
DOD standards.
The pink-shirt book... guide to IBM PCs.
So-called due to the nasty pink shirt the guy wears on the cover.
Devil book, the UNIX bible.
- What's that?
- Dragon book, compiler design.
- What's that?
- The Red book.
NSA-trusted networks.
Otherwise known as 'The Ugly Red Book That Won't Fit On A Shelf'.
Anyway, guys.
Come on.
I'm in this computer, right.
I'm looking around, throwing commands.
I don't know what it does or anything.
It's choice.
It's beautiful.
Four hours just messing around in there.
Finally, I figure out... that it's a bank.
Okay, wait.
It's a bank.
So, this morning, I check the paper, some cash machine in, like, Bumsville, Idaho, spits out $700 into the street.
- That's kinda cool.
- That was me.
- I did that.
- You did this from your house?
Are you stoned or stupid?
You don't hack a bank from your house!
You get nailed by the FBI.
Are your brains in your ass?
Don't you know anything?
It's universally stupid, man.
I don't know things because you guys won't tell me anything.
Right?
What are the three most used passwords?
'Love', 'Secret' and 'Sex'.
But not in that order, necessarily.
Right?
Don't forget 'God'.
System operators love to use 'God'.
Male ego.
To be elite, you have to do a righteous hack, not this accidental shit.
Which means you score one of those Gibsons, man.
Those supercomputers they use to do physics and look for oil.
No way, man.
Security is too tight.
Maybe.
But if I wanted to hack some heavy metal,
I'd work my way in through some back door.
Oh, man.
Wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons?
Who ate all of my fries?
- Joey!
- No, I didn't touch your fries.
- Cereal, man.
You owe me a pack.
- It was him.
- Lay off that shit, man.
- I'm gonna hit you!
Yes!
Home run, home run.
Okay, okay.
You and me, Lucy.
We're gonna show them, baby.
Ow!
Mr Belford?
My name is The Plague.
Mr The Plague, something weird is happening on the net.
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
One of the Gibsons is working really hard.
We got one person on-line but with the workload of 10 users.
I think we got a hacker.
Okay, we need proof that we were here.
Yeah.
Garbage.
Give me Garbage.
Shit.
Never fear,
I is here.
- I located the activity to terminal 23.
- Let's echo 23, see what's up.
God wouldn't be up this late.
Shit!
Get me the switching control centre.
I need to trace this call.
Hold on, Mom.
Hold on one second.
- Open the door, Joseph.
- Yeah, okay.
There you go.
Bed.
Sleep.
Now!
Sweet dreams, Joseph.
He's gone.
Did you get a trace?
Yeah, we got him.
Good.
Nice place, huh?
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn?
- You know who he is?
- No.
Don't know who he is.
Do you?
Nikon!
Lord Nikon, this is...
Crash Override.
Never heard of you.
You done anything?
No.
Come on!
What?
Your Mom buy you a 'puter for Christmas?
- Does he know anything?
- Sure.
He's elite.
Come in.
- Nikon, can I crash at your place tonight?
- Again?
Yeah, sure.
Hackers penetrate and ravage public and private computer systems, infecting them with viruses...
Who are these guys?
Richard Gill.
Hacker enemy number one.
Real boner.
Showtime.
Showtime!
- What's going on?
- Four, three, two, one...
Welcome to our show!
Hack the Planet!
Hack the Planet!
For late night hacks, Jolt Cola, soft drink ofthe elite hacker.
- Who are these guys?
- That's Razor and Blade.
Razor and Blade?
That's right.
This is a pay-phone.
Don't ask.
As you can see, this isjust a simple micro-cassette recorder.
Hook it up to the phone, and drop in five bucks in quarters.
Record the tone the coins make, hang up, get your money back.
Never again pay for a service that would be cheap, if it weren't run by profiteering gluttons.
Remember, hacking is more than just a crime.
It's a survival trait.
I'm a real wild child, I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one
Thank you!
Thank you very much!
Joey!
Joey!
Thank you!
Freeze!
- What?
- Get out of there!
Out!
- Joey!
- Get in there!
Sit down!
Lucy!
Where are you taking her?
Joey!
- How's it going, Ray?
- Looks good, sir.
We got an uncorrupted hard drive.
In English, please.
I didn't protect the President for ten years to finish my career feeling like an idiot.
I'm sorry, sir.
He didn't have time to erase his computer files.
Good.
Let's finish up here.
Take him in for interrogation.
Agent Gill, can you spare a moment?
Why, of course, Jennifer.
- Joey!
- How dangerous are hackers?
Hackers penetrate and ravage public and private computer systems, infecting them with viruses and stealing sensitive materials.
These people are terrorists.
Morning, gentlemen.
Please, be seated.
I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
Once again, don't call me Eugene.
Our recent intruder penetrated using a superuser account, giving him access to our whole system.
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
Someone didn't bother reading my memo on commonly used passwords.
As I meticulously pointed out, the foremost used passwords are...
'Love', 'Sex', 'Secret' and 'God'.
So would Your Holiness care to change her password?
A hacker planted the virus.
Virus?
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty and flooded its tanks.
Excuse me?
The little boat flipped over.
A virus planted within the Gibson system claimed responsibility.
It left a note?
Unless $5 million is transferred to the following account in 7 days,
I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson fleet.
- Is that...?
- That is the virus.
Leonardo da Vinci.
We have 26 ships at sea and don't know which ones are infected.
Well, put the ship's ballast under manual control.
There's no such thing any more.
These ships are totally computerised.
They rely on satellite navigation which links them to our network, and the virus, wherever they are.
What are we supposed to do?
Luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer.
I traced the hacker's call.
The Secret Service picked him up.
I'll search his files for the original virus code and eliminate it.
We expect you to get on this right away.
- How soon?
- As fast as I can.
This is common in corporations as large as ours.
Don't worry about it.
The Secret Service is helping us out, 100 percent.
We'll be in touch.
What the hell was that all about?
I had to move fast.
The hacker copied my garbage file.
What?
I created da Vinci so we could get the Secret Service to arrest the hacker and seize the equipment, which we can't do alone.
- I don't want to go to jail for this.
- Relax.
Think about the $25 million.
But you created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster.
Just to arrest some hacker kid?
Basically, yes.
Jesus!
You're sick, Eugene.
I'll take care of this.
I can cancel it any time.
I don't need the code.
What better way to confiscate the disk and find out how much of the garbage file was copied.
Get it!
Why did I ever trust you?
Get the file, otherwise you'll lose all your toys.
Did you find the virus program on the disks we confiscated?
No.
He's either very smart or very stupid.
Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice.
We'll release him.
Keep tight surveillance and see if he leads us to your disk.
Unit 3, outside suspect Joey Pardella's apartment.
Suspect still grounded... by his mother.
Listen to this bullshit.
'This is our world now.
The world of the electron and the switch, 'the beauty of the baud.
'We exist without nationality, skin colour or religious bias.
'You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us, 'and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.
'Yes, I am a criminal.
My crime is that of curiosity.
'I am a hacker and this is my manifesto. '
Right?
Manifesto?
'You may stop me, 'but you can't stop us all. '
That's cool.
- Cool?
- Yeah, cool.
You think it's cool?
- It's cool.
- It's not cool.
It's commie bullshit.
Can I crash at your place tonight?
What's with him?
His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since.
You hear about Joey's bust?
Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
You think he could hack a Gibson?
- Did you talk to him?
- No.
His mom says he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.
And no 'consorting with computer friends'.
The Secret Service is out to get him.
Want to go to a big party tonight?
It's at Kate's.
I thought so.
A little pelvis.
A little pelvis.
What the hell are you doing?
Plague!
Plague!
Gill.
I think we got something.
Yuk!
Hard copy!
Dade Murphy.
- Secret Service!
- Don't move!
What are you...?
Shut up!
What are you doing?
Get off me!
God!
Sit on the bed and keep your hands where we can see them.
The year was 1988.
A nasty virus crashed 1,500 systems in one day.
1,507.
It got you 7 years' probation.
No computer.
No touchtone phones.
Must have been hell, huh, Zero Cool?
A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system.
You were our prime suspect.
Till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
We believe that Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus.
He or his accomplice has a disk that Mr Belford needs to disable that virus.
We want you to help us find it.
Gill.
Loser.
I can't believe you were only 11 when you wrote this.
It's quite an impressive virus.
Dade.
I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but... we're hackers.
For us, there's no such thing as family and friends.
We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies.
Let's make a treaty.
I'm sorry.
Who are you?
I'm the one who understands you.
Now, can we be allies?
Nah.
I don't play well with others.
Shit!
Come on!
Watch which friends you do play with.
With your record, you could land in jail or get expelled.
No college.
No future.
Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
I'll be in touch.
He's fine.
Oh, and Dade,
- try to stay out of trouble, okay?
- Blow me.
Thank you.
Her Mom makes big bucks writing books for women.
Stuff like 'Women Who Love Men Who Are Emotional Amoebae'.
That explains a lot.
Big man, stepping in.
Coming through.
Big man, big boots.
You look good, girl.
- Yo, what's up, Nikon?
- In the house, man.
Thanks.
Dade, man.
You made it.
Houston, we have lift-off.
Three o'clock.
Check it.
Don't look right away!
Look at her, man.
Lisa Blair.
26 East 7th Street, apartment 16.
5554817.
Boom!
- How'd you know that?
- I got a photographic memory.
It's a curse.
Lisa!
Oh!
Look at that pooper, man.
Spandex, it's a privilege, not a right.
Hi, my name's Vicki and I'm an addict.
Hi.
My name's Hank and I'm an addict.
My name's Joey, but...
I'm not an addict.
No, really.
Listen.
I got in trouble with my computer.
My lawyer told the judge I'm an addict, but I'm not addicted to my computer.
No, really.
I'm not an addict.
I'm not.
Can I get some more coffee?
Yo!
Check this out.
This is insanely great.
It's got a 28.8 bps modem.
- Yeah?
Display?
- Active matrix.
A million psychedelic colours.
This baby is sweet.
- I want it.
- I want it to have my children.
- Bet it looks crispy in the dark.
- Hit the light.
Shit!
Come on.
Get out.
- Was that her top?
- One-handed.
Difficulty rating?
Seven.
Wow!
Burn's wetware matches her software.
Burn?
What are you doing here?
We're sorry!
Just looking at your fly laptop.
It's hype, you know.
You're in the butter zone now, baby.
Yeah, it is.
I want to triple the RAM.
Leopard boy and the deceptor cons.
Kate!
You're not going into that computer shit now, right?
Later, babe.
- Yeah, right.
- The sensitive type.
What's he doing here?
He's my guest, Burn.
You're Acid Burn?
!
You booted me out of OTV.
- What?
- I'm Crash Override.
You're the moron who's been invading my turf?
Whoa, whoa!
Crash... and Burn!
Murphy kid turn you down?
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
Pervert.
What are you talking about?
The FBI computer holds files on 20 million Americans.
I just hacked into it.
Congratulations.
I have access to every piece of data stored on Dade Murphy's parents.
His parents separated five years ago, reconciled, then divorced last year.
Custody battle.
Boy chose to go with his mother.
So?
So, we get the mother, we get the boy.
What the hell are you doing?
It's cool, I'm just looking.
- It's too much machine for you.
- Yeah?
I hope you don't screw like you type.
It has a killer refresh rate.
P6 chip.
Triple the speed of the Pentium.
It's not just the chip.
It has a PCI bus.
But... you knew that.
Indeed.
RISC architecture is going to change everything.
Yeah.
RISC is good.
Sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
Crash Override.
What was it?
'Mess with the best, die like the rest'?
Yeah.
Are you challenging me?
Name your stakes.
If I win, you become my slave.
Your slave?
You wish.
You'll do shit work.
Scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
Deal.
And if I win?
Make it my first born.
- Make it our first date.
- You won't win.
And you have to smile.
I don't do dates.
But I don't lose, either.
So you're on.
Here's the deal, the chosen contest:
To hassle Secret Service Agent Richard Gill and get one back for Joey.
Our decisions are final by a vote oftwo to one.
No appeals.
The duel will last until we declare a winner.
Use only the access codes and passwords in your collection.
No help from us.
Talkin' to me?
Any questions?
Yeah.
Who's going to notify his next of kin?
He's in the personal ads.
'Disappointed white male, cross-dresser, looking for discreet friend 'to bring dreams to reality.
'Leather, lace and water sports.
Transvestites welcome. '
I know where you can stick it.
Ijust want to lick your earlobes and your lips.
You want to lick something?
Lick this!
That's why they call me Stallion.
That's disgusting!
My heart is steaming for you spank you with...
- I'll spank your ass!
...turn you over and...
- Agghh!
Animal!
Hey!
Hey!
Do you know who I am?
Do you know who I am?
This is Accounting, sir.
You inquired about Agent Richard Gill?
Yes.
- Our records indicate he's deceased.
- I'm what?
- Dead.
- Dead?
Yeah.
Like rigor mortis, habeas corpus.
- Very impressive.
- Superhero-like, even.
Yeah, whatever.
What's the score?
Tie.
Come on.
Due to Mr Gill's untimely demise,
- you'll have to improvise the next round.
- Right.
I win, you wear a dress on our date.
And if I win, so do you.
Deal.
Dade.
I didn't know your size, so...
I guessed.
You will stick with the deal?
Thanks.
You wanted to know who I am, Zero Cool?
Let me explain... the new world order.
Governments and corporations need people like you... and me.
We are the samurai, the keyboard cowboys.
And those other people out there, who have no idea what's going on, are the cattle.
Moo.
I need your help.
You need my help.
Let me help you earn your spurs.
Think about it.
Enjoy the laptop...
Cool.
Tell me where the disk is.
You look pitiful.
Okay, you're not grounded any more.
- Yo, what's up?
- I gotta talk to you, man.
Listen.
- I copied a garbage file.
- So?
A garbage file has shit in it.
It's hot or something.
Joey, a garbage file holds odd data.
Stuff that's been erased.
I copied it from Ellingson, okay?
They're asking me about it.
Will you take a look for me?
Shit, Joey.
You got a tail.
Shit!
I am watching you.
Wake up.
Ramon?
Wake up.
Ramon, it's time for school.
Come on.
Stick your hands up!
Don't move!
Déjà vu!
You're under arrest under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.
¡La computadora de mierda!
¡Que te dije de no estar jugando con esa
- computadora!
- What are you waiting for?
Arrest me!
You get one call.
Uno.
Understand?
Operator Services?
- I'm having trouble with a number.
- What number, please?
5554202.
- Just one moment.
- Thank you.
- Hello?
- It's me.
I'm freaking.
Joey really hacked into Ellingson.
He gave me the disk he copied and now I'm in jail for some serious shit!
Stuff I didn't even do, like inserting a virus called 'da Vinci'?
And they keep asking about you guys.
- Think they're gonna bust us?
- Yeah.
You better figure out what's on that disk 'cause we're being framed.
It's in the place where I put that thing once.
Hi.
Now I see what all the fuss is about.
You have company.
- Nice room.
- We need your help.
Do my ears deceive me?
No, no.
Truce, you guys.
We got a higher purpose here.
A wake-up call for the Nintendo generation.
We demand free access to data.
Well, it comes with some responsibility.
'When I was a child, I spake as a child, I thought as a child.
'But when I became a man, I put away childish things'.
What?
It's Corinthians One,
Chapter 13, verse 11, you know?
Come on.
Phreak and Joey are being framed.
Can you help us find out what's on this disk?
I can't.
Everybody who touches that disk gets arrested.
I can't risk arrest.
I'm sorry.
Maybe I should go to the bathroom.
What is it with you?
We're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help.
I really need your help.
I'm sorry.
I can't.
Could you copy the disk?
And just hide it in case we get busted so we have a copy for our lawyers.
Something that hasn't been tampered with.
You guys help yourself to anything in the fridge.
Cereal has.
Okay.
I'll copy it.
Thank you.
The girl.
The girl has the disk I need.
I told you.
I don't play well with others.
Turn on your laptop.
Set it to receive a file.
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington.
Forgery, embezzlement, two drug convictions plus jumping parole.
Once arrested, she will have no trial, she will not pass 'Go', she will go directly to jail.
Then I change this file back to the original and your mom disappears.
That's bullshit.
What can I tell you?
Computers never lie, kid.
Your mom will be arrested, handcuffed and later strip-searched.
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
Kid, don't threaten me.
There are worse things than death...
and I can do all of them.
Talk to me.
I got it.
But Kate didn't know what's on it, she came to me to figure it out.
She didn't plant the virus.
You leave her alone.
Don't worry, kid.
If she's innocent, she'll be fine.
Your mommy's safe now, okay?
Kate, Listen.
Hold on.
- I have to tell you something.
- Hold on!
- It's so lean and clean.
- Looks like a hacker wrote it.
Come here.
Look at this.
This thing is tense.
That's ill, man.
It's incomplete.
This'll take forever to figure out.
I'll make some coffee.
Tag, you're in.
- It's not a virus.
It's a worm.
- What's it eat?
It nibbles.
You see all of this?
This is all of Ellingson's financial transactions.
From million dollar deals to $10 some guy pays for gas.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
No-one's caught it because the money isn't really gone.
It's just data being shifted around.
And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part.
Check it out.
Here it's already running at twice the speed as when it started.
- At this rate, the run ends in...
... two days.
- It's already eaten about...
... 21.8 million bucks.
Whoever wrote this needs someone to take the fall.
That's Phreak and Joey and us.
We have to find out where the money's going before the worm disappears, so we can find out who created it.
I know who wrote it!
What?
This Ellingson security creep.
I gave him a copy of the disk you gave me.
You what?
I didn't know what was on it.
Oh, man!
That's universally stupid, man.
Yo, man.
You're an amateur.
Why did he come to you?
I've got a record.
I was Zero Cool.
Zero Cool crashed 1,507 systems in one day.
Biggest crash in history.
Front page New York Times, August 10, 1988.
I thought you was black, man.
Yo, man, this is Zero Cool!
That's far out!
This is Zero Cool, man!
Yeah, that's great.
There goes MIT.
- I'll make it up!
- How?
I'll hack the Gibson.
They'll trace you like that, man.
The cops will find you with a smoking gun.
Fucked if I care, man.
Even with the password, it'd take you ten minutes to get in, then you'd have to find the files.
The cops would have you in five minutes.
Oh, wow!
We are fried!
Never send a boy to do a woman's job.
With me, we can do it in seven.
I help, we do it in six.
I gotta save all your asses!
I help, we do it in five minutes.
Okay.
Let's go shopping.
You know, if I didn't live by a strict code of honour, I might take advantage of this situation.
Erotically, as it were.
All right.
Hold it right there.
Shit!
My subway defence system.
He's way down there.
Ta-da!
- Yo, brain-dead... the manual!
- Oops!
Hey!
Truck!
Find it?
The phone's all right.
The problem must be somewhere else.
They had a large chunk of the garbage file?
- How much do they know?
- Enough to implicate us.
You said the worm was untraceable.
Yeah... to civilians.
But they're hackers.
Don't worry.
We just launch the da Vinci virus.
- Then they'll all be put away.
- Launch the da Vinci virus?
- You can't do that.
- No-one believes the guilty.
By the time they realise the truth, we'll be long gone with all our money.
Look, there is no right and wrong.
There is only fun... and boring.
A 30-year prison sentence sounds pretty dull to me.
Who do you prefer serves it?
Us... or them?
Unless $5 million is transferred to the following account in seven days,
I will capsize five Ellingson tankers.
The virus goes off tomorrow at 10.30AM, and those hackers tried to get into our system again.
I insist you take more strenuous action or Ellingson Mineral will hold the Secret Service responsible.
Get me arrest warrants on Kate Libby, alias Acid Burn,
Emmanuel Goldstein, alias Cereal Killer,
Dade Murphy, alias Crash Override, also known as
Zero Cool, and Paul Cook, alias Lord Nikon.
Pick them up tomorrow at 9.00AM.
Snoop on to them as they snoop on to us.
- Yeah, it's Kate.
- Hey, Burn.
We got a little problem.
So, what've we got?
Well, 50 passwords, plus whatever Polaroid-head got inside Ellingson.
I got a lot, right?
I don't know how many, but... my head hurts.
Yo, check this out.
- What's a da Vinci virus?
- What?
It's a memo about how they'll deal with the oil spills that happened on the 14th.
What oil spills?
- Brain-dead.
Today's the 13th.
- Well, this hasn't happened yet.
The 14th is the day the worm ends it run.
Isn't the da Vinci virus what Phreak's being charged with?
Look. 'Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers'.
They blame hackers!
Damn!
A worm and a virus?
The plot thickens.
Whoa, whoa!
Where are you going?
I got an idea.
We got a few hours until we're arrested.
Stay low.
I'm going to get help.
I'll beep you.
Are you coming?
May the Force be with you, man.
There they are!
Razor and Blade?
!
They're flakes!
They're elite!
Let's get 'em.
Get off the stage, man!
Get off!
I lost them!
Where were you?
I don't like this.
I definitely don't like this.
What do you want?
We come in peace.
We need your help, if you're up to it.
She's buff.
Ballsy.
Let's keep her.
Waste the dude.
A virus called da Vinci will cause oil spills tomorrow at 10.30AM.
It's somehow connected to that worm.
We need you to overload the Gibson so we can kill da Vinci and copy the worm.
She's rabid... but cute.
See, we're very busy.
A TV network that wishes to remain nameless is interested in our show.
Let's go, Kate.
Wait.
Nobody said no.
But you will need more than just two media icons like us.
You need an army.
That's it.
An electronic army.
If I were us,
I'd get on the Internet, send out a major distress signal.
Hackers of the world, unite!
How will you take care of the cops?
I'm blowing up!
It's Kate.
Grand Central.
Let's hit it!
You're the man!
You're the man!
Joey, you made it!
Okay.
Use your best viruses to buy us some time.
We must get in and copy the worm.
I had to do that to break the tension.
- Cereal.
Go fix the phones.
- Roger.
Joey, take his place.
- Me?
- Take his place.
Do it.
You can do it.
Ready?
Let's boot up.
- What is it?
What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Just a minor glitch.
A minor glitch with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe.
There's a new virus in the database.
What's happening?
It's eating memory.
What do I do?
Type 'cookie', you idiot.
I'll head them off at the pass.
We have a bug attacking all log-in files.
Run anti-virus.
Give me a systems display.
Die, dickweeds!
A rabbit's in the system.
Send a flu shot.
Rabbit?
Flu shot?
Someone talk to me.
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file then spreads like cancer.
Cancer?
Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream.
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,
Life is but a dream.
Whoa!
Falling off!
It's a Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
There's too many garbage files.
I need more time.
They're at Grand Central station, lower level.
Don't screw up.
Get out of here!
Everyone, let's move!
Move it!
Get the hell out of the way!
Come on!
Grand Central!
Game's over.
Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.
You're not good enough to beat me.
Maybe I'm not.
But we are,
- you asshole!
- Give it up!
Just give it up.
Are we fashionably late?
Okay, let's go!
We have massive infection.
Multiple GPI viruses from remote nodes.
- They're going for the kernel.
- Colonel who?
The command processor.
The brain!
Cancer, brain.
Brain cancer!
What's going on?
In short, Duke, a shitstorm.
Move!
Go!
I found it!
I found it!
This is the end, my friend.
Thank you for calling.
Shit!
He got me!
Joey's gettin' stupid busy.
Joey, go after the worm.
You're the closest.
It's root, slash, period, 'workspace', slash, period, 'garbage', period.
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Freeze!
Come on!
All right!
Wow!
Kill the Gibson!
Roger that.
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Is that all you got?
Come on!
Let's see what else you can do.
You talking to me, huh?
Are you nuts?
Come at me!
They're in the kernel.
Help me!
The tankers have stopped capsizing.
Ballast tanks emptying.
Should be okay.
Little pissant!
Yes!
Let's get outta here!
Freeze!
They're trashing our rights, man.
They're trashing the flow of data.
Trashing!
Trashing!
Trashing!
Hack the planet!
- Hack the planet!
- Shut up and get in!
Hack the planet!
Hack the planet!
- Hello.
- We caught them.
- Good.
- Red-handed.
You won't be having any more trouble from them.
Me, all right?
I did it.
She knows shit about computers.
She's just my girlfriend.
I suggest you modify your attitude, because you are floating and I am about to flush your ass.
Mrs Murphy is here to see you, sir.
- Are you crazy?
What are you doing?
- Trying to help you.
- Dade.
- What?
Thanks for your help.
Your son is in big trouble.
He violated his probation and has engaged in criminal activities.
My son happens to be a genius.
He understands things that you won't comprehend if you live to be 100.
He would never use his knowledge to harm others.
The news crew you requested is here.
Good.
I have some things to tell them.
Your son is facing 30 felony counts in an ongoing investigation.
You face arrest if you do that.
I don't care if I face certain death.
Mrs Murphy stays right here.
Wow.
She's great.
Yeah.
...and attacked the Ellingson network.
Is this the last we've seen of this kind of espionage?
No.
Hackers are a grave threat to the national security.
This incident just proves that we need
- increased funding to stop...
- We're getting interference.
Hola, boys and girls.
It is I, Cereal Killer, making my first worldwide global television appearance.
Yes, that's right.
I'm here to tell you about this heinous scheme hatched within Ellingson Mineral.
But for what?
World domination?
Nay.
Something far more tacky.
A virus called da Vinci, that would cause Ellingson tankers to capsize, was to be blamed on innocent hackers.
This virus was really a smokescreen.
What could be so important to protect that someone would create such a nasty, anti-social, uncool virus program?
But why?
Could it be to cover the tracks of this worm program?
A worm that was to steal 25 million bucks.
The password for this worm belongs to Margo Wallace,
- head of Public Relations at Ellingson.
- Oh, my God!
And Eugene Belford,
- computer security officer.
- Son of a bitch!
What's this?
The account in the Bahamas where the money was to be stashed?
I think so.
Unlucky!
Yo.
I kinda feel like God.
Plague?
Eugene?
I don't even know how to work the VCR let alone a computer.
Get off!
Listen, I'll make a deal.
Eugene Belford.
I know where his mother is.
Get off me!
I need a lawyer!
Here you are, Mr Babbage.
Flight time to Tokyo is 14 hours.
Can I get you anything else?
Just a pillow, please.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
What's going on?
Let go of me!
Stewardess!
I'll never fly this airline again!
You look good in a dress.
You would have looked better.
Wanna go for a swim?
I can't believe they decided you won.
They didn't.
The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date.
Anyway, you're pretty good.
You're elite.
Yeah?
If you'd said that at the start, you would have avoided a lot of trouble.
Beat that!
You know,
- I've been having these weird...
... dreams.
Subtitles By Rajanee
- Upstairs!
- What's going on?
Who are you?
Dade!
Dade!
Knock it down.
The defendant, Dade Murphy, who calls himself 'Zero Cool', has repeatedly committed criminal acts of a malicious nature.
This defendant possesses a superior intelligence, which he uses to a destructive and antisocial end.
His computer virus crashed 1507 systems, including Wall Street trading systems, single-handedly causing a seven-point drop in the New York stock market.
Dade Murphy, I hereby fine your family $45,000.
I sentence you to probation.
You are forbidden to use a computer or a touchtone telephone until the day of your 18th birthday.
- Dade?
- Yeah, Mom?
What are you doing?
Taking over a TV network.
Finish up, honey.
Go to sleep.
And happy birthday.
Security, Norm...
Norman speaking.
Norman.
This is Mr Eddie Vedder from Accounting.
I had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on.
I'm in big trouble.
You know anything about computers?
Gee...
My BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I have this big project due tomorrow for Mr Kawasaki.
If I screw up, he'll make me commit hari-kari.
You know these Japanese management techniques.
Could you read me the number on the modem?
It's a little boxy thing with switches on it.
It lets my computer talk to the one there.
212... 5554240.
So-called American Indians, Latinos, and blacks are genetically mediocre.
Yak, yak, yak.
Get a job.
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...
The Outer Limits.
Zero...
No, wait.
Unbelievable.
A hacker.
Yeah, okay, Acid Burn.
That's enough.
Shit on me!
Good morning.
Did you unpack your stuff yet?
Up all night again?
Can this wait until both of my eyes are open?
Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll get some sleep?
He's been playing with his computer all night for a week.
Yes, he could be playing with himself.
Yes, I'll ask.
Dade, you like girls, don't you?
Yeah.
I just haven't found one as charming as you.
You haven't done anything stupid, right?
Right, Dade?
Right, Mom.
And I'm still a virgin.
You hooked it up to the phone, didn't you?
Dade, turn the shower off!
You screw up again and you won't get into college.
I'm sorry we had to move in your senior year.
I didn't want to sell the house but I had to take this job.
You know that.
You'll love New York.
It's the city that never sleeps.
I miss you, too, baby.
Claro que sí.
Excuse me.
Chill, man.
I'm talking to Venezuela.
I'm sorry.
Where's the principal's office?
I can't help you, kid.
Do you have your transfer forms?
It's a straightforward question.
Do you speak English?
Sorry, you wanted...
Transfer forms.
Are you coming?
The gym is through there and the cafeteria is through there.
Great.
Cool.
What's your name?
Kate.
Kate Libby.
Here's your class.
My class.
I'm not in your class?
No, you're not in my class.
Give me time.
- You new?
- Yeah.
Tell him about the pool, Kate.
Pool?
There's an Olympic-size swimming pool on the roof.
Take the stairs over there.
Yeah.
Sure.
Thanks.
Hey!
Hold the door!
No pool.
Oh, my God.
He found the pool.
I'm Mr Simpson.
I'm subbing for Ms Bayless, who was arrested at the anti-fur rally.
I know some ofyou kids got computers at home, but these are school property.
Chapter One.
'Designing Graphical Interface'.
What's your interest in Kate Libby?
Academic, purely sexual?
Homicidal.
What's up, man?
I'm the Phreak.
The Fantom Phreak?
The King of Nynex?
I know you play the game.
Phreak, Phreak, Phreak.
Dude, dude, dude.
Joey!
One more 'dude' and I'll slap the shit out of you.
You gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man.
You're hopeless!
- Check it.
- I need a handle.
I don't have an identity until I have a handle.
You're right about that.
Check it.
Friday.
Wait.
How about The Master of Disaster?
You're utterly hopeless, man.
Ultra Laser...
Doctor Doom!
Tell me what you need.
Records?
Tapes?
Any kind offormat or disk.
Check this out, each of you.
Compilation tapes of my own making.
I call this 'The Greatest Zukes Album', featuring Hendrix, Joplin, Mama Cass, Belushi, all great artists who asphyxiated on their own vomit!
You can't get this in stores!
Please deposit $5 for the first minute.
Thank you.
No, thank you.
That's a nice score for a girl.
Think you can do better?
I'll give it a shot.
Is this kid bothering you, Kate?
Could I get some room here?
Why don't you come up here?
He's good!
Well, it looks like I'm on top.
Congratulations.
No-one's ever beat her before.
You just made an enemy for life.
Boy meets world.
Let's go.
- Who's that?
- Curtis.
What's he do?
You're looking at it.
He looks slick all day.
Joey!
What's up?
Oh, my God!
You...?
Way cool!
You saw that?
What the hell is going on?
Pool on the roof must be leaking.
Oh, man.
This is going to be good.
'God gave men brains larger than dogs so they wouldn't hump women's legs at cocktail parties'.
Ruth Libby.
I'm not sure your mother qualifies as a significant 20th century author.
Her last book sold 2 million copies.

Ginsberg.
Nice.
Very nice.
He's not in this class.
I said give me time.
He's not enrolled in this class.
Well, he's on my list.

Ozzy Osbourne.
You.
What is your name?
Emmanuel Goldstein, sir.
You, however, are not on my list.
This isn't wood shop class?
Class crashing.
Come on.
Now get out.
Thank you, sir.
How was school?
- What did we learn in school today?
- Revenge.
Ahh.
Did we meet someone special?
No.
No-one special.
I have to get back to work.
Would you please try to fill these out?
Don't worry, it's only the rest of your life.
Anything else?
Want me to mow the lawn?
Oops, I forgot.
New York, no grass.
And unpack.
You can sit at home and do absolutely nothing and your name goes through 17 computers a day.
'1984'?
Yeah, right.
That's a typo.
Orwell's here and living large.
We have no names, man.
No names!
Can I score a fry?
Meet Cereal Killer.
As in Fruit Loops.
But he does know things.
Anyway, guys, listen.
I'm in this computer, right?
I'm looking around...
You got those Crayola books?
Yeah, technicolour rainbow.
Green one.
What is that?
Let me see?
- What are these?
- International UNIX environments.
Luscious orange.
Computer security criteria...
DOD standards.
The pink-shirt book... guide to IBM PCs.
So-called due to the nasty pink shirt the guy wears on the cover.
Devil book, the UNIX bible.
- What's that?
- Dragon book, compiler design.
- What's that?
- The Red book.
NSA-trusted networks.
Otherwise known as 'The Ugly Red Book That Won't Fit On A Shelf'.
Anyway, guys.
Come on.
I'm in this computer, right.
I'm looking around, throwing commands.
I don't know what it does or anything.
It's choice.
It's beautiful.
Four hours just messing around in there.
Finally, I figure out... that it's a bank.
Okay, wait.
It's a bank.
So, this morning, I check the paper, some cash machine in, like, Bumsville, Idaho, spits out $700 into the street.
- That's kinda cool.
- That was me.
- I did that.
- You did this from your house?
Are you stoned or stupid?
You don't hack a bank from your house!
You get nailed by the FBI.
Are your brains in your ass?
Don't you know anything?
It's universally stupid, man.
I don't know things because you guys won't tell me anything.
Right?
What are the three most used passwords?
'Love', 'Secret' and 'Sex'.
But not in that order, necessarily.
Right?
Don't forget 'God'.
System operators love to use 'God'.
Male ego.
To be elite, you have to do a righteous hack, not this accidental shit.
Which means you score one of those Gibsons, man.
Those supercomputers they use to do physics and look for oil.
No way, man.
Security is too tight.
Maybe.
But if I wanted to hack some heavy metal,
I'd work my way in through some back door.
Oh, man.
Wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons?
Who ate all of my fries?
- Joey!
- No, I didn't touch your fries.
- Cereal, man.
You owe me a pack.
- It was him.
- Lay off that shit, man.
- I'm gonna hit you!
Yes!
Home run, home run.
Okay, okay.
You and me, Lucy.
We're gonna show them, baby.
Ow!
Mr Belford?
My name is The Plague.
Mr The Plague, something weird is happening on the net.
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
One of the Gibsons is working really hard.
We got one person on-line but with the workload of 10 users.
I think we got a hacker.
Okay, we need proof that we were here.
Yeah.
Garbage.
Give me Garbage.
Shit.
Never fear,
I is here.
- I located the activity to terminal 23.
- Let's echo 23, see what's up.
God wouldn't be up this late.
Shit!
Get me the switching control centre.
I need to trace this call.
Hold on, Mom.
Hold on one second.
- Open the door, Joseph.
- Yeah, okay.
There you go.
Bed.
Sleep.
Now!
Sweet dreams, Joseph.
He's gone.
Did you get a trace?
Yeah, we got him.
Good.
Nice place, huh?
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn?
- You know who he is?
- No.
Don't know who he is.
Do you?
Nikon!
Lord Nikon, this is...
Crash Override.
Never heard of you.
You done anything?
No.
Come on!
What?
Your Mom buy you a 'puter for Christmas?
- Does he know anything?
- Sure.
He's elite.
Come in.
- Nikon, can I crash at your place tonight?
- Again?
Yeah, sure.
Hackers penetrate and ravage public and private computer systems, infecting them with viruses...
Who are these guys?
Richard Gill.
Hacker enemy number one.
Real boner.
Showtime.
Showtime!
- What's going on?
- Four, three, two, one...
Welcome to our show!
Hack the Planet!
Hack the Planet!
For late night hacks, Jolt Cola, soft drink ofthe elite hacker.
- Who are these guys?
- That's Razor and Blade.
Razor and Blade?
That's right.
This is a pay-phone.
Don't ask.
As you can see, this isjust a simple micro-cassette recorder.
Hook it up to the phone, and drop in five bucks in quarters.
Record the tone the coins make, hang up, get your money back.
Never again pay for a service that would be cheap, if it weren't run by profiteering gluttons.
Remember, hacking is more than just a crime.
It's a survival trait.
I'm a real wild child, I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one
Thank you!
Thank you very much!
Joey!
Joey!
Thank you!
Freeze!
- What?
- Get out of there!
Out!
- Joey!
- Get in there!
Sit down!
Lucy!
Where are you taking her?
Joey!
- How's it going, Ray?
- Looks good, sir.
We got an uncorrupted hard drive.
In English, please.
I didn't protect the President for ten years to finish my career feeling like an idiot.
I'm sorry, sir.
He didn't have time to erase his computer files.
Good.
Let's finish up here.
Take him in for interrogation.
Agent Gill, can you spare a moment?
Why, of course, Jennifer.
- Joey!
- How dangerous are hackers?
Hackers penetrate and ravage public and private computer systems, infecting them with viruses and stealing sensitive materials.
These people are terrorists.
Morning, gentlemen.
Please, be seated.
I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
Once again, don't call me Eugene.
Our recent intruder penetrated using a superuser account, giving him access to our whole system.
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
Someone didn't bother reading my memo on commonly used passwords.
As I meticulously pointed out, the foremost used passwords are...
'Love', 'Sex', 'Secret' and 'God'.
So would Your Holiness care to change her password?
A hacker planted the virus.
Virus?
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty and flooded its tanks.
Excuse me?
The little boat flipped over.
A virus planted within the Gibson system claimed responsibility.
It left a note?
Unless $5 million is transferred to the following account in 7 days,
I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson fleet.
- Is that...?
- That is the virus.
Leonardo da Vinci.
We have 26 ships at sea and don't know which ones are infected.
Well, put the ship's ballast under manual control.
There's no such thing any more.
These ships are totally computerised.
They rely on satellite navigation which links them to our network, and the virus, wherever they are.
What are we supposed to do?
Luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer.
I traced the hacker's call.
The Secret Service picked him up.
I'll search his files for the original virus code and eliminate it.
We expect you to get on this right away.
- How soon?
- As fast as I can.
This is common in corporations as large as ours.
Don't worry about it.
The Secret Service is helping us out, 100 percent.
We'll be in touch.
What the hell was that all about?
I had to move fast.
The hacker copied my garbage file.
What?
I created da Vinci so we could get the Secret Service to arrest the hacker and seize the equipment, which we can't do alone.
- I don't want to go to jail for this.
- Relax.
Think about the $25 million.
But you created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster.
Just to arrest some hacker kid?
Basically, yes.
Jesus!
You're sick, Eugene.
I'll take care of this.
I can cancel it any time.
I don't need the code.
What better way to confiscate the disk and find out how much of the garbage file was copied.
Get it!
Why did I ever trust you?
Get the file, otherwise you'll lose all your toys.
Did you find the virus program on the disks we confiscated?
No.
He's either very smart or very stupid.
Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice.
We'll release him.
Keep tight surveillance and see if he leads us to your disk.
Unit 3, outside suspect Joey Pardella's apartment.
Suspect still grounded... by his mother.
Listen to this bullshit.
'This is our world now.
The world of the electron and the switch, 'the beauty ofthe baud.
'We exist without nationality, skin colour or religious bias.
'You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us, 'and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.
'Yes, I am a criminal.
My crime is that of curiosity.
'I am a hacker and this is my manifesto.'
Right?
Manifesto?
'You may stop me, 'but you can't stop us all.'
That's cool.
- Cool?
- Yeah, cool.
You think it's cool?
- It's cool.
- It's not cool.
It's commie bullshit.
Can I crash at your place tonight?
What's with him?
His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since.
You hear about Joey's bust?
Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
You think he could hack a Gibson?
- Did you talk to him?
- No.
His mom says he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.
And no 'consorting with computer friends'.
The Secret Service is out to get him.
Want to go to a big party tonight?
It's at Kate's.
I thought so.
A little pelvis.
A little pelvis.
What the hell are you doing?
Plague!
Plague!
Gill.
I think we got something.
Yuk!
Hard copy!
Dade Murphy.
- Secret Service!
- Don't move!
What are you...?
Shut up!
What are you doing?
Get off me!
God!
Sit on the bed and keep your hands where we can see them.
The year was 1988.
A nasty virus crashed 1,500 systems in one day.
1,507.
It got you 7 years' probation.
No computer.
No touchtone phones.
Must have been hell, huh, Zero Cool?
A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system.
You were our prime suspect.
Till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
We believe that Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus.
He or his accomplice has a disk that Mr Belford needs to disable that virus.
We want you to help us find it.
Gill.
Loser.
I can't believe you were only 11 when you wrote this.
It's quite an impressive virus.
Dade.
I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but... we're hackers.
For us, there's no such thing as family and friends.
We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies.
Let's make a treaty.
I'm sorry.
Who are you?
I'm the one who understands you.
Now, can we be allies?
Nah.
I don't play well with others.
Shit!
Come on!
Watch which friends you do play with.
With your record, you could land in jail or get expelled.
No college.
No future.
Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
I'll be in touch.
He's fine.
Oh, and Dade,
- try to stay out of trouble, okay?
- Blow me.
Thank you.
Her Mom makes big bucks writing books for women.
Stuff like 'Women Who Love Men Who Are Emotional Amoebae'.
That explains a lot.
Big man, stepping in.
Coming through.
Big man, big boots.
You look good, girl.
- Yo, what's up, Nikon?
- In the house, man.
Thanks.
Dade, man.
You made it.
Houston, we have lift-off.
Three o'clock.
Check it.
Don't look right away!
Look at her, man.
Lisa Blair.
26 East 7th Street, apartment 16.
5554817.
Boom!
- How'd you know that?
- I got a photographic memory.
It's a curse.
Lisa!
Oh!
Look at that pooper, man.
Spandex, it's a privilege, not a right.
Hi, my name's Vicki and I'm an addict.
Hi.
My name's Hank and I'm an addict.
My name's Joey, but...
I'm not an addict.
No, really.
Listen.
I got in trouble with my computer.
My lawyer told the judge I'm an addict, but I'm not addicted to my computer.
No, really.
I'm not an addict.
I'm not.
Can I get some more coffee?
Yo!
Check this out.
This is insanely great.
It's got a 28.8 bps modem.
- Yeah?
Display?
- Active matrix.
A million psychedelic colours.
This baby is sweet.
- I want it.
- I want it to have my children.
- Bet it looks crispy in the dark.
- Hit the light.
Shit!
Come on.
Get out.
- Was that her top?
- One-handed.
Difficulty rating?
Seven.
Wow!
Burn's wetware matches her software.
Burn?
What are you doing here?
We're sorry!
Just looking at your fly laptop.
It's hype, you know.
You're in the butter zone now, baby.
Yeah, it is.
I want to triple the RAM.
Leopard boy and the deceptor cons.
Kate!
You're not going into that computer shit now, right?
Later, babe.
- Yeah, right.
- The sensitive type.
What's he doing here?
He's my guest, Burn.
You're Acid Burn?
!
You booted me out of OTV.
- What?
- I'm Crash Override.
You're the moron who's been invading my turf?
Whoa, whoa!
Crash... and Burn!
Murphy kid turn you down?
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
Pervert.
What are you talking about?
The FBI computer holds files on 20 million Americans.
I just hacked into it.
Congratulations.
I have access to every piece of data stored on Dade Murphy's parents.
His parents separated five years ago, reconciled, then divorced last year.
Custody battle.
Boy chose to go with his mother.
So?
So, we get the mother, we get the boy.
What the hell are you doing?
It's cool, I'm just looking.
- It's too much machine for you.
- Yeah?
I hope you don't screw like you type.
It has a killer refresh rate.
P6 chip.
Triple the speed of the Pentium.
It's not just the chip.
It has a PCI bus.
But... you knew that.
Indeed.
RISC architecture is going to change everything.
Yeah.
RISC is good.
Sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
Crash Override.
What was it?
'Mess with the best, die like the rest'?
Yeah.
Are you challenging me?
Name your stakes.
If I win, you become my slave.
Your slave?
You wish.
You'll do shit work.
Scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
Deal.
And if I win?
Make it my first born.
- Make it our first date.
- You won't win.
And you have to smile.
I don't do dates.
But I don't lose, either.
So you're on.
Here's the deal, the chosen contest:
To hassle Secret Service Agent Richard Gill and get one back for Joey.
Our decisions are final by a vote oftwo to one.
No appeals.
The duel will last until we declare a winner.
Use only the access codes and passwords in your collection.
No help from us.
Talkin' to me?
Any questions?
Yeah.
Who's going to notify his next of kin?
He's in the personal ads.
'Disappointed white male, cross-dresser, looking for discreet friend 'to bring dreams to reality.
'Leather, lace and water sports.
Transvestites welcome.'
I know where you can stick it.
ljust want to lick your earlobes and your lips.
You want to lick something?
Lick this!
That's why they call me Stallion.
That's disgusting!
My heart is steaming for you spank you with...
- I'll spank your ass!
...turn you over and...
- Agghh!
Animal!
Hey!
Hey!
Do you know who I am?
Do you know who I am?
This is Accounting, sir.
You inquired about Agent Richard Gill?
Yes.
- Our records indicate he's deceased.
- I'm what?
- Dead.
- Dead?
Yeah.
Like rigor mortis, habeas corpus.
- Very impressive.
- Superhero-like, even.
Yeah, whatever.
What's the score?
Tie.
Come on.
Due to Mr Gill's untimely demise,
- you'll have to improvise the next round.
- Right.
I win, you wear a dress on our date.
And if I win, so do you.
Deal.
Dade.
I didn't know your size, so...
I guessed.
You will stick with the deal?
Thanks.
You wanted to know who I am, Zero Cool?
Let me explain... the new world order.
Governments and corporations need people like you... and me.
We are the samurai, the keyboard cowboys.
And those otherpeople out there, who have no idea what's going on, are the cattle.
Moo.
I need your help.
You need my help.
Let me help you earn your spurs.
Think about it.
Enjoy the laptop...
Cool.
Tell me where the disk is.
You look pitiful.
Okay, you're not grounded any more.
- Yo, what's up?
- I gotta talk to you, man.
Listen.
- I copied a garbage file.
- So?
A garbage file has shit in it.
It's hot or something.
Joey, a garbage file holds odd data.
Stuff that's been erased.
I copied it from Ellingson, okay?
They're asking me about it.
Will you take a look for me?
Shit, Joey.
You got a tail.
Shit!
I am watching you.
Wake up.
Ramon?
Wake up.
Ramon, it's time for school.
Come on.
Stick your hands up!
Don't move!
Déjà vu!
You're under arrest under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.
¡La computadora de mierda!
¡Que te dije de no estar jugando con esa
- computadora!
- What are you waiting for?
Arrest me!
You get one call.
Uno.
Understand?
Operator Services?
- I'm having trouble with a number.
- What number, please?
5554202.
- Just one moment.
- Thank you.
- Hello?
- It's me.
I'm freaking.
Joey really hacked into Ellingson.
He gave me the disk he copied and now I'm injail for some serious shit!
Stuff I didn't even do, like inserting a virus called 'da Vinci'?
And they keep asking about you guys.
- Think they're gonna bust us?
- Yeah.
You better figure out what's on that disk 'cause we're being framed.
It's in the place where I put that thing once.
Hi.
Now I see what all the fuss is about.
You have company.
- Nice room.
- We need your help.
Do my ears deceive me?
No, no.
Truce, you guys.
We got a higher purpose here.
A wake-up call for the Nintendo generation.
We demand free access to data.
Well, it comes with some responsibility.
'When I was a child, I spake as a child, I thought as a child.
'But when I became a man, I put away childish things'.
What?
It's Corinthians One,
Chapter 13, verse 11, you know?
Come on.
Phreak and Joey are being framed.
Can you help us find out what's on this disk?
I can't.
Everybody who touches that disk gets arrested.
I can't risk arrest.
I'm sorry.
Maybe I should go to the bathroom.
What is it with you?
We're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help.
I really need your help.
I'm sorry.
I can't.
Could you copy the disk?
And just hide it in case we get busted so we have a copy for our lawyers.
Something that hasn't been tampered with.
You guys help yourself to anything in the fridge.
Cereal has.
Okay.
I'll copy it.
Thank you.
The girl.
The girl has the disk I need.
I told you.
I don't play well with others.
Turn on your laptop.
Set it to receive a file.
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington.
Forgery, embezzlement, two drug convictions plus jumping parole.
Once arrested, she will have no trial, she will notpass 'Go', she will go directly tojail.
Then I change this file back to the original and your mom disappears.
That's bullshit.
What can I tell you?
Computers never lie, kid.
Your mom will be arrested, handcuffed and later strip-searched.
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
Kid, don't threaten me.
There are worse things than death...
and I can do all of them.
Talk to me.
I got it.
But Kate didn't know what's on it, she came to me to figure it out.
She didn't plant the virus.
You leave her alone.
Don't worry, kid. lfshe's innocent, she'll be fine.
Your mommy's safe now, okay?
Kate, Listen.
Hold on.
- I have to tell you something.
- Hold on!
- It's so lean and clean.
- Looks like a hacker wrote it.
Come here.
Look at this.
This thing is tense.
That's ill, man.
It's incomplete.
This'll take forever to figure out.
I'll make some coffee.
Tag, you're in.
- It's not a virus.
It's a worm.
- What's it eat?
It nibbles.
You see all of this?
This is all of Ellingson's financial transactions.
From million dollar deals to $10 some guy pays for gas.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
No-one's caught it because the money isn't really gone.
It's just data being shifted around.
And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part.
Check it out.
Here it's already running at twice the speed as when it started.
- At this rate, the run ends in...
...two days.
- It's already eaten about...
...21.8 million bucks.
Whoever wrote this needs someone to take the fall.
That's Phreak and Joey and us.
We have to find out where the money's going before the worm disappears, so we can find out who created it.
I know who wrote it!
What?
This Ellingson security creep.
I gave him a copy of the disk you gave me.
You what?
I didn't know what was on it.
Oh, man!
That's universally stupid, man.
Yo, man.
You're an amateur.
Why did he come to you?
I've got a record.
I was Zero Cool.
Zero Cool crashed 1,507 systems in one day.
Biggest crash in history.
Front page New York Times, August 10, 1988.
I thought you was black, man.
Yo, man, this is Zero Cool!
That's far out!
This is Zero Cool, man!
Yeah, that's great.
There goes MIT.
- I'll make it up!
- How?
I'll hack the Gibson.
They'll trace you like that, man.
The cops will find you with a smoking gun.
Fucked if I care, man.
Even with the password, it'd take you ten minutes to get in, then you'd have to find the files.
The cops would have you in five minutes.
Oh, wow!
We are fried!
Never send a boy to do a woman's job.
With me, we can do it in seven.
I help, we do it in six.
I gotta save all your asses!
I help, we do it in five minutes.
Okay.
Let's go shopping.
You know, if I didn't live by a strict code of honour, I might take advantage of this situation.
Erotically, as it were.
All right.
Hold it right there.
Shit!
My subway defence system.
He's way down there.
Ta-da!
- Yo, brain-dead... the manual!
- Oops!
Hey!
Truck!
Find it?
The phone's all right.
The problem must be somewhere else.
They had a large chunk of the garbage file?
- How much do they know?
- Enough to implicate us.
You said the worm was untraceable.
Yeah... to civilians.
But they're hackers.
Don't worry.
We just launch the da Vinci virus.
- Then they'll all be put away.
- Launch the da Vinci virus?
- You can't do that.
- No-one believes the guilty.
By the time they realise the truth, we'll be long gone with all our money.
Look, there is no right and wrong.
There is only fun... and boring.
A 30-year prison sentence sounds pretty dull to me.
Who do you prefer serves it?
Us... or them?
Unless $5 million is transferred to the following account in seven days,
I will capsize five Ellingson tankers.
The virus goes off tomorrow at 10.30AM, and those hackers tried to get into our system again.
I insist you take more strenuous action or Ellingson Mineral will hold the Secret Service responsible.
Get me arrest warrants on Kate Libby, alias Acid Burn,
Emmanuel Goldstein, alias Cereal Killer,
Dade Murphy, alias Crash Override, also known as
Zero Cool, and Paul Cook, alias Lord Nikon.
Pick them up tomorrow at 9.00AM.
Snoop on to them as they snoop on to us.
- Yeah, it's Kate.
- Hey, Burn.
We got a little problem.
So, what've we got?
Well, 50 passwords, plus whatever Polaroid-head got inside Ellingson.
I got a lot, right?
I don't know how many, but... my head hurts.
Yo, check this out.
- What's a da Vinci virus?
- What?
It's a memo about how they'll deal with the oil spills that happened on the 14th.
What oil spills?
- Brain-dead.
Today's the 13th.
- Well, this hasn't happened yet.
The 14th is the day the worm ends it run.
Isn't the da Vinci virus what Phreak's being charged with?
Look. 'infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers'.
They blame hackers!
Damn!
A worm and a virus?
The plot thickens.
Whoa, whoa!
Where are you going?
I got an idea.
We got a few hours until we're arrested.
Stay low.
I'm going to get help.
I'll beep you.
Are you coming?
May the Force be with you, man.
There they are!
Razor and Blade?
!
They're flakes!
They're elite!
Let's get 'em.
Get off the stage, man!
Get off!
I lost them!
Where were you?
I don't like this.
I definitely don't like this.
What do you want?
We come in peace.
We need your help, if you're up to it.
She's buff.
Ballsy.
Let's keep her.
Waste the dude.
A virus called da Vinci will cause oil spills tomorrow at 10.30AM.
It's somehow connected to that worm.
We need you to overload the Gibson so we can kill da Vinci and copy the worm.
She's rabid... but cute.
See, we're very busy.
A TV network that wishes to remain nameless is interested in our show.
Let's go, Kate.
Wait.
Nobody said no.
But you will need more than just two media icons like us.
You need an army.
That's it.
An electronic army.
If I were us,
I'd get on the Internet, send out a major distress signal.
Hackers of the world, unite!
How will you take care of the cops?
I'm blowing up!
It's Kate.
Grand Central.
Let's hit it!
You're the man!
You're the man!
Joey, you made it!
Okay.
Use your best viruses to buy us some time.
We must get in and copy the worm.
I had to do that to break the tension.
- Cereal.
Go fix the phones.
- Roger.
Joey, take his place.
- Me?
- Take his place.
Do it.
You can do it.
Ready?
Let's boot up.
- What is it?
What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Just a minor glitch.
A minor glitch with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe.
There's a new virus in the database.
What's happening?
It's eating memory.
What do I do?
Type 'cookie', you idiot.
I'll head them off at the pass.
We have a bug attacking all log-in files.
Run anti-virus.
Give me a systems display.
Die, dickweeds!
A rabbit's in the system.
Send a flu shot.
Rabbit?
Flu shot?
Someone talk to me.
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file then spreads like cancer.
Cancer?
Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream.
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,
Life is but a dream.
Whoa!
Falling off!
It's a Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
There's too many garbage files.
I need more time.
They're at Grand Central station, lower level.
Don't screw up.
Get out of here!
Everyone, let's move!
Move it!
Get the hell out of the way!
Come on!
Grand Central!
Game's over.
Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.
You're not good enough to beat me.
Maybe I'm not.
But we are,
- you asshole!
- Give it up!
Just give it up.
Are we fashionably late?
Okay, let's go!
We have massive infection.
Multiple GPI viruses from remote nodes.
- They're going for the kernel.
- Colonel who?
The command processor.
The brain!
Cancer, brain.
Brain cancer!
What's going on?
In short, Duke, a shitstorm.
Move!
Go!
I found it!
I found it!
This is the end, my friend.
Thank you for calling.
Shit!
He got me!
Joey's gettin' stupid busy.
Joey, go after the worm.
You're the closest.
It's root, slash, period, 'workspace', slash, period, 'garbage', period.
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Freeze!
Come on!
All right!
Wow!
Kill the Gibson!
Roger that.
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Is that all you got?
Come on!
Let's see what else you can do.
You talking to me, huh?
Are you nuts?
Come at me!
They're in the kernel.
Help me!
The tankers have stopped capsizing.
Ballast tanks emptying.
Should be okay.
Little pissant!
Yes!
Let's get outta here!
Freeze!
They're trashing our rights, man.
They're trashing the flow of data.
Trashing!
Trashing!
Trashing!
Hack the planet!
- Hack the planet!
- Shut up and get in!
Hack the planet!
Hack the planet!
- Hello.
- We caught them.
- Good.
- Red-handed.
You won't be having any more trouble from them.
Me, all right?
I did it.
She knows shit about computers.
She's just my girlfriend.
I suggest you modify your attitude, because you are floating and I am about to flush your ass.
Mrs Murphy is here to see you, sir.
- Are you crazy?
What are you doing?
- Trying to help you.
- Dade.
- What?
Thanks for your help.
Your son is in big trouble.
He violated his probation and has engaged in criminal activities.
My son happens to be a genius.
He understands things that you won't comprehend if you live to be 100.
He would never use his knowledge to harm others.
The news crew you requested is here.
Good.
I have some things to tell them.
Your son is facing 30 felony counts in an ongoing investigation.
You face arrest if you do that.
I don't care if I face certain death.
Mrs Murphy stays right here.
Wow.
She's great.
Yeah.
...and attacked the Ellingson network.
Is this the last we've seen of this kind ofespionage?
No.
Hackers are a grave threat to the national security.
This incident just proves that we need
- increased funding to stop...
- We're getting interference.
Hola, boys and girls.
It is I, Cereal Killer, making my first worldwide global television appearance.
Yes, that's right.
I'm here to tell you about this heinous scheme hatched within Ellingson Mineral.
But for what?
World domination?
Nay.
Something far more tacky.
A virus called da Vinci, that would cause Ellingson tankers to capsize, was to be blamed on innocent hackers.
This virus was really a smokescreen.
What could be so important to protect that someone would create such a nasty, anti-social, uncool virus program?
But why?
Could it be to cover the tracks of this worm program?
A worm that was to steal 25 million bucks.
The password for this worm belongs to Margo Wallace,
- head ofPublic Relations at Ellingson.
- Oh, my God!
And Eugene Belford,
- computer security officer.
- Son of a bitch!
What's this?
The account in the Bahamas where the money was to be stashed?
I think so.
Unlucky!
Yo.
I kinda feel like God.
Plague?
Eugene?
I don't even know how to work the VCR let alone a computer.
Get off!
Listen, I'll make a deal.
Eugene Belford.
I know where his mother is.
Get off me!
I need a lawyer!
Here you are, Mr Babbage.
Flight time to Tokyo is 14 hours.
Can I get you anything else?
Just a pillow, please.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
What's going on?
Let go of me!
Stewardess!
I'll never fly this airline again!
You look good in a dress.
You would have looked better.
Wanna go for a swim?
I can't believe they decided you won.
They didn't.
The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date.
Anyway, you're pretty good.
You're elite.
Yeah?
If you'd said that at the start, you would have avoided a lot of trouble.
Beat that!
You know,
- I've been having these weird...
...dreams.
^ xSilver ^
Let's move!
Upstairs.
Go, go.
What's going on?
What's the matter?
- Who are you?
- Come on, come on, let's go.
- Hey.
- Cover the back.
Dade!
Dade!
Knock it down.
The defendant, Dade Murphy, who calls himself "Zero Cool,"
has repeatedly committed criminal acts of a malicious nature.
This defendant possesses a superior intelligence, which he uses to a destructive and antisocial end.
His computer virus crashed 1507 systems, including Wall Street trading systems, single-handedly causing a seven-point drop in the New York stock market.
Dade Murphy,
I hereby fine your family $45,000.
I sentence you to probation, under which you are forbidden to own or operate a computer or a touchtone telephone until the day of your 18th birthday.
- Dade.
- Yeah, Ma?
What are you doing?
I'm taking over a TV network.
Finish up, honey, and get to sleep.
And happy birthday.
Security.
Norm.
Norman speaking.
Norman, this is Mr. Eddie Vedder from Accounting.
I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on.
And, listen, I'm in big trouble.
You know anything about computers?
Um, gee--
Right, well, my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki.
And if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit hara-kiri.
Uh...
Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.
Could you read me the number on the modem?
Um...
It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it.
It lets my computer talk to the one there.
212-555-4240.
So-called American Indians, Latinos, and blacks come from a genetically mediocre stock.
- Yak, yak, yak.
- Being a racist means being aware of racial divisions...
- Get a job.
- ...and I am.
Say I'm a--
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...
- the Outer Limits.
- Yes!
Hey.
What?
Zero--
No, wait.
Is this the day?
Is this the beginning of the end?
There is no time to wonder, no time to ask, "Why is it happening?
- Why is it finally happening?"
- Unbelievable.
- There is time only for...
- A hacker.
Do we pray?
Or do we merely run now?
Yeah, okay, "Acid Burn," that's enough.
Shit on me.
'Morning.
You unpack your stuff yet?
Mm.
Up all night again, huh?
Can this wait till both of my eyes are open, please?
Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours?
He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.
Well, yes, he could be playing with himself.
Mm-hmm.
Yes, I'll ask.
Dade?
You like girls, don't you?
Yeah.
I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?
- Right, Dade?
- Right, Mom.
And I'm still a virgin.
You hooked it up to the phone, didn't you?
Dade, turn the shower off.
You screw up again, and you won't get into college.
I'm sorry we had to move in your senior year.
I didn't want to sell the house, but I had to take this new job.
You know that.
You're going to love New York.
It's the "city that never sleeps."
I miss you, too, baby.
Claro que si.
Excuse me...?
Yo, chill, man.
I'm talking to Venezuela.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I was just looking for the principal's office.
Sorry, I can't help you, kid.
You have your transfer forms?
It's a relatively straightforward question.
- Do you speak English?
- Sorry.
You wanted--
I wanted transfer forms.
Thank you.
Are you coming?
The gym is through there and the cafeteria is through there.
Great.
Cool.
What's your name?
Kate.
Kate Libby.
- Here's your class.
- My class?
You mean I'm-- I'm not in your class?
No, you're not in my class.
Give me time.
- Hey, you new?
- Yeah.
Tell him about the pool, Kate.
Pool?
Yeah, there's an Olympic-size swimming pool up on the roof.
Take the stairs over there.
Yeah.
Sure.
Thanks.
Hey, hold the door!
No pool.
Oh!
Oh, my God.
He found the pool.
I'm Mr. Simpson.
I'm subbing for Miss Bayliss, who was arrested at the anti-fur rally.
I know some of you kids got computers at home, but these are school property, people.
And I don't want to see any gum stuck to them.
Chapter 1--
"Designing Graphical interface..."
So what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh?
Academic?
Purely sexual?
Homicidal.
What's up, man?
I'm the "Phreak."
The Phantom Phreak...?
The King of NYNEX...?
I know you play the game.
Phreak, Phreak, Phreak.
Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.
- Joey, Joey, Joey.
- What?
What?
What?
One more "dude" out of you, and I'm gonna slap the shit out of you, okay?
Now I try to save you from yourself, but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man.
- You're hopeless.
- Du--
- Check it--
- I need a handle, man.
I mean, I don't have an identity until I have a handle.
You know, you're right about that.
Check it.
Friday.
Look-- all right, wait, wait.
How about the "Master of Disaster," huh?
You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
"Ultra Laser." "Doctor Doom."
Records, tapes, CDs...
Bootlegged Chinese software here.
- How much for the hard drive?
- Three for 30.
Just tell me what you need.
What do you need?
- Records?
Tapes?
- You got any Rush?
Any kind of format, any kind of disk, any bootleg you need.
Check this out, each and every one of you--
Compilation tapes of my own making.
I call this "The Greatest Zukes" album, featuring artists like-- I got some Hendrix on there, some Joplin, Mama Cass, Belushi--
All great artists that asphyxiated on their own vomit.
You can't get this in stores, man.
One of a kind, $2.
All major transactions...
Please deposit $5 for the first minute.
Thank you.
No, no, no, thank you.
That's a nice score for a girl.
Think you can do better?
I'll give it a shot.
Is this kid bothering you, Kate?
Sorry, can I get some room here?
Yeah, why don't you come up here?
He's good.
Well, it looks like I'm on top.
Congratulations.
No one's ever beat her before.
You just made an enemy for life.
"Boy Meets World," let's go.
- Who's that?
- Curtis.
- And what's he do?
- That's it.
You're looking at it.
He just looks slick all day.
Joey!
What's up?
Oh, my God.
You?
Oh, my God.
Way cool!
You saw that?
What the hell is going on?
The pool on the roof must have a leak.
Man, oh, man, this is gonna be good.

It's Ginsberg.
Nice.
Very nice.
He's not in this class.

He's not enrolled in this class.
Well, he's on my list.

You, however, are not on my list.
Whoa.
This isn't wood shop class?
Out.
Out.
Class-crashing?
Come on.
Some people are too much.
- Bye.
- Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
- How was school?
- Hm.
What did we learn in school today?
- Revenge.
- Ah.
Did we meet somebody special?
No.
No one special.
Okay, I gotta get back to work.
I'm gonna be home late.
Would you try and please fill these out?
Don't worry, it's only the rest of your life.
Right.
Anything else?
You want me to mow the lawn?
Oops, I forgot.
New York-- no grass.
And unpack.
FYI, man, right?
You can sit at home and do, like, absolutely nothing and--
And your name goes through, like, 17 computers a day.
"1984"?
Yeah, right, man.
That's a typo.
Orwell is here now.
He's living large.
We have no names, man, no names.
We are nameless.
Can I score a fry?
Thanks.
Meet "Cereal Killer," as in Fruit Loops.
But he does know things.
Anyway, anyway, guys, guys, listen, listen.
I'm in this computer, right?
So I'm looking around--
- You got those Crayola books?
- Oh, yeah, Technicolor rainbow.
Here, a green one.
What is that?
What is that?
What is that?
Let me see.
- What are these?
- International UNIX environments.
Luscious orange...?
Computer security criteria, DOD standards.
The "pink-shirt book" -- Guide to IBM PCs, so-called due to the nasty pink shirt the guy wears on the cover.
- What's that?
- Devil book, the UNIX bible.
- What's that?
- Dragon book, compiler design.
Oh, yeah?
- What's that?
- The red book.
NSA-trusted networks, otherwise known as "The Ugly Red Book That Won't Fit on a Shelf."
Anyway, anyway, GUYS, guys, guys, come on.
I'm in this computer, right?
So I'm looking around.
I'm looking around, you know, throwing commands at it.
I don't know where it is or what it does or anything.
It's like-- it's, like, choice.
It's just beautiful, okay?
Like, four hours I'm just messing around in there.
Finally, I figure out that it's a bank.
Right?
Okay, wait.
Okay, so it's a bank.
So this morning, I look at the paper, some cash machine in, like, Bumsville, Idaho, spits out $700 into the middle of the street.
- That's kind of cool.
- That was me.
- That was me.
I did that.
- You did this from your house?
What, are you stoned or stupid?
You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house.
You'll get nailed by the FBI.
Where are your brains?
In your ass?
- Don't you know anything?
- It's stupid, man.
Universally stupid.
You guys always think I should know everything.
You never tell me anything, right?
Right?
All right, what are the three most common used passwords?
"Love," "secret" and "sex."
But not in that order necessarily.
Right?
Yeah, don't forget "God." System operators love to use "God." It's that whole male ego thing.
Look, you want to be elite, you gotta do a righteous hack.
None of this accidental shit.
Yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons, man--
You know, the supercomputers they use to, like, do physics and look for oil and stuff.
Ain't no way, man.
Security is too tight-- the big iron.
Maybe.
But if I were gonna hack some heavy metal,
I'd work my way back through some low security
- and try the back door.
- Yeah, but, oh, man, wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby?
Mm!
Yo, who ate all of my fries?
- Joey.
- No, no, no, I didn't touch your fries.
- I did not touch your fries.
- Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.
- It was him, man.
- You suck, dude.
You need to lay off that shit.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna hit you.
Yes!
Home run.
Home run.
Okay, okay, okay.
You and me, Lucy.
We're gonna show 'em, baby.
Ow.
Okay, okay.
Mr. Belford?
My name is "the Plague." Mr. The Plague, something weird's happening on the Net.
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
The accounting subdirectory on the Gibson is working really hard.
We've got one person online, but the workload is enough for, like, 10 users.
I think we've got a hacker.
Okay, okay, we need proof that we were here.
All right.
Yeah.
Garbage.
Okay, give me Garbage.
Shit.
Never fear,
I is here.
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
Let's echo 23, see what's up.
God wouldn't be up this late.
Shit.
Get me the switching control center.
I need to trace a call that's in progress.
Oh, shit.
Yeah, hold on.
Hold on, Mom.
Hold on one second.
Open the door, Joseph.
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
There you go.
Bed.
Sleep.
Now.
Sweet dreams, Joseph.
- He's gone.
- Did you get a trace?
- Yeah, we got him.
- Good.
Okay-
Nice place, huh?
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn?
- You know who he is?
- No.
Don't know who he is.
Do you?
Nikon.
Lord Nikon, this is...
Crash Override.
Never heard of you.
Done anything?
No.
Come on!
I hate this neighborhood.
What?
Your mom buy you a "'puter" for Christmas?
- Does he know anything?
- Sure, man.
He's elite.
Come in.
Uh, Nikon, can-- can I crash at your place tonight?
Again?
Yeah, sure.
Hackers penetrate and ravage delicate private and publicly-owned computer systems, infecting them with viruses
- and stealing materials...
- Who are these guys?
Agent Richard Gill.
You're hacker enemy number one, man.
- You're a boner.
- Thank you, Mr. Gill.
Yo, showtime.
Showtime.
Hey!
- What's going on?
- Four... three, two, one...
Welcome to our show.
- "Hack the Planet." - "Hack the Planet"!
And for those late-night hacks, Jolt Cola, the soft drink of the elite hacker.
- Who are these guys?
- That's Razor and Blade.
Razor and Blade.
That's right.
This is a pay phone.
Don't ask.
As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.
Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
Record the tones that the coins make, then hang up and get your money back.
And never again pay for a service that would be dirt-cheap...
If it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons.
Remember, hacking is more than just a crime.
It's a survival trait.
Baby, I'm a real wild child.
I'm a wild one.
I'm a wild one.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Joey!
Joey!
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Freeze!
- What?
What did I do?
- Get out of there!
Come on, get out.
- What?
- Joey?
!
Joey!
- Get in there.
Get in.
- What?
What?
- Sit down.
- Stay down there.
Don't move.
- Lucy--!
- Joey!
- Where are you taking--?
Give me my--?
Joey!
- How is it going, Ray?
- Looks good, sir.
We got an uncorrupted hard drive.
In English, please.
I didn't spend 10 years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
I'm sorry, sir.
We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had enough time to erase his computer files.
Good.
Good man.
All right, let's finish up here,
- take him in for interrogation.
- All right, sir.
Agent Gill, can you spare a moment of your time?
Why, of course, Jennifer.
- Joey.
- Mom.
Just how dangerous are hackers?
Well, hackers penetrate and ravage delicate private and publicly-owned computer systems, infecting them with viruses and stealing sensitive materials for their own ends.
These people-- They're terrorists.
- Joey.
- Thank you, Mr. Gill.
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning.
Please be seated.
I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
Once again, don't call me Eugene.
Our recent unknown intruder penetrated using a super user account, giving him access to our whole system.
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
Someone didn't bother reading my carefully-prepared memo on commonly used passwords.
Now then, as I so meticulously pointed out, the four most-used passwords are
"love," "sex," "secret"
and "God."
So would "Your Holiness" care to change her password?
A hacker planted the virus.
Virus?
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty and flooded its tanks.
Excuse me?
The little boat flipped over.
A virus planted within the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
What, it left a note?
Unless $5 million are transferred to the following numbered account in seven days,
I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson fleet.
- Is that--?
- That is the virus--
"Leonardo da Vinci."
The problem is, we have 26 ships at sea and we don't know which ones are infected.
Well then, put the ships' ballast under manual control.
There's no such thing anymore, Duke.
These ships are totally computerized.
They rely on satellite navigation, which links them to our network-- And the virus--
Wherever they are in the world.
So what are we supposed to do?
Well, luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer.
I traced the hacker's call.
The Secret Service picked him up this morning.
I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.
Look, now we expect you to get onto this right away, yeah?
- Yeah.
- Well, how soon?
Well, we're working on it as fast as we can.
This is a very common occurrence in corporations as large as ours.
- You have nothing to worry about.
- Yeah, right.
- You sure about that, Mr. The Plague?
- Yeah, the Secret Service
- is helping us out, 100%.
Okay?
- Yeah, okay.
- We'll be in touch.
- Talk to you later.
What the hell was that all about?
I had to move fast.
The hacker copied my garbage file.
What?
I created Mr. da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service, so they'd arrest the hacker, seize his equipment--
Things that we can't do on our own.
I don't want to go to jail for this.
Relax.
Think about the $25 million.
But you've created a virus that's gonna cause a worldwide ecological disaster just to arrest some hacker kid?
Basically, yeah, mm-hmm.
- Jesus.
You know, you're sick, Eugene.
- Shh, shh.
- I'll take care of this.
- All right, sir.
I can cancel it any time.
I don't need any program code.
But it's the perfect cover to confiscate the disk and find out how much of that garbage file has been copied.
Get it!
Why did I ever trust you?
Get the file.
Otherwise you'll lose all your toys.
Did you find the program for the virus on any of the disks we confiscated?
No.
He's either very smart or very stupid.
Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice.
We'll release him until his indictment.
Keep tight surveillance and see if he leads us to your disk.
Unit 3, outside suspect Joey Pardella's apartment.
Nothing to report.
Suspect still grounded... by his mother.
Listen to this bullshit.
"This is our world now--
The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud.
We exist without nationality, skin color or religious bias.
You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.
Yes, I am a criminal.
My crime is that of curiosity.
I am a hacker and this is my manifesto."
Eh?
Right?
Manifesto?
"You may stop me, but you can't stop us all."
Now that's cool.
Cool?
- Yeah, cool.
- You think it's cool?
It's cool.
It's not cool.
It's commie bullshit.
- Yo, back off.
- Relax.
Back off!
So what do you think?
Can I crash at your place tonight?
What is it with this guy?
His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since.
Hey, you hear about Joey's bust?
Yeah, probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
You think he could hack a Gibson?
- Did you talk to him?
- No.
His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.
He isn't to consort with his computer friends.
The Secret Service is really out to get him.
Hey, there's a big party tonight.
You want to go?
It's at Kate's.
Thought so.
Oh, yeah.
A little pelvis and booty.
A little pelvis and booty.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.
That's right.
Come on.
You want to fight?
Huh?
Huh?
What the hell are you doing?
- Hague?
- Huh?
Plague!
- Gill.
- I think we got something.
Ugh.
Hard copy.
Dade Murphy.
- Secret Service!
- Don't move!
- Christ, what are you?
- Shut up!
- What are you doing?
Get off me.
- Shut up.
Shut your mouth.
Ash-hm.
Just sit on the bed and keep your hands where we can see them.
The year was 1988, and this nasty virus crashed 1500 systems in one day.
- 1507.
- Wow.
It got you seven years' probation, no computer, couldn't even use a touchtone phone.
Must have been hell, huh, "Zero Cool"?
A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system.
You were our prime suspect till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
However, we've come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus.
He, or perhaps his accomplice, has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus.
- We want you to help us find it.
- Gill?
Loser.
I can't believe you were only 11 when you wrote this.
It's quite an impressive virus.
Dade...
I know how you might feel about narc-ing on your friends, but we're hackers.
For us, there's no such thing as family and friends.
We're each our own country with temporary allies and enemies.
I'd like to make a treaty with you.
I'm-
- I'm sorry.
Who are you?
I'm the one who understands you.
Now can we be allies?
Nah.
I don't play well with others.
Shit!
Come on!
Watch which friends you do play with.
A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school.
No colleges would take you-- no future, exiled from everyone and everything you love.
I'll be in touch.
It's fine.
Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?
Blow me.
Thank you.
Her mom makes big bucks writing self-help books for women, stuff like, "Women Who Love Men Who Are Emotional Amoebae."
That explains a lot.
Something ain't right...
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm gonna get myself, I'm gonna get myself.
I'm gonna get myself connected...
Hit it, baby.
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
Boom!
Big man, stepping in, stepping in coming through.
Ooh!
Big man, big boots.
You look good, girl.
I'll catch you later.
Yo, what's up, Nikon?
Phreak in the house, man.
Thanks, man.
Dade, man, you made it.
Yo, yo, Houston, we have lift-off.
Three o'clock-- check it.
Don't look right away.
What's wrong with you?
Look at her, man.
Look at that.
Oh.
Ooh!
Let's see.
Lisa Blair.
26 East 7th Street, apartment 16.
- 555-4817.
Boom'.
- Boo-y ah'.!
- How did you know that?
- I got a photographic memory.
It's a curse.
Lisa!
Stumble you might fall...
Hey, how do you know my name?
Ooh, look at that pooper, man.
Spandex-- it's a privilege, not a right.
Ain't gonna go blind...
Hi.
My name is Vicki and I'm an addict.
Hi.
My name's Hank and I'm an addict.
Uh, my name's Joey, but, uh,
I'm not an addict.
No, no, really, really, really.
Listen.
Listen.
Look.
I got in trouble with my computer, right?
Okay?
My lawyer told the judge that I'm an addict, but I'm not addicted to my computer.
No, really, really,
I'm not an addict.
I'm not.
I'm not.
Can I get some more coffee?
Thank you.
Yo, check this out, guys.
This is insanely great.
It's got a 28.8 BPS modem.
- Yeah?
Display?
- Active matrix, man.
A million psychedelic colors.
Man, the baby is sweet.
Ooh.
- I want it.
- I want it to have my children, man.
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Yo, hit the light.
- Ooh.
- Oh, wow.
- Shit.
- Shh.
Come on.
Yeah.
- Was that her top?
- One-handed.
Difficulty rating?
Seven.
- Baby.
- Wow.
Burn's "wetware" matches her software.
- "Burn"?
- Shh.
- What the--?
- What are you guys doing in here?
I'm sorry.
We're sorry.
Just checking out your fly laptop.
It's hyped, you know.
You're in the butter zone now, baby.
Huh...?
Yeah, it is.
I want to triple the RAM, all right?
Ooh, "leopard boy."
And the Decepticons.
Kate, Kate, you're not going into that computer shit now, right?
One sec.
Yeah.
Later.
- Yeah, right.
- The sensitive type.
What is he doing in here?
Relax, Burn.
He's my guest.
Burn?
You're "Acid Burn"?
- You booted me out of OTV?
- What?
I'm Crash Override.
You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
"C rash" and "Burn."
Murphy kid turn you down?
I disguised myself as an Alabama state trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
Pervert.
What are you talking about?
The FBI computer holds files on 20 million Americans.
I just hacked into it.
Congratulations.
From here, I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents.
His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year.
Custody battle.
The boy chose to go with his mother.
SQ?
So we get the mother... we get the boy.
This girl I know.
Needs some shelter.
She don't believe anyone can help her.
She's doing so much harm.
Doing so much damage.
But you don't want to get involved...
What the hell are you doing?
It's cool.
I'm just looking.
- It's too much machine for you.
- Yeah?
I hope you don't screw like you type.
It has a killer refresh rate.
P6 chip.
Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Yeah, it's not just the chip.
It has a PCI bus.
But you knew that.
Indeed.
RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
Yeah.
RISC is good.
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
Crash Override.
What was it?
"Mess with the best, die like the rest"?
Yeah.
- Are you challenging me?
- Name your stakes.
If I win, you become my slave.
- Your slave?
- You wish.
You'll do shit work-- Scan, crack copyrights--
- Whatever I want.
- Deal.
- And if I win?
- Humph.
Make it my first born.
- Make it our first date.
- You're not gonna win.
And you have to smile.
I don't do "dates."
But I don't lose either.
So you're on.
So here's the deal.
The chosen contest--
To hassle Secret Service Agent Richard Gill and get one back for Joey.
Our decisions are final by a vote of two to one.
No appeals.
The duel will last until we declare a winner.
Use only the dial-up access codes and passwords in your collection.
Can't ask for any help from us.
You talkin' to me?
- Any questions?
- Yeah.
Who's going to notify his next of kin?
What the--?
All right, he's in the personal ads.
"Disappointed white male, cross-dresser, looking for discreet friend to bring dreams to reality.
Leather, lace and water sports.
Transvestites welcome."
I know where you can stick it.
I-
- I know where you can stick it.
- Hello?
- I want to lick your earlobes.
I want to lick your lips.
I want to lick your toes.
Oh, yeah, you want to lick?
You want to lick something?
Lick this.
- That's why they call me "Stallion."
- Oh, that's disgusting.
- My heart is steaming for you.
- Oh.
- I hope to spank you with my--
- I'll spank your ass.
- ...turn you over and make you beg--
- Oh!
- Ugh.
- Animal.
Hey!
Ow.
Hey, hey, hey, do you know who I am?
Do you know who I am?
Ow!
This is Accounting, sir.
You inquired about an employee of ours, Agent Richard Gill?
Yes.
- Our records indicate he's deceased.
- I'm what?
!
- Dead.
- Dead?
Yeah, like rigor mortis, habeas corpus.
- Very impressive.
- Superhero-like even.
Yeah, whatever.
What's the score?
- Tied.
- Oh, come on.
What?
What?
Come on.
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and all, guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
Right.
I win... you wear a dress on our date.
And if I win... so do you.
Deal.
Yes!
Yeah, baby...
Yeah, baby...
Yeah, baby...
Oh...!
Dade.
I didn't know your size, so I guessed.
You are man enough to stick with the deal, aren't you?
Thanks.
You wanted to know who I am, Zero Cool?
Well, let me explain the new world order.
Governments and corporations need people like you... and me.
We are samurai, the keyboard cowboys.
And all those other people out there, who have no idea what's going on, are the cattle.
Moo.
I need your help.
You need my help.
Let me help you earn your spurs.
Aw, think about it.
Enjoy the laptop, Cool.
Tell me where the disk is.
You look pitiful.
Okay, okay!
You're not grounded anymore.
- Yo, what's up?
- Dude, dude, dude,
I gotta talk to you, man.
Listen, listen, listen.
- I copied a garbage file.
- Big deal.
A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey.
No, no, it's, like, hot or something.
I don't know.
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data, junk.
It's the stuff that's been erased, man.
I copied it from Ellingson, okay?
They're asking me about it, all right?
Will you take a look for me?
Okay-
Oh, shit, Joey.
You got a tail.
Shit!
Lam watching you.
Ramon, wake up.
Hm...?
Ramon?
Wake up.
Vémonos.
Time for school.
Come on.
Don't move!
- Don't move!
- Deja vu.
Ray Sanchez, you're under arrest under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.
La computadora de mierda!
What are you waiting for?
Arrest me already.
You get one call.
Uno.
Understand?
Hello.
Operator Services.
Hello, Operator, I'm having trouble dialing a number.
- What number, please?
- 555-4202.
- Just one moment.
- Thank you.
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me.
- Phreak?
- I'm freaking.
Joey wasn't making it up.
He really hacked into Ellingson.
He gave me the disk with the file he copied, and now I'm in jail.
They're charging me with some serious shit and there's stuff I didn't even do, like, get this, inserting some virus called "da Vinci."
And they keep asking about you guys.
- You think they're gonna bust us?
- Yeah.
You'd better figure out what's on that disk, 'cause we're being framed.
It's in that place where I put that thing that time...?
Hi.
And now I see what all the fuss is about.
Hey, you have company.
- It's a nice room.
- We need your help.
Do my ears deceive me?
No, "0, no, no, no, no, no.
Truce, you guys.
Listen, we got a higher purpose here, right?
Awake-up call for the Nintendo generation.
We demand free access to data.
Well, it comes with some responsibility.
"When I was a child, I spake as a child,
I understood as a child.
I thought as a child.
But when I became a man, I put away childish things."
What?
It's Corinthians 1, Chapter 13, verse 11.
You know, duh.
Come on.
Phreak and Joey are being framed.
We need your help to figure out what's on this disk.
I can't.
Everybody who touches that thing gets busted.
I can't afford to get arrested.
I'm sorry.
Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or something.
What is it with you?
I know we've been playing games, but we're supposed to be on the same side, and we really need your help.
I really need your help.
I'm sorry.
I can't.
Look, well, could you just make a copy of the disk and just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with?
Can you do that?
Listen, you guys, help yourself to anything in the fridge.
Cereal has.
Thank you.
- Okay.
I'll copy it.
- Okay, thank you.
The girl-- The girl has the disk I need.
I told you, I don't play well with others.
Turn on your laptop.
Set it to receive a file.
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington.
Forgery, embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole.
When she's arrested, she will not have a trial.
She will not pass "Go." She will go directly to jail.
Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
That's bullshit.
What can I tell you?
Computers never lie, kid.
Your mom will be arrested at work.
She'll be handcuffed and later strip-searched.
You lay a finger on her, and I'll kill you.
Kid, don't threaten me.
There are worse things than death, and I can do all of them.
- Talk to me.
- I got it.
But, listen, Kate didn't know what's on it.
I mean, she came to me to figure it out.
She's not the one who planted the virus.
You leave her alone.
Hey, don't worry, kid.
If she's innocent, she'll be fine.
Your mommy is safe now, okay?
- Kate, listen.
- Hold on.
- I have to tell you something.
- Hold on a sec.
- This is so lean and clean.
- It's like a hacker wrote it.
Come here.
Look at this.
Man, this thing is tense.
Lookit.
That's ill, man.
It's incomplete.
It's taking forever and a day to figure out.
I'll make some coffee.
Tag, you're in.
It isn't a virus.
It's a worm.
What's this one eat?
It nibbles.
You see all of this?
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah?
From million-dollar deals to the 10 bucks that some guy pays for gas.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone.
It's just data being shifted around.
And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part.
Check it out.
By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started?
Right, and at this rate, it ends its run in--
- Two days.
- Judging by this segment alone,
- it's already eaten about-- - 21.8 million bucks, man.
Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall, and that's Phreak and that's Joey and that's us.
We gotta get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out who created it.
- I know.
I know who wrote it.
- What?
This Ellingson security creep.
I gave him a copy of the disk you gave me.
- What?
- You what?
I didn't know what was on it.
Oh, man.
That's universally stupid, man.
Yo, man.
You're an amateur, man.
- Why did he come to you?
- I've got a record.
I was Zero Cool.
Zero Cool-- crashed 1507 systems in one day--
The biggest crash in history, front page of "The New York Times," August 10, 1988.
I thought you was black, man.
Yo, man, this is Zero Cool!
- Oh, shit!
- That's far out.
This is Zero Cool, man.
Yeah, well, that's great.
There goes MIT.
- I'll make it up!
- Yeah?
How?
I'll hack the Gibson.
Dude, they'll trace you like that, man.
The cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun.
- Fucked if I care, man.
- Even if you had the password, it'd take you 10 minutes to get in, and you still gotta find the files, man.
I mean, the cops would have you in five minutes.
Oh, wow.
We are fried.
Never send a boy to do a woman's job.
With me, we can do it in seven.
You're both screwed.
I help-- we do it in six.
Jesus, I gotta save all your asses.
I help-- we can do it in five minutes, man.
Okay, let's go shopping.
Whoo-hoo!
Boom!
You know... if I didn't live by a strict code of honor,
I might take advantage of this situation--
Erotically, as it were.
All right, hold it right there!
Shit!
My subway defense system.
He's way down there.
Ta-da!
Yo, brain-dead-- The manual!
Oops.
Hey!
Truck!
Find it?
Oh, the phone's all right.
The problem must be somewhere else.
They had a large chunk of the garbage file?
How much do they know?
Not everything, but enough to implicate us.
You said the worm was untraceable.
Yeah, to civilians.
But they're hackers.
But don't worry.
All we have to do is launch the da Vinci virus.
- And then they'll all be put away.
- Launch the da Vinci virus?
You can't do that.
No one believes the guilty.
Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.
Look, there is no right and wrong.
There's only fun and boring.
A 30-year prison sentence sounds pretty dull to me.
Who do you prefer serves it--
Us or them?
Unless $5 million are transferred to the following numbered account in seven days,
I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson fleet.
The virus goes off tomorrow morning at 10:30, and those hackers tried to get into our system again.
At this point, I insist you take more strenuous action, or Ellingson Mineral will hold the Secret Service responsible.
Get me arrest warrants on Kate Libby, alias "Acid Burn,"
Emmanuel Goldstein, alias "Cereal Killer,".
Dade Murphy, alias "Crash Override,"
also known as "Zero Cool,"
and Paul Cook, alias "Lord Nikon."
We pick them up tomorrow morning at 9:00.
Snoop onto them...
As they snoop onto us.
- Yeah, it's Kate.
- Hey, Burn, we got a little problem here.
- All right, so what have we got?
- Well, we have 50 passwords, plus whatever "Polaroid-head" here got inside Ellingson.
Well, I got a lot, all right?
I don't know how many, but... my head hurts.
Yo, yo, yo, check this out.
- Hey, what's "da Vinci virus"?
- What?
Check this out.
It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happen on the 14th.
What oil spills?
Whoa, whoa.
Yo, brain-dead, today is the 13th.
Well, this hasn't happened yet.
Wait a minute.
The 14th-- that's the same day the worm ends its run.
I mean, da Vinci virus--
Didn't Phreak say that's what he's being charged with?
Look. "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers."
- They blame hackers.
- Damn!
A worm and a virus?
The plot thickens.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going, huh?
I got an idea.
Look, we got a few hours, right, till we get arrested?
So just stay low.
I'm gonna go get some help.
I'll beep you, okay?
Shit.
Are you coming?
May the Force be with you, man.
There they are!
Razor and Blade?
They're flakes!
They're elites.
Let's get 'em.
Good morning, Vietnam!
Ha-ha!
Aw, yeah.
This is once again the man that threw this party.
I'm doin' this.
My style is quadruple damage for MCs.
I'll make 'em huff 'n' puff like mufflers from Meineke.
Human exhaust, you wanted to get lost.
Rhymes plus Exxon ride brains like Alain Prost.
You MC clowns, I blaze towns.
I dragwheel skulls I leave with speed and dust clouds...
- Hey, come on, get off the stage.
- Razor and Blade--
I gotta talk to those guys.
Hey, hey, hey!
Jive and babble, throw heavy Scrabble.
Sparkles plus the bubbles plus the flavor like Snapple.
All you so-called rebels, heavy-metal cattle.
Some horses got force, but I simply tame with saddle...
You struggle with my tempo, you ain't got good grief!
Brothers amazed, keep 'em all in a daze.
With the wild funk blaze, good grief!
I lost them.
Where were you?
I don't like this.
I definitely don't like this.
What do you want?
Um... we come in peace?
We need your help, if you're up to it.
She's buff, ballsy.
- Let's keep her.
- Waste the dude.
A virus called da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time tomorrow.
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
We need your help to overload the Gibson so we can kill the da Vinci virus and download the worm program.
She's rabid but cute.
See, we're very busy.
A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
Let's go, Kate.
Wait.
Nobody said no.
But you are going to need more than just two media icons like us.
You need an army.
That's it-- an electronic army.
If I were us, I'd get on the Internet, send out a major distress signal.
"Hackers of the world, unite."
How are you gonna take care of the cops?
Yo, I'm blowing up.
It's Kate, Grand Central.
Let's hit it.
The light is green!
You're the man, baby.
You're the man!
Hey, Joey, you made it!
Joe!
Joey!
All right, listen up.
Use your best viruses to buy us some time.
We have to get into Plague's file and copy the worm.
All right, that was a little tension-breaker.
That had to be done, all right?
- Cereal?
- Yeah?
- Go fix the phones.
- Roger.
Joey, take his place.
- What, me?
- Take his place, man.
Do it.
- You can do it.
Just do it.
- Cereal, we're counting on you.
- Just do it.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
- All right, let's boot up.
- I'm shut down completely.
- Green light.
When the green light's blinking, there's something wrong.
My computer just crashed.
Printers--
Oh, my God--!
I don't know.
Viruses everywhere.
What is it?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
It's just a minor glitch.
A minor glitch with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe.
- There's a new virus in the database.
- What's happening?
It's replicating, eating up memory.
What do I do?
Type "cookie," you idiot.
I'll head them off at the pass.
We have a "zero bug" attacking all log-in and overlay files.
Run antivirus.
Give me a systems display.
Now we've lost sections 6 through 26.
No, make that 10 to 40.
- And 1 through 6.
- Die, dickweeds.
A rabbit is in the administration system.
- Send a flu shot.
- Rabbit?
Flu shot?
Someone talk to me.
A "rabbit" replicates till it overloads a file,
- then it spreads like cancer.
- Cancer?
Row, row, row your boat.
Gently down the stream.
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily.
Life is but a dream.
- Row, row, row your boat...
- Whoa.
Crawling halt.
It's the Gibson.
It's finding us too fast.
Man, there's too many garbage files.
I need more time.
They're at Grand Central Station, lower level.
Don't screw up.
Go!
Get out of here!
Everybody, let's move!
- Move it!
- Let's go!
Get the hell out of the way.
Come on.
30 seconds.
Move it.
Game's over.
Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.
You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
Yeah, maybe I'm not.
But we are, you asshole.
- Give it up.
- Three minutes to capsize.
Just give it up.
Are we fashionably late?
Okay, let's go.
Okay.
Si, sono pronta.
Andiamo.
We have massive infection, multiple GPI and FSI viruses.
It's coming in from remote nodes.
They're going for the Kernal!
- "Colonel" who?
- The system command processor.
- It's the brain.
- Cancer, brain.
Brain, cancer.
- Belf, what's going on?
- In short, Duke, a shitstorm.
Move!
Go!
Move!
Move!
Move!
Did they call the police--?
Get out of the way!
I found it.
I found it!
This is the end, my friend.
Thank you for calling.
Oh, shit.
He got me.
Yo, Joey's getting stupid busy.
Come on, out of my way, my man.
Joey, I need you to drop your virus, go after the worm.
- You're the closest.
- Out of the way, people!
It's "root, slash, period, workspace, slash, period, garbage, period."
Out of the way!
Let's go.
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Get out of the way!
Freeze!
Aw!
Oh, come on!
Ha!
All right.
Good job.
- Kill the Gibson.
- Roger that.
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Is that all you got, huh?
Come on!
Let's see what else you can do!
You talking to me, huh?
!
Are you nuts?
Come at me.
They're in the Kernal.
Help me...!
The tankers have stopped capsizing.
The ballast tanks are empty.
We should be okay.
Little pissant.
Yes!
- We did it.
- Let's get out of here.
Freeze!
Train departing track number 24...
Keep it moving.
Come on, come on.
What are you waiting on?
Let's go.
They're trashing our rights, man!
They're trashing the flow of data!
They're trashing!
Trashing!
Trashing!
Hack the planet!
- Hack the planet!
- Shut up and get in the car.
Hack the planet!
Hack the planet!
- Hello?
- We caught them.
- Good.
- Red-handed.
You won't be having any more trouble from them.
Me, all right?
I did it.
She knows shit about computers.
She's just my girlfriend.
I suggest you modify your attitude, because you are floating and I'm about to flush your ass.
You've got a Mrs. Murphy to see you, sir.
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?
I'm trying to help you.
- Dade.
- What?
Thanks for your help.
Your son is in big trouble.
He has violated his probation and he has engaged in criminal activity.
My son happens to be a genius.
He understands something happening today that you won't comprehend if you live to be a hundred.
And he would never use what he knows to harm a living soul.
The news crew you requested is here.
Oh, good. 'Cause I have a few things to tell them.
Your son is facing 30 felony counts in an ongoing investigation.
You face possible arrest if you do that.
Mister, I don't care if I face certain death.
Mrs. Murphy stays right here.
Oh, wow.
She's great.
Yeah.
...and attacked the Ellingson's computer network.
Is this the last we've seen of this type of high-tech espionage?
Well, I'm afraid not.
Hackers are a grave threat to the national security.
This incident just proves without a doubt that we need increased funding to stop--
- Hold on.
We're getting interference.
- Hola, boys and girls.
- It is I, the Cereal Killer...
- Get that clown off.
Making my first coast-to-coast worldwide global television appearance.
Yes, that's right.
I'm here to tell you about this heinous scheme hatched from within Ellingson Mineral.
But for what, you ask?
World domination?
Nay.
Something far more tacky.
A virus called da Vinci, that, when launched, would cause Ellingson mineral tankers to capsize, was to be blamed on innocent hackers.
But this virus was really the smokescreen, right?
What could be so vitally important to protect
- that someone would create...
- How did he do that?
...such a nasty, antisocial, very uncool virus program?
But Why?
Could it be to cover the tracks of this worm program--
A worm that was to steal 25 million bucks?
The password to this hungry little sucker belongs to Margo Wallace,
- head of Public Relations...
- Oh, my God--!
...and Eugene Belford, computer security officer.
Son of a bitch!
Oh, my--!
Oh!
What's this?
Is this the unnamed account in the Bahamas where the money was to be stashed?
I think so.
Unlucky!
Yo, I kind of feel like God.
Plague...?
Eugene?
!
A comedy of errors-- I don't even know how to work the VCR, let alone a computer.
Get off!
Look.
Listen, I'll make a deal.
Eugene Belford-- I know where his mother is.
I promise you.
Get off me.
I need a lawyer!
Thank you.
Here you are, Mr. Babbage.
Flight time to Tokyo should be about 14 hours today.
Can I get you anything else?
Just a pillow, please.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
What's going on?
Let go of me!
Stewardess!
I'll never fly this airline again!
You look good in a dress.
You would have looked better.
Want to go for a swim?
I can't believe they decided you won.
They didn't.
The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date.
Anyway... you're pretty good.
You're elite.
Yeah?
You know, if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
Beat that.
You know,
I've been having these really weird--
Dreams?
I love you, I love you today.
I don't care what.
The world has to say.
They don't know that.
I love you.
I love you today.
I don't care what.
The world has to say.
They don't know that.
Dreams escape from the fear.
Built inside, in his heart.
Bring me home, cast the net.
Far and wide, I'll return.
To the night, mask up front.
Cast away, give me love.
I don't care what the world has to say.
You should know that I love you.
I love you.
I love you today.
I don't care what.
The world has to say.
They don't know that.
I love you, I love you today.
I don't care what.
The world has to say.
They don't know that I'm in love.
I can feel the eyes behind us.
As we walk.
I can see the ears that listen.
When we talk.
I don't care what the world has to say.
You should know that I love you.
I love you, I love you today.
Can't you see how I feel?
Like a cloud, conquer all.
With the thoughts in my head.
In my heart, love is real.
Can't you see how I feel?
Like a cloud, conquer all.
With the thoughts in my head.
In my heart, once again.
Can't you see how I feel?
Like a cloud, conquer all.
With the thoughts in my head.
In my heart, love is real...

Good morning.
Did you unpack your stuff yet?
Up all night again?
Can this wait until both of my eyes are open?
Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll get some sleep?
He's been playing with his computer all night for a week.
Yes, he could be playing with himself.
Yes, I'll ask.
Dade, you like girls, don't you?
Yeah.
I just haven't found one as charming as you.
You haven't done anything stupid, right?
Right, Dade?
Right, Mom.
And I'm still a virgin.
You hooked it up to the phone, didn't you?
Dade, turn the shower off!
You screw up again and you won't get into college.
I'm sorry we had to move in your senior year.
I didn't want to sell the house but I had to take this job.

Chill, man.
I'm talking to Venezuela.
I'm sorry.
Where's the principal's office?
I can't help you, kid.
Do you have your transfer forms?
It's a straightforward question.

Tell him about the pool, Kate.
Pool?
There's an Olympic-size swimming pool on the roof.
Take the stairs over there.
Yeah.
Sure.

Could I get some room here?
Why don't you come up here?
He's good!
Well, it looks like I'm on top.

Oh, man.

No names!
Can I score a fry?
Meet Cereal Killer.

But he does know things.
Anyway, guys, listen.
I'm in this computer, right?
I'm looking around...
You got those Crayola books?
Yeah, technicolour rainbow.
Green one.
What is that?
Let me see?
- What are these?
- International UNIX environments.
Luscious orange.
Computer security criteria...
DOD standards.
The pink-shirt book... guide to IBM PCs.
So-called due to the nasty pink shirt the guy wears on the cover.
Devil book, the UNIX bible.
- What's that?
- Dragon book, compiler design.
- What's that?
- The Red book.
NSA-trusted networks.
Otherwise known as 'The Ugly Red Book That Won't Fit On A Shelf'.
Anyway, guys.
Come on.
I'm in this computer, right.
I'm looking around, throwing commands.
I don't know what it does or anything.
It's choice.
It's beautiful.
Four hours just messing around in there.
Finally, I figure out... that it's a bank.
Okay, wait.
It's a bank.
So, this morning, I check the paper, some cash machine in, like, Bumsville, Idaho, spits out $700 into the street.
- That's kinda cool.
- That was me.
- I did that.
- You did this from your house?
Are you stoned or stupid?
You don't hack a bank from your house!
You get nailed by the FBI.
Are your brains in your ass?
Don't you know anything?
It's universally stupid, man.
I don't know things because you guys won't tell me anything.
Right?
What are the three most used passwords?
'Love', 'Secret' and 'Sex'.
But not in that order, necessarily.
Right?
Don't forget 'God'.
System operators love to use 'God'.
Male ego.
To be elite, you have to do a righteous hack, not this accidental shit.
Which means you score one of those Gibsons, man.
Those supercomputers they use to do physics and look for oil.
No way, man.
Security is too tight.
Maybe.
But if I wanted to hack some heavy metal,
I'd work my way in through some back door.
Oh, man.
Wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons?
Who ate all of my fries?
- Joey!
- No, I didn't touch your fries.
- Cereal, man.
You owe me a pack.
- It was him.
- Lay off that shit, man.
- I'm gonna hit you!
Yes!
Home run, home run.
Okay, okay.
You and me, Lucy.
We're gonna show them, baby.
Ow!
Mr Belford?
My name is The Plague.
Mr The Plague, something weird is happening on the net.
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
One of the Gibsons is working really hard.
We got one person on-line but with the workload of 10 users.
I think we got a hacker.
Okay, we need proof that we were here.
Yeah.
Garbage.
Give me Garbage.
Shit.
Never fear,
I is here.
- I located the activity to terminal 23.
- Let's echo 23, see what's up.
God wouldn't be up this late.
Shit!
Get me the switching control centre.
I need to trace this call.
Hold on, Mom.
Hold on one second.
- Open the door, Joseph.
- Yeah, okay.
There you go.
Bed.
Sleep.
Now!
Sweet dreams, Joseph.
He's gone.
Did you get a trace?
Yeah, we got him.
Good.
Nice place, huh?
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn?
- You know who he is?
- No.
Don't know who he is.
Do you?
Nikon!
Lord Nikon, this is...
Crash Override.
Never heard of you.
You done anything?
No.
Come on!
What?
Your Mom buy you a 'puter for Christmas?
- Does he know anything?
- Sure.
He's elite.
Come in.
- Nikon, can I crash at your place tonight?
- Again?
Yeah, sure.
Hackers penetrate and ravage public and private computer systems, infecting them with viruses...
Who are these guys?
Richard Gill.
Hacker enemy number one.
Real boner.
Showtime.
Showtime!
- What's going on?
- Four, three, two, one...
Welcome to our show!
Hack the Planet!
Hack the Planet!
For late night hacks, Jolt Cola, soft drink ofthe elite hacker.
- Who are these guys?
- That's Razor and Blade.
Razor and Blade?
That's right.
This is a pay-phone.
Don't ask.
As you can see, this isjust a simple micro-cassette recorder.
Hook it up to the phone, and drop in five bucks in quarters.
Record the tone the coins make, hang up, get your money back.
Never again pay for a service that would be cheap, if it weren't run by profiteering gluttons.
Remember, hacking is more than just a crime.
It's a survival trait.
I'm a real wild child, I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one
Thank you!
Thank you very much!
Joey!
Joey!
Thank you!
Freeze!
- What?
- Get out of there!
Out!
- Joey!
- Get in there!
Sit down!
Lucy!
Where are you taking her?
Joey!
- How's it going, Ray?
- Looks good, sir.
We got an uncorrupted hard drive.
In English, please.
I didn't protect the President for ten years to finish my career feeling like an idiot.
I'm sorry, sir.
He didn't have time to erase his computer files.
Good.
Let's finish up here.
Take him in for interrogation.
Agent Gill, can you spare a moment?
Why, of course, Jennifer.
- Joey!
- How dangerous are hackers?
Hackers penetrate and ravage public and private computer systems, infecting them with viruses and stealing sensitive materials.
These people are terrorists.
Morning, gentlemen.
Please, be seated.
I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
Once again, don't call me Eugene.
Our recent intruder penetrated using a superuser account, giving him access to our whole system.
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
Someone didn't bother reading my memo on commonly used passwords.
As I meticulously pointed out, the foremost used passwords are...
'Love', 'Sex', 'Secret' and 'God'.
So would Your Holiness care to change her password?
A hacker planted the virus.
Virus?
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty and flooded its tanks.
Excuse me?
The little boat flipped over.
A virus planted within the Gibson system claimed responsibility.
It left a note?
Unless $5 million is transferred to the following account in 7 days,
I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson fleet.
- Is that...?
- That is the virus.
Leonardo da Vinci.
We have 26 ships at sea and don't know which ones are infected.
Well, put the ship's ballast under manual control.
There's no such thing any more.
These ships are totally computerised.
They rely on satellite navigation which links them to our network, and the virus, wherever they are.
What are we supposed to do?
Luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer.
I traced the hacker's call.
The Secret Service picked him up.
I'll search his files for the original virus code and eliminate it.
We expect you to get on this right away.
- How soon?
- As fast as I can.
This is common in corporations as large as ours.
Don't worry about it.
The Secret Service is helping us out, 100 percent.
We'll be in touch.
What the hell was that all about?
I had to move fast.
The hacker copied my garbage file.
What?
I created da Vinci so we could get the Secret Service to arrest the hacker and seize the equipment, which we can't do alone.
- I don't want to go to jail for this.
- Relax.
Think about the $25 million.
But you created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster.
Just to arrest some hacker kid?
Basically, yes.
Jesus!
You're sick, Eugene.
I'll take care of this.
I can cancel it any time.
I don't need the code.
What better way to confiscate the disk and find out how much of the garbage file was copied.
Get it!
Why did I ever trust you?
Get the file, otherwise you'll lose all your toys.
Did you find the virus program on the disks we confiscated?
No.
He's either very smart or very stupid.
Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice.
We'll release him.
Keep tight surveillance and see if he leads us to your disk.
Unit 3, outside suspect Joey Pardella's apartment.
Suspect still grounded... by his mother.
Listen to this bullshit.
'This is our world now.
The world of the electron and the switch, 'the beauty ofthe baud.
'We exist without nationality, skin colour or religious bias.
'You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us, 'and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.
'Yes, I am a criminal.
My crime is that of curiosity.
'I am a hacker and this is my manifesto.'
Right?
Manifesto?
'You may stop me, 'but you can't stop us all.'
That's cool.
- Cool?
- Yeah, cool.
You think it's cool?
- It's cool.
- It's not cool.
It's commie bullshit.
Can I crash at your place tonight?
What's with him?
His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since.
You hear about Joey's bust?
Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
You think he could hack a Gibson?
- Did you talk to him?
- No.
His mom says he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.
And no 'consorting with computer friends'.
The Secret Service is out to get him.
Want to go to a big party tonight?
It's at Kate's.
I thought so.
A little pelvis.
A little pelvis.
What the hell are you doing?
Plague!
Plague!
Gill.
I think we got something.
Yuk!
Hard copy!
Dade Murphy.
- Secret Service!
- Don't move!
What are you...?
Shut up!
What are you doing?
Get off me!
God!
Sit on the bed and keep your hands where we can see them.
The year was 1988.
A nasty virus crashed 1,500 systems in one day.
1,507.
It got you 7 years' probation.
No computer.
No touchtone phones.
Must have been hell, huh, Zero Cool?
A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system.
You were our prime suspect.
Till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
We believe that Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus.
He or his accomplice has a disk that Mr Belford needs to disable that virus.
We want you to help us find it.
Gill.
Loser.
I can't believe you were only 11 when you wrote this.
It's quite an impressive virus.
Dade.
I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but... we're hackers.
For us, there's no such thing as family and friends.
We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies.
Let's make a treaty.
I'm sorry.
Who are you?
I'm the one who understands you.
Now, can we be allies?
Nah.
I don't play well with others.
Shit!
Come on!
Watch which friends you do play with.
With your record, you could land in jail or get expelled.
No college.
No future.
Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
I'll be in touch.
He's fine.
Oh, and Dade,
- try to stay out of trouble, okay?
- Blow me.
Thank you.
Her Mom makes big bucks writing books for women.
Stuff like 'Women Who Love Men Who Are Emotional Amoebae'.
That explains a lot.
Big man, stepping in.
Coming through.
Big man, big boots.
You look good, girl.
- Yo, what's up, Nikon?
- In the house, man.
Thanks.
Dade, man.
You made it.
Houston, we have lift-off.
Three o'clock.
Check it.
Don't look right away!
Look at her, man.
Lisa Blair.
26 East 7th Street, apartment 16.
5554817.
Boom!
- How'd you know that?
- I got a photographic memory.
It's a curse.
Lisa!
Oh!
Look at that pooper, man.
Spandex, it's a privilege, not a right.
Hi, my name's Vicki and I'm an addict.
Hi.
My name's Hank and I'm an addict.
My name's Joey, but...
I'm not an addict.
No, really.
Listen.
I got in trouble with my computer.
My lawyer told the judge I'm an addict, but I'm not addicted to my computer.
No, really.
I'm not an addict.
I'm not.
Can I get some more coffee?
Yo!
Check this out.
This is insanely great.
It's got a 28.8 bps modem.
- Yeah?
Display?
- Active matrix.
A million psychedelic colours.
This baby is sweet.
- I want it.
- I want it to have my children.
- Bet it looks crispy in the dark.
- Hit the light.
Shit!
Come on.
Get out.
- Was that her top?
- One-handed.
Difficulty rating?
Seven.
Wow!
Burn's wetware matches her software.
Burn?
What are you doing here?
We're sorry!
Just looking at your fly laptop.
It's hype, you know.
You're in the butter zone now, baby.
Yeah, it is.
I want to triple the RAM.
Leopard boy and the deceptor cons.
Kate!
You're not going into that computer shit now, right?
Later, babe.
- Yeah, right.
- The sensitive type.
What's he doing here?
He's my guest, Burn.
You're Acid Burn?
!
You booted me out of OTV.
- What?
- I'm Crash Override.
You're the moron who's been invading my turf?
Whoa, whoa!
Crash... and Burn!
Murphy kid turn you down?
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
Pervert.
What are you talking about?
The FBI computer holds files on 20 million Americans.
I just hacked into it.
Congratulations.
I have access to every piece of data stored on Dade Murphy's parents.
His parents separated five years ago, reconciled, then divorced last year.
Custody battle.
Boy chose to go with his mother.
So?
So, we get the mother, we get the boy.
What the hell are you doing?
It's cool, I'm just looking.
- It's too much machine for you.
- Yeah?
I hope you don't screw like you type.
It has a killer refresh rate.
P6 chip.
Triple the speed of the Pentium.
It's not just the chip.
It has a PCI bus.
But... you knew that.
Indeed.
RISC architecture is going to change everything.
Yeah.
RISC is good.
Sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
Crash Override.
What was it?
'Mess with the best, die like the rest'?
Yeah.
Are you challenging me?
Name your stakes.
If I win, you become my slave.
Your slave?
You wish.
You'll do shit work.
Scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
Deal.
And if I win?
Make it my first born.
- Make it our first date.
- You won't win.
And you have to smile.
I don't do dates.
But I don't lose, either.
So you're on.
Here's the deal, the chosen contest:
To hassle Secret Service Agent Richard Gill and get one back for Joey.
Our decisions are final by a vote oftwo to one.
No appeals.
The duel will last until we declare a winner.
Use only the access codes and passwords in your collection.
No help from us.
Talkin' to me?
Any questions?
Yeah.
Who's going to notify his next of kin?
He's in the personal ads.
'Disappointed white male, cross-dresser, looking for discreet friend 'to bring dreams to reality.
'Leather, lace and water sports.
Transvestites welcome.'
I know where you can stick it.
ljust want to lick your earlobes and your lips.
You want to lick something?
Lick this!
That's why they call me Stallion.
That's disgusting!
My heart is steaming for you spank you with...
- I'll spank your ass!
...turn you over and...
- Agghh!
Animal!
Hey!
Hey!
Do you know who I am?
Do you know who I am?
This is Accounting, sir.
You inquired about Agent Richard Gill?
Yes.
- Our records indicate he's deceased.
- I'm what?
- Dead.
- Dead?
Yeah.
Like rigor mortis, habeas corpus.
- Very impressive.
- Superhero-like, even.
Yeah, whatever.
What's the score?
Tie.
Come on.
Due to Mr Gill's untimely demise,
- you'll have to improvise the next round.
- Right.
I win, you wear a dress on our date.
And if I win, so do you.
Deal.
Dade.
I didn't know your size, so...
I guessed.
You will stick with the deal?
Thanks.
You wanted to know who I am, Zero Cool?
Let me explain... the new world order.
Governments and corporations need people like you... and me.
We are the samurai, the keyboard cowboys.
And those otherpeople out there, who have no idea what's going on, are the cattle.
Moo.
I need your help.
You need my help.
Let me help you earn your spurs.
Think about it.
Enjoy the laptop...
Cool.
Tell me where the disk is.
You look pitiful.
Okay, you're not grounded any more.
- Yo, what's up?
- I gotta talk to you, man.
Listen.
- I copied a garbage file.
- So?
A garbage file has shit in it.
It's hot or something.
Joey, a garbage file holds odd data.
Stuff that's been erased.
I copied it from Ellingson, okay?
They're asking me about it.
Will you take a look for me?
Shit, Joey.
You got a tail.
Shit!
I am watching you.
Wake up.
Ramon?
Wake up.
Ramon, it's time for school.
Come on.
Stick your hands up!
Don't move!
Déjà vu!
You're under arrest under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.
¡La computadora de mierda!
¡Que te dije de no estar jugando con esa
- computadora!
- What are you waiting for?
Arrest me!
You get one call.
Uno.
Understand?
Operator Services?
- I'm having trouble with a number.
- What number, please?
5554202.
- Just one moment.
- Thank you.
- Hello?
- It's me.
I'm freaking.
Joey really hacked into Ellingson.
He gave me the disk he copied and now I'm injail for some serious shit!
Stuff I didn't even do, like inserting a virus called 'da Vinci'?
And they keep asking about you guys.
- Think they're gonna bust us?
- Yeah.
You better figure out what's on that disk 'cause we're being framed.
It's in the place where I put that thing once.
Hi.
Now I see what all the fuss is about.
You have company.
- Nice room.
- We need your help.
Do my ears deceive me?
No, no.
Truce, you guys.
We got a higher purpose here.
A wake-up call for the Nintendo generation.
We demand free access to data.
Well, it comes with some responsibility.
'When I was a child, I spake as a child, I thought as a child.
'But when I became a man, I put away childish things'.
What?
It's Corinthians One,
Chapter 13, verse 11, you know?
Come on.
Phreak and Joey are being framed.
Can you help us find out what's on this disk?
I can't.
Everybody who touches that disk gets arrested.
I can't risk arrest.
I'm sorry.
Maybe I should go to the bathroom.
What is it with you?
We're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help.
I really need your help.
I'm sorry.
I can't.
Could you copy the disk?
And just hide it in case we get busted so we have a copy for our lawyers.
Something that hasn't been tampered with.
You guys help yourself to anything in the fridge.
Cereal has.
Okay.
I'll copy it.
Thank you.
The girl.
The girl has the disk I need.
I told you.
I don't play well with others.
Turn on your laptop.
Set it to receive a file.
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington.
Forgery, embezzlement, two drug convictions plus jumping parole.
Once arrested, she will have no trial, she will notpass 'Go', she will go directly tojail.
Then I change this file back to the original and your mom disappears.
That's bullshit.
What can I tell you?
Computers never lie, kid.
Your mom will be arrested, handcuffed and later strip-searched.
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
Kid, don't threaten me.
There are worse things than death...
and I can do all of them.
Talk to me.
I got it.
But Kate didn't know what's on it, she came to me to figure it out.
She didn't plant the virus.
You leave her alone.
Don't worry, kid. lfshe's innocent, she'll be fine.
Your mommy's safe now, okay?
Kate, Listen.
Hold on.
- I have to tell you something.
- Hold on!
- It's so lean and clean.
- Looks like a hacker wrote it.
Come here.
Look at this.
This thing is tense.
That's ill, man.
It's incomplete.
This'll take forever to figure out.
I'll make some coffee.
Tag, you're in.
- It's not a virus.
It's a worm.
- What's it eat?
It nibbles.
You see all of this?
This is all of Ellingson's financial transactions.
From million dollar deals to $10 some guy pays for gas.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
No-one's caught it because the money isn't really gone.
It's just data being shifted around.
And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part.
Check it out.
Here it's already running at twice the speed as when it started.
- At this rate, the run ends in...
...two days.
- It's already eaten about...
...21.8 million bucks.
Whoever wrote this needs someone to take the fall.
That's Phreak and Joey and us.
We have to find out where the money's going before the worm disappears, so we can find out who created it.
I know who wrote it!
What?
This Ellingson security creep.
I gave him a copy of the disk you gave me.
You what?
I didn't know what was on it.
Oh, man!
That's universally stupid, man.
Yo, man.
You're an amateur.
Why did he come to you?
I've got a record.
I was Zero Cool.
Zero Cool crashed 1,507 systems in one day.
Biggest crash in history.
Front page New York Times, August 10, 1988.
I thought you was black, man.
Yo, man, this is Zero Cool!
That's far out!
This is Zero Cool, man!
Yeah, that's great.
There goes MIT.
- I'll make it up!
- How?
I'll hack the Gibson.
They'll trace you like that, man.
The cops will find you with a smoking gun.
Fucked if I care, man.
Even with the password, it'd take you ten minutes to get in, then you'd have to find the files.
The cops would have you in five minutes.
Oh, wow!
We are fried!
Never send a boy to do a woman's job.
With me, we can do it in seven.
I help, we do it in six.
I gotta save all your asses!
I help, we do it in five minutes.
Okay.
Let's go shopping.
You know, if I didn't live by a strict code of honour, I might take advantage of this situation.
Erotically, as it were.
All right.
Hold it right there.
Shit!
My subway defence system.
He's way down there.
Ta-da!
- Yo, brain-dead... the manual!
- Oops!
Hey!
Truck!
Find it?
The phone's all right.
The problem must be somewhere else.
They had a large chunk of the garbage file?
- How much do they know?
- Enough to implicate us.
You said the worm was untraceable.
Yeah... to civilians.
But they're hackers.
Don't worry.
We just launch the da Vinci virus.
- Then they'll all be put away.
- Launch the da Vinci virus?
- You can't do that.
- No-one believes the guilty.
By the time they realise the truth, we'll be long gone with all our money.
Look, there is no right and wrong.
There is only fun... and boring.
A 30-year prison sentence sounds pretty dull to me.
Who do you prefer serves it?
Us... or them?
Unless $5 million is transferred to the following account in seven days,
I will capsize five Ellingson tankers.
The virus goes off tomorrow at 10.30AM, and those hackers tried to get into our system again.
I insist you take more strenuous action or Ellingson Mineral will hold the Secret Service responsible.
Get me arrest warrants on Kate Libby, alias Acid Burn,
Emmanuel Goldstein, alias Cereal Killer,
Dade Murphy, alias Crash Override, also known as
Zero Cool, and Paul Cook, alias Lord Nikon.
Pick them up tomorrow at 9.00AM.
Snoop on to them as they snoop on to us.
- Yeah, it's Kate.
- Hey, Burn.
We got a little problem.
So, what've we got?
Well, 50 passwords, plus whatever Polaroid-head got inside Ellingson.
I got a lot, right?
I don't know how many, but... my head hurts.
Yo, check this out.
- What's a da Vinci virus?
- What?
It's a memo about how they'll deal with the oil spills that happened on the 14th.
What oil spills?
- Brain-dead.
Today's the 13th.
- Well, this hasn't happened yet.
The 14th is the day the worm ends it run.
Isn't the da Vinci virus what Phreak's being charged with?
Look. 'infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers'.
They blame hackers!
Damn!
A worm and a virus?
The plot thickens.
Whoa, whoa!
Where are you going?
I got an idea.
We got a few hours until we're arrested.
Stay low.
I'm going to get help.
I'll beep you.
Are you coming?
May the Force be with you, man.
There they are!
Razor and Blade?
!
They're flakes!
They're elite!
Let's get 'em.
Get off the stage, man!
Get off!
I lost them!
Where were you?
I don't like this.
I definitely don't like this.
What do you want?
We come in peace.
We need your help, if you're up to it.
She's buff.
Ballsy.
Let's keep her.
Waste the dude.
A virus called da Vinci will cause oil spills tomorrow at 10.30AM.
It's somehow connected to that worm.
We need you to overload the Gibson so we can kill da Vinci and copy the worm.
She's rabid... but cute.
See, we're very busy.
A TV network that wishes to remain nameless is interested in our show.
Let's go, Kate.
Wait.
Nobody said no.
But you will need more than just two media icons like us.
You need an army.
That's it.
An electronic army.
If I were us,
I'd get on the Internet, send out a major distress signal.
Hackers of the world, unite!
How will you take care of the cops?
I'm blowing up!
It's Kate.
Grand Central.
Let's hit it!
You're the man!
You're the man!
Joey, you made it!
Okay.
Use your best viruses to buy us some time.
We must get in and copy the worm.
I had to do that to break the tension.
- Cereal.
Go fix the phones.
- Roger.
Joey, take his place.
- Me?
- Take his place.
Do it.
You can do it.
Ready?
Let's boot up.
- What is it?
What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Just a minor glitch.
A minor glitch with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe.
There's a new virus in the database.
What's happening?
It's eating memory.
What do I do?
Type 'cookie', you idiot.
I'll head them off at the pass.
We have a bug attacking all log-in files.
Run anti-virus.
Give me a systems display.
Die, dickweeds!
A rabbit's in the system.
Send a flu shot.
Rabbit?
Flu shot?
Someone talk to me.
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file then spreads like cancer.
Cancer?
Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream.
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,
Life is but a dream.
Whoa!
Falling off!
It's a Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
There's too many garbage files.
I need more time.
They're at Grand Central station, lower level.
Don't screw up.
Get out of here!
Everyone, let's move!
Move it!
Get the hell out of the way!
Come on!
Grand Central!
Game's over.
Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.
You're not good enough to beat me.
Maybe I'm not.
But we are,
- you asshole!
- Give it up!
Just give it up.
Are we fashionably late?
Okay, let's go!
We have massive infection.
Multiple GPI viruses from remote nodes.
- They're going for the kernel.
- Colonel who?
The command processor.
The brain!
Cancer, brain.
Brain cancer!
What's going on?
In short, Duke, a shitstorm.
Move!
Go!
I found it!
I found it!
This is the end, my friend.
Thank you for calling.
Shit!
He got me!
Joey's gettin' stupid busy.
Joey, go after the worm.
You're the closest.
It's root, slash, period, 'workspace', slash, period, 'garbage', period.
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Freeze!
Come on!
All right!
Wow!
Kill the Gibson!
Roger that.
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Is that all you got?
Come on!
Let's see what else you can do.
You talking to me, huh?
Are you nuts?
Come at me!
They're in the kernel.
Help me!
The tankers have stopped capsizing.
Ballast tanks emptying.
Should be okay.
Little pissant!
Yes!
Let's get outta here!
Freeze!
They're trashing our rights, man.
They're trashing the flow of data.
Trashing!
Trashing!
Trashing!
Hack the planet!
- Hack the planet!
- Shut up and get in!
Hack the planet!
Hack the planet!
- Hello.
- We caught them.
- Good.
- Red-handed.
You won't be having any more trouble from them.
Me, all right?
I did it.
She knows shit about computers.
She's just my girlfriend.
I suggest you modify your attitude, because you are floating and I am about to flush your ass.
Mrs Murphy is here to see you, sir.
- Are you crazy?
What are you doing?
- Trying to help you.
- Dade.
- What?
Thanks for your help.
Your son is in big trouble.
He violated his probation and has engaged in criminal activities.
My son happens to be a genius.
He understands things that you won't comprehend if you live to be 100.
He would never use his knowledge to harm others.
The news crew you requested is here.
Good.
I have some things to tell them.
Your son is facing 30 felony counts in an ongoing investigation.
You face arrest if you do that.
I don't care if I face certain death.
Mrs Murphy stays right here.
Wow.
She's great.
Yeah.
...and attacked the Ellingson network.
Is this the last we've seen of this kind ofespionage?
No.
Hackers are a grave threat to the national security.
This incident just proves that we need
- increased funding to stop...
- We're getting interference.
Hola, boys and girls.
It is I, Cereal Killer, making my first worldwide global television appearance.
Yes, that's right.
I'm here to tell you about this heinous scheme hatched within Ellingson Mineral.
But for what?
World domination?
Nay.
Something far more tacky.
A virus called da Vinci, that would cause Ellingson tankers to capsize, was to be blamed on innocent hackers.
This virus was really a smokescreen.
What could be so important to protect that someone would create such a nasty, anti-social, uncool virus program?
But why?
Could it be to cover the tracks of this worm program?
A worm that was to steal 25 million bucks.
The password for this worm belongs to Margo Wallace,
- head ofPublic Relations at Ellingson.
- Oh, my God!
And Eugene Belford,
- computer security officer.
- Son of a bitch!
What's this?
The account in the Bahamas where the money was to be stashed?
I think so.
Unlucky!
Yo.
I kinda feel like God.
Plague?
Eugene?
I don't even know how to work the VCR let alone a computer.
Get off!
Listen, I'll make a deal.
Eugene Belford.
I know where his mother is.
Get off me!
I need a lawyer!
Here you are, Mr Babbage.
Flight time to Tokyo is 14 hours.
Can I get you anything else?
Just a pillow, please.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
What's going on?
Let go of me!
Stewardess!
I'll never fly this airline again!
You look good in a dress.
You would have looked better.
Wanna go for a swim?
I can't believe they decided you won.
They didn't.
The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date.
Anyway, you're pretty good.
You're elite.
Yeah?
If you'd said that at the start, you would have avoided a lot of trouble.
Beat that!
You know,
- I've been having these weird...
...dreams.

- You did this from your house?
Are you stoned or stupid?
You don't hack a bank from your house!
You get nailed by the fbi.
Are your brains in your ass?
Don't you know anything?
It's universally stupid, man.
I don't know things because you guys won't tell me anything.

Which means you score one of those Gibsons, man.
Those supercomputers they use to do physics si look for oil.

Security is too tight.

But if I wanted to hack some heavy metal, I'd work my way in through some back door.
Oh, man.
Wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons?
Who ate all of my fries?
- Joey!
- Nu, I didn't touch your fries.

Razor si Blade?
That's right.
This is a pay-phone.
Don't ask.
As you can see, this isjust a simple micro-cassette recorder.
Hook it up to the phone, si drop in five bucks in quarters.
Record the tone the coins make, hang up, get your money back.
Never again pay for a service that would be cheap, if it weren't run by profiteering gluttons.
Remember, hacking is more than just a crime.
It's a survival trait.
I'm a real wild child, I'm a wild one I'm a wild one
Multumesc!
Multumesc very much!

We got an uncorrupted hard drive.
In English, please.
I didn't protect the President for ten years to finish my career feeling like an idiot.
I'm sorry, sir.
He didn't have time to erase his computer files.
Good.
Let's finish up here.
Take him in for interrogation.
Agent Gill, can you spare a moment?
Why, of course, Jennifer.
- Joey!
- How dangerous are hackers?
Hackers penetrate si ravage public si private computer systems, infecting them with viruses si stealing sensitive materials.
These people are terrorists.
Morning, gentlemen.
Please, be seated.
I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
Once again, don't call me Eugene.
Our recent intruder penetrated using a superuser account, giving him access to our whole system.
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
Someone didn't bother reading my memo on commonly used passwords.
As I meticulously pointed out, the foremost used passwords are...
'Love', 'Sex', 'Secret' si 'God'.
So would Your Holiness care to change her password?
Un hacker planted the virus.
Virus?
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty si flooded its tanks.
Excuse me?
The little boat flipped over.
A virus planted within the Gibson system claimed responsibility.
It left a Nute?
unless $5 miIIion is transferred to the following account in 7 days,
I will capsize five tankers in the EIIingson fleet.
- ls that...?
- That is the virus.
Leonardo da Vinci.
We have 26 ships at sea si don't know which ones are infected.
Well, put the ship's ballast under manual control.
There's Nu such thing any more.
These ships are totally computerised.
They rely on satellite navigation which links them to our network, si the virus, wherever they are.
What are we supposed to do?
Luckily, you have a gifted si talented security officer.
I traced the hacker's call.
The Secret Service picked him up.
I'll search his files for the original virus code si eliminate it.
We expect you to get on this right away.
- How soon?
- As fast as I can.
This is common in corporations as large as ours.
Don't worry about it.
The Secret Service is helping us out, 100 percent.
We'll be in touch.
What the hell was that all about?
I had to move fast.
The hacker copied my garbage file.
What?
I created da Vinci so we could get the Secret Service to arrest the hacker si seize the equipment, which we can't do alone.
- l don't want to go to jail for this.
- Relax.
Think about the $25 million.
But you created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster.
Just to arrest some hacker kid?
Basically, yes.
Jesus!
You're sick, Eugene.
I'll take care of this.
I can cancel it any time.
I don't need the code.
What better way to confiscate the disk si find out how much of the garbage file was copied.
Get it!
Why did I ever trust you?
Get the file, otherwise you'll lose all your toys.
Did you find the virus program on the disks we confiscated?
Nu.
He's either very smart or very stupid.
Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice.
We'll release him.
Keep tight surveillance si see if he leads us to your disk.
Unit 3, outside suspect Joey PardeIIa's apartment.
Suspect still grounded... by his mother.
Listen to this bullshit.
'This is our world Nuw.
The world of the electron si the switch, 'the beauty ofthe baud.
'We exist without nationality, skin colour or religious bias.
'You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us, 'si try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.
'Yes, I am a criminal.
My crime is that of curiosity.
'l am Un hacker si this is my manifesto.'
Right?
Manifesto?
'You may stop me, 'but you can't stop us all.'
That's cool.
- Cool?
- Yeah, cool.
You think it's cool?
- lt's cool.
- lt's Nut cool. lt's commie bullshit.
Can I crash at your place tonight?
What's with him?
His parents missed Woodstock si he's been making up for it since.
You hear about Joey's bust?
Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
You think he could hack a Gibson?
- Did you talk to him?
- Nu.
His mom says he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.
Si Nu 'consorting with computer friends'.
The Secret Service is out to get him.
Want to go to a big party tonight?
It's at Kate's.
I thought so.
A little pelvis.
A little pelvis.
What the hell are you doing?
Plague!
Plague!
Gill.
I think we got something.
Yuk!

What are you...?
Shut up!
What are you doing?
Get off me!
God!
Sit on the bed si keep your hands where we can see them.

A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system.
You were our prime suspect.

We believe that Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus.
He or his accomplice has a disk that Mr Belford needs to disable that virus.
We want you to help us find it.
Gill.
Loser.
I can't believe you were only 1 1 when you wrote this.
It's quite an impressive virus.
Dade.
I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but... we're hackers.
For us, there's Nu such thing as family si friends.
We're each our own country, with temporary allies si enemies.

Stuff I didn't even do, like inserting a virus called 'da Vinci'?
Si they keep asking about you guys.
- Think they're gonna bust us?
- Yeah.
You better figure out what's on that disk 'cause we're being framed.
It's in the place where l put that thing once.
Hi.
Nuw I see what all the fuss is about.
You have company.
- Nice room.
- We need your help.
Do my ears deceive me?
Nu, Nu.
Truce, you guys.
We got a higher purpose here.
A wake-up call for the Nintendo generation.
We demsi free access to data.
Well, it comes with some responsibility.
'When I was a child, I spake as a child, I thought as a child.
'But when I became a man, I put away childish things'.
What?
It's Corinthians One,
Chapter 1 3, verse 1 1 , you know?
Come on.
Phreak si Joey are being framed.
Can you help us find out what's on this disk?
I can't.
Everybody who touches that disk gets arrested. I can't risk arrest.
I'm sorry.
Maybe I should go to the bathroom.
What is it with you?
We're supposed to be on the same side si we really need your help.
I really need your help.
I'm sorry. I can't.
Could you copy the disk?
Si just hide it in case we get busted so we have a copy for our lawyers.
Something that hasn't been tampered with.
You guys help yourself to anything in the fridge.
Cereal has.
Okay. I'll copy it.
Multumesc.
The girl.
The girl has the disk I need.
I told you.
I don't play well with others.
Turn on your laptop.
Set it to receive a file.
Lauren Murphy is Nuw a wanted felon in the state of Washington.
Forgery, embezzlement, two drug convictions plus jumping parole.
Once arrested, she will have Nu trial, she will Nutpass 'Go', she will go directly tojaiI.
Then I change this file back to the original si your mom disappears.
That's bullshit.
What can I tell you?
Computers never lie, kid.
Your mom will be arrested, handcuffed si later strip-searched.
You lay a finger on her si l'll kill you.
Kid, don't threaten me.
There are worse things than death...
si l can do all of them.
talk to me.
I got it.
But Kate didn't know what's on it, she came to me to figure it out.
She didn't plant the virus.
You leave her alone.
Don't worry, kid.
Ifshe's inNucent, she'II be fine.
Your mommy's safe Nuw, okay?
Kate, Listen.
Hold on.
- l have to tell you something.
- Hold on!
- lt's so lean si clean.
- Looks like Un hacker wrote it.
Come here.
Look at this.
This thing is tense.
That's ill, man.
It's incomplete.
This'll take forever to figure out.
I'll make some coffee.
Tag, you're in.
- lt's Nut a virus. lt's a worm.
- What's it eat?
It nibbles.
You see all of this?
This is all of Ellingson's financial transactions.
From million dollar deals to $10 some guy pays for gas.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Nu-one's caught it because the money isn't really gone.
It's just data being shifted around.
Si when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money si erases its tracks.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part.
Check it out.
Here it's already running at twice the speed as when it started.
- At this rate, the run ends in...
- ..two days.
- lt's already eaten about...
- ..21 .8 million bucks.
Whoever wrote this needs someone to take the fall.
That's Phreak si Joey si us.
We have to find out where the money's going before the worm disappears, so we can find out who created it.
I know who wrote it!
What?
This Ellingson security creep.
I gave him a copy of the disk you gave me.
You what?
I didn't know what was on it.
Oh, man!
That's universally stupid, man.
Yo, man.
You're an amateur.
Why did he come to you?
I've got a record.
I was Zero Cool.
Zero Cool crashed 1 ,507 systems in one day.
Biggest crash in history.
Front page New York Times, August 10, 1988.
I thought you was black, man.
Yo, man, this is Zero Cool!
That's far out!
This is Zero Cool, man!
Yeah, that's great.
There goes mit.
- l'll make it up!
- How?
I'll hack the Gibson.
They'll trace you like that, man.
The cops will find you with a smoking gun.
Fucked if I care, man.
Even with the password, it'd take you ten minutes to get in, then you'd have to find the files.
The cops would have you in five minutes.
Oh, wow!
We are fried!
Never send a boy to do a woman's job.
With me, we can do it in seven.
I help, we do it in six.
I gotta save all your asses!
I help, we do it in five minutes.
Okay.
Let's go shopping.
You know, if I didn't live by a strict code of hoNuur, I might take advantage of this situation.
Erotically, as it were.
All right.
Hold it right there.
Shit!
My subway defence system.
He's way down there.
Ta-da!
- Yo, brain-dead... the manual!
- Oops!
Hey!
Truck!
Find it?
The phone's all right.
The problem must be somewhere else.
They had a large chunk of the garbage file?
- How much do they know?
- ENuugh to implicate us.
You said the worm was untraceable.
Yeah... to civilians.
But they're hackers.
Don't worry.
We just launch the da Vinci virus.
- Then they'll all be put away.
- Launch the da Vinci virus?
- You can't do that.
- Nu-one believes the guilty.
By the time they realise the truth, we'll be long gone with all our money.
Look, there is Nu right si wrong.
There is only fun... si boring.
A 30-year prison sentence sounds pretty dull to me.
Who do you prefer serves it?
Us... or them?
unless $5 miIIion is transferred to the following account in seven days,
I will capsize five EIIingson tankers.
The virus goes off tomorrow at 10.30AM, si those hackers tried to get into our system again.
I insist you take more strenuous action or Ellingson Mineral will hold the Secret Service responsible.
Get me arrest warrants on Kate Libby, alias Acid Burn,
Emmanuel Goldstein, alias Cereal Killer,
Dade Murphy, alias Crash Override, also known as
Zero cool, si paul Cook, alias Lord Nikon.
Pick them up tomorrow at 9.00AM.
SNuop on to them as they sNuop on to us.
- Yeah, it's Kate.
- Hey, Burn.
We got a little problem.
So, what've we got?
Well, 50 passwords, plus whatever Polaroid-head got inside Ellingson.
I got a lot, right?
I don't know how many, but... my head hurts.
Yo, check this out.
- What's a da Vinci virus?
- What?
It's a memo about how they'll deal with the oil spills that happened on the 14th.
What oil spills?
- Brain-dead.
Today's the 1 3th.
- Well, this hasn't happened yet.
The 14th is the day the worm ends it run.
Isn't the da Vinci virus what Phreak's being charged with?
Look. 'infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers'.
They blame hackers!
Damn!
A worm si a virus?
The plot thickens.
Whoa, whoa!
Where are you going?
I got an idea.
We got a few hours until we're arrested.
Stay low. I'm going to get help.
I'II beep you.
Are you coming?
May the Force be with you, man.
There they are!
Razor si blade?
!
They're flakes!
They're elite!
Let's get 'em.
Get off the stage, man!
Get off!
I lost them!
Where were you?
I don't like this.
I definitely don't like this.
What do you want?
We come in peace.
We need your help, if you're up to it.
She's buff.
Ballsy.
Let's keep her.
Waste the dude.
A virus called da Vinci will cause oil spills tomorrow at 10.30AM.
It's somehow connected to that worm.
We need you to overload the Gibson so we can kill da Vinci si copy the worm.
She's rabid... but cute.
See, we're very busy.
A TV network that wishes to remain nameless is interested in our show.
Let's go, Kate.
Asteapta.
Nubody said Nu.
But you will need more than just two media icons like us.
You need an army.
That's it.
An electronic army.
If I were us, I'd get on the Internet, send out a major distress signal.
Hackers of the world, unite!
How will you take care of the cops?
I'm blowing up!
It's Kate.
Grsi Central.
Let's hit it!
You're the man!
You're the man!
Joey, you made it!
Okay.
Use your best viruses to buy us some time.
We must get in si copy the worm.
I had to do that to break the tension.
- Cereal.
Go fix the phones.
- Roger.
Joey, take his place.
- Me?
- Take his place.
Do it.
You can do it.
Ready?
Let's boot up.
- What is it?
What's wrong?
- Nuthing.
Just a miNur glitch.
A miNur glitch with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe.
There's a new virus in the database.
What's happening?
It's eating memory.
What do I do?
Type 'cookie', you idiot.
I'll head them off at the pass.
We have a bug attacking all log-in files.
Run anti-virus.
Give me a systems display.
Die, dickweeds!
A rabbit's in the system.
Send a flu shot.
Rabbit?
Flu shot?
Someone talk to me.
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file then spreads like cancer.
Cancer?
Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream.
MerriIy, merrily, merrily, merrily,
Life is but a dream.
Whoa!
Falling off!
It's a Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
There's too many garbage files.
I need more time.
They're at Grsi Central station, lower level.
Don't screw up.
Get out of here!
Everyone, let's move!
Move it!
Get the hell out of the way!
Come on!
Grsi Central!
Game's over.
Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.
You're Nut good eNuugh to beat me.
Maybe I'm Nut.
But we are,
- you asshole!
- Give it up!
Just give it up.
Are we fashionably late?
Okay, let's go!
We have massive infection.
Multiple gpl viruses... ..from remote Nudes.
- They're going for the kernel.
- Colonel who?
The commsi processor.
The brain!
Cancer, brain.
Brain cancer!
What's going on?
In short, Duke, a shitstorm.
Move!
Go!
I found it!
I found it!
This is the end, my friend.
Multumesc for calling.
Shit!
He got me!
Joey's gettin' stupid busy.
Joey, go after the worm.
You're the closest.
It's root, slash, period, 'workspace', slash, period, 'garbage', period.
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Freeze!
Come on!
All right!
Wow!
Kill the Gibson!
Roger that.
Come on, you son of a bitch.
is that all you got?
Come on!
Let's see what else you can do.
You talking to me, huh?
Are you nuts?
Come at me!
They're in the kernel.
Help me!
The tankers have stopped capsizing.
ballast tanks emptying.
Should be okay.
Little pissant!
Yes!
Let's get outta here!
Freeze!
They're trashing our rights, man.
They're trashing the flow of data.
Trashing!
Trashing!
Trashing!
Hack the planet!
- Hack the planet!
- Shut up si get in!
Hack the planet!
Hack the planet!
- Hello.
- We caught them.
- Good.
- Red-handed.
You won't be having any more trouble from them.
Me, all right?
I did it.
She knows shit about computers.
She's just my girlfriend.
I suggest you modify your attitude, because you are floating si l am about to flush your ass.
Mrs Murphy is here to see you, sir.
- Are you crazy?
What are you doing?
- Trying to help you.
- Dade.
- What?
Thanks for your help.
Your son is in big trouble.
He violated his probation si has engaged in criminal activities.
My son happens to be a genius.
He understsis things that you won't comprehend if you live to be 100.
He would never use his knowledge to harm others.
The news crew you requested is here.
Good. I have some things to tell them.
Your son is facing 30 felony counts in an ongoing investigation.
You face arrest if you do that.
I don't care if I face certain death.
Mrs Murphy stays right here.
Wow.
She's great.
Yeah.
..si attacked the EIIingson network.
Is this the Iast we've seen of this kind ofespionage?
Nu.
Hackers are a grave threat to the national security.
This incident just proves that we need
- increased funding to stop...
- We're getting interference.
hola, boys si girls.
It is I, cereal killer, making my first worldwide global television appearance.
Yes, that's right.
I'm here to tell you about this heiNuus scheme hatched within EIIingson mineral.
But for what?
world domination?
Nay.
Something far more tacky.
A virus called da Vinci, that would cause EIIingson tankers to capsize, was to be blamed on inNucent hackers.
This virus was really a smokescreen.
What could be so important to protect that someone would create such a nasty, anti-sociaI, uncool virus program?
But why?
could it be to cover the tracks of this worm program?
A worm that was to steal 25 million bucks.
The password for this worm belongs to Margo wallace,
- head ofPubIic relations at EIIingson.
- Oh, my God!
Si Eugene BeIford,
- computer security officer.
- Son of a bitch!
What's this?
The account in the Bahamas where the money was to be stashed?
I think so.
Unlucky!
Yo.
I kinda feel like God.
Plague?
Eugene?
I don't even know how to work the VCR let alone a computer.
Get off!
Listen, I'll make a deal.
Eugene Belford.
I know where his mother is.
Get off me!
I need a lawyer!
Here you are, Mr Babbage.
Flight time to Tokyo is 14 hours.
Can I get you anything else?
Just a pillow, please.
Multumesc.
You're welcome.
What's going on?
Let go of me!
Stewardess!
I'll never fly this airline again!
You look good in a dress.
You would have looked better.
Wanna go for a swim?
I can't believe they decided you won.
They didn't.
The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date.
Anyway, you're pretty good.
You're elite.
Yeah?
If you'd said that at the start, you would have avoided a lot of trouble.
Beat that!
You know,
- l've been having these weird...
- ..dreams.
- Upstairs!
- What's going on?
Who are you?
Dade!
Dade!
Knock it down.
The defendant, Dade Murphy, who calls himself 'Zero Cool', has repeatedly committed criminal acts of a malicious nature.
This defendant possesses a superior intelligence, which he uses to a destructive and antisocial end.
His computer virus crashed 1507 systems, including Wall Street trading systems, single-handedly causing a seven-point drop in the New York stock market.
Dade Murphy, I hereby fine your family $45,000.
I sentence you to probation.
You are forbidden to use a computer or a touchtone telephone until the day of your 18th birthday.
- Dade?
- Yeah, Mom?
What are you doing?
Taking over a TV network.
Finish up, honey.
Go to sleep.
And happy birthday.
Security, Norm...
Norman speaking.
Norman.
This is Mr Eddie Vedder from Accounting.
I had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on.
I'm in big trouble.
You know anything about computers?
Gee...
My BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I have this big project due tomorrow for Mr Kawasaki.
If I screw up, he'll make me commit hari-kari.
You know these Japanese management techniques.
Could you read me the number on the modem?
It's a little boxy thing with switches on it.
It lets my computer talk to the one there.
212... 5554240.
So-called American Indians, Latinos, and blacks are genetically mediocre.
Yak, yak, yak.
Get a job.
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...
The Outer Limits.
Zero...
No, wait.
Unbelievable.
A hacker.
Yeah, okay, Acid Burn.
That's enough.
Shit on me!
Good morning.
Did you unpack your stuff yet?
Up all night again?
Can this wait until both of my eyes are open?
Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll get some sleep?
He's been playing with his computer all night for a week.
Yes, he could be playing with himself.
Yes, I'll ask.
Dade, you like girls, don't you?
Yeah.
I just haven't found one as charming as you.
You haven't done anything stupid, right?
Right, Dade?
Right, Mom.
And I'm still a virgin.
You hooked it up to the phone, didn't you?
Dade, turn the shower off!
You screw up again and you won't get into college.
I'm sorry we had to move in your senior year.
I didn't want to sell the house but I had to take this job.
You know that.
You'll love New York.
It's the city that never sleeps.
I miss you, too, baby.
Claro que sí.
Excuse me.
Chill, man.
I'm talking to Venezuela.
I'm sorry.
Where's the principal's office?
I can't help you, kid.
Do you have your transfer forms?
It's a straightforward question.
Do you speak English?
Sorry, you wanted...
Transfer forms.
Are you coming?
The gym is through there and the cafeteria is through there.
Great.
Cool.
What's your name?
Kate.
Kate Libby.
Here's your class.
My class.
I'm not in your class?
No, you're not in my class.
Give me time.
- You new?
- Yeah.
Tell him about the pool, Kate.
Pool?
There's an Olympic-size swimming pool on the roof.
Take the stairs over there.
Yeah.
Sure.
Thanks.
Hey!
Hold the door!
No pool.
Oh, my God.
He found the pool.
I'm Mr Simpson.
I'm subbing for Ms Bayless, who was arrested at the anti-fur rally.
I know some ofyou kids got computers at home, but these are school property.
Chapter One.
'Designing Graphical Interface'.
What's your interest in Kate Libby?
Academic, purely sexual?
Homicidal.
What's up, man?
I'm the Phreak.
The Fantom Phreak?
The King of Nynex?
I know you play the game.
Phreak, Phreak, Phreak.
Dude, dude, dude.
Joey!
One more 'dude' and I'll slap the shit out of you.
You gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man.
You're hopeless!
- Check it.
- I need a handle.
I don't have an identity until I have a handle.
You're right about that.
Check it.
Friday.
Wait.
How about The Master of Disaster?
You're utterly hopeless, man.
Ultra Laser...
Doctor Doom!
Tell me what you need.
Records?
Tapes?
Any kind offormat or disk.
Check this out, each of you.
Compilation tapes of my own making.
I call this 'The Greatest Zukes Album', featuring Hendrix, Joplin, Mama Cass, Belushi, all great artists who asphyxiated on their own vomit!
You can't get this in stores!
Please deposit $5 for the first minute.
Thank you.
No, thank you.
That's a nice score for a girl.
Think you can do better?
