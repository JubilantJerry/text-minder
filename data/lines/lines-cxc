- A smooth shave?
You've never for a smooth shave requested.
I know, but I got you always wondered how that is.
Unless you're too busy.
- No, let me warm up a towel.
And here's twenty.
Keep the change in case you touched my neck vein.
Yes, it takes me an hour.
We need this here a little shorter.
We must make the appropriate shoulder.
Yes, I have never one-styled suit had.
Yes, sir.
It looks very good.
What can I do for you, Mr..
Kowalski?
- I am here to confess.
Oh, what have you done?
- No, you do now but easy.
What are you planning?
- Do you take me to confess, or not?
How long ago is that you last gebiecht have?
Forever.
Bless me, Reverend, for my sins.
- What are your sins, my son?
In 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski Christmas at the factory.
Dorothy was in another room with the other women.
It just happened.
Yes, go on.
I have nine hundred dollars margins by a boat and engine sales.
I have no tax paid and that is the same as a steal.
Yes, good.
Finally ...
I was never very close with my two sons.
I do not know them.
I do not know how.
Was that it?
- That was it.
It was my entire life like.
Say ten 'Weesgegroetjes' and five "Our Fathers."
God loves you and forgive you And relieved you of your sins.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Thank you, Pastor.
Will you ever take revenge what has happened with Sue?
I go to that house today, Mr. Kowalski.
Is that so?
- That is so.
And every day until you see that stupid is what you're planning.
Busy day, I gotta go.
- Go in peace.
Oh, I am peace.
Mighty God!
What is mine?
Have you ever shot with a gun?
- No.
I want you in it.
I have something I you want to show, come on.
What?
In 1952, we were sent out Chink-a strong point to overcome.
They had us nice suits.
I was the only one who came back that day.
This gave me a silver star.
Here it is.
Here, I want you to have it.
Why?
We all knew the danger that night but we went anyway.
Thus it can also go tonight.
There is always a chance that you do not come back.
- The dead Thursday not.
We are going to go in there and let them smell a poopy.
Yes, that would be stupid.
That is exactly the reaction they wait.
Come on, quit this.
How many?
- How much what?
How many men have you killed in Korea?
Thirteen, maybe more.
- How was it to kill a man?
That is you do not know.
Make it up.
Walt!
Walt!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Calm down, because you can not.
- Let me now!
Let me out!
Son of a bitch, let me out.
I kill you if I'm out!
Shut up!
Want to know how it is to kill a man?
Well, it's horrible, it is.
The only thing worse is that you have a medal courage to get, because you kill a poor boy, who had just given.
That's all.
Yes, as a frightened gook, just like you.
I shot him right in his face with that gun you just have taken down there.
Not a day goes by that I do not think.
You don 't want your soul.
I have blood on my hands.
I'm tainted.
So tonight I go alone.
Walt, take me with you!
Let me out!
Look, you've come a long way.
I am proud to say that my friend.
But you have your whole life for you.
But I?
I end things.
That is what I do.
And I go alone.
No, wait.
Walt!
I want you on my dog pass.
Yes, I love yours
Yes, she is also old.
Her name is Daisy.
Hello.
- Here is Walt.
The key to my house under the ceramic turtle at the front.
Let yourself within.
Your brother is in the basement.
I gotta go.
Sorry, Reverend.
We gotta go.
I tell you, if you are not there, there will be blood flow.
We have been here hours.
We can not afford to a unit in a location to hold.
I beg you to stay.
I have command of my sergeant.
We pull the plug out.
I'll stay.
- No, you do not.
We have a clear mission.
You came with us and you can take us away.
Watch your head.
Sue, on this side.
This side.
Let me out.
He is left without me.
He has gone without me Smokies.
Tao!
Are there within swamp rats?
I did not think that you would come.
- Shut up, gook.
I have nothing to say, under door.
A dwarf like you.
Yes, yes.
Go ahead, look out for your boyfriend.
Because it was either he or you or anyone else someone of your own family raped.
Create your own blood, in hell.
Go ahead and you pull your gun, as dwarf Cowboy's.
Go your way.
Where is Tao?
Could not that what you are?
Do not worry about Tao.
Tao has no second time for you.
Who says that?
You?
What do you do to hell, old man?
What are you doing, old man?
- Pussy.
A little schrikkerig, or not?
- Shut up.
Keep you mouth.
Got a light?
- Fuck you.
No.
I ...
I have a fire.
'Hail Mary, full of grace. "
Yes, sergeant.
What happened?
- You must make a pass backwards.
He is a friend of mine.
- He said: 'a backward pass. "
Hey, have you heard him?
A pass backwards.
What happened?
- Hey, a pass backwards.
Let me, he is my friend.
Please, it's important.
He took his lighter and they shot him down.
He had no gun with him.
This time, we have witnesses.
These guys we wanted have long detention.
Chang Agent!
Send these people back!
- Now a pass backwards, okay?
If the thunder here.
Get them here.
Walt Kowalski once said to me, I knew nothing about life and death.
Because I trained a lot, 27 year old virgin, that the basis of superstitious old women did and promised them eternal life.
Walt had no problem with that to name as he saw it.
But he was right.
I knew nothing about life and death, Walt until I know.
And guys, what have I learned.
Then I leave my house to the church after because Dorothy would have wanted.
That brings us to the last point.
And again, Excuse me for the language, in the testament of Mr. Kowalski, I read simple as it is written.
And I would like my Gran Torino in 1972, Failure to ... my friend ...
Lor Vang Tao.
Provided that your roof is not fucked, as one of the cocks, paintnostupidflamesout, as that 'white trash' boerenkinkels, notgayspoilerand placeattheend as you'll see that other nitwit cars.
Itdoesnotlook.
If you all abstains it is yours.
[MUSIC: relaxing, soft bass]
[bird chirping] [faint pipe organ] [pipe organ music]
[foot steps]
..sorry about Dorothy, Walt.
She was a real peach.
Thanks for coming, Al.
[Sighs]
..Holy Spirit.
Spectacles, testicles, wallet and watch. [Laughs]
Look at the Old Man glaring at Ashley.
He can't even tone it down for Mom's funeral?
What do you expect?
Dad's still living in the 50s.
He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly.
Yeah, well, your kid's wearing a Lion's jersey.
I'm sure Dad appreciates that.
The point I am trying to make is that there's nothing anyone can do that won't disappoint the Old Man.
It's inevitable.
That's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings.
You know, that deal with the boat motor, the broken bird bath,
It's always something.
What are we going to do with him?
Don't you think he'll get in trouble over there all by himself in the old neighborhood?
Why don't you have him move in with you?
[Chuckling]
[Coughs]
Death is often a bittersweet occasion to us, Catholics.
Bitter in the pain.
Sweet, in the salvation.
[Someone snoring] Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased.
... and their families
Sweet to those of us, who know the salvation that awaits.
And some may ask, what is death?
[Someone sighs] Is it the end?
Or is it the beginning?
And what is life?
What is this thing we call life?
[Beeping] All these questions can frustrate you at times like this. (Stop that!
)
- And that's why you have to turn to the Lord.
- Jesus ...
Because the Lord is the sweetness.
- Is that dad?
- No, that's grandpa Walt.
There is a platoon, E-Company, March 2, 1952.
- Korea?
- Where's Korea?
[People chattering]
Well, people showed up after the service, huh?
Yeah, well, I suppose they heard there'd be a lot of ham.
I'll go down the basement and get some chairs.
- Oh, I can do that, Dad..
- No, we need them now not next week.
Cool, I found a medal.
Look at this.
[Chest closes]
[Squeaky, popping stairs]
How much longer do we have to stay?
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell and I'm bored.
Ashley, honey.
Why don't you help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?
- Me?
- Yes, you.
Grandpa Walt, would you like some help with these four chairs.
No, you probably just painted your nails.
(Whispering) Your dad is driving me crazy.
- Why did you guys even-
- It's okay, honey, we're leaving soon?
Come on, let's go.
[Neighbor chattering in foreign language]
How many swamp rats can get in one room?
Wow, Grandpa, when'd you get the vintage car?
1972.
I never knew you had a cool old car.
Yeah, it's been here since before you were born.
So, what are you going do with it when you..
like die?
Grr..
Then what about that super cool retro couch that you have in the den cause I was thinking, I'm going to State next year... and I think it would look really good in my dorm room.
And I don't have any furniture at all.
God.
- Who are you?
- Hi, I am Tao.
- What do you want?
I live next door.
- Come on, get the shit out of your mouth.
I wa--
- Tell me what you want.
Do you have jumper cables?
My uncle's car is old and.....
No, we don't any jumper cables.
And have some respect, zipper head, we're mourning here..
How you holding up, Walt?
Mr. Kowalski.
- Huh?
- Mr. Kowalski, that's my name.
Right, Mr. Kowalski.
Your wife and I became quite close these last few months.
She asked that I watch over you when she passed on.
I told her I watch over my entire flock.
But she made me promise I'd keep an extra sharp eye on you.
I appreciate your kindness you've shown to my wife.
Now that you've spoken your piece, why don't go and attend some of your other sheep?
Ok?
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her desire for you to go to confession.
She said she couldn't remember the last time you went.
- Is that so?
- It is.
Well, I confess that I never really cared for church very much.
The only reason I went was because of her.
And I confess that I have no desire to confess to a boy that is just out of the seminary.
- Bye, dear.
- G'bye, Walt.
Wish I could help, dad, but.. gotta get the kids home.
- Kids getting restless.
- Yeah, fine, just go.
- I'll call in a few, see how you're doing.
- All right.
Kill you to buy American.
Jeez...
Did you see the way he looked at the truck?
Jeez.
It's always Rice-Burner this or Jap-Burner that.
You know.
Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go.
- Well, at least he didn't say anything this time.
-He didn't need to.
Well, what do you expect, Mitch?
The man worked at a Ford plant for all those years.
I suppose that's my goddamned fault?
Just give it a rest and drive.
Ok?
Kids, do you want the radio on?
/ Yes.
You want to listen to some music?
Good.
Damn, barbarians.
[Metal clanging]
Oh, Jesus ...
Polaski would roll over in his grave if he could see his lawn now.
What the hell the chinks had to move in this neighborhood for?
Have you gone completely deaf or something?
Hi there, Walt.
I kind of not a friend of yours.
Why do you insist on calling me, Walt?
Sorry , Mr. Kowalski.
- What are you peddling today, padre?
- Nothing.
Thought I'd drop by and see how you are doing.
I haven't seen you in church in a while.
Okay.
Well, now that you've done your good deed, why don't you just take off down the road?
- I'd really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.
- Not in this lifetime, sonny.
Why?
- Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
- You don't want to know.
No, I do.
Well I think you're an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold hands of old ladies who are superstitious and promises them eternity.
[Reggae music thumping]
Yo!
Hey!
Is you a boy or is you a girl, man, I can't tell.
Hey, Chicito.
If you was in pink, I would fuck you and your ass would be my bitch.
What ya reading, Jackass and the Rice Stalk?
That's right, you keep walking.
- Look at me when I talk to you, hom.
- Fucking slopes everywhere you look, man.

- Go back to your rice paddy.
Look at that, man.
- That's my little cousin, over there.
- You sure that's your cousin, man?
- Fuck yes, that's my little cousin.
- He tight with anybody?
- No, he is flying solo, man.
- Flying solo?
Let's go down and see what the fuck they're doing to him.
I love your jungles too.

They fucking with you?

Let's get the fuck out of here.
Let's get this strapped.
Pussy!
Hey, Tao.
Hey what's up?
What's up, Tao?
What are you doing little man?
Why are you doing woman's work?
What do you want?
What?
We can't just come and talk to my little cousin?
He doesn't want to talk to you.
- Well, I am here right.
- Hey, Spider, who dat?
- What's up?
- Spider?
Is that what he just called you, Fong?
- Spider?
- Is there something wrong with Spider?
What are you doing here?
Hey, so how old is you anyways?
- Mentally, I am way too old for you.
- What?
You are just stupid.
I am going inside.
Sue!
Help yor bra, do dis gardni.
Quiet, stupid.
Hey, you will roll with us man, come on?
- Dude, come on ride with us.
- C'mon, chill with us.
You need somebody to protect you, man.
That's what your big cousins are for.
Look, dawg.
I've been there, I've done it and I've seen it.
Back in a day everybody used to want to beat me up, dawg.
But now look, nobody want to fuck with me.
- Come on man, let's go.
- We are couz right?
- Come on.
- We are couz right?
We are family.
Look, a brother to Spider, is a brother to me, c'mon.
- Take this shit off, man, c'mon.
- Roll with us.
- That's a woman's work man.
- Come and get your hands dirty, man.
So what do I have to do?
Spider told me that old boy next door had a bad ass whip.
[Hmong language]
Come on.
- Nice.
- Ya, my little cousin being little man.
Yo, that's a nice car.
Hell, yeah, 1972 Gran Torino, Fastback.
- Cobra jet engine.
- Yo man it still in mint condition.
Yo man, it's in mint condition man.
I've got one.
A Mexican, a Jew and a colored guy go into a bar.
The bartender looks up and says:
"Get the fuck out of here!"
So, here's where my flock congregates when they're not in church..
- Hey, Father J.
- Hey, Mel.
Hey, Darrel.
- Hey, father.
- Hi, Walt.
What brings you in here, father.
Meat raffle?
No, I just came down to talk to Walt if that's ok.
Damn, padre.
You are persistent, aren't you?
I promised your wife.
All right, let's get a booze.
I'll have Pabst and a shot of Jack.
And whatever he's having.
- I'll have a Diet Coke.
- Bullshit.
This is a bar.
You have a drink.
- I'll have a gin and tonic.
- Attaboy!
So, what do you want?
I promised your wife I'd get you to go to confession.
- Now, why would you do that?
- She was very insistent.
She made me.
Well you're kinda fond of promising things you can't deliver on, right, father?
- Let's talk about something else.
- What?
Life and death.
Life and death.
What the hell do you know about life and death?
I'd like to think I know a lot.
I'm a priest..
Yeah, you get up and preach about life and death.
But all what you know is what you learned in a priest school.
Right out of the rookie Preacher's Handbook.
I don't know about that.
I think...
That is bittersweet.
Sort of bitter in its pain.
But sweet in its salvation.
That's what you know of life and death, and that's pathetic.
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?
I know a lot.
I lived there almost three years in Korea.
Thanks.
We shot men.
We stabbed them with bayonets, hacked 17-year-olds to death with shovels stuff I'll remember till the day I die.
Horrible things, but things I live with.
And what about life?
Well, I ...
I survived the war.
got married... and had a family.
Sounds like you know more about death than you do living.
Maybe so, father.
Maybe so.
Son of a bitch.
- Hey, man, get in the car!
- Tao, what the fuck, get in!
- Come on Tao.
- Come, let's go,man, get in!
Fuck, man, get in!
[Phone ringing]
[Drill sound] [Phone rings]
Hello?
Hey, G'morning, Dad, it's your number one son, Mitch.
Morning?
It's after one in the afternoon.
It's not morning.
Oh, right.
Afternoon, then.
- So what do you want?
- What?
No, nothing.
I mean, what would I want?
Well, I don't know.
Your wife has already gone through all of your mother's jewelry.
No, dad.
I'm just calling to see how you are doing.
Well, anything new with the old neighborhood?
Ye...
No.
- Great.
Smooth sailing then.
- Yeah.
- Ok, good, good, then.
- Oh, hey, Dad.
- Yeah.
You wouldn't happen to still know that guy from the plant that has Lion season tickets?
Are you f--
Dad-- ?
Ain't she sweet?
[Sipping]
Come on.
Hey, what's up?
- What is you doin' out here, man?
- Nothing.
- Minding our own business.
- Just hanging out.
What are you guys doing here?
What?
Can I just come here to hang with my little cousin?
- We have a good news for you, man.
- Really, and what's that?
- Only for guy talk.
- I don't think so.
Why not?
C'mon, man, we're gonna give you another shot, man.
C'mon.
- Don't go, Tao.
- Mind your own business, girl.
- Come on, let's go
- Come.
[Commotion, everyone speaking Hmong]
What the hell is this?
Get up.
Get off my lawn.
Listen old man, you don't want to fuck with me.
Did you hear me?
I said get off my lawn, now.
Are you fucking crazy?
Go back in the house.
Yeah, I'll blow the hole in your face and then I'll go in the house.
And I'll sleep like a baby.
You can count on that.
We used to stack fucks like you 5 feet high in Korea used you for sandbags.
Ok.
You better watch your back...
He's crazy.
[Speaking in Hmong]
Thank you.
Get off my lawn.
[Speaking in Hmong]
What the hell is this?
No, no, no, no, no.
C'mon, no more.
No more, no more.
Stay right there.
Stay right there.
Why can't you people just leave me alone?
We brought you some chives to plant in the garden.
I don't want them.
They're perennials, they come back every year.
Look, why are bringing me all this garbage anyway.
Because...
Because you saved Tao.
I didn't save anybody.
I just..
I kept a bunch of jabbering gooks off of my lawn.
- Well, you're a hero to the neighborhood.
- I am not a hero.
Too bad, they think you are and that's why they keep bringing you the gifts.
- Please take them.
- Well, they're wrong.
- I just want to be left alone, thank you.
- [Speaking Hmong] Wait!
This is my mom, Vu, I'm Sue and that's my brother, Tao.
- We live next door.
- So?
Tao wants to say something.
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?
For trying to steal your car.
Let me tell you something boy.
You step on this property again, you're done.
Good afternoon, Walt.
- I told you I'm not going to confession.
- Why didn't you just call the police?
What?
I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I heard there was some trouble in the neighborhood.
Why didn't call the police?
Well ...
You know why, I've prayed that they would show up, but nobody answered.
- What were you thinking?
Someone could've been killed.
We're talking life and death here.
When things go wrong, you gotta act quickly.
When we were in Korea and a 1000 screaming gooks came across our land we didn't call the police.
We reacted.
- We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski.
I've been thinking about our conversation on life and death.
About what you said.
About how you carry around all the horrible things you were forced to do.
Horrible things that won't leave you.
It seems that it would do you good to unload some of that burden.
Things done during war are terrible.
Being ordered to kill killing to save yourself, killing to save others.
You're right, those are things I know nothing about.
But I do know about forgiveness.
And I've seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins admitted their guilt and left their burdens behind them.
Stronger men than you!
Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things and are now at peace.
Well I got to hand it to you, padre, you came here with your guns loaded this time.
- Thank you!
- And you're right about one thing.
About stronger men than me, reaching their salvation.
Well, Hallefuckinlujah.
- But you are wrong about something else.
- What's that, Mr. Kowalski?
The thing that haunts a man the most is what he isn't ordered to do.
There, finally, you look like a human being again.
You shouldn't wait so long between haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch.
Well, I'm surprised you're still around.
I was always hoping that you die off and they get somebody in here they knew what the hell they were doing.
Instead you just keep hanging around, like the do-up dago you are.
- That'll be ten bucks, Walt.
- Ten bucks, Jesus Christ, Martin.
What are you half-Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices all the time.
It's been ten bucks for the last five years... and you hard-nosed, Pollack son of a bitch.
- Keep the change.
- See you in 3 weeks, prick.
Not if I see you first, dipshit.
[Chuckling]
Sounds like it'll go down hill after that.
- Yeah.
- So, that's like--
That's cool, you know.
Man, look at this.
Check this out.
Bring your tight ass over here.
Come here, girl.
Don't be shy.
You can't say hi?
Or are you acting like stuck-up and shit.
- What's you supposed to be, man?
- Yo, it's cool dawg.
The fuck are you doing in my neighborhood, boy?
None, Just going to the corner spot, you know get some CDs, sound good, bro?
- He called, you bro!
- C'mon, sound good, bro?
- Sound good.
- Shut the fuck up.
Call me bro again, and I'll bite your motherfucking face off.
- Yeah, motherfucker.
- Now what the fuck yo come down here for?
You here to bring me this little present?
- Oriental yummy?
- Don't worry, I'm gonna take a real good care with her.
- Fuck outta here.
- Fuck outta here, man!
Oh shit, you have a bitch with you.
Keep your ass right here.
Oh great.
Another asshole who has a fetish for Asian girls.
God, it gets so old.
Oh, shit, what's your name girl?
My name?
Get your ass out of here, okay.
It's 'take your crude, overly obvious come-on to every woman who walks past and cram it.'
That's my name.
Who do you think you are talking to?
Who does it look like?
You think you're real funny, don't you?
- Man, she's tough.
- What?
You gonna hit me now?
That'd pretty much complete the picture.
You need to keep your bitch on a leash.
Put a choke chain on her and yank that motherfucker.
- Of course, right to the stereotype thesaurus.
- Oh yeah.
- Call me a whore and a bitch in the same sentence.
- Bitch is crazy.
- I like her like that.
- Now take that bitch.
Oh, shit, you don't know when to quit, do you, girl?
Let me teach your ass a lesson.
That's what you need.
Stop!
Let me go!
Take your ass over there.
What the fuck are you looking at old man?
What the hell are you spooks up to?
Spooks?
You'd better get your ass on honkey, while I still let you.
That's what you'd better do.
Da fuck he think he eh?
Have you noticed how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't have fucked with?
That's me.
You fucking crazy, get outta here, man.
Why don't ya get your ass outta here bfar I kick yo wrinkly white ass.
Crazy, mothafucka, what's wrong with him, man?
What da fuck?
- Motherfucker's crazy!
-What is this thing?
What the hell?
Get in the truck.
- Crazy motherfucker.
- What's wrong with him, man.
- Oh!
Shit!
- Hey, pops c'mon now.
- Shut your fucking face!
You fucking don't listen, do you?
- Now get in the truck.
- Go get in a truck girl.
- Way to go, man!
- Shut up pussy.
What is this 'bro' shit anyway?
You want to be superb page, or something?
These guy don't want to be your bro and I don't blame them.
Now get your old faint paddy ass on down the road.
Take care now.
You too.
Oh, yeah.
Why ya'll fuckin' do nothing?
Man you fucking!
Shit man.
If he had cannon at your fucking face, you would do nothing.
What's the matter with you, for Christ sake?
Trying to get yourself killed?
I thought you Asian girls were supposed to be smart.
Hanging around in the neighborhood like that is the fast way to get you in the obituaries.
I know, I know.
Take it easy.
And what about that goofball guy you were with.
Is that a date or something?
- Yeah, kind of.
His name is Trey.
- You shouldn't be hanging out with him.
You should be hanging out with your own people.
The other Hummongs.
You mean, Hmong?
- Hmong, not Hummong
- Whatever.
What the hell is Humong, I mean Mong anyway?
Wow, you so enlightened you know that?
No, Hmong is not a place, it is a people.
My people come from different parts of Laos, Thailand, and China.
Well how did you end up in my neighborhood?
Why didn't you stay there?
It's Vietnam thing.
We fought on your side.
And when Americans quit the communists started killing all the Hmong.
So we came over here.
Yeah, well I don't know how you ended up in the Midwest.
Snow on the ground six months out of the year.
What is it?
Jungle people wanted to be on a great frozen tundra?
Hill people.
We are hill people.
Not jungle people.
BOO-ga, BOO-ga, BOO-ga!
Yeah, whatever...
Blame the Lutherans.
They brought us over here.
Everybody blames the Lutherans.
Well, you'd think the cold will keep all the idiots out.
Thanks for the ride.
You know something kid, you are all right.
But what about that dimwit brother of yours?
He little slow or something?
Tao is actually really smart.
He just doesn't know which direction to go in.
- Yeah, poor toad.
- It's really common.
Hmong girls over here fit in better.
The girls go to college and the boys go to jail.
That old hag hates my ass.
Your birthday today, Daisy.
This year you have to make a choice between two life paths.
Second chances come your way.
Extraordinary events culminate in what might seem to be an anticlimax.
You lucky numbers are:
84, 23, 11, 78, and 99.
What a load of shit.
Yea.
What the hell is it with kids nowadays?
All right.
- Let me help you with those.
- Oh, thank you.
How about that?
How about that, Daisy?
- That's too heavy for a bag.
- No problem. / Thank you.
- Good, Karen, give it to him.
- Here you go.
- Well, what is it?
- It's a gopher.
So you can reach stuff.
It makes things a lot of easier.
This is from me.
It's a phone.
Oh, I can see that.
I just thought...well, we thought that it would make things easier.
Thank you, Karen.
There's nothing wrong with making things less hard on yourself.
You know Karen's right, Dad.
You've worked hard your whole life.
Maybe it's time you started thinking about taking it easier?
And some other thing, Dad.
You really should get rid of the coffin nails.
But, da.. we were thinking about the house.
You know, well, with Mom gone, it's got to be a lot to maintain around here.
Let alone clean.
And you are here all alone...
Yeah, you know, there are these great places now, you know, these communities where you don't have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow.
You know, people are like you, active and alert, but are alone.
And would benefit from being around folks their own age.
Yeah, Dad, look.
You got to check it out.
We brought some brochures.
These places are nothing like that you think they would be.
They are great.
No, they are beautiful.
They are really nice They really are.
These are top-notch like resorts.
- It is like staying in a hotel, practically.
- They're beautiful.
- They really are.
- Yeah.
They care of everything.
They clean up.
They're really nice.
Oh, there are wonderful stores, you can buy new shoes.
They are amazing, they really are.
You have a good time, play some golf maybe.
Meet other people.
Son of a bitch.
Kicking us out on his birthday.
I told you that this was a bad idea.
- I know, you were right
- He won't let anybody help him.
Well, we tried.
Can we just drop it?
No one can say we didn't try.
What the hell with him, you know what we should've done.
We should've stayed home with Josh and Ashley.
At least they were smart enough not come.
The goddamn kids have more sense than we do.
Ah, we miss mama, don't we, Daisy?
[Hmong; car door closing]
Hey, Walt.
What are you up to?
We're having a barbecue.
You want to come over?
- What do you think?
- There's tons of fooood.
- Just keep your hands off my dog.
- No worries.
We only eat cats.
- Really?
- No, I'm kidding, you moron.
- C'mon, you can be my special guest.
- No, I am fine right here.
Yeah...
- Son of a bitch.
- Okay, so, what have you had to eat today?
I had a piece of cake.
Little beef jerky.
Come on over and get something to eat.
We've got beer too.
Well...
I might as well drink with strangers, better than drinking alone.
After all, it is my birthday.
- Really.
Happy birthday, Wally
- Don't call me Wally.
- You have no pets, but plenty of beer.
- As they say, "when in Hmong."
What am I doing wrong?
Every time I look at somebody they always look at the ground.
You're fine.
[Speaking Hmong]
- What is she saying?
- She said welcome to our home.
- Oh no, she is not.
- No, she didn't.
She hates me.
Yeah, she hates you.
Okay.
What?
!
What are all you fish heads looking at anyway?
I think we should go into the other room.
Sorry.
All the people in this house are very traditional.
Number 1.
Never touch a Hmong person on their head.
Not even a child.
Hmong people believe that the soul resides on the head.
- So, don't do that.
- Sounds dumb, but fine.
And a lot of Hmong people consider looking at someone in their eye to be very rude.
That's why they look away, when you look at them.
Anything else?
Yeah, some Hmong people tend to smile or grin when they're yelled at.
It's a cultural thing.
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity, it's not that they're laughing at you or anything.
You people are nuts.
But the food..
- It looks good, smells good too.
- Of course, it's Hmong food.
Okay, and then can I come back for seconds?
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
You know, you mentioned about looking at people, he's been staring at me the whole evening.
That's Kor Khue.
He is the Lor family shaman.
And what's that?
Some sort of witch doctor or something.
Something like that.
- Boo-ga boo.
- Ah, ha, you're funny, Wally.
[Speaking Hmong]
Kor Khue's interested in you.
He heard what you did.
He would like to read you.
It would be rude not allow him this.
It's a great honor.
- Yeah sure, fine by me.
- All right, take a seat.
[Speaking Hmong]
He says people do not respect you.
They don't even want to look at you.
[Speaking Hmong]
He says the way you live, your food has no flavor.
You wearied by your life.
[Speaking Hmong]
You made a mistake in your past life, like a mistake that you did you are not satisfied with.
[Speaking Hmong]
He says you have no happiness in your life.
It's like you are not at peace.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I am fine.
Fine, I am fine.
God, I've got more in common with these gooks than I do with my own spoiled-rotten family.
Jesus Christ ...
Happy birthday.
Are you ok?
Yeah, yeah, I am fine.
- You were bleeding.
- No, I bit my tongue.
It's nothing.
Why don't we go down and get some of that good gook food.
I am starving.
Okay.
You ladies are wonderful.
That stuff is really good.
- C'mon you glutton!
- What's up?
- Let's go.
- What for?
- To mingle.
- We can mingle right here.
C'mon, you told me not to leave you alone.
Thank you very much, but I have to..
I have to go now.
I'll be back.
Don't let me go away.
- Well, well, well, look who's over there?
- Yeah, the kid who steal my Gran Torino.
- My brother Tao.
- Tried to anyway, yeah, toad.
It was wobby a bit.
But it should fix it.
What's this?
Little rice liquor.
Here, try it.
All right.
My friends and I were just wondering what you're doing here?
That's a good question.
What am I doing here?
- My name is Walt.
- Hey, Walt.
I am Youa.
- Yu yang?
- No, Youa.
- Youa, ok.
- So what do you do?
- I fix things.
Stuff like that.
- Like what?
I've just fixed that dryer there.
I fixed my wife's friend's sink.
I took old aunt Merry to doctor to get a prescription.
Fixed up.
I've even the fixed the door, that had't even broken yet.
You're funny.
I've been called a lot of things, but never funny.
- Well, I'll take off.
Enjoy yourself.
- Okay, Yum Yao.
Pleasure.
Come on.
Relax, zipper head.
I am not gonna shoot you.
I'd look down too if I was you.
You know, I knew you were a dipshit the first time I ever saw you.
But I never thought you're worse with women than you are with stealing cars, Toad.
- It's Tao.
- What?
It's not toad, it's Tao.
My name is Tao.
You were blowing it with that girl who was there.
Not that I'd give two shits about a Toad like you.
You don't what you are talking about.
You're wrong egg roll.
I know exactly what I'm talking about.
I may not be the most pleasant person to be around.
But I got the best woman who was ever on this planet to marry me.
I worked at it.
That was the best thing that ever happened to me.
Hands down.
But you... you know...
You let Click Clack, Ding Dong and Charlie Chan just walk out..
...with Miss what's-her-face.
She likes you, you know, though I don't know why.
Who?
Yum yum!
You know that girl in the purple sweater.
She's been looking at you all day, stupid.
- You mean, Youa?
- Yeah, Yum Yum.
Yeah.
Nice girl, very charming girl.
I talked with her.
But, you, you let her just walk right out with three stooges.
And you know why?
Cause you are big, fat pussy.
Well...
I gotta go.
Good day.
Pussy cake.
[Speaking Hmong]
No, no more.
Okay, put them over there.
No.
No.
No more No more.
C'mon.
No more.
[Speaking Hmong]
No more, please...
Is that chicken dumpling thing you brought before?
All right.
Better than beef jerky all the time.
What's going on?
- What's going on?
- Tao is here to make amends.
- He is here to work for you.
- No, he isn't.
He's not gonna work for me.
My mom said he dishonored the family.
And now he has to work off his debt.
- He starts tomorrow morning.
- Oh not tomorrow, not any time.
I don't even want him on my property I thought we went over all that.
It is very important to my mom that you accept and that would be an insult if you refuse.
Why is it being put back on me, all of sudden?
He's the one who tried to steal my car.
All of the sudden, I'm the bad guy in this thing.
Look, my family is very traditional and would be very much upset if you don't let Tao repay.
If he doesn't want to do it, then let's just go.
Shut up!
[Mom shouting in Hmong]
Yeah, shut up.
All right, tomorrow, c'mon, tomorrow.
Thank you.
Jesus, Joseph, and Mary.
These Hmong broads are like badgers.
Son of a bitch.
I never thought he'd show.
All right, what are you good at?
- Like what?
- That's what I am asking.
You gonna work for me, I gotta know what you are good at.
- I gotta know what you can do.
- I don't know.
That's kind of half way what I expected you to say.
See that tree right there?
You just go over there and count the birds.
- You want me to count the birds?
- Yeah, you can count?
All you slopes are supposed to be good at math, right?
- Yeah, I can count.
- Good.
One, two...
So, what do you have for me to do?
You want me to watch paint dry or maybe count the clouds that pass by?
Don't get flip with me, boy.
I am not the one who tried to steal, don't you forget that.
Go ahead.
I don't care if you insult me and say racist things.
- Cause you know what?
I'll take it.
- Of course, you'll take it.
Cause you have no teeth, you have no balls, kid.
Look, I'm stuck here.
Why don't you find something useful for me to do.
Unlike you, I am not useless.
And I maintain my own property.
These swamp rats, on the other hand, you just can't help it.
How long do I have you for?
Toad, how long?
'till next Friday.
[Chuckling] All right.
Go get that ladder out of the garage.
When you get finished with that roof there.
You can take that gutter, and nail it back up.
I am tired looking at it for the last three years.
[Older man speaking Hmong]
Yeah, you said it, brother.
[Panting]
Hello.
Grandpa says he want to know if you can have Tao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch?
Wasp nest?
That's terrible.
I think we can handle that after lunch.
[Bell ringing]
Jesus, Lord All Mighty, knock it off!
Hey, it's my last day.
What else do you have for me to do?
Take the day-off.
You did enough.
Toad!
Nothing.
Nevermind.
Kawski?
Kawski?
Koski?
Mr. Kowalski?
Good morning.
I looked over your paperwork and I think we should immediately start a full battery of tests.
I feel that this would be the best way to go about checking out all the issues that you've had.
Excuse me, what happened to Dr.Fellman, my regular doctor?
Dr. Fellmon retired three years ago.
I am his replacement, Dr. Chu.
- It's grandpa Walt.
- Pick it up.
You talk to him!
Mitch.
- I'm doing bills here.
- You talk to him, he's your father.
Hey, Dad.
Hi, Mitch.
It's me your dad.
Yeah, I know.
What's up?
Oh, nothing, nothing much really.
How is everything going?
I am fine, fine, doing fine.
How about Karen and the kids?
Fine, everybody is great.
Doing fine.
Good.
How about work?
Busy.
Yeah..
I suppose...
In fact, um, speaking of busy, I got a lot on my plate right now so if it is not something pressing.
No, no, not at all.
So, why don't you call me this weekend?
Sure.
Ok, it was nice talking to you, dad.
Thanks for calling.
Thanks.
[Hip hop music thumping]
This kid doesn't have a chance.
What do you know about faucets?
I know a lot about them, boy.
Tend to side.
- Jesus.
For the love of Pete.
- What?
It must be a 100 degrees here.
Just, turn on the fan.
This place is falling apart.
Where did you get all the stuff?
- What are you talking about?
- All the tools and stuff.
Well, may come as surprise to a thief but I bought this stuff.
Everything in here with my own money.
Yeah, yeah, this is not what I meant.
I mean this is so much shit packed in here.
Yeah, well.
Every tool in here has a purpose.
Everything has a job to do.
- They are all used when necessary.
- Okay, so, what's that?
- That's a post hole digger.
- That.
Vice-grips.
Wire cutters, you know that's a trowel.
C'mon.
There is shears right there, and that's a saw.
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me kid.
All right, what's on your mind.
It's just..
I can't afford to buy all this stuff.
Well, I guess, even a bonehead like you, could understand that a man acquires these over a period of 50 years.
- Yeah, but...
- All right, look, here.
These three items right here, you can have these.
WD-40, vice grips, and some duck tape.
Any man worth his salt, can do half of the house chores with just those three things.
Anything else you need you just borrow it, that's all.
Ok, cool.
- Fuck me.
- What's with that?
Nothing.
What?
Nothing, huh?
I just saw you've coughed out blood.
That's not good.
You should really see a doctor.
Look..
Those guys over here, the other night ...
- on my lawn, what a bout them?
- Just a gang.
Bunch of Hmong gang bangers.
I assume that.
What they were doing here?
They were going to take me away.
They were kind of pissed, that I blew my first initiation.
Yeah, well you are, you are a pussy.
You wanna hang out with guys like that.
What was your initiation supposed to be?
My Gran Torino?
Christ, old Friday.
Shit!
Toad, you got a minute?
Here it is.
Here is the deal.
I take the top, cause that's the heaviest.
I'll pull on that.
And you stand right back here, and you push.
And help me push it up each step.
- Just like that.
- Then, let me take the top.
No, no, I've got a top.
No, I'll take the top.
It looks pretty heavy.
Look, I'm not crippled.
I've got the top.
If you don't let me take the top.
I ain't helping.
I'm gonna go back home.
- Listen to me, zipper head.
- No, you listen, old man!
I am here because you need help.
So it's either top or I'm out of here.
All right, you take the top and I'll push.
Don't let it slip off you little girl hands and crush me.
Don't give me any ideas now.
That thing weighs a ton.
Runs like a clock, though.
They don't make them like this anymore.
- So what are you going to do with it?
- Sell it I guess.
- How much?
- 60 bucks.
I am tired of having this sit around down in the basement there.
Why?
You are looking for a freezer?
- Our downstairs one kind of died.
- Okay, 25 bucks and it's yours.
25?
But you just said 60.
I know, it will save me money putting an ad in the paper.
Come on, let wheel it over to your place.
- Kind of ironic, huh?
- What?
Toad washing a car they tried to steal from you.
Yeah, he misses one spot, he's doing it all over again too.
It's nice of you to kind look after him like this.
He doesn't have any real role models in his life.
- Well, I am not any role model.
- But you're a good man, Wally.
- I wish our father would've been more like you.
- Don't go calling me Wally.
No, I am serious.
He was really hard on us.
Really traditional and really old school.
- Well, I am old school.
Yeah, but you're an American.
What's that supposed to mean?
- You like him, don't you?
- Are you kidding?
He tried to steal my car.
And you spend time with him, teaching him how to fix things.
- Saved him from that fucked cousin of ours...
- Hey, watch your language, lady.
And you're a good man
I am not a good man.
Get me another beer, dragon lady.
This one's empty.
You know, Hmong consider gardening to be a woman's work.
Yeah, that probably why I see you in the garden over there all the time.
- Besides we ain't in Hu-Mong.
- Funny.
You know you should quit.
That's bad for you.
Yeah?
So it is being in a gang, dipshit.
Didn't you hear what I just said?
I saw you cough out blood.
You should quit.
What's that emblem supposed to mean anyway?
Your ancient cub scout emblem?
1st cavalry.
I've had it since 51.
So what you wanna do with you life kid?
I was thinking about, maybe sales.
Sales, eh?
My oldest son is in sales.
Does he do well?
Oh, yeah.
License to steal.
I worked in a Ford factory for 50 years.
And he's out selling Japanese cars.
You made cars?
Yeah.
I put the steering column in this Gran Torino in 1972, right on the line.
You are old.
So cool.
So you wanna be in sales?
Thinking about going to school, maybe.
- Kinda, but school cost money.
- Maybe you should get a job.
Can't just sit there and spread mulch in my garden for the rest of your life.
Well, maybe you can just pay me.
Yeah, very funny.
- What kind of job could I ever get?
- Yeah you're right, nobody would ever hire you.
Look, I am just kidding zip...
I mean.
You can get a job.
You can get a job anywhere.
Like what?
- How about construction?
- Me?
- Yeah.
- Construction?
- Yeah.
- Do you have Alzheimer's or something?
.
No, get a job in the construction.
I know people in the trades.
Of course, I have to make a little adjustment and man you up a little bit.
- Man me up?
- Yeah.
And I think you ought to date Miss Yum Yum too.
Do you little good.
Get carbon off the valves.
Now you're just gonna learn how guys talk.
You just listen the way Martin and I batter it back and forth.
- You okay?
You ready?
- Sure. / All right.
Let's go in.
Perfect.
A pollack and a chink.
How are you doing, Martin, you crazy Italian prick.
Walt, you cheap bastard, I should have known you'd come in I was having such a pleasant day
- What did you do?
Jew some poor blind guy out of his money.
- Give him a wrong change?
- Who's the nip?
He's the pussy kid from next door, I am just trying to man him up a little bit.
You see kid?
That's how guys talk to one another.
- They do?
- Why, do you have shit in your ears?
Now go out and come back in and talk to him like a man.
Like a real man.
Come on.
Get your ass out of here.
Come on back now.
Sorry about this.
That's ok.
What's up you old Italian prick?
Get out of my shop before I blow your head off you goddamn dick smoker.
Go!
Jesus Christ.
Oh, shit.
Take it easy.
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
That's what you said.
That what you said men say.
You don't just come in and insult the man in his own shop.
You just don't do that.
What happens if you meet some stranger?
If you get the wrong one he's gonna blow your gook head right off.
- What should I've said then?
- Why don't you start with Hi or Hello.
Yeah just come in and say: 'Sir, I'd like a haircut if you have the time.'
Yeah, be polite but don't kiss ass.
In fact, you can talk about the construction job you just came from.
And bitch about your girl friend in your car.
Son of a bitch, I just got my breaks fixed and those sons of the bitches really nailed me.
They screwed right in the ass.
Yeah, don't swear at the guy.
Just talk about people who are not in the room.
You can bitch about your boss making you work overtime when it is bowling night.
Right, my old lady bitches for two goddamn hours about how..
...they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store.
...and the minute I turn on a fucking game she starts crying how we never talk.
See, now, go out, come back and talk to him.
And it ain't a rocket science for Christ sake.
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car, or a girlfriend.
Jesus, I should have blown his head off when I had a chance.
Maybe so, I want you to turn around and go outside and come back and don't talk about having no job no car, no girlfriend, no future, no dick.
Ok, just turn around and go.
Excuse me, sir, I need a haircut if you ain't too busy.
You old Italian son of a bitch prick barber.
Boy, does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job.
Fuck me.
- All set to go through with this, right?
- Yeah, yeah.
Don't yeah, yeah me.
Just say, "Yes sir and I'll do my best."
- Yes, I'll do my best.
- Cause when I vouch for somebody that means I am give them my word.
I don't want you making me look bad.
No I am good.
Totally into this.
Don't lay down either.
Just look em straight in the eye.
And a man can tell a lot by your handshake.
- Here, put those in your back pocket.
- Cool.
Don't blow this.
Hey, Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon.
How the hell are you?
- I am shitty.
But who's gonna listen?
- Not me, that's for sure.
Help yourself there, Walt.
You dumb pollack.
Ok this is the kid, I was telling you about.
Tao, this is Tim Kennedy, he is super on this job.
What do we got here, Walt?
Well he knows construction and he's a smart kid.
He'll do anything you need him for.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
- You speak English?
- Yes, sir.
- Were you born here?
- You bet.
I see that Walt drove you here.
You got a vehicle?
- Not at the moment.
Taking the bus for now.
- Bus?
Jesus Christ.
You don't have a car?
My head gasket cracked and the goddamned pricks at the shop wants to bend me over for $2100.
Oh, please.
I just replaced the tranny in my Tahoe and the sons of bitches fucked me hard, just under $3,200.
- Goddamned thieves.
It ain't right.
- You got that right.
Okay, come on in on Monday and we'll find something for you to do.
Thanks, Mr. Kennedy.
- It's Tim, and what's your name again?
- Tao.
T. .., okay.
You owe me one, Walt.
Yeah, well I'll buy a fruit cake for Christmas.
Oh, fuck the fruit cake.
How about you just hand over them keys to that Gran Torino.
- Why the hell does everybody want my car?
- Well, I'm not surprised.
Yeah, you don't know the half of it.
All right, come on, zipper head.
Let Mick stay here and play with himself.
What are we doing?
What do you want to do?
Carry your tools in a rice bag?
Here we go.
You can use one of these and you'll need one of these here.
I can't afford any of this.
I'll cover it.
You can pay me back on your first pay check.
- Cool.
- Here, you'll need something like that.
This is what I am looking for here, tool belt.
There you go.
Not to bitch.
But won't I be needing some tools.
Tools I've got but I'm not going to lend you my tool belt.
You can pick up tools as you go.
- I really appreciate all this.
- Forget it.
No, I really do.
Thank you.
What's up homeboy?
What ya doing?
What up man?
What you got, punk?
- Just checking up on my little cousin.
- Yeah, man.
My little cousin...
what's this?
- Where you coming from, man?
- I am coming-- ...home from work.. not that you guys would know much about that.
- So it's true, you got a job.
- You can't just leave me alone?
What?
Hey, check this out.
[Speaking Hmong]
He is scared, huh?
- Who bought this shit for you?
Your dad?
- What you guys want with me?
- Your dad bought this shit for you?
- Keep your hands off my stuff.
What fuck is that shit?
Why the fuck you gotta make me look bad, huh?
Keep your hands off my stuff!
This massive my job man.
[Speaking Hmong]
- Give me that, that.
- Hey come on, that's my stuff.
You wanna smoke man?
Fuck it.
Let me go.
Give me that, man.
Give me that.
[Speaking Hmong]
What's the phrase I am looking for?
Oh yeah, 'saving face.'
Hey, there.
Hey.
I gotta run.
Haven't seen you for a few days.
Where you've been?
Been busy.
Busy, huh?
- What the hell happened to you?
- Don't worry about it.
What do you mean don't worry about it.
Look at your goddamn face.
I said don't worry about it.
Okay, it's not your problem.
When?
Grabbed me a couple of days ago right after I got off work.
Cowards.
I did everything I can possibly do.
But they broke some of your tools.
- I will replace them.
- Don't worry about the tools.
Where does your cousin live?
No, Walt.
I'll be ok.
- I don't want you to do anything.
- All right.
If you need extra tools, you just let me know.
- Well, I could use a roofing hammer.
- Good, go in my garage and get it.
This should be the last stop.
All right, here is the deal.
You stay away from Tao, understand?
You tell your friends to stay away from Tao.
If they don't listen to you, you tell him you don't want to see him anymore.
That's it, got it?
I'll take that as yes, because if I have to come back here it is gonna get fucking ugly.
Get out of my way.
How do you want your dog?
I mean steak?
- Funny.
- I told you we only eat cats.
I've never seen you like this before.
Well I am feeling good.
I got beautiful women, great food.
- And Tao.
- And even Tao isn't bugging me.
- You are having a good time, I see.
- Yeah.
And it never ends.
What happened to your knuckles anyways?
I slipped in the shower.
No big problem.
Look, now, Yum-Yum if he doesn't ask you out, I'm gonna ask you out.
Youa, don't listen to him.
He's the white devil.
Yeah, I am.
I am the white devil.
I'd loved to, Walt, but he beat you to it.
Really?
No kidding!
Dinner and a movie, or what?
Yeah, they're taking the bus.
No, you can't take the bus.
We gotta get you something more stylish that that.
Like what?
Take a limo?
How about that?
- The Gran Torino?
- Yeah.
- You'd let me take the Gran Torino.
- Yeah, I'd let you take the Gran Torino.
Really?
Yeah, really.
[Machine gun sounds]
Is everybody all right?
[Speaking Hmong]
Tao!
It's all right.
Where's grandma?
Where is Sue?
- Where is Sue?
- She went to our aunt's.
- To her aunts?
Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Get on the phone and call her right now.
[Everyone speaking in Hmong]
Sue...
I knew, this was gonna happen.
What the hell am I doing here?
Maybe some of her friends called her and she changed her plans.
Yeah.
At the war we just, lost a lot of friends but you're getting stab for it.
You kill to it.
[Grandma speaking Hmong]
[Speaking Hmong]
Mr. Kowalski?
Are you ok?
Yeah, I am ok.
Police finally left, no one is talking.
One thing about Hmong, they keep their mouths shut.
Yeah, I've noticed that.
You know, Tao and Sue will never gonna find peace in this world as long as those gangs are around.
Until they go away.
You know, forever.
What are you saying?
You know what I am saying.
I took Sue to the hospital.
She's scared.
- They're all scared..
- Yeah
Tao especially.
He's sitting out there right now staring at your front door.
You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.
What would you do?
- What should Tao do?
- I know what I would do if I was you.
- Or at least what you think you should do.
- Really.
If I was Tao, I guess I'd want vengeance.
I'd wanna to stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys.
- And you?
- What would I do?
I'd come over here and talk to you I guess.
I know you're close with these people, but this pisses me off too, Mr. Kowalski.
- Wanna beer?
- I'd love one.
There some in the chest, right over there behind you.
Damn all this.
- Just isn't fair.
- Nothing is fair, father.
So what you gonna do, Mr. Kowalski?
Call me Walt.
All right.
What are you gonna do, Walt?
I don't know.
But I'll think of something.
Whatever it is, they won't have a chance.
What are you doing?
Thinking.
Thinking.
Thinking time is over.
Now it's time to knock shit out of those pricks.
I know you don't want to hear this, but now it's time to stay calm.
Calm?
You want me to be calm?
We stay calm or else mistakes get made.
We have to step back from this thing.
No, don't let me down Walt.
Not you.
This is gonna end today.
Sit down.
- I don't want to sit.
- I said sit down.
Now, listen to me.
We gotta plan this and plan it very carefully.
Can't make any mistakes.
You know I'm the right man for this job.
I want to go home and stay calm, and come back here at 4 this afternoon.
- And what needs to be done will be done.
- I say we go now, right now.
And what?
Kill that cousin of yours and the rest of those zips.
Mr. Tough Guy is out for blood all of the sudden.
You know nothing about it.
Now, go home.
You stay calm, and come back here at 4.
All right?
Ok?
Okay.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Give me a break, will you?
It's the first time I've ever smoked in the house.
Let a man enjoy himself, would you girl?
All finished. 10 dollars American.
I don't suppose your guinea hands are steady enough to do a straight shave?
- Straight shave?
You've never ask for a straight shave, ever.
I know but I always wondered about it.
- That's unless you are too busy.
- No, just let me heat up a towel.
Here, here is 20.
Keep the change.
It's just in case you hit my jugular.
Yes sir, It gonna take about one hour.
We gonna shorten these sleeves little bit.
Gonna fix at the shoulder.
I never had a fitted suit before.
Yes, sir.
Look very good.
- What can I do for you, Mr. Kowalski?
- I am here for a confession.
- Oh, Lord Jesus, what have you done?
- Nothing you just take it easy now.
- What are you up to?
- Are you gonna give me a confession or not?
How long has it been since your last confession?
Forever.
- Bless me father, for I have sinned.
- What are your sins, my son?
In 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski at the factory Christmas party.
Dorothy was in the other room with the other wives.
It just happened.
Yes, go on.
Well, I made 900 dollar profit selling a boat and a motor.
I didn't pay the taxes it's the same as stealing.
Yes, fine.
And lastly...
I was never very close with my two sons.
I don't know them.
I didn't know how.
- That's it?
- That's it.
It's bothered me most of my life.
Say 10 "Hail Maries" and 5 "Our Fathers".
God loves and forgives you and absolves you of all your sins.
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Thank you, padre.
Are you gonna retaliate for what happened to Sue.
I'm going over to that house today, Mr. Kowalski.
- Is that so?
- It is.
And every other day until you see the folly of what you are planning.
- Busy day, gotta go.
- Go in peace.
Oh, I am at peace.
Jesus Christ.
So which one is mine?
- You ever fired a weapon before?
- No.
Why don't you put that one down.
I got something I wanna show you.
C'mon.
What?
In 1952 we were sent to take out a chink machine gun nest.
They trod us up pretty good.
I was the only one who came back that day.
For that they gave me a silver star.
Here it is.
Here I want you to have it.
Why?
Because we all knew the dangers that night.
But we went anyway.
That's the way it might be tonight.
There is always a chance you don't come back.
The hell we won't.
We'll roll up in there and tear some ass.
Yeah, that's foolish.
That's the exact reaction they're waiting for.
Come on and close this up.
- How many?
- How many what?
How many men did you kill in Korea?
- 13, maybe more.
- What was it like to kill a man?
You don't want to know.
Now close it up.
Walt!
Walt!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Relax, you can't get out of there.
You let me out right now!
Let me out.
You fuck let me out, I'll fucking kill you.
Shut the fuck up!
You want to know what it's like to kill a man?
Well, it's goddamn awful.
That's what it is.
The only thing worse is getting a medal of valor for killing some poor kids that wanted to just to give up.
That's all.
Yeah, some scared little gook just like you.
I shot them right in the face with that rifle you were holding in there a while ago.
Not a day goes by that I don't think about it.
You don't that on your soul.
I got blood on my hands.
I am soiled.
That's why I am going at it alone tonight.
Walt, you take me with you right now, let me out!
Look, you've come a long way.
I am proud to say that you are my friend.
But you got your whole life ahead of you.
But me, I finish things.
That's what I do and I am going at it alone.
No, wait!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
[Grandma speaking Hmong]
I need you to watch my dog.
Yeah, I love you too.
Yeah, she is old too.
Her name is Daisy.
- Hello.
- It's Walt.
The keys to my house are under the ceramic turtle on the front porch.
Let yourself in.
Your brother is in the basement.
I gotta go.
Sorry, father, we have to go.
I'm telling you, if we are not here there will be bloodshed.
We've been here for hours.
We can't afford to anchor a unit down to one location.
I am begging you to stay.
Just got a word from my sergeant, we're pulling the plug.
I am staying.
No you aren't.
We have specific orders you came with us, you're leaving with us.
Watch your head.
[Engine starts]
Sue, over here, over here.
Unlock this right now.
What's going on?
He left without me.
He went to Smokie's without me.
Tao!
What's the fuck, man?
Any swamp rats in there?
- I didn't think your ass would came.
- Shut up, gook.
I've got nothing to say to you, shrimp dick, lizard like you.
Yeah, yeah.
You go ahead watch out for your boyfriend.
Cause it was either he or you or someone who raped one of their own family.
You own blood, for Christ sake.
Now go ahead and pull those pistols, like miniature cowboys.
Go ahead.
So where's Tao at?
That pussy motherfucker not gonna come.
Don't worry about Tao.
Tao's got not one second for you.
Says who?
You?
- Fuck that.
- What the fuck you gonna do, old man?
What are you gonna do?
You bitch.
-
- Kind of jumpy, aren't we?
- Shut the fuck up.
You shut the fuck up!
- Got a light?
- What the fuck?
No.
Me..
I've got a light...
'Hail Mary, full of grace..'
Yes, sergeant.
- What happened?
- You need to step back.
- He's a friend of mine.
- I said, step back.
Hey, did you hear him?
Step back.
- What happened?
- Hey, step back.
He is my friend.
- Officer Chang!
Get those people back.
- Hey, step back now, Ok.
Get the fuck out of here!
[Mellow vocal background music]
Walt Kowalski once said to me that I didn't know anything about life or death.
Because I was an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin... who held the hands of superstitious old women and promised they eternity.
Walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it.
But he was right.
I knew really nothing about life or death, until I got to know Walt.
And boy did I learn.
And I want to leave my house to the church because Dorothy would've liked it now which brings us to the last item.
And again please excuse the language in Mr. Kowalski's will, I'm simply reading it the way it was written.
And I'd like to leave my 1972 Gran Torino to... my friend Tao Vang Lor.
Under the condition that you don't choptop the roof like one of those beaners don't paint any idiotic flames on it like some white-trash hillbilly and don't put a big gay spoiler on the rear end like you see... on all the other zipper heads' cars.
It just looks like hell
If you can refrain from doing any of that, it's yours.

[MUSIC: relaxing, soft bass]
[bird chirping] [faint pipe organ] [pipe organ music]
[foot steps] sorry about Dorothy, Walt.
She was a real peach.
Thanks for coming, Al.
[Sighs]
Holy Spirit.
Spectacles, testicles, wallet and watch. [Laughs]
Look at the Old Man glaring at Ashley.
He can't even tone it down for Mom's funeral?
What do you expect?
Dad's still living in the 50s.
He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly.
Yeah, well, your kid's wearing a Lion's jersey.
I'm sure Dad appreciates that.
The point I am trying to make is that there's nothing anyone can do that won't disappoint the Old Man.
It's inevitable.
That's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings.
You know, that deal with the boat motor, the broken bird bath,
It's always something.
What are we going to do with him?
Don't you think he'll get in trouble over there all by himself in the old neighborhood?
Why don't you have him move in with you?
[Chuckling]
[Coughs]
Death is often a bittersweet occasion to us, Catholics.
Bitter in the pain.
Sweet, in the salvation.
[Someone snoring] Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased.
and their families
Sweet to those of us, who know the salvation that awaits.
And some may ask, what is death?
[Someone sighs] Is it the end?
Or is it the beginning?
And what is life?
What is this thing we call life?
[Beeping] All these questions can frustrate you at times like this. (Stop that!
)
–And that's why you have to turn to the Lord.
–Jesus...
Because the Lord is the sweetness.
–Is that dad?
–No, that's grandpa Walt.
There is a platoon, E-Company, March 2, 1952.
–Korea?
–Where's Korea?
[People chattering]
Well, people showed up after the service, huh?
Yeah, well, I suppose they heard there'd be a lot of ham.
I'll go down the basement and get some chairs.
–Oh, I can do that, Dad...
–No, we need them now... not next week.
Cool, I found a medal.
Look at this.
[Chest closes]
[Squeaky, popping stairs]
How much longer do we have to stay?
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell and I'm bored.
Ashley, honey.
Why don't you help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?
–Me?
–Yes, you.
Grandpa Walt, would you like some help with these four chairs.
No, you probably just painted your nails.
(Whispering) Your dad is driving me crazy.
–Why did you guys even- –It's okay, honey, we're leaving soon?
Come on, let's go.
[Neighbor chattering in foreign language]
How many swamp rats can get in one room?
Wow, Grandpa, when'd you get the vintage car?
1972.
I never knew you had a cool old car.
Yeah, it's been here since before you were born.
So, what are you going do with it when you...
like... die?
Grr...
Then what about that super cool retro couch that you have in the den... cause I was thinking, I'm going to State next year... and I think it would look really good in my dorm room.
And I don't have any furniture at all.
God.
–Who are you?
–Hi, I am Tao.
–What do you want?
I live next door.
–Come on, get the shit out of your mouth.
I wa— –Tell me what you want.
Do you have jumper cables?
My uncle's car is old and......
No, we don't any jumper cables.
And have some respect, zipper head, we're mourning here...
How you holding up, Walt?
Mr Kowalski.
–Huh?
–Mr Kowalski, that's my name.
Right, Mr Kowalski.
Your wife and I became quite close these last few months.
She asked that I watch over you when she passed on.
I told her I watch over my entire flock.
But she made me promise I'd keep an extra sharp eye on you.
I appreciate your kindness you've shown to my wife.
Now that you've spoken your piece, why don't go and attend some of your other sheep?
Ok?
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her desire for you to go to confession.
She said she couldn't remember the last time you went.
–Is that so?
–It is.
Well, I confess that I never really cared for church very much.
The only reason I went was because of her.
And I confess that I have no desire to confess... to a boy that is just out of the seminary.
–Bye, dear.
–G'bye, Walt.
Wish I could help, dad, but... gotta get the kids home.
–Kids getting restless.
–Yeah, fine, just go.
–I'll call in a few, see how you're doing.
–All right.
Kill you to buy American.
Jeez...
Did you see the way he looked at the truck?
Jeez.
It's always Rice-Burner this or Jap-Burner that.
You know.
Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go.
–Well, at least he didn't say anything this time.
–He didn't need to.
Well, what do you expect, Mitch?
The man worked at a Ford plant for all those years.
I suppose that's my goddamned fault?
Just give it a rest and drive.
Ok?
Kids, do you want the radio on?
—Yes.
You want to listen to some music?
Good.
Damn, barbarians.
[Metal clanging]
Oh, Jesus...
Polaski would roll over in his grave if he could see his lawn now.
What the hell the chinks had to move in this neighborhood for?
Have you gone completely deaf or something?
Hi there, Walt.
I kind of not a friend of yours.
Why do you insist on calling me, Walt?
Sorry, Mr Kowalski.
–What are you peddling today, padre?
–Nothing.
Thought I'd drop by and see how you are doing.
I haven't seen you in church in a while.
Okay.
Well, now that you've done your good deed, why don't you just take off down the road?
–I'd really like to talk, Mr Kowalski.
–Not in this lifetime, sonny.
Why?
–Do you have a problem with me, Mr Kowalski?
–You don't want to know.
No, I do.
Well I think you're an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin... who likes to hold hands of old ladies who are superstitious... and promises them eternity.
[Reggae music thumping]
Yo!
Hey!
Is you a boy or is you a girl, man, I can't tell.
Hey, Chicito.
If you was in pink, I would fuck you and your ass would be my bitch.

Why are you doing woman's work?

He doesn't want to talk to you.
–Well, I am here right.
–Hey, Spider, who dat?
–What's up?
–Spider?

–Spider?
–Is there something wrong with Spider?

Back in a day everybody used to want to beat me up, dawg.
But now look, nobody want to fuck with me.

[Hmong language]
Come on.
–Nice.
–Ya, my little cousin being little man.
Yo, that's a nice car.
Hell, yeah, 1972 Gran Torino, Fastback.
–Cobra jet engine.
–Yo man it still in mint condition.
Yo man, it's in mint condition man.
I've got one.
A Mexican, a Jew and a colored guy go into a bar.
The bartender looks up and says:
"Get the fuck out of here!"
So, here's where my flock congregates when they're not in church... –Hey, Father J. –Hey, Mel.
Hey, Darrel.
–Hey, father.
–Hi, Walt.
What brings you in here, father.
Meat raffle?
No, I just came down to talk to Walt if that's ok.
Damn, padre.
You are persistent, aren't you?
I promised your wife.
All right, let's get a booze.
I'll have Pabst and a shot of Jack.
And whatever he's having.
–I'll have a Diet Coke.
–Bullshit.
This is a bar.
You have a drink.
–I'll have a gin and tonic.
–Attaboy!
So, what do you want?
I promised your wife I'd get you to go to confession.
–Now, why would you do that?
–She was very insistent.
She made me.
Well you're kinda fond of promising things you can't deliver on, right, father?
–Let's talk about something else.
–What?
Life and death.
Life and death.
What the hell do you know about life and death?
I'd like to think I know a lot.
I'm a priest...
Yeah, you get up and preach about life and death.
But all what you know is what you learned in a priest school.
Right out of the rookie Preacher's Handbook.
I don't know about that.
I think...
That is bittersweet.
Sort of bitter in its pain.
But sweet in its salvation.
That's what you know of life and death, and that's pathetic.
What do you know, Mr Kowalski?
I know a lot.
I lived there almost three years in Korea.
Thanks.
We shot men.
We stabbed them with bayonets, hacked 17-year-olds to death with shovels... stuff I'll remember till the day I die.
Horrible things, but things I live with.
And what about life?
Well, I...
I survived the war.
got married... and had a family.
Sounds like you know more about death than you do living.
Maybe so, father.
Maybe so.
Son of a bitch.
–Hey, man, get in the car!
–Tao, what the fuck, get in!
–Come on Tao.
–Come, let's go, man, get in!
Fuck, man, get in!
[Phone ringing]
[Drill sound] [Phone rings]
Hello?
Hey, G'morning, Dad, it's your number one son, Mitch.
Morning?
It's after one in the afternoon.
It's not morning.
Oh, right.
Afternoon, then.
–So what do you want?
–What?
No, nothing.
I mean, what would I want?
Well, I don't know.
Your wife has already gone through all of your mother's jewelry.
No, dad.
I'm just calling to see how you are doing.
Well, anything new with the old neighborhood?
Ye...
No.
–Great.
Smooth sailing then.
–Yeah.
–Ok, good, good, then.
–Oh, hey, Dad.
–Yeah.
You wouldn't happen to still know that guy from the plant that has Lion season tickets?
Are you f—
Dad—?
Ain't she sweet?
[Sipping]
Come on.
Hey, what's up?
–What is you doin' out here, man?
–Nothing.
–Minding our own business.
–Just hanging out.
What are you guys doing here?
What?
Can I just come here to hang with my little cousin?
–We have a good news for you, man.
–Really, and what's that?
–Only for guy talk.
–I don't think so.
Why not?
C'mon, man, we're gonna give you another shot, man.
C'mon.
–Don't go, Tao.
–Mind your own business, girl.
–Come on, let's go –Come.
[Commotion, everyone speaking Hmong]
What the hell is this?
Get up.
Get off my lawn.
Listen old man, you don't want to fuck with me.
Did you hear me?
I said get off my lawn, now.
Are you fucking crazy?
Go back in the house.
Yeah, I'll blow the hole in your face and then I'll go in the house.
And I'll sleep like a baby.
You can count on that.
We used to stack fucks like you 5 feet high in Korea... used you for sandbags.
Ok.
You better watch your back...
He's crazy.
[Speaking in Hmong]
Thank you.
Get off my lawn.
[Speaking in Hmong]
What the hell is this?
No, no, no, no, no.
C'mon, no more.
No more, no more.
Stay right there.
Stay right there.
Why can't you people just leave me alone?
We brought you some chives to plant in the garden.
I don't want them.
They're perennials, they come back every year.
Look, why are bringing me all this garbage anyway.
Because...
Because you saved Tao.
I didn't save anybody.
I just...
I kept a bunch of jabbering gooks off of my lawn.
–Well, you're a hero to the neighborhood.
–I am not a hero.
Too bad, they think you are and that's why they keep bringing you the gifts.
–Please take them.
–Well, they're wrong.
–I just want to be left alone, thank you.
–[Speaking Hmong] Wait!
This is my mom, Vu, I'm Sue and that's my brother, Tao.
–We live next door.
–So?
Tao wants to say something.
–I'm sorry.
–Sorry for what?
For trying to steal your car.
Let me tell you something boy.
You step on this property again, you're done.
Good afternoon, Walt.
–I told you I'm not going to confession.
–Why didn't you just call the police?
What?
I do work with some of the Hmong gangs... and I heard there was some trouble in the neighborhood.
Why didn't call the police?
Well...
You know why, I've prayed that they would show up, but... nobody answered.
–What were you thinking?
Someone could've been killed.
We're talking life and death here.
When things go wrong, you gotta act quickly.
When we were in Korea and a 1000 screaming gooks came across our land... we didn't call the police.
We reacted.
–We're not in Korea, Mr Kowalski.
I've been thinking about our conversation on life and death.
About what you said.
About how you carry around all the horrible things you were forced to do.
Horrible things that won't leave you.
It seems that it would do you good to unload some of that burden.
Things done during war are terrible.
Being ordered to kill... killing to save yourself, killing to save others.
You're right, those are things I know nothing about.
But I do know about forgiveness.
And I've seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins... admitted their guilt and left their burdens behind them.
Stronger men than you!
Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things... and are now at peace.
Well I got to hand it to you, padre, you came here with your guns loaded this time.
–Thank you!
–And you're right about one thing.
About stronger men than me, reaching their salvation.
Well, Hallefuckinlujah.
–But you are wrong about something else.
–What's that, Mr Kowalski?
The thing that haunts a man the most is what he isn't ordered to do.
There, finally, you look like a human being again.
You shouldn't wait so long between haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch.
Well, I'm surprised you're still around.
I was always hoping that you die off... and they get somebody in here they knew what the hell they were doing.
Instead you just keep hanging around, like the do-up dago you are.
–That'll be ten bucks, Walt.
–Ten bucks, Jesus Christ, Martin.
What are you half-Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices all the time.
It's been ten bucks for the last five years... and you hard-nosed, Pollack son of a bitch.
–Keep the change.
–See you in 3 weeks, prick.
Not if I see you first, dipshit.
[Chuckling]
Sounds like it'll go down hill after that.
–Yeah.
–So, that's like—
That's cool, you know.
Man, look at this.
Check this out.
Bring your tight ass over here.
Come here, girl.
Don't be shy.
You can't say hi?
Or are you acting like stuck-up and shit.
–What's you supposed to be, man?
–Yo, it's cool dawg.
The fuck are you doing in my neighborhood, boy?
None, Just going to the corner spot, you know get some CDs, sound good, bro?
–He called, you bro!
–C'mon, sound good, bro?
–Sound good.
–Shut the fuck up.
Call me bro again, and I'll bite your motherfucking face off.
–Yeah, motherfucker.
–Now what the fuck yo come down here for?
You here to bring me this little present?
–Oriental yummy?
–Don't worry, I'm gonna take... a real good care with her.
–Fuck outta here.
–Fuck outta here, man!
Oh shit, you have a bitch with you.
Keep your ass right here.
Oh great.
Another asshole who has a fetish for Asian girls.
God, it gets so old.
Oh, shit, what's your name girl?
My name?
Get your ass out of here, okay.
It's "take your crude, overly obvious come-on to every woman who walks past and cram it."
That's my name.
Who do you think you are talking to?
Who does it look like?
You think you're real funny, don't you?
–Man, she's tough.
–What?
You gonna hit me now?
That'd pretty much complete the picture.
You need to keep your bitch on a leash.
Put a choke chain on her and yank that motherfucker.
–Of course, right to the stereotype thesaurus.
–Oh yeah.
–Call me a whore and a bitch in the same sentence.
–Bitch is crazy.
–I like her like that.
–Now take that bitch.
Oh, shit, you don't know when to quit, do you, girl?
Let me teach your ass a lesson.
That's what you need.
Stop!
Let me go!
Take your ass over there.
What the fuck are you looking at old man?
What the hell are you spooks up to?
Spooks?
You'd better get your ass on honkey, while I still let you.
That's what you'd better do.
Da fuck he think he eh?
Have you noticed how you come across somebody once in a while... you shouldn't have fucked with?
That's me.
You fucking crazy, get outta here, man.
Why don't ya get your ass outta here bfar I kick yo wrinkly white ass.
Crazy, mothafucka, what's wrong with him, man?
What da fuck?
–Motherfucker's crazy!
–What is this thing?
What the hell?
Get in the truck.
–Crazy motherfucker.
–What's wrong with him, man.
–Oh!
Shit!
–Hey, pops c'mon now.
–Shut your fucking face!
You fucking don't listen, do you?
–Now get in the truck.
–Go get in a truck girl.
–Way to go, man!
–Shut up pussy.
What is this "bro" shit anyway?
You want to be superb page, or something?
These guy don't want to be your bro and I don't blame them.
Now get your old faint paddy ass on down the road.
Take care now.
You too.
Oh, yeah.
Why ya'll fuckin' do nothing?
Man you fucking!
Shit man.
If he had cannon at your fucking face, you would do nothing.
What's the matter with you, for Christ sake?
Trying to get yourself killed?
I thought you Asian girls were supposed to be smart.
Hanging around in the neighborhood like that is the fast way to get you... in the obituaries.
I know, I know.
Take it easy.
And what about that goofball guy you were with.
Is that a date or something?
–Yeah, kind of.
His name is Trey.
–You shouldn't be hanging out with him.
You should be hanging out with your own people.
The other Hummongs.
You mean, Hmong?
–Hmong, not Hummong –Whatever.
What the hell is Humong, I mean Mong anyway?
Wow, you so enlightened you know that?
No, Hmong is not a place, it is a people.
My people come from different parts of Laos, Thailand, and China.
Well how did you end up in my neighborhood?
Why didn't you stay there?
It's Vietnam thing.
We fought on your side.
And when Americans quit... the communists started killing all the Hmong.
So we came over here.
Yeah, well I don't know how you ended up in the Midwest.
Snow on the ground six months out of the year.
What is it?
Jungle people wanted to be on a great frozen tundra?
Hill people.
We are hill people.
Not jungle people.
BOO-ga, BOO-ga, BOO-ga!
Yeah, whatever...
Blame the Lutherans.
They brought us over here.
Everybody blames the Lutherans.
Well, you'd think the cold will keep all the idiots out.
Thanks for the ride.
You know something kid, you are all right.
But what about that dimwit brother of yours?
He little slow or something?
Tao is actually really smart.
He just doesn't know which direction to go in.
–Yeah, poor toad.
–It's really common.
Hmong girls over here fit in better.
The girls go to college and the boys go to jail.
That old hag hates my ass.
Your birthday today, Daisy.
This year you have to make a choice between two life paths.
Second chances come your way.
Extraordinary events culminate in what might seem to be an anticlimax.
You lucky numbers are:
84, 23, 11, 78, and 99.
What a load of shit.
Yea.
What the hell is it with kids nowadays?
All right.
–Let me help you with those.
–Oh, thank you.
How about that?
How about that, Daisy?
–That's too heavy for a bag.
–No problem. —Thank you.
–Good, Karen, give it to him.
–Here you go.
–Well, what is it?
–It's a gopher.
So you can reach stuff.
It makes things a lot of easier.
This is from me.
It's a phone.
Oh, I can see that.
I just thought... well, we thought that it would make things easier.
Thank you, Karen.
There's nothing wrong with making things less hard on yourself.
You know Karen's right, Dad.
You've worked hard your whole life.
Maybe it's time you started thinking about taking it easier?
And some other thing, Dad.
You really should get rid of the coffin nails.
But, da... we were thinking about the house.
You know, well, with Mom gone, it's got to be a lot to maintain around here.
Let alone clean.
And you are here all alone...
Yeah, you know, there are these great places now, you know, these communities... where you don't have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow.
You know, people are like you, active and alert, but are alone.
And would benefit from being around folks their own age.
Yeah, Dad, look.
You got to check it out.
We brought some brochures.
These places are nothing like that you think they would be.
They are great.
No, they are beautiful.
They are really nice They really are.
These are top-notch like resorts.
–It is like staying in a hotel, practically.
–They're beautiful.
–They really are.
–Yeah.
They care of everything.
They clean up.
They're really nice.
Oh, there are wonderful stores, you can buy new shoes.
They are amazing, they really are.
You have a good time, play some golf maybe.
Meet other people.
Son of a bitch.
Kicking us out on his birthday.
I told you that this was a bad idea.
–I know, you were right –He won't let anybody help him.
Well, we tried.
Can we just drop it?
No one can say we didn't try.
What the hell with him, you know what we should've done.
We should've stayed home with Josh and Ashley.
At least they were smart enough not come.
The goddamn kids have more sense than we do.
Ah, we miss mama, don't we, Daisy?
[Hmong; car door closing]
Hey, Walt.
What are you up to?
We're having a barbecue.
You want to come over?
–What do you think?
–There's tons of fooood.
–Just keep your hands off my dog.
–No worries.
We only eat cats.
–Really?
–No, I'm kidding, you moron.
–C'mon, you can be my special guest.
–No, I am fine right here.
Yeah... –Son of a bitch.
–Okay, so, what have you had to eat today?
I had a piece of cake.
Little beef jerky.
Come on over and get something to eat.
We've got beer too.
Well...
I might as well drink with strangers, better than drinking alone.
After all, it is my birthday.
–Really.
Happy birthday, Wally –Don't call me Wally.
–You have no pets, but plenty of beer.
–As they say, "when in Hmong."
What am I doing wrong?
Every time I look at somebody they always look at the ground.
You're fine.
[Speaking Hmong]
–What is she saying?
–She said welcome to our home.
–Oh no, she is not.
–No, she didn't.
She hates me.
Yeah, she hates you.
Okay.
What⁈ What are all you fish heads looking at anyway?
I think we should go into the other room.
Sorry.
All the people in this house are very traditional.
Number 1.
Never touch a Hmong person on their head.
Not even a child.
Hmong people believe that the soul resides on the head.
–So, don't do that.
–Sounds dumb, but fine.
And a lot of Hmong people consider looking at someone in their eye to be very rude.
That's why they look away, when you look at them.
Anything else?
Yeah, some Hmong people tend to smile or grin when they're yelled at.
It's a cultural thing.
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity, it's not that they're laughing... at you or anything.
You people are nuts.
But the food... –It looks good, smells good too.
–Of course, it's Hmong food.
Okay, and then can I come back for seconds?
–Here you go.
–Thanks.
You know, you mentioned about... looking at people, he's been staring at me the whole evening.
That's Kor Khue.
He is the Lor family shaman.
And what's that?
Some sort of witch doctor or something.
Something like that.
–Boo-ga boo.
–Ah, ha, you're funny, Wally.
[Speaking Hmong]
Kor Khue's interested in you.
He heard what you did.
He would like to read you.
It would be rude not allow him this.
It's a great honor.
–Yeah sure, fine by me.
–All right, take a seat.
[Speaking Hmong]
He says people do not respect you.
They don't even want to look at you.
[Speaking Hmong]
He says the way you live, your food has no flavor.
You wearied by your life.
[Speaking Hmong]
You made a mistake in your past life, like a mistake that you did... you are not satisfied with.
[Speaking Hmong]
He says you have no happiness in your life.
It's like you are not at peace.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I am fine.
Fine, I am fine.
God, I've got more in common with these gooks than I do with my own spoiled-rotten family.
Jesus Christ...
Happy birthday.
Are you ok?
Yeah, yeah, I am fine.
–You were bleeding.
–No, I bit my tongue.
It's nothing.
Why don't we go down and get some of that good gook food.
I am starving.
Okay.
You ladies are wonderful.
That stuff is really good.
–C'mon you glutton!
–What's up?
–Let's go.
–What for?
–To mingle.
–We can mingle right here.
C'mon, you told me not to leave you alone.
Thank you very much, but I have to...
I have to go now.
I'll be back.
Don't let me go away.
–Well, well, well, look who's over there?
–Yeah, the kid who steal my Gran Torino.
–My brother Tao.
–Tried to anyway, yeah, toad.
It was wobby a bit.
But it should fix it.
What's this?
Little rice liquor.
Here, try it.
All right.
My friends and I were just wondering what you're doing here?
That's a good question.
What am I doing here?
–My name is Walt.
–Hey, Walt.
I am Youa.
–Yu Yang?
–No, Youa.
–Youa, ok.
–So what do you do?
–I fix things.
Stuff like that.
–Like what?
I've just fixed that dryer there.
I fixed my wife's friend's sink.
I took old aunt Merry to doctor to get a prescription.
Fixed up.
I've even the fixed the door, that had't even broken yet.
You're funny.
I've been called a lot of things, but never funny.
–Well, I'll take off.
Enjoy yourself.
–Okay, Yum Yao.
Pleasure.
Come on.
Relax, zipper head.
I am not gonna shoot you.
I'd look down too if I was you.
You know, I knew you were a dipshit the first time I ever saw you.
But I never thought you're worse with women than you are with stealing cars, Toad.
–It's Tao.
–What?
It's not toad, it's Tao.
My name is Tao.
You were blowing it with that girl who was there.
Not that I'd give two shits about a Toad like you.
You don't what you are talking about.
You're wrong egg roll.
I know exactly what I'm talking about.
I may not be the most pleasant person to be around.
But I got the best woman who was ever on this planet to marry me.
I worked at it.
That was the best thing that ever happened to me.
Hands down.
But you... you know...
You let Click Clack, Ding Dong and Charlie Chan just walk out... with Miss what's-her-face.
She likes you, you know, though I don't know why.
Who?
Yum yum!
You know that girl in the purple sweater.
She's been looking at you all day, stupid.
–You mean, Youa?
–Yeah, Yum Yum.
Yeah.
Nice girl, very charming girl.
I talked with her.
But, you, you let her just walk right out with three stooges.
And you know why?
Cause you are big, fat pussy.
Well...
I gotta go.
Good day.
Pussy cake.
[Speaking Hmong]
No, no more.
Okay, put them over there.
No.
No.
No more No more.
C'mon.
No more.
[Speaking Hmong]
No more, please...
Is that chicken dumpling thing you brought before?
All right.
Better than beef jerky all the time.
What's going on?
–What's going on?
–Tao is here to make amends.
–He is here to work for you.
–No, he isn't.
He's not gonna work for me.
My mom said he dishonored the family.
And now he has to work off his debt.
–He starts tomorrow morning.
–Oh not tomorrow, not any time.
I don't even want him on my property I thought we went over all that.
It is very important to my mom that you accept... and that would be an insult if you refuse.
Why is it being put back on me, all of sudden?
He's the one who tried to steal my car.
All of the sudden, I'm the bad guy in this thing.
Look, my family is very traditional... and would be very much upset if you don't let Tao repay.
If he doesn't want to do it, then let's just go.
Shut up!
[Mom shouting in Hmong]
Yeah, shut up.
All right, tomorrow, c'mon, tomorrow.
Thank you.
Jesus, Joseph, and Mary.
These Hmong broads are like badgers.
Son of a bitch.
I never thought he'd show.
All right, what are you good at?
–Like what?
–That's what I am asking.
You gonna work for me, I gotta know what you are good at.
–I gotta know what you can do.
–I don't know.
That's kind of half way what I expected you to say.
See that tree right there?
You just go over there and count the birds.
–You want me to count the birds?
–Yeah, you can count?
All you slopes are supposed to be good at math, right?
–Yeah, I can count.
–Good.
One, two...
So, what do you have for me to do?
You want me to watch paint dry... or maybe count the clouds that pass by?
Don't get flip with me, boy.
I am not the one who tried to steal, don't you forget that.
Go ahead.
I don't care if you insult me and say racist things.
–Cause you know what?
I'll take it.
–Of course, you'll take it.
Cause you have no teeth, you have no balls, kid.
Look, I'm stuck here.
Why don't you find something useful for me to do.
Unlike you, I am not useless.
And I maintain my own property.
These swamp rats, on the other hand, you just can't help it.
How long do I have you for?
Toad, how long?
'till next Friday.
[Chuckling] All right.
Go get that ladder out of the garage.
When you get finished with that roof there.
You can take that gutter, and nail it back up.
I am tired looking at it for the last three years.
[Older man speaking Hmong]
Yeah, you said it, brother.
[Panting]
Hello.
Grandpa says he want to know if... you can have Tao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch?
Wasp nest?
That's terrible.
I think we can handle that after lunch.
[Bell ringing]
Jesus, Lord All Mighty, knock it off!
Hey, it's my last day.
What else do you have for me to do?
Take the day-off.
You did enough.
Toad!
Nothing.
Nevermind.
Kawski?
Kawski?
Koski?
Mr Kowalski?
Good morning.
I looked over your paperwork and I think we should immediately start a full battery of tests.
I feel that this would be the best way to go about... checking out all the issues that you've had.
Excuse me, what happened to DrFellman, my regular doctor?
Dr Fellmon retired three years ago.
I am his replacement, Dr Chu.
–It's grandpa Walt.
–Pick it up.
You talk to him!
Mitch.
–I'm doing bills here.
–You talk to him, he's your father.
Hey, Dad.
Hi, Mitch.
It's me your dad.
Yeah, I know.
What's up?
Oh, nothing, nothing much really.
How is everything going?
I am fine, fine, doing fine.
How about Karen and the kids?
Fine, everybody is great.
Doing fine.
Good.
How about work?
Busy.
Yeah...
I suppose...
In fact, um, speaking of busy, I got a lot on my plate right now... so if it is not something pressing.
No, no, not at all.
So, why don't you call me this weekend?
Sure.
Ok, it was nice talking to you, dad.
Thanks for calling.
Thanks.
[Hip hop music thumping]
This kid doesn't have a chance.
What do you know about faucets?
I know a lot about them, boy.
Tend to side.
–Jesus.
For the love of Pete.
–What?
It must be a 100 degrees here.
Just, turn on the fan.
This place is falling apart.
Where did you get all the stuff?
–What are you talking about?
–All the tools and stuff.
Well, may come as surprise to a thief... but I bought this stuff.
Everything in here with my own money.
Yeah, yeah, this is not what I meant.
I mean this is so much shit packed in here.
Yeah, well.
Every tool in here has a purpose.
Everything has a job to do.
–They are all used when necessary.
–Okay, so, what's that?
–That's a post hole digger.
–That.
Vice-grips.
Wire cutters, you know that's a trowel.
C'mon.
There is shears right there, and that's a saw.
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me kid.
All right, what's on your mind.
It's just...
I can't afford to buy all this stuff.
Well, I guess, even a bonehead like you, could understand... that a man acquires these over a period of 50 years.
–Yeah, but...
–All right, look, here.
These three items right here, you can have these.
WD-40, vice grips, and some duck tape.
Any man worth his salt, can do half of the house chores... with just those three things.
Anything else you need you just borrow it, that's all.
Ok, cool.
–Fuck me.
–What's with that?
Nothing.
What?
Nothing, huh?
I just saw you've coughed out blood.
That's not good.
You should really see a doctor.
Look...
Those guys over here, the other night... on my lawn, what about them?
–Just a gang.
Bunch of Hmong gang bangers.
I assume that.
What they were doing here?
They were going to take me away.
They were kind of pissed, that I blew my first initiation.
Yeah, well you are, you are a pussy.
You wanna hang out with guys like that.
What was your initiation supposed to be?
My Gran Torino?
Christ, old Friday.
Shit!
Toad, you got a minute?
Here it is.
Here is the deal.
I take the top, cause that's the heaviest.
I'll pull on that.
And you stand right back here, and you push.
And help me push it up each step.
–Just like that.
–Then, let me take the top.
No, no, I've got a top.
No, I'll take the top.
It looks pretty heavy.
Look, I'm not crippled.
I've got the top.
If you don't let me take the top.
I ain't helping.
I'm gonna go back home.
–Listen to me, zipper head.
–No, you listen, old man!
I am here because you need help.
So it's either top or I'm out of here.
All right, you take the top and I'll push.
Don't let it slip off you little girl hands and crush me.
Don't give me any ideas now.
That thing weighs a ton.
Runs like a clock, though.
They don't make them like this anymore.
–So what are you going to do with it?
–Sell it I guess.
–How much?
–60 bucks.
I am tired of having this sit around down in the basement there.
Why?
You are looking for a freezer?
–Our downstairs one kind of died.
–Okay, 25 bucks and it's yours.
25?
But you just said 60.
I know, it will save me money putting an ad in the paper.
Come on, let wheel it over to your place.
–Kind of ironic, huh?
–What?
Toad washing a car they tried to steal from you.
Yeah, he misses one spot, he's doing it all over again too.
It's nice of you to kind look after him like this.
He doesn't have any real role models in his life.
–Well, I am not any role model.
–But you're a good man, Wally.
–I wish our father would've been more like you.
–Don't go calling me Wally.
No, I am serious.
He was really hard on us.
Really traditional... and really old school.
–Well, I am old school.
Yeah, but you're an American.
What's that supposed to mean?
–You like him, don't you?
–Are you kidding?
He tried to steal my car.
And you spend time with him, teaching him how to fix things.
–Saved him from that fucked cousin of ours...
–Hey, watch your language, lady.
And you're a good man
I am not a good man.
Get me another beer, dragon lady.
This one's empty.
You know, Hmong consider gardening to be a woman's work.
Yeah, that probably why I see you in the garden over there all the time.
–Besides we ain't in Hu-Mong.
–Funny.
You know you should quit.
That's bad for you.
Yeah?
So it is being in a gang, dipshit.
Didn't you hear what I just said?
I saw you cough out blood.
You should quit.
What's that emblem supposed to mean anyway?
Your ancient cub scout emblem?
1st cavalry.
I've had it since 51.
So what you wanna do with you life kid?
I was thinking about, maybe sales.
Sales, eh?
My oldest son is in sales.
Does he do well?
Oh, yeah.
License to steal.
I worked in a Ford factory for 50 years.
And he's out selling Japanese cars.
You made cars?
Yeah.
I put the steering column in this Gran Torino in 1972, right on the line.
You are old.
So cool.
So you wanna be in sales?
Thinking about going to school, maybe.
–Kinda, but school cost money.
–Maybe you should get a job.
Can't just sit there and spread mulch in my garden for the rest of your life.
Well, maybe you can just pay me.
Yeah, very funny.
–What kind of job could I ever get?
–Yeah you're right, nobody would ever hire you.
Look, I am just kidding zip...
I mean.
You can get a job.
You can get a job anywhere.
Like what?
–How about construction?
–Me?
–Yeah.
–Construction?
–Yeah.
–Do you have Alzheimer's or something?
.
No, get a job in the construction.
I know people in the trades.
Of course, I have to make a little adjustment and man you up a little bit.
–Man me up?
–Yeah.
And I think you ought to date Miss Yum Yum too.
Do you little good.
Get carbon off the valves.
Now you're just gonna learn how guys talk.
You just listen the way Martin and I batter it back and forth.
–You okay?
You ready?
–Sure. —All right.
Let's go in.
Perfect.
A pollack and a chink.
How are you doing, Martin, you crazy Italian prick.
Walt, you cheap bastard, I should have known you'd come in...
I was having such a pleasant day –What did you do?
Jew some poor blind guy out of his money.
–Give him a wrong change?
–Who's the nip?
He's the pussy kid from next door, I am just trying to man him up a little bit.
You see kid?
That's how guys talk to one another.
–They do?
–Why, do you have shit in your ears?
Now go out and come back in and talk to him like a man.
Like a real man.
Come on.
Get your ass out of here.
Come on back now.
Sorry about this.
That's ok.
What's up you old Italian prick?
Get out of my shop before I blow your head off you goddamn dick smoker.
Go!
Jesus Christ.
Oh, shit.
Take it easy.
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
That's what you said.
That what you said men say.
You don't just come in and insult the man in his own shop.
You just don't do that.
What happens if you meet some stranger?
If you get the wrong one he's gonna blow your gook head right off.
–What should I've said then?
–Why don't you start with Hi or Hello.
Yeah just come in and say: "Sir, I'd like a haircut if you have the time."
Yeah, be polite but don't kiss ass.
In fact, you can talk about the construction job you just came from.
And bitch about your girl friend in your car.
Son of a bitch, I just got my breaks fixed... and those sons of the bitches really nailed me.
They screwed right in the ass.
Yeah, don't swear at the guy.
Just talk about people who are not in the room.
You can bitch about your boss making you work overtime when it is bowling night.
Right, my old lady bitches for two goddamn hours about how... they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store.
and the minute I turn on a fucking game she starts crying how we never talk.
See, now, go out, come back and talk to him.
And it ain't a rocket science for Christ sake.
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car, or a girlfriend.
Jesus, I should have blown his head off when I had a chance.
Maybe so, I want you to turn around and go outside... and come back and don't talk about having no job... no car, no girlfriend, no future, no dick.
Ok, just turn around and go.
Excuse me, sir, I need a haircut if you ain't too busy.
You old Italian son of a bitch prick barber.
Boy, does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job.
Fuck me.
–All set to go through with this, right?
–Yeah, yeah.
Don't yeah, yeah me.
Just say, "Yes sir and I'll do my best."
–Yes, I'll do my best.
–Cause when I vouch for somebody... that means I am give them my word.
I don't want you making me look bad.
No I am good.
Totally into this.
Don't lay down either.
Just look em straight in the eye.
And a man can tell a lot by your handshake.
–Here, put those in your back pocket.
–Cool.
Don't blow this.
Hey, Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon.
How the hell are you?
–I am shitty.
But who's gonna listen?
–Not me, that's for sure.
Help yourself there, Walt.
You dumb pollack.
Ok this is the kid, I was telling you about.
Tao, this is Tim Kennedy, he is super on this job.
What do we got here, Walt?
Well he knows construction and he's a smart kid.
He'll do anything you need him for.
–You sure?
–Yeah.
–You speak English?
–Yes, sir.
–Were you born here?
–You bet.
I see that Walt drove you here.
You got a vehicle?
–Not at the moment.
Taking the bus for now.
–Bus?
Jesus Christ.
You don't have a car?
My head gasket cracked and the goddamned pricks at the shop... wants to bend me over for $2100.
Oh, please.
I just replaced the tranny in my Tahoe... and the sons of bitches fucked me hard, just under $3,200.
–Goddamned thieves.
It ain't right.
–You got that right.
Okay, come on in on Monday and we'll find something for you to do.
Thanks, Mr Kennedy.
–It's Tim, and what's your name again?
–Tao.
T..., okay.
You owe me one, Walt.
Yeah, well I'll buy a fruit cake for Christmas.
Oh, fuck the fruit cake.
How about you just hand over them keys to that Gran Torino.
–Why the hell does everybody want my car?
–Well, I'm not surprised.
Yeah, you don't know the half of it.
All right, come on, zipper head.
Let Mick stay here and play with himself.
What are we doing?
What do you want to do?
Carry your tools in a rice bag?
Here we go.
You can use one of these... and you'll need one of these here.
I can't afford any of this.
I'll cover it.
You can pay me back on your first pay check.
–Cool.
–Here, you'll need something like that.
This is what I am looking for here, tool belt.
There you go.
Not to bitch.
But won't I be needing some tools.
Tools I've got but I'm not going to lend you my tool belt.
You can pick up tools as you go.
–I really appreciate all this.
–Forget it.
No, I really do.
Thank you.
What's up homeboy?
What ya doing?
What up man?
What you got, punk?
–Just checking up on my little cousin.
–Yeah, man.
My little cousin...
what's this?
–Where you coming from, man?
–I am coming— home from work... not that you guys would know much about that.
–So it's true, you got a job.
–You can't just leave me alone?
What?
Hey, check this out.
[Speaking Hmong]
He is scared, huh?
–Who bought this shit for you?
Your dad?
–What you guys want with me?
–Your dad bought this shit for you?
–Keep your hands off my stuff.
What fuck is that shit?
Why the fuck you gotta make me look bad, huh?
Keep your hands off my stuff!
This massive my job man.
[Speaking Hmong]
–Give me that, that.
–Hey come on, that's my stuff.
You wanna smoke man?
Fuck it.
Let me go.
Give me that, man.
Give me that.
[Speaking Hmong]
What's the phrase I am looking for?
Oh yeah, "saving face."
Hey, there.
Hey.
I gotta run.
Haven't seen you for a few days.
Where you've been?
Been busy.
Busy, huh?
–What the hell happened to you?
–Don't worry about it.
What do you mean don't worry about it.
Look at your goddamn face.
I said don't worry about it.
Okay, it's not your problem.
When?
Grabbed me a couple of days ago right after I got off work.
Cowards.
I did everything I can possibly do.
But they broke some of your tools.
–I will replace them.
–Don't worry about the tools.
Where does your cousin live?
No, Walt.
I'll be ok.
–I don't want you to do anything.
–All right.
If you need extra tools, you just let me know.
–Well, I could use a roofing hammer.
–Good, go in my garage and get it.
This should be the last stop.
All right, here is the deal.
You stay away from Tao, understand?
You tell your friends to stay away from Tao.
If they don't listen to you, you tell him you don't want to see him anymore.
That's it, got it?
I'll take that as yes, because if I have to come back here it is gonna get fucking ugly.
Get out of my way.
How do you want your dog?
I mean steak?
–Funny.
–I told you we only eat cats.
I've never seen you like this before.
Well I am feeling good.
I got beautiful women, great food.
–And Tao.
–And even Tao isn't bugging me.
–You are having a good time, I see.
–Yeah.
And it never ends.
What happened to your knuckles anyways?
I slipped in the shower.
No big problem.
Look, now, Yum-Yum if he doesn't ask you out, I'm gonna ask you out.
Youa, don't listen to him.
He's the white devil.
Yeah, I am.
I am the white devil.
I'd loved to, Walt, but he beat you to it.
Really?
No kidding!
Dinner and a movie, or what?
Yeah, they're taking the bus.
No, you can't take the bus.
We gotta get you something... more stylish that that.
Like what?
Take a limo?
How about that?
–The Gran Torino?
–Yeah.
–You'd let me take the Gran Torino.
–Yeah, I'd let you take the Gran Torino.
Really?
Yeah, really.
[Machine gun sounds]
Is everybody all right?
[Speaking Hmong]
Tao!
It's all right.
Where's grandma?
Where is Sue?
–Where is Sue?
–She went to our aunt's.
–To her aunts?
Are you sure?
–Yeah.
Get on the phone and call her right now.
[Everyone speaking in Hmong]
Sue...
I knew, this was gonna happen.
What the hell am I doing here?
Maybe some of her friends called her and she changed her plans.
Yeah.
At the war we just, lost a lot of friends but you're getting stab for it.
You kill to it.
[Grandma speaking Hmong]
[Speaking Hmong]
Mr Kowalski?
Are you ok?
Yeah, I am ok.
Police finally left, no one is talking.
One thing about Hmong, they keep their mouths shut.
Yeah, I've noticed that.
You know, Tao and Sue will never gonna find peace in this world... as long as those gangs are around.
Until they go away.
You know, forever.
What are you saying?
You know what I am saying.
I took Sue to the hospital.
She's scared.
–They're all scared...
–Yeah
Tao especially.
He's sitting out there right now staring at your front door.
You know what he expects, Mr Kowalski.
What would you do?
–What should Tao do?
–I know what I would do if I was you.
–Or at least what you think you should do.
–Really.
If I was Tao, I guess I'd want vengeance.
I'd wanna to stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys.
–And you?
–What would I do?
I'd come over here and talk to you I guess.
I know you're close with these people, but this pisses me off too, Mr Kowalski.
–Wanna beer?
–I'd love one.
There some in the chest, right over there behind you.
Damn all this.
–Just isn't fair.
–Nothing is fair, father.
So what you gonna do, Mr Kowalski?
Call me Walt.
All right.
What are you gonna do, Walt?
I don't know.
But I'll think of something.
Whatever it is, they won't have a chance.
What are you doing?
Thinking.
Thinking.
Thinking time is over.
Now it's time to knock shit out of those pricks.
I know you don't want to hear this, but now it's time to stay calm.
Calm?
You want me to be calm?
We stay calm or else mistakes get made.
We have to step back from this thing.
No, don't let me down Walt.
Not you.
This is gonna end today.
Sit down.
–I don't want to sit.
–I said sit down.
Now, listen to me.
We gotta plan this and plan it very carefully.
Can't make any mistakes.
You know I'm the right man for this job.
I want to go home and stay calm, and come back here at 4 this afternoon.
–And what needs to be done will be done.
–I say we go now, right now.
And what?
Kill that cousin of yours and the rest of those zips.
Mr Tough Guy is out for blood all of the sudden.
You know nothing about it.
Now, go home.
You stay calm, and come back here at 4.
All right?
Ok?
Okay.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Give me a break, will you?
It's the first time I've ever smoked in the house.
Let a man enjoy himself, would you girl?
All finished. 10 dollars American.
I don't suppose your guinea hands are steady enough... to do a straight shave?
–Straight shave?
You've never ask for a straight shave, ever.
I know but I always wondered about it.
–That's unless you are too busy.
–No, just let me heat up a towel.
Here, here is 20.
Keep the change.
It's just in case you hit my jugular.
Yes sir, It gonna take about one hour.
We gonna shorten these sleeves little bit.
Gonna fix at the shoulder.
I never had a fitted suit before.
Yes, sir.
Look very good.
–What can I do for you, Mr Kowalski?
–I am here for a confession.
–Oh, Lord Jesus, what have you done?
–Nothing you just take it easy now.
–What are you up to?
–Are you gonna give me a confession or not?
How long has it been since your last confession?
Forever.
–Bless me father, for I have sinned.
–What are your sins, my son?
In 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski at the factory Christmas party.
Dorothy was in the other room with the other wives.
It just happened.
Yes, go on.
Well, I made 900 dollar profit selling a boat and a motor.
I didn't pay the taxes it's the same as stealing.
Yes, fine.
And lastly...
I was never very close with my two sons.
I don't know them.
I didn't know how.
–That's it?
–That's it.
It's bothered me most of my life.
Say 10 "Hail Maries" and 5 "Our Fathers".
God loves and forgives you and absolves you of all your sins.
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Thank you, padre.
Are you gonna retaliate for what happened to Sue.
I'm going over to that house today, Mr Kowalski.
–Is that so?
–It is.
And every other day until you see the folly of what you are planning.
–Busy day, gotta go.
–Go in peace.
Oh, I am at peace.
Jesus Christ.
So which one is mine?
–You ever fired a weapon before?
–No.
Why don't you put that one down.
I got something I wanna show you.
C'mon.
What?
In 1952 we were sent to take out a chink machine gun nest.
They trod us up pretty good.
I was the only one who came back that day.
For that they gave me a silver star.
Here it is.
Here I want you to have it.
Why?
Because we all knew the dangers that night.
But we went anyway.
That's the way it might be tonight.
There is always a chance you don't come back.
The hell we won't.
We'll roll up in there and tear some ass.
Yeah, that's foolish.
That's the exact reaction they're waiting for.
Come on and close this up.
–How many?
–How many what?
How many men did you kill in Korea?
–13, maybe more.
–What was it like to kill a man?
You don't want to know.
Now close it up.
Walt!
Walt!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Relax, you can't get out of there.
You let me out right now!
Let me out.
You fuck let me out, I'll fucking kill you.
Shut the fuck up!
You want to know what it's like to kill a man?
Well, it's goddamn awful.
That's what it is.
The only thing worse is getting a medal of valor for killing some poor kids... that wanted to just to give up.
That's all.
Yeah, some scared little gook just like you.
I shot them right in the face with that rifle you were holding in there a while ago.
Not a day goes by that I don't think about it.
You don't that on your soul.
I got blood on my hands.
I am soiled.
That's why I am going at it alone tonight.
Walt, you take me with you right now, let me out!
Look, you've come a long way.
I am proud to say that you are my friend.
But you got your whole life ahead of you.
But me, I finish things.
That's what I do and I am going at it alone.
No, wait!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
[Grandma speaking Hmong]
I need you to watch my dog.
Yeah, I love you too.
Yeah, she is old too.
Her name is Daisy.
–Hello.
–It's Walt.
The keys to my house are under the ceramic turtle on the front porch.
Let yourself in.
Your brother is in the basement.
I gotta go.
Sorry, father, we have to go.
I'm telling you, if we are not here there will be bloodshed.
We've been here for hours.
We can't afford to anchor a unit down to one location.
I am begging you to stay.
Just got a word from my sergeant, we're pulling the plug.
I am staying.
No you aren't.
We have specific orders you came with us, you're leaving with us.
Watch your head.
[Engine starts]
Sue, over here, over here.
Unlock this right now.
What's going on?
He left without me.
He went to Smokie's without me.
Tao!
What's the fuck, man?
Any swamp rats in there?
–I didn't think your ass would came.
–Shut up, gook.
I've got nothing to say to you, shrimp dick, lizard like you.
Yeah, yeah.
You go ahead watch out for your boyfriend.
Cause it was either he or you or someone who raped one of their own family.
You own blood, for Christ sake.
Now go ahead and pull those pistols, like miniature cowboys.
Go ahead.
So where's Tao at?
That pussy motherfucker not gonna come.
Don't worry about Tao.
Tao's got not one second for you.
Says who?
You?
–Fuck that.
–What the fuck you gonna do, old man?
What are you gonna do?
You bitch.
–
–Kind of jumpy, aren't we?
–Shut the fuck up.
You shut the fuck up!
–Got a light?
–What the fuck?
No.
Me...
I've got a light...
"Hail Mary, full of grace..."
Yes, sergeant.
–What happened?
–You need to step back.
–He's a friend of mine.
–I said, step back.
Hey, did you hear him?
Step back.
–What happened?
–Hey, step back.
He is my friend.
–Officer Chang!
Get those people back.
–Hey, step back now, Ok.
Get the fuck out of here!
[Mellow vocal background music]
Walt Kowalski once said to me that I didn't know anything about life or death.
Because I was an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin... who held the hands of superstitious old women and... promised they eternity.
Walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it.
But he was right.
I knew really nothing about life or death, until I got to know Walt.
And boy did I learn.
And I want to leave my house to the church because Dorothy would've liked it... now which brings us to the last item.
And again please excuse the language... in Mr Kowalski's will, I'm simply reading it the way it was written.
And I'd like to leave my 1972 Gran Torino to... my friend Tao Vang Lor.
Under the condition that you don't choptop the roof like one of those beaners don't paint any idiotic flames on it like some white-trash hillbilly and don't put a big gay spoiler on the rear end like you see... on all the other zipper heads'cars.
It just looks like hell
If you can refrain from doing any of that, it's yours.

Spectacles, testicles, wallet, and watch
[CHILDREN LAUGH]
Look at the way the old man glared at Ashley
Can't even tone it down for Mom's funeral
What do you expect?
Dad's still living in the '50s
He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly
Well, your kid's wearing a Lions jersey I'm sure Dad appreciates that
The point is that there's nothing anyone can do that won't disappoint the old man
It's inevitable
You know, that's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings
You know, that deal with the boat motor, the broken birdbath It's always something
What are we gonna do with him?
Don't you think he's gonna get in trouble, all by himself in the old neighborhood?
Well, why don't you have him move in with you?
[CHUCKLES]
Ha, ha, ha
Hey Shh
Death is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics
Bitter in the pain, sweet in the salvation
Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased and their families
Sweet to those of us who know the salvation that awaits
And some may ask, "What is death?
Is it the end?
Or is it the beginning?
And what is life?
What is this thing we call life?"
[BEEPS]
All these questions can frustrate you KAREN:
Ashley, stop it
JANOVICH:
That's why you have to turn to the Lord
Jesus
JANOVICH:
Because the Lord is the sweetness
WOMAN:
This is so good MAN:

I'll go down in the basement and get some chairs
Oh, I can do that, Dad No, I need them now, not next week
Cool, I found a medal Look at this
How much longer do we have to stay?
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell, and I'm bored
Ashley, why don't you go help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?
Me?
Yes, you Go Go help him
Grandpa Walt, would you like some help with this?
With your chairs?
No You probably just painted your nails
KAREN:
Honey, come here Okay, well, your dad is driving me crazy
Why did you make me do that?
KAREN:
It's okay We're leaving soon
WALT:
Hey, girl Come on
Come on Come on

So what are you gonna do with it when you, like, die?

Oh, God
[DOORBELL RINGS]

She asked that I watch over you when she passed on
I told her I watch over my flock
But she made me promise I'd keep an extra sharp eye on you
Look, I appreciate the kindness you've shown to my wife
Now that you've spoken your piece why don't you go tend to some of your other sheep?
Okay?
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her desire for you to go to confession
She said she couldn't remember the last time you went
Is that so?
It is
Well, I confess that I never really cared for church very much
The only reason I went was because of her
And I confess that I have no desire to confess to a boy that's just out of the seminary
[CHATTERING IN HMONG]

Come home, spirit and soul, come home
Live a good life and grow old

Why don't you strut away, you dumb rooster?
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Are you gone completely deaf or something?
Hi there, Walt
I'm not a friend of yours, so why do you insist on calling me Walt?
Sorry Mr. Kowalski
What are you peddling today, Padre?
Nothing I thought I'd drop by and see you
I haven't seen you in church
Now that you've done your good deed, why don't you take off down the road?
I'd really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski Not in this lifetime, sonny
Why?
Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
You don't wanna know No, I do
Well, I think you're an over educated 27 year old virgin who likes to hold hands of ladies who are superstitious and promises them eternity

Yo Cobra jet engine
Yo, man, it's still in mint condition
Yo, man It's in mint condition, man
Oh, I've got one
There's a Mexican, a Jew, and a colored guy go into a bar
The bartender looks up and says, "Get the fuck out of here"
So here's where my flock congregates when they're not in church
Hey, Father J
Hi, Mel Hey there, Darrell
Hello, Father Hi, Walt
What brings you in here, Father?
The meat raffle?
No, I just came down to talk to Walt, if that's okay
Damn, Padre, you are persistent, aren't you?
I promised your wife
All right Let's get a booth
I'll have a Pabst and a shot of Jack and whatever he's having
I'll have a Diet Coke Bullshit, this is a bar You have a drink
Um, I'll have a gin and tonic WALT:
Attaboy
So what do you want?
I promised your wife I'd get you to go to confession
Now, why would you do that?
She was very insistent She made me
You're kind of fond of promising things you can't deliver on Right, Father?
Let's talk about something else What?
Life and death
Life and death What the hell do you know about life and death?
I'd like to think I know a lot I'm a priest
Yeah You get up and preach about life and death but all you know is what you learned in priest school
Right out of the rookie preacher's handbook
I don't know about that I think
Death is bittersweet
Sort of bitter in its pain, but sweet in its salvation
That's what you know about life and death, and it's pathetic
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?
I know a lot I lived for almost three years in Korea with it
Thanks
We shot men stabbed them with bayonets, hacked 17 year olds to death with shovels
Stuff I'll remember till the day I die
Horrible things, but things I'll live with
And what about life?
Well, I survived the war
Got married, had a family
Sounds like you know a lot more about death than you do living
Maybe so, Father
Maybe so
[METAL CLANGING]
Son of a bitch

MAN 1:

Listen, old man, you don't wanna fuck with me
Did you hear me?
I said, get off my lawn now
Are you fucking crazy?

Okay
But you better watch your back Fuck it, man, he's crazy
MAN 2:
We'll get this cracker next time
Thank you
Get off my lawn
[THUDDING]
What the hell is this?
Christ
No, no No, no, no Come on, no more No more
No more What?
Stay right there Stay right there
Why can't you just leave me alone?
We brought you some shallots to plant
I don't want them They're perennials
They come back every year Why are you bringing me all this garbage?
Because
Because you saved Thao I didn't save anybody
I just I kept a bunch of jabbering gooks off of my lawn, that's all
You're a hero to the neighborhood I'm not a hero
They think you are That's why they keep bringing you gifts
Please, take them They're wrong
Now, I just want to be left alone Thank you
[SPEAKS IN HMONG]
SUE:
Wait
This is my mom, Vu, I'm Sue, and that's my brother, Thao
We live next door So?
Thao wants to say something
I'm sorry
Sorry for what?
For trying to steal your car
Let me tell you something, boy
You step on this property again, you're done
Good afternoon, Walt
I told you I'm not going to confession
Why didn't you just call the police?
What?
I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I heard there was trouble in the neighborhood
Why didn't you call the police?
Well
You know, I prayed that they would show up but nobody answered
What were you thinking?
Someone could have been killed We're talking life and death here
When things go wrong, you gotta act quickly
When we were in Korea and a thousand screaming gooks came across our line we didn't call the police, we reacted
We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski
I've been thinking about our conversation on life and death
About what you said
About how you carry around all the horrible things you were forced to do horrible things that won't leave you
It seems it would do you good to unload some of that burden
Things done during war are terrible
Being ordered to kill
Killing to save yourself, killing to save others
You're right Those are things I know nothing about but I do know about forgiveness and I've seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins admitted their guilt, and left their burdens behind them
Stronger men than you
Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things and are now at peace
Well, I gotta hand it to you, Padre
You came here with your guns loaded this time
Thank you
And you're right about one thing
About stronger men than me reaching their salvation
Well, halle fucking lujah
But you're wrong about something else
What's that, Mr. Kowalski?
The thing that haunts a man the most is what he isn't ordered to do
There You finally look like a human being again
You shouldn't wait so long between haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch
Yeah Well, I'm surprised you're still around
I was always hoping you'd die and they'd get somebody who knew what they were doing
Instead you just keep hanging around like the doo wop dago you are
That'll be 10 bucks, Walt Ten bucks?
Jesus Christ, Martin
What are you, half Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices
It's been 10 bucks for the last five years, you hard nosed, Polack son of a bitch
Yeah, well, keep the change See you in three weeks, prick
Not if I see you first, dipshit
Since everything could go downhill after that
Yeah, that's true That would suck
That's cool, you know?
Yeah MAN:

You didn't do nothing Trying to stay out
What's the matter with you, for chrissake?
Trying to get yourself killed?
I thought you Asian girls were supposed to be smart
Hanging around a neighborhood like that's a fast way to get you in the obituaries
I know I know Take it easy
And what about that goofball guy you were with?
Is that a date or something?
Yeah Kind of His name is Trey
Well, you shouldn't be hanging out with him
You should be hanging out with your own people, with other Humongs
You mean Hmong?
We're Hmong, not "Humong"
Whatever
Where the hell is Humong, I mean Hmong, anyway?
[SUE LAUGHS]
Wow
You're so enlightened, you know that?
No, Hmong isn't a place It's a people
Hmong people come from different parts of Laos, Thailand, and China
Yeah Well, how did you end up in my neighborhood, then?
Why didn't you stay there?
It's a Vietnam thing We fought on your side
And when the Americans quit, the Communists started killing all the Hmong
So we came over here
Yeah Well, I don't know how you ended up in the Midwest
There's snow on the ground six months out of the year
Why does a jungle people want to be in the great frozen tundra?
Hill people We were hill people Not jungle people Booga booga booga

Blame the Lutherans They brought us over here
Everybody blames the Lutherans

Yeah, and there are these great places now, you know, these communities where you don't have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow where the people are like you, active and alert, but are alone
and would benefit from being around folks their own age
Yeah, Dad, look You gotta check it out We've brought some brochures
These places are nothing like what you'd think they'd be
They're great No, no, beautiful

Okay Hey
[PEOPLE MURMURING]
Hey, what are all you fish heads looking at anyway?
I think we should go into the other room Sorry
SUE:
A lot of people in this house are very traditional
Number one, never touch a Hmong person on their head, not even a child
Hmong people believe that the soul resides on the head, so don't do that
Well, sounds dumb, but fine
Yeah, and a lot of Hmong people consider looking someone in the eye to be very rude
That's why they look away when you look at them
Anything else?
Yeah
Some Hmong people tend to smile or grin when they're yelled at
It's a cultural thing It expresses embarrassment or insecurity
It's not that they're laughing at you or anything
Yeah God, you people are nuts
But the food does look good Smells good too
Well, of course It's Hmong food
Yeah Okay Can I come back for seconds?
Here you go Thanks
You know, you mentioned about looking at people
He's been staring at me the whole evening That's Kor Khue
He's the Lor family shaman
And what's that, some sort of a witch doctor or something?
Something like that Yeah Booga booga
Ha, ha Very funny, Wally
[BOTH SPEAKING IN HMONG]
Kor Khue's interested in you He heard what you did
He would like to read you It'd be rude not to allow him this
It's a great honor
Yeah, sure, fine by me Sure All right Take a seat
WALT:
Here?
He says that people do not respect you They don't even wanna look at you
He says the way you live, your food has no flavor
You're worried about your life
You made a mistake in your past life, like a mistake that you did you're not satisfied with
He says you have no happiness in your life It's like you're not at peace
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm Yeah, I'm fine
Fine I'm fine
God, I've got more in common with these gooks than I do my own spoilt rotten family
Jesus Christ
Happy birthday
Are you okay?
Yeah Yeah, I'm fine
You were bleeding
No, I bit my tongue It's nothing
Why don't we go and get some of that good gook food?

My mom said he dishonored the family and now he has to work off his debt
He'll start tomorrow morning Not tomorrow, not any time
I don't even want him on my property I thought we went over all that
It's very important that you accept, and it would be an insult if you refuse
Why is this being put back on me?
He's the one who tried to steal my car
All of a sudden, I'm the bad guy in this
Look, my family is very traditional and would be very much upset if you don't let Thao repay
If he doesn't wanna do it, then let's just go

Go ahead I don't care if you insult me or say racist things
Because you know what?
I'll take it
Yeah, course you'll take it, because you have no teeth, you have no balls, kid

In fact, speaking of busy, I got a lot on my plate right now so if there's not something pressing
No No, not at all
So why don't you call me this weekend?
Sure
Okay It was nice talking to you, Dad Thanks for calling
Thanks Yeah
[L P, BUDDAH, CUZZ L B 'S "APPRECIATION" PLAYS ON CAR STEREO]
This kid doesn't have a chance
What do you know about faucets?
I know a lot about them, boy
Stand aside
Jesus For the love of Pete What?
It must be a hundred degrees in here Why don't you turn on the fan?
The place is falling apart
THAO:
Man, where'd you get all this stuff?
What are you talking about?
All the tools and stuff
Well, it may come as a surprise to a thief but I bought this stuff, everything in here, with my own money
Yeah, yeah That's not what I meant
I mean, there's just so much shit packed in here
Yeah Well, every tool in here has a purpose
Everything has a job to do
They're all to use if necessary
Okay, so, what's that?
That's a post hole digger That?
Vise grips
That?
Wire cutters
You know it's a trowel, come on
Those are shears there, and that's a saw
That's a tack hammer You can't fool me, kid
All right, what's on your mind?
It's just, I can't afford to buy all this stuff
Well, I guess even a bonehead like you could understand that a man acquires this over a period of 50 years
Yeah, but All right, look, here
Take these three items, right here You can have this
WD 40, vise grips and some duct tape
Any man worth his salt can do half of the household chores with just those three things
Anything else you need, you just borrow it, that's all
Okay Cool
[COUGHING]
Fuck me What's with that?
Nothing What?
Nothing, huh?
I just saw you coughed up blood
That's not good You should really see a doctor
Yeah
Look those guys who were here the other night, on my lawn
What about them?
Just a gang, a bunch of Hmong gangbangers
Yeah, I assumed that, but what were they doing here?
They were gonna take me away
They were kind of pissed that I blew my first initiation
Yeah Well, you are a pussy, you know, you wanna hang out with guys like that
What was your initiation supposed to be?
My Gran Torino?
Christ all Friday
Shit
Toad, you got a minute?
All right Okay
Here it is
Here's the deal I take the top because that's the heaviest
I pull on that, and you stand right back here and you push and help me push it up each step
Just like that Then let me take the top
No, no, I've got the top
Really, I'll take the top It looks heavy
Look, I'm not crippled I've got the top
If you don't let me take the top, I ain't helping
Now, listen to me, zipperhead No, you listen, old man
I'm here because you needed help So it's either top or I'm out of here
[GROWLS]
All right You take the top, and I'll push
Just don't let it slip out of your little girl hands and crush me
Don't give me any ideas, now
That thing weighs a ton Yeah
It runs like a clock, though They just don't make them like this anymore
So, what are you gonna do with it?
Sell it, I guess
How much?
60 bucks They
I'm tired of having it sit around down in the basement there
Why?
You looking for a freezer?
The downstairs one kind of died
Okay 25 bucks and it's yours
Twenty five?
But you just said 60
I know, but this'll save me money putting an ad in the paper
Come on, let's wheel it over to your place All right Okay
Kind of ironic, huh?
WALT:
What?
Toad washing the car that he tried to steal from you
Yeah He misses one spot, he's doing it all over again too
It's nice of you to look after him like this
He doesn't have any real role models in his life
Well, I'm not any role model
But you're a good man, Wally
I wish our father would've been more like you
Don't go calling me Wally No, I'm serious
He was really hard on us, really traditional, and really old school
Yeah, well, I'm old school Yeah, but you're an American
What's that supposed to mean?
You like him, don't you?
Are you kidding?
He tried to steal my car
Uh huh And you spend time with him teach him how to fix things, saved him from that fucked cousin of ours
Hey Watch your language, lady And you're a good man
I'm not a good man
Get me another beer, dragon lady This one's empty
You know, the Hmong consider gardening to be women's work
Yeah That's probably why I see you in the garden over there all the time
Besides, we ain't in Humong
Funny
You know, you should quit That's bad for you
Yeah?
So is being in a gang, dipshit
Didn't you hear what I just said?
I saw you cough up blood
You should quit
So, what's that emblem supposed to mean anyway?
Is it your ancient Cub Scout emblem?
First Cavalry I've had it since '51
So, what do you want to do with your life, kid?
Well, I was thinking about maybe sales
Sales, huh?
My oldest son is in sales
Does he do well?
Oh, yeah License to steal
I work in the Ford factory for 50 years, and he's out selling Japanese cars
You made cars?
Yeah
I put the steering column in this Gran Torino in 1972, right on the line
Oh, you are old So cool
Yeah So you wanna be in sales You thinking about going to school maybe?
Kind of, but school costs money Well, maybe you should get a job
You can't just sit there and spread mulch in my garden the rest of your life
Well, maybe you could just pay me Yeah Very funny
Well, what kind of job could I ever get?
Yeah You're right Nobody would ever hire you
Yeah, I know

"Sir, I'd like a haircut, if you have time"

Son of a bitch, I just got my brakes fixed, and those sons of bitches really nailed me
I mean, they screwed me right in the ass WALT:
Don't swear at the guy
Just talk about people who are not in the room
You could bitch about your boss making you work overtime when it's bowling night
Right Or my old lady bitches for two goddamn hours about how they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store and the minute I turn on the game, she starts crying how we never talk
You see?
Now go out, come back and talk to him
And it ain't rocket science, for chrissake
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car or a girlfriend
Jesus I should've blown his head off when I had the chance
Yeah Maybe so
Now, okay, I want you to turn around and go outside and come back, and don't talk about having no job no car, no girlfriend, no future, no dick
Okay?
Just turn around and go

If I was Thao, I guess I'd want vengeance
I'd wanna stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys
And you?
What would I do?
I'd come over here and talk to you, I guess
I know you're close with these people, but this pisses me off too, Mr. Kowalski
Want a beer?

Are you gonna give me a confession or not?
How long has it been since your last confession?
WALT:
Oh, forever
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned
What are your sins, my son?
Well, in 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski at the factory Christmas party
Dorothy was in the other room with the other wives
It just happened
Yes, go on
Well, I made a 900 dollar profit selling a boat and a motor
I didn't pay the taxes It's the same as stealing
Yes, fine
Oh, lastly
I was never very close with my two sons
I don't know them I didn't know how
That's it?
That's it?
It's bothered me most of my life
Say 10 "Hail Marys" and five "Our Fathers"
God loves you and forgives you, and I absolve you of all your sins
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
Thank you, Padre
Are you going to retaliate for what happened to Sue?
I'm going over to that house today, Mr. Kowalski
WALT:
Is that so?
It is And every other day until you see the folly in what you're planning
Busy day Gotta go Go in peace
Oh, I am at peace
Jesus Christ
So which one's mine?
You ever fired a weapon before?
No
Well, why don't you put that one down?

Been shredding us up pretty good
I was the only one that came back that day
For that, they gave me a Silver Star Here it is
Here I want you to have it
Why?
Why?
Because we all knew the dangers that night, but we went anyway
That's the way it might be tonight
There's always a chance you don't come back
The hell we won't We're gonna roll up in there and tear some ass
That's foolish That's the exact reaction they're waiting for

Yeah, some scared little gook just like you
I shot him in the face with that rifle you were holding in there a while ago
Not a day goes by that I don't think about it, and you don't want that on your soul

Walt Kowalski once said to me that I didn't know anything about life or death because I was an over educated, 27 year old virgin who held the hands of superstitious old women and promised them eternity
[PEOPLE CHUCKLE]
Walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it but he was right
I knew really nothing about life or death until I got to know Walt
And, boy, did I learn
"And I wanna leave my house to the church because Dorothy would've liked it"
Now, which brings us to our last item, and again please excuse the language in Mr. Kowalski's will
I'm simply reading it the way it was written
"And I'd like to leave my 1972 Gran Torino
to my friend
Thao Vang Lor on the condition that you don't chop top the roof like one of those beaners don't paint any idiotic flames on it like some white trash hillbilly and don't put a big, gay spoiler on the rear end
like you see on all the other zipperheads' cars
It just looks like hell
If you can refrain from doing any of that, it's yours"
{{{the end}}}
God, I am sorry for Dorothy, Walt.
She was a real peach.
Thanks for coming, Al.
Spectacles, testicles, wallet and watch.
Look at the Old Man glaring at Ashley.
He can?
t even tone it down at Mom?
s funeral?
What do you expect?
Dad?
s still living in the ?
50s.
He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly.
Yeah, well your kid?
s wearing a Timberwolves jersey.
I?
m sure Dad appreciates that.
The point I am trying to make is that there?
s nothing anyone can do that won?
t disappoint the Old Man.
It?
s inevitable.
That?
s why we stopped doing Thanksgivings.
the deal with the boat motor, the broken bird bath,
It?
s always something.
What are we going to do with him?
Don?
t you think he?
ll get in trouble over there all by himself in the old neighborhood?
Why don?
t you have him move in with you?
Death is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics.
Bitter in the pain.
Sweet in the salvation.
Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased.
... and their families
Sweet to those who know the salvation that awaits.
And some may ask, what is death?
Is it the end?
Or is it the beginning?
And what is life?
What is this thing we call life?
All these questions can frustrate you at times like this.
And that's why you have to turn to the Lord.
- Jesus ...
Because the Lord is the sweetness.
Is that dad?
- No, that's grandpa Walt.
There is a platoon, E-Company, March 2, 1952.
Korea?
- Where's Korea?
Well, people showed up after the service, huh?
Yeah, well, I suppose they heard there?
d be a lot of ham.
I?
ll go down the basement and get some chairs.
Oh, I can do that, Dad..
- No, we need them now not next week.
Cool, I found a medal.
Look at this.
How much longer do we have to stay?
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell and I?
m bored.
Ashley, honey.
Why don?
t you help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?
Me?
- Yes, you.
Grandpa Walt, would you like some help with these four chairs.
No, you probably just painted your nails.
Your dad is driving me crazy.
Why didn't you guys make him a hint we're leaving soon?
Come on, let's go.
Jesus Christ, how many swamp rats can get in one room?
Grandpa, when?
d you get the vintage car?
1972.
I never knew you had a cool old car.
Yeah, it's been here since before you were born.
So, what are you going do with it when you like... die?
Then what about that super cool retro couch that you have in the den
Cause I was thinking I?
m going to State next year, and I think it would look really good in my dorm room.
And I don't have any furniture at all.
God.

How you holding up, Walt?
Mr. Kowalski.
Huh?
- Mr. Kowalski, that's my name.
Right, Mr. Kowalski.
Your wife and I became quite close these last few months.
She asked that I watch over you when she passed on.
I told her I watch out for my entire flock.
But she made me promise I?
d keep an extra sharp eye on you.
I appreciate your kindness you've shown to my wife.
Now that you?
ve spoken your piece, why don?
t go and attend some of your other sheep?
Ok?
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her desire for you to go to confession.
She said she couldn?
t remember the last time you went.
Is that so?
- It is.
Well, I confess that I never really cared for church very much.
The only reason I went was because of her.
And I confess that I have no desire to confess to a boy that is just out of the seminary.
Wish I could help dad, but gotta get kids home.
Kids getting restless.
- Yeah, fine, just go.
I?
ll call in a few, see how you?
re doing.
- Alright.
Kill you to buy American.
Huh ...

Jesus.
It?

You know.
Even at Mom?
s funeral, he can?
t let it go.
At least he didn?
t say anything this time.
-He didn?
t need to.
Well, what do you expect, Mitch?
The man worked at a Ford plant for a lot of years.
I suppose that?
s my goddamned fault?
Just give it a rest.
Drive.
Ok?
Kids, do you want the radio on?
Yes.
You want to listen to some music?
Good.
Damn, barbarians
Oh, Jesus ...
Polarski would roll over in his grave if he could see his lawn now.
What the hell the chinks had to move in this neighborhood for?
Have you gone completely deaf or something?
Hi there, Walt.
I kind of not a friend of yours.
Why do you insist on calling me Walt?
Sorry , Mr.Kowalski.
What are you peddling today, padre?
- Nothing.

Okay.
Well now when you tipped on your good deed, now why don?
t you just take off down the road?
I?
d really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.
- Not in this lifetime, sonny.
Why?
Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
- You don't want to know.
No, I do.
Well I think you?
re an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold the hands of old ladies who are superstitious and promises them eternity.
Is you a boy or is you a girl, I can?

But now look, nobody wants to fuck with me.
Come on man, let's go.

We are a family.
Look, I am brother to Spider, as he is brother to me.
Come on.

That's a woman's work man.
- Come get your hands dirty, man.
So what do I have to do?
Spider told that old boy next door had a bad ass whip.
Told you we got him.
Come on.
Nice.
- Ya, my little cousin being little man.
Yo, that's a nice car.
1972 Gran Torino, Fastback.
Cobra jet engine.
- Yo man it can still in mint condition.
Yo man, it's in mint condition man.
I've got one.
A Mexican, a Jew and a colored guy go into the bar.
The bartender looks up and says:
"Get the fuck out of here!"
So, here?
s where my flock congregates when they?
re not in church..
Hey Father J.
- Hey, Mel.
Hey, Darrel.
Hey father.
- Hi, Walt.
What brings you in here, father.
Meat raffle?
No, I just came down to talk Walt if that's ok.
Damn, padre.
You are persistent, aren't you?
I promised your wife.
All right, let's get booze.
I'll have Pabst and a shot of Jack.
And whatever he's having.
I'll have a Diet Coke.
- Bullshit.
This is a bar.
You have a drink.
I'll have a gin and tonic.
- Attaboy!
So, what you want?
I promised your wife I?
d get you to go to confession.
Now, why would you do that?
- She was very insistent.
She made me.
Well you're kinda found of promising things you can?
t deliver on, right, father?
Let?
s talk about something else.
- What?
Life and death.
Life and death.
What the hell do you know about life and death?
I?
d like to think I know a lot.
I?
m a priest..
Yeah, you get up and preach about life and death.
But all what you know is what you learned in a priest school.
Right out of the rookie Preacher's Handbook
I don't know about that.
I think...
That is bittersweet.
Sort of bitter in its pain.
But sweet in its salvation.
That's what you know of life and death, and that's pathetic.
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?
I know a lot.
I lived there almost three years in Korea.
Thanks.
We shot men.
We stabbed them with bayonets, hacked seventeen-year-olds to death with shovels
Stuff I'll remember till the day I die.
Horrible things, but things I live with.
And what about life?
Well, I ...
I survived the war.
got married... and had a family.
Sounds like you know more about death than you do living.
Maybe so, father.
Maybe so.
Son of a bitch.
Hey, man, get in a car!
- Tao, what the fuck, get in!
Come on Tao.
- Come, let's go,man, get in!
Fuck man, get in!
Hello?
Morning, Dad, it?
s your number one son, Mitch.
Morning?
It's after one in the afternoon.
It's not morning.
Oh, right.
Afternoon, then.
So what do you want?
- What?
Me?
Nothing.
I mean, what would I want?
Well, I don?
t know.
Your wife has already gone through all of your mother?
s jewelry.
No, dad.
I was just calling to see how are you doing?
Well, anything new with the old neighborhood?
No.
- Great.
Smooth sailing then.
Yah.
- Ok, good, good, then.
Oh, hey, dead.
- Yeah.
You wouldn't happen to still know that guy from the plant who has Lion season tickets?
Dad?
Ain't she sweet?
Come on.
Hey, what's up?
What are you doing here, man?
- Nothing.
Minding our own business.
- Just hanging out.
What are you guys doing here?
What?
Can I just come here to hang with my little cousin?
We have good new for you.
- Really, and what's that?
Only for guy talk.
- I don't think so.
Why not?
- Come on, man, we are going to give you another shot.
Don't go, Tao.
- Mind your own business girl.
Come on, let's go
- Come.
What the hell is this?
Get up.
- G?
t off my lawn.
Listen old man, you don't want to fuck with me.
Did you hear me?
I said get off my lawn, now.
Are you fucking crazy?
Go back in a house.
Yeah, I'll blow the hole in your face and then I'll go in a house.
And I'll sleep like a baby You can count on that.
We used to stack fucks like you five feet high in Korea, used you for sandbags.
Ok.
You better watch your back...
Thank you.
Get off my lawn.
What the hell is this?
No, no, no, no more.
Stay right there.
Why can't you people just leave me alone?
We brought you some shallots to plant in the garden.
I don't want them.
They?
re perennials, they come back every year.
Look, why are bringing me all this garbage anyway.
Because
Because you saved, Tao.
I didn't save anybody.
I just.
I kept a bunch of jabbering gooks off of my lawn .
You are a hero to the neighborhood.
I am not a hero.
Too bad, they think you are and that?
s why they're keep bringing you the gifts.
Please take them.
- All they are wrong.
I just want to be left alone, thank you.
- Wait!
This is my mom, Vu, I?
m Sue and that's my brother, Tao.
We live next door.
- So?
Tao wants to say something.
I am sorry.
- Sorry for what?
For trying to steal your car.
Let me tell you something boy.
You step on this property again, you are done...
Good afternoon, Walt.
I told you I?
m not going to confession..
- Why didn't you just call the police?
What?
I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I heard there was some trouble in the neighborhood.
Why didn't call the police?
Well ...
You know why, I've prayed that they would show up, but..
.. nobody answered.
- What were you thinking?
Someone could have been killed.
We?
re talking life and death here.
When things go wrong, you gotta act quickly.
When we were in Korea and a thousand screaming gooks came across our land..
... we didn't call the police.
We reacted.
- We are not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski,
I?
ve been thinking about our conversation on life and death.
About what you said.
About how you carry around all the horrible things you were forced to do
Horrible things that won?
t leave you.
It seems that it would do you good to unload some of that burden.
Things done during war are terrible.
being ordered to kill ... killing to save yourself, killing to save others.
You?
re right, those are things I know nothing about.
But I do know about forgiveness.
And I?
ve seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins, admitted their guilt and left their burdens behind them.
Stronger men than you!
Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things... and are now at peace.
Well I got to hand it to you, padre, You came here with your guns loaded this time.
Thank you!
- And you're right about one thing.
About stronger men than me, reaching their salvation.
Well, Hallefuckinlujah.
- But you are wrong about something else.
- What's that, Mr. Kowalski?
The thing that haunts a man the most is what he isn?
t ordered to do.
There, finally, you look like a human being again. .
You shouldn?
t wait so long between haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch.
Well I am surprised you are still around.
I was always hoping that you die off and they get somebody in here they knew what the hell they are doing.
Instead you just keep hanging around, like the dump wop dago you are.
- That?
ll be ten dollars, Walt.
- Ten bucks, Jesus Christ, Martin.
What are you half-Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices all the time.
It?
s been ten bucks for the last five years and you hard-mellows,
Pollack son of a bitch.
Keep the change.
- See you in three weeks, prick.
Not if I see you first, dipshit.
That's cool, you know.
Look at this.
You tight ass over here.
Come here girl.
You can't say hi?
Or are you acting like stuck-up and shit.
What are you supposed to be man?
- Yo, it's cool dog.
The fuck are you doing in my neighborhood, boy?
None, Just going to the corner spot, you know get some CDs, sound good, bro?
He called, you bro!
- Come on sound good, bro?
Sound good.
- Shut the fuck up.
Call me bro again, and I'll bite your motherfucking face off .
Yeah, motherfucker.
- Now what the fuck you come down here for?
You here to bring this little present?
Oriental yummy?
Don't worry, I'll take a real good care with her.
Fuck out of here, .
- Fuck out of here, man!
Oh shit, you have a bitch with you.
Keep your ass right here.
Oh great.
Another asshole who has a fetish for Asian girls.
God, it gets so old.
Oh, shit, what's your name girl?
My name?
Get your ass out of here, okay.
It?
s 'take your crude, overly obvious come-on to every woman who walks past and cram it.'
That?
s my name.
Who do you think you are talking to?
Who does it look like?
Man she's tough.
- What?
You gonna hit me now?
That'd pretty much complete the picture.
You need to keep your bitch on a leash.
Put a choke chain on her and yank that motherfucker.
Oh, of course, right to the stereotype thesaurus
- Oh yeah
Call me a whore and a bitch in the same sentence.
-Bitch is crazy.
I like her like that
- Now take that bitch.
You don't know when to quit do you, girl?
- Let me teach you a lesson
Stop!
Let me go!
Take your ass over there.
What the fuck are you looking at old man?
What the hell are you spooks up to?
Spooks?
You'd better get your ass on honkey, while I still let you.
That's you'd better do.
What the fuck he thinks he is?
Have you noticed how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't fucking with?
That's me.
You are fucking crazy, get out of here, man.
Why don't you get your ass out of here before we kicked your wrinkly white ass.
What's wrong with him man?
The motherfucker's crazy!
-What is this thing?
What the hell?
Get in a truck.
Crazy motherfucker.
- What's wrong with him, man.
Hey pops come on now.
- Shut your fucking face!
You don't fucking listen, do you?
Now get in a truck.
- Go get in a truck girl.
Let her go, old man!
Shut up pussy.
What is this 'bro' shit anyway?
You want to be superb page, or something
These guy don't want to be your bro and I don't blame them.
Now get your old faint paddy ass on down the road.
Take care now.
You too.
Oh, yeah.
Why didn't you do nothing?
Man you fucking!
Shit man.
If he had cannon at your fucking face, you would do nothing.
What's the matter with you, for Christ sake?
Trying to get yourself killed?
I thought you Asian girls were supposed to be smart.
Hanging around in the neighborhood like that is the fast way to get you in the obituaries.
I know, I know.
Take it easy.
And what about that goofball guy you were with.
Is that a date or something?
Yeah, kind of.
His name is Trey.
- You should be hanging out with them.
You should be hanging out with your own people.
The other Hummongs.
- You mean, Hmong?
Hmong, not Hummong
- Whatever.
What the hell is Hmong, I mean Mong anyway?
Wow, you so enlighten you know that?
No, Hmong is not a place, it is a people.
My people come from different parts of Laos, Thailand and China.
Well how you ended up in my neighborhood?
Why didn't you stay there?
It's Vietnam thing.
We thought on your side And when American quit the communists started killing all the Hmong.
So we came over here.
Yeah, well I don't know how you ended up in Midwest.
Snow on the ground six months in the year.
What is it?
Jungle people wanted to be on great frozen tundra?
Hill people.
We are hill people.
Not jungle people.
BOO-ga, ga-Boo, BOO-ga!
Yeah, whatever ...
Blame the Lutherans.
They brought us up here.
Everybody blames the Lutherans.
Well, you'd think the cold will keep all the idiots out.
Thanks for the ride.
You know something kid, you are all right.
But what about that dimwit brother of yours?
He is little slow or something?
Tao is actually really smart.
He just doesn't know what direction to go in.
Poor toad.
- It is really common.
Hmong girls over here fit in better.
The girls go to college and the boys go to jail.
That old hag hates my ass.
Your birthday today, Daisy.
This year you have to make a choice between two life paths.
Second chances come your way.
Extraordinary events culminate in what might seem to be an anticlimax.
You lucky numbers are: 84, 23, 11, 78 and 99.
What a load of shit.
Yea.
What the hell is it with kids nowadays?
All right.
Let me help you with those.
- Oh, thank you.
How about that?
How about that, Daisy?
It's too heavy for a bag.
- No problem.
Good, Karen, give it to him.
-Here you go.
Well, what is it?
-It's a Gopher.
So you can reach stuff.
It makes things a lot of easier.
This is from me.
It's a phone.
Oh, I can see that.
I just thought...well, we thought that it would make things easier.
Thank you, Karen.
There?
s nothing wrong with making things less hard on yourself.
You know Karen?
s right, Dad.
You?
ve worked hard your whole life.
Maybe it's time you start thinking about taking it a easier?
And some other thing, Dad.
You really should get rid of the coffin nails.
We were thinking about the house.
You know, when Mom?
s gone, it?
s got to be a lot to maintain around here.
Let alone clean.
And you are here all alone ...
Yeah, you know, there?
s these great places now, you know, these communities
Where you don?
t have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow.
You know, People who are like you, active and alert, but are alone.
And would benefit from being around folks their own age.
Yeah Dad, look.
You got to check it out.
We brought some brochures.
These places are nothing like that you think they would be.
They are great.
- No, they are beautiful.
They are really nice They really are.
These are top-notch like resorts.
It is like staying in a hotel, practically.
- They're beautiful.
They really are.
- Yeah.
They care of everything.
They clean up.
They're really nice.
Oh, there are wonderful stores, where you can buy new shoes.
They are amazing, they really are.
You have a good time, play some golf maybe.
Meet other people.
Son of a bitch.
Kicked us out on his birthday.
I've told you that was a bad idea.
I know, you were right
- He won?
t let anybody help him.
Well, we tried.
Now can we just drop it?
No one can say we didn?
t try
What the hell with him, we shouldn't have done it.
We should?
ve stayed home with Josh and Ashley.
At least they were smart enough to not come here.
The goddamn kids have more sense than we do.
We miss mom, don't we Daisy?
Hey, Walt.
What are you up to?
We?
re having a barbecue.
You want to come over?
What do you think?
- There's tons of food.
Just keep you hands off my dog.
-No worries.
We only eat cats.
Really?
- No I am kidding, you moron.
Come on you can be my special guest.
-No, I am fine right here.
Yeah ...
Son of a bitch.
- Okay, so, what have you had to eat today?
I had a piece of cake.
And a little beef jerky.
Come on over and get something to eat.
We've got beer too.
Well ...
I might as well drink with strangers better than drinking alone.
It is my birthday.
Really.
Happy birthday Wally
- Don't call me Wally.
You have no Pabts among the beer.
- As they say, "when in Hmong."
What am I doing wrong?
Every time I look at somebody they always look at the ground.
What is she saying?
- She said welcome to our home.
Oh no, she is not.
- Yes, she didn't.
She hates me.
Yeah, she hates you.
Okay.
What?
!
What are all you fish heads looking at anyway?
I think we should go to other room.
Sorry.
All the people in this house are very traditional.
Number 1.
Never touch a Hmong person on the head, not even a child..
Hmong-people believe that the soul resides on the head.
So, don't do that.
- Sounds dumb, but fine.
And a lot of Hmong people consider looking at someone eye to be very rude.
That's why they look away, when you look at them.
- Anything else?
Yeah, some Hmong people tend to smile or grin when they?
re yelled at.
It's a cultural thing.
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity, it's not that they?
re laughing at you, really.
You people are nuts
But the food..
It looks good, smells good too.
-Of course, its Hmong food.
Okay, and I come back in few seconds.
Here you go.
- Thanks.
You mentioned about..
looking at people, he's been staring at me the whole evening.
That's Kor Khue.
He is the Lor's family shaman.
What's that some sort of witch doctor or something.
- Something like that.
Boeki Boo.
- You're funny, Wally.
Kor Khue's interested in you.
He heard what you did.
He would like to read you.
It would be rude not allow him this.
It's a great honor.
Yeah sure.
It's fine by me.
- All right, take a seat.
He says people do not respect you.
They don't even want to look at you.
He says the way you live, your food has no flavor.
You wearied by your life.
You made a mistake.
And you past life is like a mistake what you did.
You are not satisfied with.
He says, you have no happiness in your life.
It's like you are not at peace.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I am fine.
Fine, I am fine.
God, I?
ve got more in common with these gooks than I have with my own spoiled-rotten family.
Jesus Christ ...
Happy Birthday.
Are you ok?
Yeah, I am fine.
You were bleeding.
- No, I bit my tongue.
It's nothing.
Why don't we get down and get some of that good gook food.
I am starving.
Okay.
You ladies are wonderful.
That stuff is really good.
Come on you glutton!
- What's up?
Let's go.
- What for?
To mingle.
- We can mingle right here.
No.
You told me not to leave you alone.
Thank you very much.
I have to go now.
I'll be back.
Don't let me go right of it .
Well, well, look he is over there.
- Yeah, the kid who steal my Gran Torino.
My brother Tao.
- Tried to anyway, yeah, toad.
It was wobby a bit.
But it should fix it.
What's this?
Little rice liquor Here, try it.
All right.
My friends and I were just wondering what you?
re doing here?
That's a good question.
What am I doing here?
My name is Walt.
- Hey, Walt.
I am Wa Xam.
Wa Yum?
- No Wa Xam.
Wa Xam, Ok.
- So what do you do?
I fix things.
Stuff like that.
- Like what?
I've just fixed that dryer over there.
I fixed my wife's friend sink.
I took old aunt Merry to doctor to get a prescription.
Fixed up.
I've even the fixed the door, what had't even broken yet.
You're funny
I've been called a lot of things, but never funny.
Well, I have to take off.
Enjoy yourself.
- Okay, Yum Yum.
Later.
Come on.
Relax, zipper headed.
I am not gonna shoot you.
I'd look down too if I was you.
You know, I knew you were a dipshit the first time I ever saw you.
You?
re worse with women than you are with stealing cars, Toad.
It's Tao.
- What?
It's not toad, it's Tao.
My name is Tao.
You were blowing it with that girl who was there.
Not that I give two shits about a Toad like you.
You don't what you are talking about.
You are wrong egg roll.
I know exactly what I am talking about.
I may not be the most pleasant person to be around.
But I got the best woman who was ever on this planet to marry me.
I had to work at it.
That was the best thing that ever happened to me.
Hangs down.
But you ... you know
You let Click Clack, Ding Dong and Charlie Chan just walk out with what?
s-her-face.
She likes you, you know.
I don't know why.
Who?
Yum yum!
You know that girl in the purple sweater.
She's been looking at you all day, stupid.
Do you mean, Wa Xam?
- Yeah, Yum Yum.Yeah.
Nice girl, very charming girl.
I talked with her.
But you let her just walk right out.
With the three stooges.
And you know why?
Cause you are big, fat pussy.
Well ...
I gotta go.
Good day.
Puss cake.
No, no more.
Okay, put them over there.
No.
No.
No more No more.
No more.
No more, please ...
Is that chicken dumpling thing you brought before?
Alright.
Better than beef jerky all the time.
What's going on?
What's going on?
-Tao is here to make amends.
He is here to work for you.
-No, he isn't.
He's not gonna work for me.
My mom said dishonored the family.
And now he has to work off his dept.
He starts tomorrow morning.
- Oh not tomorrow, not any time.
I don't even want him on my property I thought we went over all that.
It is very important to my mom that you accept.
And that would be an insult if you refuse.
Why is it being put back on me, all of this?
He is the one who tried to steal my car ... all of the sudden I am a bad guy in this thing.
Look my family is very traditional and would be very much upset if you don't let Tao repay.
If you doesn't want to do it, then let's just go.
Shut up!
Yeah, shut up.
All right, tomorrow, tomorrow.
Thank you.
Jesus, Joseph and Mary.
These Hmong broads are like badgers.
Son of a bitch.
I never thought he'd show.
All right, what are you good at?
Like what?
- That's what I am asking.
You gonna work for me, I gotta know what you are good at.
I gotta know what you can do.
- I don't know.
That's kind of half way what I expected you to say.
See that tree right there?
You just go over there and count the birds.
You want me to count the birds?
- Yeah, you can count?
All you slopes are supposed to be good at math, right?
Yeah, I can count.
- Good.
One, two ...
So, what do you have for me to do?
You want me to watch paint dry or maybe count the clouds that pass by?
Don't get flip with me, boy.
I am not the one who is trying to steal, don't you forget that.
Go ahead.
I don?
t care if you insult me and say racist things.
Cause you know what?
I'll take it.
- Of cause you'll take it.
Cause you have no teeth, you have no balls, kid.
Look, I am stuck here.
Why don't you find something useful for me to do.
Unlike you, I am not useless.
And I maintain my own property.
These swamp rats, on the other hand, you just can help it.
How long do I have you for?
Toad, how long?
Till next Friday.
All right.
Go get the ladder out of the garage.
When you got finished with that roof there.
You can take that gutter, and nail it back up.
I am tired looking at it for the last three years.
Yeah, you said it, brother.
Hello.
Grandpa says he want to know if you can have Tao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch?
Wasp nest?
That's terrible.
I think we can handle that after the lunch.
Lord All Mighty, knock it off.
It's my last day.
What else do have for me do?
Take a day-off.
You did enough.
Toad!
Nothing.
Nevermind.
Kowski?
Kowski?
Kowski?
Mr. Kowalski?
Good morning.
I looked over your paperwork and I think we should immediately start a full battery of tests
I feel that this would be the best way to go about checking all the issues that you've had.
Excuse me, what happened to Dr.Felmon, my regular doctor?
Dr. Felmon retired three years ago.
I am his replacement Dr. Chang.
It's grandpa Walt.
- Pick it up.
You talk to him!
Mitch.
I'm doing bills here.
- You talk to him, he is yours father.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Mitch.
It's me your dad.
Yeah, I know.
What's up?
Oh, nothing, nothing much really.
How is everything going?
I am fine, fine.
How about Karen and the kids?
Fine, everybody is great.
Doing fine.
Good.
How about work?
Busy.
Yeah, I suppose...
In fact, um, speaking of busy.
I got a lot on my plate right now, so if it is not something pressing.
No, not it all.
Why don't you call me this weekend?
Sure.
Ok, It was nice talking to you.
Thanks for talk.
Thanks.
This kid doesn't have a chance.
What do you know about faucets?
I know a lot about them, boy.
Tender side.
Jesus.
For the love of Pete.
- What?
It must be a hundred degrees here.
Just, turn on the fan.
This place is wobbling apart.
Where did you get all the stuff?
What are you talking about?
- All the tools and stuff.
Well, may come as surprise to a thief, but I bought this stuff.
Everything in here with my own money.
Yeah, yeah.
This is not what I meant.
I mean this is so much shit packed in here.
Yeah, well.
Every tool in here has a purpose.
Everything has a job to do.
They are all used when necessary.
- Okay, so, what is that?
it is a post hole digger.
- That
Vice-grips.
Wire cutters, you know that's a trowel.
There is shears right there, and that's a saw.
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me kid.
Alright, what's on your mind.
It's just..
I can't afford to buy all this stuff.
Well, I guess, even a bonehead like you, could understand... that a man acquires it over the period of 50 years.
Yeah, but...
All right, look, here.
These three items right here, you can have this.
WD-40, vice grips and some duck tape.
Any man who is worth his salt, can do half of the house chores with just those three things.
Anything else you need you just borrow it, that's all.
Ok, cool.
Fuck me.
- What's with that?
Nothing.
What?
Nothing, huh?
I just saw you've coughed out blood.
That's not good.
You should really see a doctor.
Look..
Those guys over here, the other night ... on my lawn, what a bout them?
- Just a gang.
A bunch of Hmong gang bangers.
I assume that.
What they were doing here?
They were going to take me away.
They were kind of pissed, that I blew my first initiation.
Yeah, well you are, you are a pussy.
You wanna hang out with guys like that.
What was your initiation supposed to be?
My Gran Torino?
Toad, you got a minute?
Here it is.
Here is the deal.
I take the top, cause that's the heaviest.
I'll pull on that.
And you stand right back here, and you push.
And help me push it up each step.
like that.
- Then, let me take the top.
No, no, I've got a top.
No, I'll take the top.
It looks pretty heavy.
Look I am not crippled.
I've got the top.
If you don't let me take the top.
I ain't helping.
I will go back home.
Listen to me, zipper head.
No, you listen, old man!
I am here because you need help.
So it is either top of I am out of here.
All right, you take the top and I'll push.
Don't let it slip off you little girl hands and crush me.
Don't give me any ideas.
That thing weighs a ton.
Runs like a clock.
They don't make them like this anymore.
So what are you going to do with it?
- Sell it I guess.
How much?
- 60 bucks.
I am tired of having this sit around down in the basement there.
Why?
You are looking for a freezer?
Our downstairs one kind of died.
- Okay, 25 bucks and it's yours.
25?
You've just said 60.
I know, it will save me money putting an ad in the paper.
Come on, let haul it over your place.
Kind of ironic, huh?
- What?
Toad washing a car they tried to steal from you.
Yeah, he misses one spot.
He is doing it all over again too.
It is nice of you to kind look after him like this.
He doesn't have any real role models in his life.
Well, I am not a role model.
But you are a good man, Wally.
I wish our father would have been more like you.
Don't go calling me Wally.
No, I am serious.
He was really hard on us.
Really traditional... and really old school.
Well, I am old school.
yeah, but you an American.
What's that supposed to me?
You like him, don't you?
- Are you kidding?
He tried to steal my car.
And you spend time with him, teaching him how to fix things.
Saved him from a fucked cousin of ours...
- Hey, what you language lady.
And you're a good man
- I am not a good man.
Give me another beer, dragon lady.
This one is empty.
You know, Hmong consider gardening to be a woman's work.
Yeah, that probably why I see in the garden over there all the time.
Besides we ain't in Hu-Mong.
- Funny.
You know you should quit.
That's bad for you.
Yeah?
So it is being in a gang, dipshit.
Didn't you hear what I've just said?
I saw you coughed out blood.
You should quit.
What's that emblem supposed to mean anyway?
Your ancient camp scout emblem?
1'st cavalry.
I've had it since 1951.
So what you wanna do with you life kid.
I was thinking maybe sales.
So you wanna be in sales?
What about going to school, maybe.
But school costs money.
Maybe you should get a job.
You can't just sit there and spread mulch in my garden for the rest of your life.
Maybe you can just pay me.
Yeah, very funny.
What kind of job could I ever get?
- Yeah you're right, nobody would ever hire you.
Look I am just kidding zip...
I mean.
You can get a job.
You can get a job everywhere.
Like what?
How about construction?
- Me?
Yeah.
- Construction?
Yeah.
- Do you have Alzheimer?
s or something?
.
No, get a job in the construction.
I know people in the trades.
Of course I have to make a little adjustment and man you up a little bit.
Man me up?
- Yeah.
And I think you ought to date Miss Yum Yum too.
Do you little good.
Get carbon off the vaults.
Now you just gonna learn, how guys talk.
You just listen the way Martin and I banter back and forth.
You okay?
You are ready?
- Sure.
Let's go in.
Perfect.
A pollack and a chink.
How are you doing, Martin, you crazy Italian prick.
Walt, you cheap bastard, I should have known you?
d come in,
I was having such a pleasant day
- What did you do?
Jew some poor blind guy out of his money.
Giving him a wrong change?
- Who's the nip?
He is a pussy kid from next door.
I am just trying to man him up a little bit.
You see kid?
That's how guys talk to one another .
They do?
-Do you have shit in your ears?
Now go out and come back in and talk to him like a man.
Like a real man.
Come on.
Get your ass out of here.
Come on back now.
Sorry about this.
That's ok.
What's up you old Italian prick?
Get out of my shop before I blow your head off you goddamn dick smoker.
Jesus Christ.
Shit.
Take it easy.
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
That's what you said.
That what you said men say.
You don't just come in and insult a man in his own shop.
What happens if you meet some stranger?
If you get the wrong one he's gonna blow you gook head right off.
What should I've said then?
- Why don't you start with Hi or Hello.
Yeah just come in and say: 'Sir, I'd like a haircut if you have a time'
Yeah, be polite but don't kiss ass.
In fact you can talk about the construction job you just came from.
And bitch about your girl friend in your car.
Son of a bitch, I've just got breaks fixed and those sons of the bitches really nailed me.
They screwed right in the ass.
Yeah, don't swear at the guy.
Just talk about people who are not in the room.
You can bitch about your boss making you work overtime when it is bowling night.
Right, my old lady bitches for two goddamn hours about how..
they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store.
and the minute I turn on a fucking game she starts crying we never talk.
See now go out, come back and talk to him.
And it ain't a rocket science for Christ sake.
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car, or a girlfriend.
Jesus, I should have blown his head off when I had a chance.
Maybe so, I want you to turn around and go outside and come back and don't talk about having no job, no car, no girlfriend, no future, no dick.
Ok, just turn around and go.
Excuse me sir, I need a hair cut if you ain't too busy.
You old Italian son of a bitch prick barber.
Boy, does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job.
Fuck me.
All set to go through with this, right?
- Yeah, yeah.
Don't yeah, yeah me.
Just say:
Yes sir and I'll do my best.
Yes, I'll do my best.
- Cause when I vouch for somebody that means I am give them my word.
I don't want you making me look bad.
No I am good.
Totally into this.
Don't lay down either.
Just look em straight in the eye.
And a man can tell a lot by your handshake.
Here, put those in your back pocket.
- Cool.
Don't blow this.
Hey, Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon.
How the hell are you?
I am shitty.
But who's gonna listen?
- Not me, that's for sure.
Help yourself there, Walt.
You dumb pollack.
Ok this is the kid, I was telling you about.
Tao, this is Tim Kennedy, he is super on this job.
What we got here, Walt?
Well he knows construction and he is a smart kid.
He'll do anything you need him for.
You sure?
- Yeah.
You speak English?
- Yes, sir.
Were you born here?
- You bet.
I see that Walt drove you here.
You got a vehicle?
Not at the moment.
Taking a bus for now.
- Bus?
Jesus Christ.
You don't have a car?
My head gasket cracked and the goddamned pricks at the shop wants to bend me over for $2100
Oh please.
I just replaced the tranny in my Tahoe and the sons a bitches fucked me hard, just under $3200.
Goddamned thieves.
It ain?

Thanks, Mr. Kennedy.
That's Tim, and what's you name again?
- Tao.
T. .., okay.
You owe me one, Walt.
Well I'll buy a fruit cake for Christmas.
Fuck a fruit cake.
How about you just hand over the keys to that Gran Torino.
What the hell does everybody want my car?
- Yeah, I am not surprised.
Yeah, you don't know a half of it.
Alright, come on, zipper head.
Let the Mick stay here and play with himself.
What are we doing?
What do you want to do?
Carry you tools in a rice bag?
Here.
You can use one of these ... and you'll need one of this here.
I can't afford any of this.
I'll cover it.
You can pay me back with your first pay check.
Cool
- Here, we need something like that.
This is what I am looking for here, tool belt.
There you go.
Not to bitch.
But won't I be needing some tools.
Tools I've got but I am not going to lend you my tool belt.
You can pick up tools as you go.
I really appreciate all this.
- Forget it.
No, I really do Thank you.
What's up homeboy, what are you doing?
What up man?
- What you got, punk?
Checking up on my little cousin.
- Yeah, man.
My little cousin ...
What's this?
Where you come from man?
- I am coming
Home from work I know you guys don't know much about that.
So that's true, you got a job.
- You can't just leave me alone?
What?
He is scared, huh?
Who bought this shit for you?
Your dad?
- What you guys want with me?
Your dad bought this shit for you?
- Keep your hands off my stuff.
What's the fuck is that shit?

- Hey come on, this is my stuff.
You wanna smoke man?
Fuck it.

What's the phrase I am looking for?
Oh yeah, 'saving face'
Hey, there.
Hey.
I gotta run.
Haven't seen you for a few days.
Where you've been?
Been busy.
Busy, huh?
What the hell happened to you?
- Don't worry about it.
What do you mean don't worry about it.
Look at your goddamn face.
I said don't worry about it.
Okay, it's not your problem.
When?
Grabbed me a couple of days ago right after I go off work.
Cowards.
I did everything I can possibly do.
But they broke some of your tools.
I will replace them.
Don't worry about the tools.
Where is your cousin lives?
No, Walt.
I'll be ok.
I don't want you to do anything.
- Right,.
You could need extra tools, you just let me know.
Well, I could use a roofing hammer.
-Good, go in my garage and get it.
This should be the last stop.
Here is the deal.
You stay away from Tao, understand?
You tell your friends to stay away from Tao.
You want to fight with us than I could sound don't want to see him anymore.
That's it, got it?
I'll take that as yes.
Cause if I have to come back here it is gonna get fucking ugly.
Get off of my way.
How do you want your dog?
I mean steak?
Funny.
I told you we only eat cats.
I've never seen you like this before.
Well I am feeling good.
I god beautiful women, great food.
And Tao.
And even Tao isn't bugging me.
You are having a good time, I see.
-Yeah.
And it never ends.
What happened to your knuckles anyways?
I slipped in a shower.
No big problem.
Look Yum-Yum if he doesn't ask you out I will ask you out.
Wa Xam, don't listen to him.
He is a white devil.
Yeah, I am.
I am a white devil.
I've loved to Walt, but he beat you to it.
Really?
No kidding!
Dinner and a movie, or what?
Yeah, they are taking a bus.
No, you can't take a bus.
You gonna get you something more stylish that that.
Like what?
Take a limo?
How about that?
The Gran Torino?
- Yeah.
You'd let me take the Gran Torino.
- Yeah, I let you take the Gran Torino.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Is everybody all right?
Tao!
It's all right.
Where's grandma?
Where is Sue?
Where is Sue?
- She went to our aunts.
To her aunts?
Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Get on the phone and call her right now.
Sue ...
I knew, this was gonna happen.
What the hell am I doing here?
Maybe some of her friends called her and she changed her plans.
Yeah.
At the war we just all of us lost a lot of friends but you gotta stand for it.
You can care to it.
Mr. Kowalski?
Are you Ok?
Yeah, I am Ok.
Police finally left, no one is talking.
One thing about Hmong, they keep their mouths shut.
Yeah, I've noticed that.
You know, Tao and Sue will never gonna find peace in this world as long as those gangs around.
Until they go away.
You know forever.
What are you saying?
You know what I am saying.
I took Sue to the hospital.
She is scared.
They are all scared..
Yeah
Tao especially.
He?
s sitting out there right now staring at your front door.
You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.
What would you do?
What should Tao do?
I know what I would do if I was you.
Or at least what you think you should do.
- Really
If I was Tao I guess I'd wanted vengeance.
I'd wanted to stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys.
And you?
- What would I do?
I'd come over here and talk to you I guess.
I know you are close with these people, but this pisses me off too.
Mr.Kowalski.
Wanna beer?
- I'd love one.
There some in the chest, right over there behind you.
Damn all this.
It just isn't fair.
- Nothing is fair, father.
So what you gonna do, Mr. Kowalski?
Call me Walt.
All right.
What you gonna do, Walt?
I don't know.
But I'll think of something.
Whatever it is, they won't have a chance.
What are you doing?
Thinking.
Thinking.
Thinking time is over.
Now it's time to knock shit out of these pricks.
I know you don't want to hear this, but now it's the time to stay calm.
Calm?
You want me to be calm?
We stay calm or else mistakes will get made.
We have to step back from this thing.
No, don't let me down Walt.
Not you.
This is gonna end today.
Sit down.
I don't want to sit.
I said sit down.
Now, listen to me.
We gotta plan this and plan it very carefully.
Can't make any mistakes.
You know I am the right man for this job.
I want to go home and stay calm, and come back here at 4 this afternoon.
And this to be done will be done.
I say we go now, Right now.
And what?
Kill that cousin of yours and the rest of those zips.
Mr. Tough Guy is out for blood all of the sudden.
I know nothing about it.
Now go home.
You stay calm come back here at 4.
Ok?
Okay.
I know, I know.
Give me a break, please, it?
s the first time I?
ve ever smoked in the house.
Let a man enjoy himself,would you girl.
All finished. 10 dollars American.
I don?
t suppose your guinea hands are steady enough to do a straight shave?
- Straight shave?
You've never asked about straight shave ever.
I know but I always wondered about it.
That's unless you are too busy.
No, just let me heat up a towel.
Here is 20.
Keep the change.
It is just in case you hit my jugular.
Yes sir, It gonna take about one hour.
We gonna shorten these sleeves little bit.
Gonna fix at the shoulder.
I never had a suited suit before.
Yes sir, look very good.
Yes, sir.
Look very good.
What can I do for you, Mr. Kowalski?
- I am here for a confession.
Lord Jesus, what have you done?
- Nothing you just take it easy now.
What are you up to?
Are you gonna give a confession or not?
How long has it been since your last confession?
Forever.
Bless me father, for I have sinned.
What are your sins, my son?
In 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski at the factory Christmas party.
Dorothy was in the other room with the other wives.
it just happened.
Yes, go on.
Well, I made 900 dollars profit selling a boat and motor.
I didn't pay the taxes it is the same as stealing.
Yes, fine.
Lastly...
I was never very close with my two sons.
I don't know them.
I didn't know how.
That's it?
- That's it.
It's bothered me most of my life.
Say 10 "Hail Maries" and 5 "Our fathers".
God loves and forgives you and absolves you of all your sins.
In the name of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.
Thank you padre.
Are you going to retaliate for what happened to Sue.
I?
m going over to that house today, Mr. Kowalski.
Is that so?
- It is.
And every other day until you see the folly of what you are planning.
Busy day, gotta go.
- Go in peace.
Oh I am at peace.
Jesus Christ.
So which one is mine?
You ever fired a weapon before?
- No
Why don't you put that one down.
I got something more to show you.
What?
In 1952 we were sent to take out a chink machine gun nest.
They trod us up pretty good.
I was the only one who came back out there.
For that they gave me a silver star.
Here it is.
Here I want you to have it.
Why?
Because we all knew the danger that night.
But we went anyway.
That's the way it might be tonight.
There is always a chance you don't come back.
The hell we won?
t.
We?
re will roll in there and tear ass.
Yeah, that's foolish.
That's the exact reaction they are waiting for.
Come on and close this up.
How many?
- How many what?
How many men did you kill in Korea?
13, maybe more.
-What was it like to kill a man.
You don't want to know.
Now close it up.
Walt!
Walt!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Relax, you can't get out of there.
You let me out right now !
Let me out.
You fuck let me out, I'll fucking kill you.
Shut the fuck up!
You want to know what is like to kill a man?
Well, that's goddamn awful.
The only thing worse is get a medal of valor for killing some poor kids..
that wanted just to give up that's all
Yeah, some scared little gook just like you.
I shot them right in a face with that rifle you were holding in there a while ago.
So if the day goes by that I don't think about it.
You don't that on your soul.
I got blood on my hands.
I am soiled.
That's why I am going alone tonight.
Walt you take me with you right now, let me out.
Look, you've come a long way.
I am proud to say that you are my friend.
But you got your whole life ahead of you.
But me, I finished things.
That's what I do and I am going alone.
No, wait.
Walt!
Walt!
I need you to watch my dog.
Yeah I love you too.
Yeah, she is old too.
Her name is Daisy.
Hello.
- It is Walt.
The keys to my house are under the ceramic turtle on the from porch.
Let yourself in.
Your brother is in the basement.
I gotta go.
Sorry father, we have to go.
I am telling if we are not here there will be a bloodshed.
We've been here for hours.
We can't afford to anchor a unit down to one location.
I am bagging you to stay.
Just got a word from my sergeant, we're pulling the plug.
I am staying.
No you aren't.
We have specific orders you came with us, you are leaving with us.
Watch your head.
Sue, over here, over here.
Unlock this right now.
He left without me.
He went to Smokie without me.
Tao!
Any swamp rats in there.
I didn't know your ass would came.
-Shut up, gook.
I have nothing to say to you, shrimp dick, lizard like you.
Yeah, yeah.
You go ahead watch out for your boyfriend.
Cause it was either he or you or something who raped one of their own family.
You own blood, for Christ sake.
Now go ahead and pull those pistols, like miniature cowboys.
Go ahead.
So where's Tao at?
That pussy motherfucker not gonna come.
Don't worry about Tao.
Tao's got not one second for you.
Says who?
You?
What the fuck you gonna do, old man?
What are you gonna do?
You bitch.
-
Kind of jumpy, aren't we?
- Shut the fuck up.
You should the fuck up!
Got a light?
- What the fuck?
No
Me..
I've got a light...
'Hail Mary, full of grace..'
Yes, sergeant.
What happened?
- You need to step back.
He is a friend of mine.
- He said step back.
Hey, did you hear him.
Step back.
What happened?
- Hey, step back.
He is my friend.
Officer Chang!
get those people back.
- Hey, step back now, Ok.
Get the fuck out of here!
Walt Kowalski once said to me that I didn't know anything about life or death.
Because I was an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who held the hands of superstitious old women and promised they eternity.
Walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it.
But he was right.
I knew really nothing about life or death, until I got to know Walt.
And boy did I learn.
And I want to leave my house to the church becouse Dorothy would've liked it now which brings to out last item .
And again please excuse the language.
in Mr. Kowalski's will, I?
m simply reading it as it was written.
And I'd like to leave my 1972 Gran Torino to ... my friend ...
Tao Vang Lor.

.. sorry about Dorothy, Walt.
She was a real peach.
Thanks for coming, Al.
.. Holy Spirit.
Spectacles, testicles, wallet and watch.
Look at the Old Man glaring at Ashley.
He can't even tone it down for Mom's funeral?
What do you expect?
Dad's still living in the 50s.
He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly.
Yeah, well, your kid's wearing a Lion's jersey.
I'm sure Dad appreciates that.
The point I am trying to make is that there's nothing anyone can do that won't disappoint the Old Man.
It's inevitable.
That's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings.
You know, that deal with the boat motor, the broken bird bath,
It's always something.
What are we going to do with him?
Don't you think he'll get in trouble over there all by himself in the old neighborhood?
Why don't you have him move in with you?
Death is often a bittersweet occasion to us, Catholics.
Bitter in the pain.
Sweet, in the salvation.
Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased and their families.
Sweet to those of us, who know the salvation that awaits.
And some may ask, what is death?
Is it the end?
Or is it the beginning?
And what is life?
What is this thing we call life?
All these questions can frustrate you at times like this.
And that's why you have to turn to the Lord.
Jesus...
Because the Lord is the sweetness.
- Is that dad?
- No, that's grandpa Walt.
There is a platoon, E-Company, March 2, 1952.
- Korea?
- Where's Korea?
Well, people showed up after the service, huh?
Yeah, well, I suppose they heard there'd be a lot of ham.
I'll go down the basement and get some chairs.
- Oh, I can do that, Dad..
- No, we need them now not next week.
Cool, I found a medal.
Look at this.
How much longer do we have to stay?
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell and I'm bored.
Ashley, honey.
Why don't you help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?
- Me?
- Yes, you.
Grandpa Walt, would you like some help with these four chairs.
No, you probably just painted your nails.
Your dad is driving me crazy.
- Why did you guys even-
- It's okay, honey, we're leaving soon?
Come on, let's go.
How many swamp rats can get in one room?
Wow, Grandpa, when'd you get the vintage car?
1972.
I never knew you had a cool old car.
Yeah, it's been here since before you were born.
So, what are you going do with it when you..
like die?
Grr..
Then what about that super cool retro couch that you have in the den cause I was thinking, I'm going to State next year... and I think it would look really good in my dorm room.
And I don't have any furniture at all.
God.
- Who are you?
- Hi, I am Tao.
- What do you want?
I live next door.
Come on, get the shit out of your mouth.
I wa-
- Tell me what you want.
Do you have jumper cables?
My uncle's car is old and...
No, we don't any jumper cables.
And have some respect, zipper head, we're mourning here..
How you holding up, Walt?
Mr. Kowalski.
- Huh?
- Mr. Kowalski, that's my name.
Right, Mr. Kowalski.
Your wife and I became quite close these last few months.
She asked that I watch over you when she passed on.
I told her I watch over my entire flock.
But she made me promise I'd keep an extra sharp eye on you.
I appreciate your kindness you've shown to my wife.
Now that you've spoken your piece, why don't go and attend some of your other sheep?
Ok?
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her desire for you to go to confession.
She said she couldn't remember the last time you went.
- Is that so?
- It is.
Well, I confess that I never really cared for church very much.
The only reason I went was because of her.
And I confess that I have no desire to confess to a boy that is just out of the seminary.
- Bye, dear.
- G'bye, Walt.
Wish I could help, dad, but.. gotta get the kids home.
- Kids getting restless.
- Yeah, fine, just go.
I'll call in a few, see how you're doing.
All right.
Kill you to buy American.
Jeez...
Did you see the way he looked at the truck?
Jeez.
It's always Rice-Burner this or Jap-Burner that.
You know.
Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go.
Well, at least he didn't say anything this time.
He didn't need to.
Well, what do you expect, Mitch?
The man worked at a Ford plant for all those years.
I suppose that's my goddamned fault?
Just give it a rest and drive.
Ok?
Kids, do you want the radio on?
/ Yes.
You want to listen to some music?
Good.
Damn, barbarians.
Oh, Jesus...
Polaski would roll over in his grave if he could see his lawn now.
What the hell the chinks had to move in this neighborhood for?
Have you gone completely deaf or something?
Hi there, Walt.
I kind of not a friend of yours.
Why do you insist on calling me, Walt?
Sorry, Mr. Kowalski.
- What are you peddling today, padre?
- Nothing.
Thought I'd drop by and see how you are doing.
I haven't seen you in church in a while.
Okay.
Well, now that you've done your good deed, why don't you just take off down the road?
- I'd really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.
- Not in this lifetime, sonny.
Why?
Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
You don't want to know.
No, I do.
Well I think you're an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold hands of old ladies who are superstitious and promises them eternity.
Yo!
Hey!
Is you a boy or is you a girl, man, I can't tell.
Hey, Chicito.
If you was in pink, I would fuck you and your ass would be my bitch.
What ya reading, Jackass and the Rice Stalk?
That's right, you keep walking.
Look at me when I talk to you, hom.
Fucking slopes everywhere you look, man.
- Fucking pigs.
- Go back to your rice paddy.
Look at that, man.
- That's my little cousin, over there.
- You sure that's your cousin, man?
- Fuck yes, that's my little cousin.
- He tight with anybody?
- No, he is flying solo, man.
- Flying solo?
Let's go down and see what the fuck they're doing to him.
I love your jungles too.
Hey, they fucking with you?
They fucking with you?
Fuck you.

Tomorrow, I have to see your ass.
- Why you gotta be a little girl?
- Tomorrow!
Come let's go, man.
We've got a gun, man.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Let's get this strapped.
Pussy!
Hey, Tao.
Hey what's up?
What's up, Tao?
What are you doing little man?
Why are you doing woman's work?
What do you want?
What?
We can't just come and talk to my little cousin?
He doesn't want to talk to you.
- Well, I am here right.
- Hey, Spider, who dat?
- What's up?
- Spider?
Is that what he just called you, Fong?
- Spider?
- Is there something wrong with Spider?
What are you doing here?
Hey, so how old is you anyways?
- Mentally, I am way too old for you.
- What?
You are just stupid.
I am going inside.
Sue!
Help yor bra, do dis gardni.
Quiet, stupid.
Hey, you will roll with us man, come on?
- Dude, come on ride with us.
- C'mon, chill with us.
You need somebody to protect you, man.
That's what your big cousins are for.
Look, dawg.
I've been there, I've done it and I've seen it.
Back in a day everybody used to want to beat me up, dawg.
But now look, nobody want to fuck with me.
- Come on man, let's go.
- We are couz right?
- Come on.
- We are couz right?
We are family.
Look, a brother to Spider, is a brother to me, c'mon.
- Take this shit off, man, c'mon.
- Roll with us.
- That's a woman's work man.
- Come and get your hands dirty, man.
So what do I have to do?
Spider told me that old boy next door had a bad ass whip.
Come on.
- Nice.
- Ya, my little cousin being little man.
Yo, that's a nice car.
Hell, yeah, 1972 Gran Torino, Fastback.
- Cobra jet engine.
- Yo man it still in mint condition.
Yo man, it's in mint condition man.
I've got one.
A Mexican, a Jew and a colored guy go into a bar.
The bartender looks up and says:
"Get the fuck out of here!"
So, here's where my flock congregates when they're not in church..
- Hey, Father J.
- Hey, Mel.
Hey, Darrel.
- Hey, father.
- Hi, Walt.
What brings you in here, father.
Meat raffle?
No, I just came down to talk to Walt if that's ok.
Damn, padre.
You are persistent, aren't you?
I promised your wife.
All right, let's get a booze.
I'll have Pabst and a shot of Jack.
And whatever he's having.
I'll have a Diet Coke.
Bullshit.
This is a bar.
You have a drink.
- I'll have a gin and tonic.
- Attaboy!
So, what do you want?
I promised your wife I'd get you to go to confession.
- Now, why would you do that?
- She was very insistent.
She made me.
Well you're kinda fond of promising things you can't deliver on, right, father?
- Let's talk about something else.
- What?
Life and death.
Life and death.
What the hell do you know about life and death?
I'd like to think I know a lot.
I'm a priest..
Yeah, you get up and preach about life and death.
But all what you know is what you learned in a priest school.
Right out of the rookie Preacher's Handbook.
I don't know about that.
I think...
That is bittersweet.
Sort of bitter in its pain.
But sweet in its salvation.
That's what you know of life and death, and that's pathetic.
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?
I know a lot.
I lived there almost three years in Korea.
Thanks.
We shot men.
We stabbed them with bayonets, hacked 17-year-olds to death with shovels stuff I'll remember till the day I die.
Horrible things, but things I live with.
And what about life?
Well, I...
I survived the war.
got married... and had a family.
Sounds like you know more about death than you do living.
Maybe so, father.
Maybe so.
Son of a bitch.
- Hey, man, get in the car!
- Tao, what the fuck, get in!
- Come on Tao.
- Come, let's go,man, get in!
Fuck, man, get in!
Hello?
Hey, G'morning, Dad, it's your number one son, Mitch.
Morning?
It's after one in the afternoon.
It's not morning.
Oh, right.
Afternoon, then.
- So what do you want?
- What?
No, nothing.
I mean, what would I want?
Well, I don't know.
Your wife has already gone through all of your mother's jewelry.
No, dad.
I'm just calling to see how you are doing.
Well, anything new with the old neighborhood?
- Ye...
No.
- Great.
Smooth sailing then.
- Yeah.
- Ok, good, good, then.
- Oh, hey, Dad.
- Yeah.
You wouldn't happen to still know that guy from the plant that has Lion season tickets?
Are you f-
Dad-?
Ain't she sweet?
Come on.
Hey, what's up?
- What is you doin' out here, man?
- Nothing.
- Minding our own business.
- Just hanging out.
What are you guys doing here?
What?
Can I just come here to hang with my little cousin?
- We have a good news for you, man.
- Really, and what's that?
- Only for guy talk.
- I don't think so.
Why not?
C'mon, man, we're gonna give you another shot, man.
C'mon.
- Don't go, Tao.
- Mind your own business, girl.
- Come on, let's go
- Come.
What the hell is this?
Get up.
Get off my lawn.
Listen old man, you don't want to fuck with me.
Did you hear me?
I said get off my lawn, now.
Are you fucking crazy?
Go back in the house.
Yeah, I'll blow the hole in your face and then I'll go in the house.
And I'll sleep like a baby.
You can count on that.
We used to stack fucks like you 5 feet high in Korea used you for sandbags.
Ok.
You better watch your back...
He's crazy.
Thank you.
Get off my lawn.
What the hell is this?
No, no, no, no, no.
C'mon, no more.
No more, no more.
Stay right there.
Stay right there.
Why can't you people just leave me alone?
We brought you some chives to plant in the garden.
I don't want them.
They're perennials, they come back every year.
Look, why are bringing me all this garbage anyway.
Because...
Because you saved Tao.
I didn't save anybody.
I just..
I kept a bunch of jabbering gooks off of my lawn.
- Well, you're a hero to the neighborhood.
I am not a hero.
Too bad, they think you are and that's why they keep bringing you the gifts.
- Please take them.
- Well, they're wrong.
- I just want to be left alone, thank you.
Wait!
This is my mom, Vu, I'm Sue and that's my brother, Tao.
- We live next door.
- So?
Tao wants to say something.
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?
For trying to steal your car.
Let me tell you something boy.
You step on this property again, you're done.
Good afternoon, Walt.
I told you I'm not going to confession.
Why didn't you just call the police?
What?
I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I heard there was some trouble in the neighborhood.
Why didn't call the police?
Well...
You know why, I've prayed that they would show up, but...
- ... nobody answered.
- What were you thinking?
Someone could've been killed.
We're talking life and death here.
When things go wrong, you gotta act quickly.
When we were in Korea and a 1000 screaming gooks came across our land we didn't call the police.
We reacted.
We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski.
I've been thinking about our conversation on life and death.
About what you said.
About how you carry around all the horrible things you were forced to do.
Horrible things that won't leave you.
It seems that it would do you good to unload some of that burden.
Things done during war are terrible.
Being ordered to kill killing to save yourself, killing to save others.
You're right, those are things I know nothing about.
But I do know about forgiveness.
And I've seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins admitted their guilt and left their burdens behind them.
Stronger men than you!
Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things and are now at peace.
Well I got to hand it to you, padre, you came here with your guns loaded this time.
- Thank you!
- And you're right about one thing.
About stronger men than me, reaching their salvation.
Well, Hallefuckinlujah.
But you are wrong about something else.
What's that, Mr. Kowalski?
The thing that haunts a man the most is what he isn't ordered to do.
There, finally, you look like a human being again.
You shouldn't wait so long between haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch.
Well, I'm surprised you're still around.
I was always hoping that you die off and they get somebody in here they knew what the hell they were doing.
Instead you just keep hanging around, like the do-up dago you are.
- That'll be ten bucks, Walt.
- Ten bucks, Jesus Christ, Martin.
What are you half-Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices all the time.
It's been ten bucks for the last five years... and you hard-nosed, Pollack son of a bitch.
- Keep the change.
- See you in 3 weeks, prick.
Not if I see you first, dipshit.
Sounds like it'll go down hill after that.
- Yeah.
- So, that's like-
That's cool, you know.
Man, look at this.
Check this out.
Bring your tight ass over here.
Come here, girl.
Don't be shy.
You can't say hi?
Or are you acting like stuck-up and shit.
- What's you supposed to be, man?
- Yo, it's cool dawg.
The fuck are you doing in my neighborhood, boy?
None, Just going to the corner spot, you know,get some CDs, sound good, bro?
- He called, you bro!
- C'mon, sound good, bro?
- Sound good.
- Shut the fuck up.
Call me bro again, and I'll bite your motherfucking face off.
Yeah, motherfucker.
Now what the fuck yo come down here for?
You here to bring me this little present?
- Oriental yummy?
- Don't worry, I'm gonna take a real good care with her.
- Fuck outta here.
- Fuck outta here, man!
Oh shit, you have a bitch with you.
Keep your ass right here.
Oh great.
Another asshole who has a fetish for Asian girls.
God, it gets so old.
Oh, shit, what's your name girl?
My name?
Get your ass out of here, okay.
It's 'take your crude, overly obvious come-on to every woman who walks past and cram it.'
That's my name.
Who do you think you are talking to?
Who does it look like?
You think you're real funny, don't you?
- Man, she's tough.
- What?
You gonna hit me now?
That'd pretty much complete the picture.
You need to keep your bitch on a leash.
Put a choke chain on her and yank that motherfucker.
Of course, right to the stereotype thesaurus.
Oh yeah.
Call me a whore and a bitch in the same sentence.
Bitch is crazy.
- I like her like that.
- Now take that bitch.
Oh, shit, you don't know when to quit, do you, girl?
Let me teach your ass a lesson.
That's what you need.
Stop!
Let me go!
Take your ass over there.
What the fuck are you looking at, old man?
What the hell are you spooks up to?
Spooks?
You'd better get your ass on honkey, while I still let you.
That's what you'd better do.
Da fuck he think he eh?
Have you noticed how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't have fucked with?
That's me.
You fucking crazy, get outta here, man.
Why don't ya get your ass outta here befor I kick yo wrinkly white ass.
Crazy, mothafucka, what's wrong with him, man?
What da fuck?
- Motherfucker's crazy!
- What is this thing?
What the hell?
Get in the truck.
- Crazy motherfucker.
- What's wrong with him, man.
Oh!
Shit!
- Hey, pops c'mon now.
- Shut your fucking face!
You fucking don't listen, do you?
- Now get in the truck.
- Go get in a truck girl.
- Way to go, man!
- Shut up pussy.
What is this 'bro' shit anyway?
You want to be superb page, or something?
These guy don't want to be your bro and I don't blame them.
Now get your old faint paddy ass on down the road.
Take care now.
You too.
Oh, yeah.
Why ya'll fuckin' do nothing?
Man you fucking!
Shit man.
If he had cannon at your fucking face, you would do nothing.
What's the matter with you, for Christ sake?
Trying to get yourself killed?
I thought you Asian girls were supposed to be smart.
Hanging around in the neighborhood like that is the fast way to get you in the obituaries.
I know, I know.
Take it easy.
And what about that goofball guy you were with.
Is that a date or something?
- Yeah, kind of.
His name is Trey.
- You shouldn't be hanging out with him.
You should be hanging out with your own people.
The other Hummongs.
You mean, Hmong?
- Hmong, not Hummong
- Whatever.
What the hell is Humong, I mean Mong anyway?
Wow, you so enlightened you know that?
No, Hmong is not a place, it is a people.
My people come from different parts of Laos, Thailand, and China.
Well how did you end up in my neighborhood?
Why didn't you stay there?
It's Vietnam thing.
We fought on your side.
And when Americans quit the communists started killing all the Hmong.
So we came over here.
Yeah, well I don't know how you ended up in the Midwest.
Snow on the ground six months out of the year.
What is it?
Jungle people wanted to be on a great frozen tundra?
Hill people.
We are hill people.
Not jungle people.
BOO-ga, BOO-ga, BOO-ga!
Yeah, whatever...
Blame the Lutherans.
They brought us over here.
Everybody blames the Lutherans.
Well, you'd think the cold will keep all the idiots out.
Thanks for the ride.
You know something kid, you are all right.
But what about that dimwit brother of yours?
He little slow or something?
Tao is actually really smart.
He just doesn't know which direction to go in.
- Yeah, poor toad.
- It's really common.
Hmong girls over here fit in better.
The girls go to college and the boys go to jail.
That old hag hates my ass.
Your birthday today, Daisy.
This year you have to make a choice between two life paths.
Second chances come your way.
Extraordinary events culminate in what might seem to be an anticlimax.
You lucky numbers are:
84, 23, 11, 78, and 99.
What a load of shit.
Yea.
What the hell is it with kids nowadays?
All right.
- Let me help you with those.
- Oh, thank you.
How about that?
How about that, Daisy?
- That's too heavy for a bag.
- No problem. / Thank you.
- Good, Karen, give it to him.
- Here you go.
- Well, what is it?
- It's a gopher.
So you can reach stuff.
It makes things a lot of easier.
This is from me.
It's a phone.
Oh, I can see that.
I just thought... well, we thought that it would make things easier.
Thank you, Karen.
There's nothing wrong with making things less hard on yourself.
You know Karen's right, Dad.
You've worked hard your whole life.
Maybe it's time you started thinking about taking it easier?
And some other thing, Dad.
You really should get rid of the coffin nails.
But, da..
we were thinking about the house.
You know, well, with Mom gone, it's got to be a lot to maintain around here.
Let alone clean.
And you are here all alone...
Yeah, you know, there are these great places now, you know, these communities where you don't have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow.
You know, people are like you, active and alert, but are alone.
And would benefit from being around folks their own age.
Yeah, Dad, look.
You got to check it out.
We brought some brochures.
These places are nothing like that you think they would be.
They are great.
No, they are beautiful.
They are really nice They really are.
These are top-notch like resorts.
- It is like staying in a hotel, practically.
They're beautiful.
- They really are.
- Yeah.
They care of everything.
They clean up.
They're really nice.
Oh, there are wonderful stores, you can buy new shoes.
They are amazing, they really are.
You have a good time, play some golf maybe.
Meet other people.
Son of a bitch.
Kicking us out on his birthday.
I told you that this was a bad idea.
- I know, you were right
- He won't let anybody help him.
Well, we tried.
Can we just drop it?
No one can say we didn't try.
What the hell with him, you know what we should've done.
We should've stayed home with Josh and Ashley.
At least they were smart enough not come.
The goddamn kids have more sense than we do.
Ah, we miss mama, don't we, Daisy?
Hey, Walt.
What are you up to?
We're having a barbecue.
You want to come over?
- What do you think?
- There's tons of fooood.
- Just keep your hands off my dog.
- No worries.
We only eat cats.
- Really?
- No, I'm kidding, you moron.
- C'mon, you can be my special guest.
- No, I am fine right here.
Yeah...
Son of a bitch.
- Okay, so, what have you had to eat today?
I had a piece of cake.
Little beef jerky.
Come on over and get something to eat.
We've got beer too.
Well...
I might as well drink with strangers, better than drinking alone.
After all, it is my birthday.
- Really.
Happy birthday, Wally
- Don't call me Wally.
- You have no pets, but plenty of beer.
- As they say, "when in Hmong."
What am I doing wrong?
Every time I look at somebody they always look at the ground.
You're fine.
- What is she saying?
- She said welcome to our home.
- Oh no, she is not.
- No, she didn't.
She hates me.
Yeah, she hates you.
Okay.
What?
!
What are all you fish heads looking at anyway?
I think we should go into the other room.
Sorry.
All the people in this house are very traditional.
Number 1.
Never touch a Hmong person on their head.
Not even a child.
Hmong people believe that the soul resides on the head.
- So, don't do that.
- Sounds dumb, but fine.
And a lot of Hmong people consider looking at someone in their eye to be very rude.
That's why they look away, when you look at them.
Anything else?
Yeah, some Hmong people tend to smile or grin when they're yelled at.
It's a cultural thing.
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity, it's not that they're laughing at you or anything.
You people are nuts.
But the food..
- It looks good, smells good too.
- Of course, it's Hmong food.
Okay, and then can I come back for seconds?
Here you go.
Thanks.
You know, you mentioned about looking at people, he's been staring at me the whole evening.
That's Kor Khue.
He is the Lor family shaman.
And what's that?
Some sort of witch doctor or something.
Something like that.
- Boo-ga boo.
- Ah, ha, you're funny, Wally.
Kor Khue's interested in you.
He heard what you did.
He would like to read you.
It would be rude not allow him this.
It's a great honor.
- Yeah sure, fine by me.
- All right, take a seat.
He says people do not respect you.
They don't even want to look at you.
He says the way you live, your food has no flavor.
You wearied by your life.
You made a mistake in your past life, like a mistake that you did you are not satisfied with.
He says you have no happiness in your life.
It's like you are not at peace.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I am fine.
Fine, I am fine.
God, I've got more in common with these gooks than I do with my own spoiled-rotten family.
Jesus Christ...
Happy birthday.
Are you ok?
Yeah, yeah, I am fine.
- You were bleeding.
- No, I bit my tongue.
It's nothing.
Why don't we go down and get some of that good gook food.
I am starving.
Okay.
You ladies are wonderful.
That stuff is really good.
- C'mon you glutton!
- What's up?
- Let's go.
- What for?
- To mingle.
- We can mingle right here.
C'mon, you told me not to leave you alone.
Thank you very much, but I have to..
I have to go now.
I'll be back.
Don't let me go away.
Well, well, well, look who's over there?
Yeah, the kid who steal my Gran Torino.
- My brother Tao.
- Tried to anyway, yeah, toad.
It was wobby a bit.
But it should fix it.
What's this?
Little rice liquor.
Here, try it.
All right.
My friends and I were just wondering what you're doing here?
That's a good question.
What am I doing here?
- My name is Walt.
- Hey, Walt.
I am Youa.
- Yu yang?
- No, Youa.
- Youa, ok.
- So what do you do?
- I fix things.
Stuff like that.
- Like what?
I've just fixed that dryer there.
I fixed my wife's friend's sink.
I took old aunt Merry to doctor to get a prescription.
Fixed up.
I've even the fixed the door, that had't even broken yet.
You're funny.
I've been called a lot of things, but never funny.
- Well, I'll take off.
Enjoy yourself.
- Okay, Yum Yao.
Pleasure.
Come on.
Relax, zipper head.
I am not gonna shoot you.
I'd look down too if I was you.
You know, I knew you were a dipshit the first time I ever saw you.
But I never thought you're worse with women than you are with stealing cars, Toad.
- It's Tao.
- What?
It's not toad, it's Tao.
My name is Tao.
You were blowing it with that girl who was there.
Not that I'd give two shits about a Toad like you.
You don't what you are talking about.
You're wrong egg roll.
I know exactly what I'm talking about.
I may not be the most pleasant person to be around.
But I got the best woman who was ever on this planet to marry me.
I worked at it.
That was the best thing that ever happened to me.
Hands down.
But you... you know...
You let Click Clack, Ding Dong and Charlie Chan just walk out..
...with Miss what's-her-face.
She likes you, you know, though I don't know why.
Who?
Yum yum!
You know that girl in the purple sweater.
She's been looking at you all day, stupid.
- You mean, Youa?
- Yeah, Yum Yum.
Yeah.
Nice girl, very charming girl.
I talked with her.
But, you, you let her just walk right out with three stooges.
And you know why?
Cause you are big, fat pussy.
Well...
I gotta go.
Good day.
Pussy cake.
No, no more.
Okay, put them over there.
No.
No.
No more No more.
C'mon.
No more.
No more, please...
Is that chicken dumpling thing you brought before?
All right.
Better than beef jerky all the time.
What's going on?
- What's going on?
- Tao is here to make amends.
- He is here to work for you.
- No, he isn't.
He's not gonna work for me.
My mom said he dishonored the family.
And now he has to work off his debt.
- He starts tomorrow morning.
- Oh not tomorrow, not any time.
I don't even want him on my property I thought we went over all that.
It is very important to my mom that you accept and that would be an insult if you refuse.
Why is it being put back on me, all of sudden?
He's the one who tried to steal my car.
All of the sudden, I'm the bad guy in this thing.
Look, my family is very traditional and would be very much upset if you don't let Tao repay.
If he doesn't want to do it, then let's just go.
Shut up!
Yeah, shut up.
All right, tomorrow, c'mon, tomorrow.
Thank you.
Jesus, Joseph, and Mary.
These Hmong broads are like badgers.
Son of a bitch.
I never thought he'd show.
All right, what are you good at?
- Like what?
- That's what I am asking.
You gonna work for me, I gotta know what you are good at.
- I gotta know what you can do.
- I don't know.
That's kind of half way what I expected you to say.
See that tree right there?
You just go over there and count the birds.
- You want me to count the birds?
- Yeah, you can count?
All you slopes are supposed to be good at math, right?
- Yeah, I can count.
- Good.
One, two...
So, what do you have for me to do?
You want me to watch paint dry or maybe count the clouds that pass by?
Don't get flip with me, boy.
I am not the one who tried to steal, don't you forget that.
Go ahead.
I don't care if you insult me and say racist things.
- Cause you know what?
I'll take it.
- Of course, you'll take it.
Cause you have no teeth, you have no balls, kid.
Look, I'm stuck here.
Why don't you find something useful for me to do.
Unlike you, I am not useless.
And I maintain my own property.
These swamp rats, on the other hand, you just can't help it.
How long do I have you for?
Toad, how long?
'till next Friday.
All right.
Go get that ladder out of the garage.
When you get finished with that roof there.
You can take that gutter, and nail it back up.
I am tired looking at it for the last three years.
Yeah, you said it, brother.
Hello.
Grandpa says he want to know if you can have Tao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch?
Wasp nest?
That's terrible.
I think we can handle that after lunch.
Jesus, Lord All Mighty, knock it off!
Hey, it's my last day.
What else do you have for me to do?
Take the day-off.
You did enough.
Toad!
Nothing.
Nevermind.
Kawski?
Kawski?
Koski?
Mr. Kowalski?
Good morning.
I looked over your paperwork and I think we should immediately start a full battery of tests.
I feel that this would be the best way to go about checking out all the issues that you've had.
Excuse me, what happened to Dr. Fellman, my regular doctor?
Dr. Fellmon retired three years ago.
I am his replacement, Dr. Chu.
- It's grandpa Walt.
- Pick it up.
You talk to him!
Mitch.
- I'm doing bills here.
- You talk to him, he's your father.
Hey, Dad.
Hi, Mitch.
It's me your dad.
Yeah, I know.
What's up?
Oh, nothing, nothing much really.
How is everything going?
I am fine, fine, doing fine.
How about Karen and the kids?
Fine, everybody is great.
Doing fine.
Good.
How about work?
Busy.
Yeah..
I suppose...
In fact, um, speaking of busy, I got a lot on my plate right now so if it is not something pressing.
No, no, not at all.
So, why don't you call me this weekend?
Sure.
Ok, it was nice talking to you, dad.
Thanks for calling.
Thanks.
This kid doesn't have a chance.
What do you know about faucets?
I know a lot about them, boy.
Tend to side.
- Jesus.
For the love of Pete.
- What?
It must be a 100 degrees here.
Just, turn on the fan.
This place is falling apart.
Where did you get all the stuff?
- What are you talking about?
- All the tools and stuff.
Well, may come as surprise to a thief but I bought this stuff.
Everything in here with my own money.
Yeah, yeah, this is not what I meant.
I mean this is so much shit packed in here.
Yeah, well.
Every tool in here has a purpose.
Everything has a job to do.
- They are all used when necessary.
- Okay, so, what's that?
- That's a post hole digger.
- That.
Vice-grips.
Wire cutters, you know that's a trowel.
C'mon.
There is shears right there, and that's a saw.
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me kid.
All right, what's on your mind.
It's just..
I can't afford to buy all this stuff.
Well, I guess, even a bonehead like you, could understand that a man acquires these over a period of 50 years.
- Yeah, but...
- All right, look, here.
These three items right here, you can have these.
WD-40, vice grips, and some duck tape.
Any man worth his salt, can do half of the house chores with just those three things.
Anything else you need you just borrow it, that's all.
Ok, cool.
- Fuck me.
- What's with that?
Nothing.
What?
Nothing, huh?
I just saw you've coughed out blood.
That's not good.
You should really see a doctor.
Look..
Those guys over here, the other night... on my lawn, what a bout them?
- Just a gang.
Bunch of Hmong gang bangers.
I assume that.
What they were doing here?
They were going to take me away.
They were kind of pissed, that I blew my first initiation.
Yeah, well you are, you are a pussy.
You wanna hang out with guys like that.
What was your initiation supposed to be?
My Gran Torino?
Christ, old Friday.
Shit!
Toad, you got a minute?
Here it is.
Here is the deal.
I take the top, cause that's the heaviest.
I'll pull on that.
And you stand right back here, and you push.
And help me push it up each step.
- Just like that.
- Then, let me take the top.
No, no, I've got a top.
No, I'll take the top.
It looks pretty heavy.
Look, I'm not crippled.
I've got the top.
If you don't let me take the top.
I ain't helping.
I'm gonna go back home.
- Listen to me, zipper head.
- No, you listen, old man!
I am here because you need help.
So it's either top or I'm out of here.
All right, you take the top and I'll push.
Don't let it slip off you little girl hands and crush me.
Don't give me any ideas now.
That thing weighs a ton.
Runs like a clock, though.
They don't make them like this anymore.
- So what are you going to do with it?
- Sell it I guess.
- How much?
- 60 bucks.
I am tired of having this sit around down in the basement there.
Why?
You are looking for a freezer?
- Our downstairs one kind of died.
- Okay, 25 bucks and it's yours.
25?
But you just said 60.
I know, it will save me money putting an ad in the paper.
Come on, let wheel it over to your place.
- Kind of ironic, huh?
- What?
Toad washing a car they tried to steal from you.
Yeah, he misses one spot, he's doing it all over again too.
It's nice of you to kind look after him like this.
He doesn't have any real role models in his life.
- Well, I am not any role model.
- But you're a good man, Wally.
I wish our father would've been more like you.
Don't go calling me Wally.
No, I am serious.
He was really hard on us.
Really traditional...
- ... and really old school.
- Well, I am old school.
Yeah, but you're an American.
What's that supposed to mean?
- You like him, don't you?
- Are you kidding?
He tried to steal my car.
And you spend time with him, teaching him how to fix things.
Saved him from that fucked cousin of ours...
Hey, watch your language, lady.
And you're a good man
I am not a good man.
Get me another beer, dragon lady.
This one's empty.
You know, Hmong consider gardening to be a woman's work.
Yeah, that probably why I see you in the garden over there all the time.
- Besides we ain't in Hu-Mong.
- Funny.
You know you should quit.
That's bad for you.
Yeah?
So it is being in a gang, dipshit.
Didn't you hear what I just said?
I saw you cough out blood.
You should quit.
What's that emblem supposed to mean anyway?
Your ancient cub scout emblem?
1st cavalry.
I've had it since 51.
So what you wanna do with you life kid?
I was thinking about, maybe sales.
Sales, eh?
My oldest son is in sales.
Does he do well?
Oh, yeah.
License to steal.
I worked in a Ford factory for 50 years.
And he's out selling Japanese cars.
You made cars?
Yeah.
I put the steering column in this Gran Torino in 1972, right on the line.
You are old.
So cool.
So you wanna be in sales?
Thinking about going to school, maybe.
- Kinda, but school cost money.
- Maybe you should get a job.
Can't just sit there and spread mulch in my garden for the rest of your life.
Well, maybe you can just pay me.
Yeah, very funny.
What kind of job could I ever get?
Yeah you're right, nobody would ever hire you.
Look, I am just kidding zip...
I mean.
You can get a job.
You can get a job anywhere.
Like what?
- How about construction?
- Me?
- Yeah.
- Construction?
- Yeah.
- Do you have Alzheimer's or something?
.
No, get a job in the construction.
I know people in the trades.
Of course, I have to make a little adjustment and man you up a little bit.
- Man me up?
- Yeah.
And I think you ought to date Miss Yum Yum too.
Do you little good.
Get carbon off the valves.
Now you're just gonna learn how guys talk.
You just listen the way Martin and I batter it back and forth.
- You okay?
You ready?
- Sure.
- All right.
Let's go in.
Perfect.
A pollack and a chink.
How are you doing, Martin, you crazy Italian prick.
Walt, you cheap bastard, I should have known you'd come in...
- ...
I was having such a pleasant day.
- What did you do?
Jew some poor blind guy out of his money.
- Give him a wrong change?
- Who's the nip?
He's the pussy kid from next door,
I am just trying to man him up a little bit.
You see kid?
That's how guys talk to one another.
- They do?
- Why, do you have shit in your ears?
Now go out and come back in and talk to him like a man.
Like a real man.
Come on.
Get your ass out of here.
Come on back now.
Sorry about this.
That's ok.
What's up you old Italian prick?
Get out of my shop before I blow your head off you goddamn dick smoker.
Go!
Jesus Christ.
Oh, shit.
Take it easy.
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
That's what you said.
That what you said men say.
You don't just come in and insult the man in his own shop.
You just don't do that.
What happens if you meet some stranger?
If you get the wrong one he's gonna blow your gook head right off.
- What should I've said then?
- Why don't you start with Hi or Hello.
Yeah just come in and say: 'Sir, I'd like a haircut if you have the time.'
Yeah, be polite but don't kiss ass.
In fact, you can talk about the construction job you just came from.
And bitch about your girl friend in your car.
Son of a bitch, I just got my breaks fixed and those sons of the bitches really nailed me.
They screwed right in the ass.
Yeah, don't swear at the guy.
Just talk about people who are not in the room.
You can bitch about your boss making you work overtime when it is bowling night.
Right, my old lady bitches for two goddamn hours about how they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store.
And the minute I turn on a fucking game, she starts crying how we never talk.
See, now, go out, come back and talk to him.
And it ain't a rocket science for Christ sake.
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car, or a girlfriend.
Jesus, I should have blown his head off when I had a chance.
Maybe so, I want you to turn around and go outside and come back and don't talk about having no job, no car, no girlfriend, no future, no dick.
Ok, just turn around and go.
Excuse me, sir, I need a haircut if you ain't too busy.
You old Italian son of a bitch prick barber.
Boy, does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job.
Fuck me.
All set to go through with this, right?
Yeah, yeah.
Don't yeah, yeah me.
Just say, "Yes sir and I'll do my best."
- Yes, I'll do my best.
- Cause when I vouch for somebody, that means I am give them my word.
I don't want you making me look bad.
No I am good.
Totally into this.
Don't lay down either.
Just look em straight in the eye.
And a man can tell a lot by your handshake.
- Here, put those in your back pocket.
- Cool.
Don't blow this.
Hey, Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon.
How the hell are you?
- I am shitty.
But who's gonna listen?
- Not me, that's for sure.
Help yourself there, Walt.
You dumb pollack.
Ok this is the kid, I was telling you about.
Tao, this is Tim Kennedy, he is super on this job.
What do we got here, Walt?
Well he knows construction and he's a smart kid.
He'll do anything you need him for.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
- You speak English?
- Yes, sir.
- Were you born here?
- You bet.
I see that Walt drove you here.
You got a vehicle?
Not at the moment.
Taking the bus for now.
Bus?
Jesus Christ.
You don't have a car?
My head gasket cracked and the goddamned pricks at the shop wants to bend me over for $2100.
Oh, please.
I just replaced the tranny in my Tahoe and the sons of bitches fucked me hard, just under $3,200.
- Goddamned thieves.
It ain't right.
- You got that right.
Okay, come on in on Monday and we'll find something for you to do.
Thanks, Mr. Kennedy.
- It's Tim, and what's your name again?
- Tao.
T..., okay.
You owe me one, Walt.
Yeah, well I'll buy a fruit cake for Christmas.
Oh, fuck the fruit cake.
How about you just hand over them keys to that Gran Torino.
Why the hell does everybody want my car?
Well, I'm not surprised.
Yeah, you don't know the half of it.
All right, come on, zipper head.
Let Mick stay here and play with himself.
What are we doing?
What do you want to do?
Carry your tools in a rice bag?
Here we go.
You can use one of these, and you'll need one of these here.
I can't afford any of this.
I'll cover it.
You can pay me back on your first pay check.
- Cool.
- Here, you'll need something like that.
This is what I am looking for here, tool belt.
There you go.
Not to bitch.
But won't I be needing some tools.
Tools I've got but I'm not going to lend you my tool belt.
You can pick up tools as you go.
- I really appreciate all this.
- Forget it.
No, I really do.
Thank you.
What's up homeboy?
What ya doing?
What up man?
What you got, punk?
- Just checking up on my little cousin.
- Yeah, man.
My little cousin...
what's this?
- Where you coming from, man?
- I am coming- ...home from work.. not that you guys would know much about that.
- So it's true, you got a job.
- You can't just leave me alone?
What?
Hey, check this out.
He is scared, huh?
- Who bought this shit for you?
Your dad?
What you guys want with me?
- Your dad bought this shit for you?
- Keep your hands off my stuff.
What fuck is that shit?
Why the fuck you gotta make me look bad, huh?
Keep your hands off my stuff!
This massive my job man.
- Give me that, that.
- Hey come on, that's my stuff.
You wanna smoke man?
Fuck it.
Let me go.
Give me that, man.
Give me that.
What's the phrase I am looking for?
Oh yeah, 'saving face.'
Hey, there.
Hey.
I gotta run.
Haven't seen you for a few days.
Where you've been?
Been busy.
Busy, huh?
- What the hell happened to you?
- Don't worry about it.
What do you mean don't worry about it.
Look at your goddamn face.
I said don't worry about it.
Okay, it's not your problem.
When?
Grabbed me a couple of days ago right after I got off work.
Cowards.
I did everything I can possibly do.
But they broke some of your tools.
- I will replace them.
- Don't worry about the tools.
Where does your cousin live?
No, Walt.
I'll be ok.
- I don't want you to do anything.
- All right.
If you need extra tools, you just let me know.
- Well, I could use a roofing hammer.
- Good, go in my garage and get it.
This should be the last stop.
All right, here is the deal.
You stay away from Tao, understand?
You tell your friends to stay away from Tao.
If they don't listen to you, you tell him you don't want to see him anymore.
That's it, got it?
I'll take that as yes, because if I have to come back here it is gonna get fucking ugly.
Get out of my way.
How do you want your dog?
I mean steak?
- Funny.
- I told you we only eat cats.
I've never seen you like this before.
Well I am feeling good.
I got beautiful women, great food.
- And Tao.
- And even Tao isn't bugging me.
- You are having a good time, I see.
- Yeah.
And it never ends.
What happened to your knuckles anyways?
I slipped in the shower.
No big problem.
Look, now, Yum-Yum if he doesn't ask you out, I'm gonna ask you out.
Youa, don't listen to him.
He's the white devil.
Yeah, I am.
I am the white devil.
I'd loved to, Walt, but he beat you to it.
Really?
No kidding!
Dinner and a movie, or what?
Yeah, they're taking the bus.
No, you can't take the bus.
We gotta get you something more stylish that that.
Like what?
Take a limo?
How about that?
- The Gran Torino?
- Yeah.
You'd let me take the Gran Torino.
Yeah, I'd let you take the Gran Torino.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Is everybody all right?
Tao!
It's all right.
Where's grandma?
Where is Sue?
- Where is Sue?
- She went to our aunt's.
- To her aunts?
Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Get on the phone and call her right now.
Sue...
I knew, this was gonna happen.
What the hell am I doing here?
Maybe some of her friends called her and she changed her plans.
Yeah.
At the war we just lost a lot of friends but you're getting stab for it.
You kill to it.
Mr. Kowalski?
Are you ok?
Yeah, I am ok.
Police finally left, no one is talking.
One thing about Hmong, they keep their mouths shut.
Yeah, I've noticed that.
You know, Tao and Sue will never gonna find peace in this world as long as those gangs are around.
Until they go away.
You know, forever.
What are you saying?
You know what I am saying.
I took Sue to the hospital.
She's scared.
- They're all scared..
- Yeah
Tao especially.
He's sitting out there right now staring at your front door.
You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.
What would you do?
- What should Tao do?
- I know what I would do if I was you.
- Or at least what you think you should do.
Really.
If I was Tao, I guess I'd want vengeance.
I'd wanna to stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys.
- And you?
- What would I do?
I'd come over here and talk to you I guess.
I know you're close with these people, but this pisses me off too, Mr. Kowalski.
- Wanna beer?
- I'd love one.
There some in the chest, right over there behind you.
Damn all this.
- Just isn't fair.
- Nothing is fair, father.
So what you gonna do, Mr. Kowalski?
Call me Walt.
All right.
What are you gonna do, Walt?
I don't know.
But I'll think of something.
Whatever it is, they won't have a chance.
What are you doing?
Thinking.
Thinking.
Thinking time is over.
Now it's time to knock shit out of those pricks.
I know you don't want to hear this, but now it's time to stay calm.
Calm?
You want me to be calm?
We stay calm or else mistakes get made.
We have to step back from this thing.
No, don't let me down Walt.
Not you.
This is gonna end today.
Sit down.
- I don't want to sit.
- I said sit down.
Now, listen to me.
We gotta plan this and plan it very carefully.
Can't make any mistakes.
You know I'm the right man for this job.
I want to go home and stay calm, and come back here at 4 this afternoon.
- And what needs to be done will be done.
I say we go now, right now.
And what?
Kill that cousin of yours and the rest of those zips.
Mr. Tough Guy is out for blood all of the sudden.
You know nothing about it.
Now, go home.
You stay calm, and come back here at 4.
All right?
Ok?
Okay.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Give me a break, will you?
It's the first time I've ever smoked in the house.
Let a man enjoy himself, would you girl?
All finished. 10 dollars American.
I don't suppose your guinea hands are steady enough...
- ... to do a straight shave?
- Straight shave?
You've never ask for a straight shave, ever.
I know but I always wondered about it.
- That's unless you are too busy.
- No, just let me heat up a towel.
Here, here is 20.
Keep the change.
It's just in case you hit my jugular.
Yes sir, It gonna take about one hour.
We gonna shorten these sleeves little bit.
Gonna fix at the shoulder.
I never had a fitted suit before.
Yes, sir.
Look very good.
- What can I do for you, Mr. Kowalski?
- I am here for a confession.
- Oh, Lord Jesus, what have you done?
- Nothing you just take it easy now.
- What are you up to?
- Are you gonna give me a confession or not?
How long has it been since your last confession?
Forever.
- Bless me father, for I have sinned.
- What are your sins, my son?
In 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski at the factory Christmas party.
Dorothy was in the other room with the other wives.
It just happened.
Yes, go on.
Well, I made 900 dollar profit selling a boat and a motor.
I didn't pay the taxes it's the same as stealing.
Yes, fine.
And lastly...
I was never very close with my two sons.
I don't know them.
I didn't know how.
- That's it?
- That's it.
It's bothered me most of my life.
Say 10 "Hail Maries" and 5 "Our Fathers".
God loves and forgives you and absolves you of all your sins.
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Thank you, padre.
Are you gonna retaliate for what happened to Sue.
I'm going over to that house today, Mr. Kowalski.
- Is that so?
- It is.
And every other day until you see the folly of what you are planning.
- Busy day, gotta go.
- Go in peace.
Oh, I am at peace.
Jesus Christ.
So which one is mine?
- You ever fired a weapon before?
- No.
Why don't you put that one down.
I got something I wanna show you.
C'mon.
What?
In 1952 we were sent to take out a chink machine gun nest.
They trod us up pretty good.
I was the only one who came back that day.
For that they gave me a silver star.
Here it is.
Here I want you to have it.
Why?
Because we all knew the dangers that night.
But we went anyway.
That's the way it might be tonight.
There is always a chance you don't come back.
The hell we won't.
We'll roll up in there and tear some ass.
Yeah, that's foolish.
That's the exact reaction they're waiting for.
Come on and close this up.
- How many?
- How many what?
How many men did you kill in Korea?
- 13, maybe more.
- What was it like to kill a man?
You don't want to know.
Now close it up.
Walt!
Walt!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Relax, you can't get out of there.
You let me out right now!
Let me out.
You fuck let me out, I'll fucking kill you.
Shut the fuck up!
You want to know what it's like to kill a man?
Well, it's goddamn awful.
That's what it is.
The only thing worse is getting a medal of valor for killing some poor kids that wanted to just to give up.
That's all.
Yeah, some scared little gook just like you.
I shot them right in the face with that rifle you were holding in there a while ago.
Not a day goes by that I don't think about it.
You don't that on your soul.
I got blood on my hands.
I am soiled.
That's why I am going at it alone tonight.
Walt, you take me with you right now, let me out!
Look, you've come a long way.
I am proud to say that you are my friend.
But you got your whole life ahead of you.
But me, I finish things.
That's what I do and I am going at it alone.
No, wait!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
I need you to watch my dog.
Yeah, I love you too.
Yeah, she is old too.
Her name is Daisy.
- Hello.
- It's Walt.
The keys to my house are under the ceramic turtle on the front porch.
Let yourself in.
Your brother is in the basement.
I gotta go.
Sorry, father, we have to go.
I'm telling you, if we are not here there will be bloodshed.
We've been here for hours.
We can't afford to anchor a unit down to one location.
I am begging you to stay.
Just got a word from my sergeant, we're pulling the plug.
I am staying.
No you aren't.
We have specific orders you came with us, you're leaving with us.
Watch your head.
Sue, over here, over here.
Unlock this right now.
What's going on?
He left without me.
He went to Smokie's without me.
Tao!
What's the fuck, man?
Any swamp rats in there?
- I didn't think your ass would came.
- Shut up, gook.
I've got nothing to say to you, shrimp dick, lizard like you.
Yeah, yeah.
You go ahead watch out for your boyfriend.
Cause it was either he or you or someone who raped one of their own family.
You own blood, for Christ sake.
Now go ahead and pull those pistols, like miniature cowboys.
Go ahead.
So where's Tao at?
That pussy motherfucker not gonna come.
Don't worry about Tao.
Tao's got not one second for you.
Says who?
You?
- Fuck that.
- What the fuck you gonna do, old man?
What are you gonna do?
You bitch.
- Kind of jumpy, aren't we?
- Shut the fuck up.
You shut the fuck up!
- Got a light?
- What the fuck?
No.
Me..
I've got a light...
'Hail Mary, full of grace...'
Yes, sergeant.
- What happened?
- You need to step back.
- He's a friend of mine.
- I said, step back.
Hey, did you hear him?
Step back.
- What happened?
- Hey, step back.
He is my friend.
- Officer Chang!
Get those people back.
- Hey, step back now, Ok.
Get the fuck out of here!
Walt Kowalski once said to me that I didn't know anything about life or death.
Because I was an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin... who held the hands of superstitious old women and promised they eternity.
Walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it.
But he was right.
I knew really nothing about life or death, until I got to know Walt.
And boy did I learn.
And I want to leave my house to the church because Dorothy would've liked it.
Now which brings us to the last item.
And again please excuse the language in Mr. Kowalski's will, I'm simply reading it the way it was written.
And I'd like to leave my 1972 Gran Torino to... my friend... ... Tao Vang Lor.
Under the condition that you don't choptop the roof like one of those beaners, don't paint any idiotic flames on it like some white-trash hillbilly, and don't put a big gay spoiler on the rear end like you see... on all the other zipper heads' cars.
It just looks like hell.
If you can refrain from doing any of that, it's yours.

God, sorry about Dorothy, Walt.
She was a real peach.
Thanks for coming, Al.
Spectacles, testicles, wallet and watch.
Look at the Old Man glaring at Ashley.
He can't even tone it down at Mom's funeral?
What do you expect?
Dad's still living in the '50s.
He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly.
Yeah, well your kid's wearing a Timberwolves jersey.
I'm sure Dad appreciates that.
The point I am trying to make is that there's nothing ...anyone can do that won't disappoint the Old Man.
It's inevitable.
That's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings.
the deal with the boat motor, the broken bird bath,
It's always something.
What are we going to do with him?
Don't you think he'll get in trouble over ...there all by himself in the old neighborhood?
Why don't you have him move in with you?
Death is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics.
Bitter in the pain.
Sweet in the salvation.
Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased.
...and their families
Sweet to those who know the salvation that awaits.
And some may ask, what is death?
Is it the end?
Or is it the beginning?
And what is life?
What is this thing we call life?
All these questions can frustrate you at times like this.
-And that's why you have to turn to the Lord.
-Jesus ...
Because the Lord is the sweetness.
- Is that dad?
- No, that's grandpa Walt.
There is a platoon, E-Company, March 2, 1952.
- Korea?
- Where's Korea?
Well, people showed up after the service, huh?
Yeah, well, I suppose they heard there'd be a lot of ham.
I'll go down the basement and get some chairs.
- Oh, I can do that, Dad...
- No, we need them now not next week.
Cool, I found a medal.
Look at this.
How much longer do we have to stay?
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell and I'm bored.
Ashley, honey.
Why don't you help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?
- Me?
- Yes, you.
Grandpa Walt, would you like some help with these four chairs.
No, you probably just painted your nails.
Your dad is driving me crazy.
Why didn't you guys make him a hint we're leaving soon?
Come on, let's go.
Jesus Christ, how many swamp rats can get in one room?
Grandpa, when'd you get the vintage car?
1972.
I never knew you had a cool old car.
Yeah, it's been here since before you were born.
So, what are you going do with it when you like die?
Then what about that super cool retro couch that you have in the den?
Cause I was thinking I'm going to State next year, and I think it would look really good in my dorm room.
And I don't have any furniture at all.
God.
- Who are you?
- Hi, I am Tao.
- What do you want?
- I live next door.
- Come on, get the shit out of your mouth.
- I am...
- Tell me what you want.
Do you have jumper cables?
My uncle's car is old and.....
No we don't any jumper cables.
And have some respect, zipper head, we're mourning here..
How you holding up, Walt?
Mr. Kowalski.
Mr. Kowalski, that's my name.
Right, Mr. Kowalski.
Your wife and I became quite close these last few months.
She asked that I watch over you when she passed on.
I told her I watch out for my entire flock.
But she made me promise I'd keep an extra sharp eye on you.
I appreciate your kindness you've shown to my wife.
Now that you've spoken your piece, why don't go and attend some of your other sheep?
Ok?
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her desire for you to go to confession.
She said she couldn't remember the last time you went.
- Is that so?
- It is.
Well, I confess that I never really cared for church very much.
The only reason I went was because of her.
And I confess that I have no desire to confess to a boy that is just out of the seminary.
Wish I could help dad, but gotta get kids home.
- Kids getting restless.
- Yeah, fine, just go.
- I'll call in a few, see how you're doing.
- Alright.
Kill you to buy American.
Did you see the way he looked at the truck?
Jesus.
It's always Rice-Burner this or Jap-Burner that.
You know.
Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go.
- At least he didn't say anything this time.
- He didn't need to.
Well, what do you expect, Mitch?
The man worked at a Ford plant for a lot of years.
I suppose that's my goddamned fault?
Just give it a rest.
Drive.
Ok?
Kids, do you want the radio on?
Yes.
You want to listen to some music?
Good.
Damn, barbarians.
Oh, Jesus...
Polarski would roll over in his grave if he could see his lawn now.
What the hell the chinks had to move in this neighborhood for?
Have you gone completely deaf or something?
Hi there, Walt.
I kind of not a friend of yours.
Why do you insist on calling me Walt?
Sorry, Mr.Kowalski.
- What are you peddling today, padre?
- Nothing.
Thought I'd drop by and see how you are doing.
I haven't seen you in church in a while.
Okay.
Well now when you tipped on your good deed, now why don't you just take off down the road?
- I'd really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.
- Not in this lifetime, sonny.
Why?
- Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
- You don't want to know.
No, I do.
Well I think you're an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin... who likes to hold the hands of old ladies who are superstitious... and promises them eternity.
Is you a boy or is you a girl, I can't tell.
Hey, Chicito.
If you was in pink, I would fuck you and your ass would be my bitch.
What you reading, jackass and The rice stalk?
That's right, you keep walking.
- Look at me when I am talking to you.
- Fucking slopes everywhere you look, man.
Fucking pigs.
Look at that, man.
- That's my little cousin, over there.
- You sure that's your cousin, man?
- Fuck yes, that's my little cousin.
- He tight with anybody?
- No he is flying solo, man.
- Flying solo?
Let's go down and see what the fucking they're doing to him.
I love your jungles too.
Hey, they fucking with you?
They fucking with you?
We can do this right now.
You go fucking back here, don't you?
You are fucking rise niggers!
Tao, come on man, get in the car.
Dog, get in the car.
We just bailed your ass out, dawg.
Come on, dawg, get the fuck in here.
Get in the car, man, come on.
Chill with us, man.
We just bailed your ass out!
Come on.
- Come on, Tao, man.
- Fuck him, man, let's go.
- Come on, Spider.
- Fuck it.
Get it man, let's go.
Fuck his ass.
Tomorrow, I have to see your ass.
- Don't be like a little girl!
- Tomorrow.
Come let's go, man.
We've got a gun, man.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Let's get this strapped.
Pussy!
Hey, Tao.
Hey what's up?
What's up, Tao?
What are you doing, little man?
Why are you doing woman's work?
What do you want?
What?
We can't just come and talk to my little cousin?
He doesn't want to talk to you.
- I am here right.
- Hey, Spider, who is that?
- What's up?
- Spider?
Is that what he just called you, Fong?
- Spider?
- Is there something wrong with Spider?
What are you doing here?
Hey, so how old are you anyways?
- Mentally, I am way too old for you.
- What?
You are just stupid.
I am going inside.
Sue!
How your little brother, do this gardening.
Fine, stupid.
Hey, you will roll with us man?
- Come on ride with us.
- Chill with us.
You need somebody to protect you, man.
That's what your big cousins are for.
Look, dawg.
I've been there, I've done it and I've seen it.
Back in a day everybody wanted to beat me, dawg.
But now look, nobody wants to fuck with me.
- Come on man, let's go.
- We are cousins right?
- Come on.
- We are cousins right?
We are a family.
Look, I am brother to Spider, as he is brother to me.
Come on.
Take this shit off.
- That's a woman's work man.
- Come get your hands dirty, man.
So what do I have to do?
Spider told that old boy next door had a bad ass whip.
Told you we got him.
Come on.
- Nice.
- Ya, my little cousin being little man.
Yo, that's a nice car.
1972 Gran Torino, Fastback.
- Cobra jet engine.
- Yo man it can still in mint condition.
Yo man, it's in mint condition, man.
I've got one.
A Mexican, a Jew and a colored guy go into the bar.
The bartender looks up and says:
"Get the fuck out of here!"
So, here's where my flock congregates when they're not in church...
- Hey Father J.
- Hey, Mel.
Hey, Darrel.
- Hey, father.
- Hi, Walt.
What brings you in here, father.
Meat raffle?
No, I just came down to talk Walt if that's ok.
Damn, padre.
You are persistent, aren't you?
I promised your wife.
All right, let's get booze.
I'll have Pabst and a shot of Jack.
And whatever he's having.
- I'll have a Diet Coke.
- Bullshit.
This is a bar.
You have a drink.
- I'll have a gin and tonic.
- Attaboy!
So, what you want?
I promised your wife I'd get you to go to confession.
- Now, why would you do that?
- She was very insistent.
She made me.
Well you're kinda found of promising things you can't deliver on, right, father?
- Let's talk about something else.
- What?
Life and death.
Life and death.
What the hell do you know about life and death?
I'd like to think I know a lot.
I'm a priest.
Yeah, you get up and preach about life and death.
But all what you know is what you learned in a priest school.
Right out of the rookie Preacher's Handbook.
I don't know about that.
I think...
That is bittersweet.
Sort of bitter in its pain.
But sweet in its salvation.
That's what you know of life and death, and that's pathetic.
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?
I know a lot.
I lived there almost three years in Korea.
Thanks.
We shot men.
We stabbed them with bayonets, hacked 17-year-olds to death with shovels...
Stuff I'll remember till the day I die.
Horrible things, but things I live with.
And what about life?
Well, I ...
I survived the war.
Got married...
and had a family.
Sounds like you know more about death than you do living.
Maybe so, father.
Maybe so.
Son of a bitch.
- Hey, man, get in a car!
- Tao, what the fuck, get in!
- Come on Tao.
- Come, let's go,man, get in!
Fuck man, get in!
Hello?
Morning, Dad, it's your number one son, Mitch.
Morning?
It's after one in the afternoon.
It's not morning.
Oh, right.
Afternoon, then.
- So what do you want?
- What?
Me?
Nothing.
I mean, what would I want?
Well, I don't know.
Your wife has already gone through all of your mother's jewelry.
No, dad.
I was just calling to see how are you doing?
Well, anything new with the old neighborhood?
- No.
- Great.
Smooth sailing then.
Yah.
- Ok, good, good, then.
- Oh, hey, dead.
- Yeah.
You wouldn't happen to still know that guy from the plant who has Lion season tickets?
Dad?
Ain't she sweet?
Come on.
Hey, what's up?
- What are you doing here, man?
- Nothing.
- Minding our own business.
- Just hanging out.
What are you guys doing here?
What?
Can I just come here to hang with my little cousin?
- We have good new for you.
- Really, and what's that?
- Only for guy talk.
- I don't think so.
- Why not?
- Come on, man, we are going to give you another shot.
Don't go, Tao.
- Mind your own business girl.
- Come on, let's go
- Come.
What the hell is this?
- Get up.
- G't off my lawn.
Listen old man, you don't want to fuck with me.
Did you hear me?
I said get off my lawn, now.
Are you fucking crazy?
Go back in a house.
Yeah, I'll blow the hole in your face and then I'll go in a house.
And I'll sleep like a baby.
You can count on that.
We used to stack fucks like you 5 feet high in Korea, used you for sandbags.
You better watch your back...
Thank you.
Get off my lawn.
What the hell is this?
No, no, no, no more.
Stay right there.
Why can't you people just leave me alone?
We brought you some shallots to plant in the garden.
- I don't want them.
- They're perennials, they come back every year.
Look, why are bringing me all this garbage anyway?
Because...
Because you saved Tao.
I didn't save anybody.
I just.
I kept a bunch of jabbering gooks off of my lawn.
- You are a hero to the neighborhood.
- I am not a hero.
Too bad, they think you are and that's why they're keep bringing you the gifts.
- Please take them.
- All they are wrong.
- I just want to be left alone, thank you.
- Wait!
This is my mom, Vu, I'm Sue and that's my brother, Tao.
- We live next door.
- So?
Tao wants to say something.
- I am sorry.
- Sorry for what?
For trying to steal your car.
Let me tell you something, boy.
You step on this property again...
you are done.
Good afternoon, Walt.
- I told you I'm not going to confession..
- Why didn't you just call the police?
What?
I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and...
I heard there was some trouble in the neighborhood.
Why didn't call the police?
Well ...
You know why, I've prayed that they would show up, but..
...nobody answered.
- What were you thinking?
Someone could have been killed.
We're talking life and death here.
When things go wrong, you gotta act quickly.
When we were in Korea and a thousand screaming gooks came across our land..
...we didn't call the police.
We reacted.
- We are not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski,
I've been thinking about our conversation on life and death.
About what you said.
About how you carry around all the horrible things you were forced to do.
Horrible things that won't leave you.
It seems that it would do you good to unload some of that burden.
Things done during war are terrible.
Being ordered to kill... killing to save yourself, killing to save others.
You're right, those are things I know nothing about.
But I do know about forgiveness.
And I've seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins, admitted their guilt and left their burdens behind them.
Stronger men than you!
Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things... and are now at peace.
Well I got to hand it to you, padre.
You came here with your guns loaded this time.
- Thank you!
- And you're right about one thing.
About stronger men than me, reaching their salvation.
Well, Hallefuckinlujah.
- But you are wrong about something else.
- What's that, Mr. Kowalski?
The thing that haunts a man the most is what he isn't ordered to do.
There, finally, you look like a human being again...
You shouldn't wait so long between haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch.
Well I am surprised you are still around.
I was always hoping that you die off and they get somebody in here they knew what the hell they are doing.
Instead you just keep hanging around, like the dump wop dago you are.
- That'll be 10 dollars, Walt.
- Ten bucks, Jesus Christ, Martin.
What are you half-Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices all the time.
It's been 10 bucks for the last 5 years and you hard-mellows,
Pollack son of a bitch.
- Keep the change.
- See you in three weeks, prick.
Not if I see you first, dipshit.
That's cool, you know.
Look at this.
Check this out.
You tight ass over here.
Come here girl.
You can't say hi?
Or are you acting like stuck-up and shit.
- What are you supposed to be man?
- Yo, it's cool dog.
The fuck are you doing in my neighborhood, boy?
None, just going to the corner spot, you know, get some CDs, sound good, bro?
- He called, you bro!
- Come on sound good, bro?
- Sound good.
- Shut the fuck up.
Call me bro again, and I'll bite your motherfucking face off.
- Yeah, motherfucker.
- Now what the fuck you come down here for?
You here to bring this little present?
Oriental yummy?
Don't worry, I'll take a real good care with her.
- Fuck out of here!
- Fuck out of here, man!
Oh shit, you have a bitch with you.
Keep your ass right here.
Oh, great.
Another asshole who has a fetish for Asian girls.
God, it gets so old.
Oh, shit, what's your name, girl?
My name?
Get your ass out of here, okay.
It's "take your crude, overly obvious come-on to every woman who walks past and cram it."
That's my name.
Who do you think you are talking to?
- Who does it look like?
- You think you're really funny, don't you?
- Man she's tough.
- What?
You gonna hit me now?
That'd pretty much complete the picture.
You need to keep your bitch on a leash.
Put a choke chain on her and yank that motherfucker.
-Oh, of course, right to the stereotype thesaurus.
-Oh yeah.
-Call me a whore and a bitch in the same sentence.
-Bitch is crazy.
- I like her like that.
- Now take that bitch.
- You don't know when to quit do you, girl?
- Let me teach you a lesson.
Stop!
Let me go!
Take your ass over there.
What the fuck are you looking at, old man?
What the hell are you spooks up to?
Spooks?
You'd better get your ass on, honkey, while I still let you.
That's you'd better do.
What the fuck he thinks he is?
Have you noticed how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't fucking with?
That's me.
You are fucking crazy, get out of here, man.
Why don't you get your ass out of here before we kicked your wrinkly white ass.
What's wrong with him man?
- The motherfucker's crazy!
-What is this thing?
What the hell?
Get in a truck.
- Crazy motherfucker.
- What's wrong with him, man.
- Hey pops come on now.
- Shut your fucking face!
You don't fucking listen, do you?
- Now get in a truck.
- Go get in a truck, girl.
Let her go, old man!
Shut up, pussy.
What is this 'bro' shit anyway?
You want to be superb page, or something?
These guy don't want to be your bro and I don't blame them.
Now get your old faint paddy ass on down the road.
Take care now.
You too.
Oh, yeah.
Why didn't you do nothing?
Man you fucking!
Shit, man.
If he had cannon at your fucking face, you would do nothing.
What's the matter with you, for Christ sake?
Trying to get yourself killed?
I thought you Asian girls were supposed to be smart.
Hanging around in the neighborhood like that is the fast way to get you in the obituaries.
I know, I know.
Take it easy.
And what about that goofball guy you were with.
Is that a date or something?
- Yeah, kind of.
His name is Trey.
- You should be hanging out with them.
You should be hanging out with your own people.
The other Hummongs.
You mean, Hmong?
- Hmong, not Hummong
- Whatever.
What the hell is Hmong, I mean Mong anyway?
Wow, you so enlighten you know that?
No, Hmong is not a place, it is a people.
My people come from different parts of Laos, Thailand and China.
Well how you ended up in my neighborhood?
Why didn't you stay there?
It's Vietnam thing.
We thought on your side And when American quit the communists started killing all the Hmong.
So we came over here.
Yeah, well I don't know how you ended up in Midwest.
Snow on the ground 6 months in the year.
What is it?
Jungle people wanted to be on great frozen tundra?
Hill people.
We are hill people.
Not jungle people.
BOO-ga, ga-Boo, BOO-ga!
Yeah, whatever...
Blame the Lutherans.
They brought us up here.
Everybody blames the Lutherans.
Well, you'd think the cold will keep all the idiots out.
Thanks for the ride.
You know something kid, you are all right.
But what about that dimwit brother of yours?
He is little slow or something?
Tao is actually really smart.
He just doesn't know what direction to go in.
- Poor toad.
- It is really common.
Hmong girls over here fit in better.
The girls go to college and the boys go to jail.
That old hag hates my ass.
Your birthday today, Daisy.
This year you have to make a choice between two life paths.
Second chances come your way.
Extraordinary events culminate in what might seem to be an anticlimax.
You lucky numbers are:
84, 23, 11, 78 and 99.
What a load of shit.
Yea.
What the hell is it with kids nowadays?
All right.
- Let me help you with those.
- Oh, thank you.
How about that?
How about that, Daisy?
- It's too heavy for a bag.
- No problem.
- Good, Karen, give it to him.
-Here you go.
- Well, what is it?
-It's a Gopher.
So you can reach stuff.
It makes things a lot of easier.
This is from me.
It's a phone.
Oh, I can see that.
I just thought... well, we thought that it would make things easier.
Thank you, Karen.
There's nothing wrong with making things less hard on yourself.
You know, Karen's right, Dad.
You've worked hard your whole life.
Maybe it's time you start thinking about taking it a easier?
And some other thing, Dad.
You really should get rid of the coffin nails.
We were thinking about the house.
You know, when Mom's gone, it's got to be a lot to maintain around here.
Let alone clean.
And you are here all alone...
Yeah, you know, there's these great places now, you know, these communities.
Where you don't have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow.
You know, people who are like you, active and alert, but are alone.
And would benefit from being around folks their own age.
Yeah Dad, look.
You got to check it out.
We brought some brochures.
These places are nothing like that you think they would be.
They are great.
No, they are beautiful.
They are really nice.
They really are.
These are top-notch like resorts.
- It is like staying in a hotel, practically.
- They're beautiful.
- They really are.
- Yeah.
They care of everything.
They clean up.
They're really nice.
Oh, there are wonderful stores, where you can buy new shoes.
They are amazing, they really are.
You have a good time, play some golf maybe.
Meet other people.
Son of a bitch.
Kicked us out on his birthday.
I've told you that was a bad idea.
- I know, you were right
- He won't let anybody help him.
Well, we tried.
Now can we just drop it?
No one can say we didn't try.
What the hell with him, we shouldn't have done it.
We should've stayed home with Josh and Ashley.
At least they were smart enough to not come here.
The goddamn kids have more sense than we do.
We miss mom, don't we Daisy?
Hey, Walt.
What are you up to?
We're having a barbecue.
You want to come over?
- What do you think?
- There's tons of food.
- Just keep you hands off my dog.
-No worries.
We only eat cats.
- Really?
- No I am kidding, you moron.
- Come on you can be my special guest.
-No, I am fine right here.
Yeah...
- Son of a bitch.
- Okay, so, what have you had to eat today?
I had a piece of cake.
And a little beef jerky.
Come on over and get something to eat.
We've got beer too.
Well...
I might as well drink with strangers better than drinking alone.
It is my birthday.
- Really?
Happy birthday, Wally.
- Don't call me Wally.
- You have no Pabts among the beer.
- As they say, "when in Hmong."
What am I doing wrong?
Every time I look at somebody they always look at the ground.
- What is she saying?
- She said welcome to our home.
- Oh no, she is not.
- Yes, she didn't.
- She hates me.
- Yeah, she hates you.
Okay.
What?
!
What are all you fish heads looking at anyway?
I think we should go to other room.
Sorry.
All the people in this house are very traditional.
Number 1.
Never touch a Hmong person on the head, not even a child...
Hmong-people believe that the soul resides on the head.
- So, don't do that.
- Sounds dumb, but fine.
And a lot of Hmong people consider looking at someone eye to be very rude.
- That's why they look away, when you look at them.
- Anything else?
Yeah, some Hmong people tend to smile or grin when they're yelled at.
It's a cultural thing.
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity, it's not that they're laughing at you, really.
You people are nuts.
But the food...
- It looks good, smells good too.
- Of course, its Hmong food.
Okay, and I come back in few seconds.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
You mentioned about... looking at people, he's been staring at me the whole evening.
That's Kor Khue.
He is the Lor's family shaman.
-What's that some sort of witch doctor or something?
-Something like that.
- Boeki Boo.
- You're funny, Wally.
Kor Khue's interested in you.
He heard what you did.
He would like to read you.
It would be rude not allow him this.
It's a great honor.
- Yeah sure.
It's fine by me.
- All right, take a seat.
He says people do not respect you.
They don't even want to look at you.
He says the way you live, your food has no flavor.
You wearied by your life.
You made a mistake.
And you past life is like a mistake what you did.
You are not satisfied with.
He says, you have no happiness in your life.
It's like you are not at peace.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I am fine.
Fine, I am fine.
God, I've got more in common with these gooks than I do my own spoiled-rotten family.
Jesus Christ...
Happy Birthday.
- Are you ok?
- Yeah, I am fine.
- You were bleeding.
- No, I bit my tongue.
It's nothing.
Why don't we get down and get some of that good gook food.
I am starving.
Okay.
You ladies are wonderful.
That stuff is really good.
- Come on you glutton!
- What's up?
- Let's go.
- What for?
- To mingle.
- We can mingle right here.
No.
You told me not to leave you alone.
Thank you very much.
I have to go now.
I'll be back.
Don't let me go right of it.
- Well, well, look he is over there.
- Yeah, the kid who steal my Gran Torino.
- My brother Tao.
- Tried to anyway, yeah, toad.
It was wobby a bit.
But it should fix it.
What's this?
Little rice liquor.
Here, try it.
All right.
My friends and I were just wondering what you're doing here?
That's a good question.
What am I doing here?
- My name is Walt.
- Hey, Walt.
I am Wa Xam.
- Wa Yum?
- No Wa Xam.
- Wa Xam, Ok.
- So what do you do?
- I fix things.
Stuff like that.
- Like what?
I've just fixed that dryer over there.
I fixed my wife's friend sink.
I took old aunt Merry to doctor to get a prescription.
Fixed up.
I've even the fixed the door, what had't even broken yet.
You're funny.
I've been called a lot of things, but never funny.
- Well, I have to take off.
Enjoy yourself.
- Okay, Yum Yum.
Later.
Come on.
Relax, zipper headed.
I am not gonna shoot you.
I'd look down too if I was you.
You know, I knew you were a dipshit the first time I ever saw you.
You're worse with women than you are with stealing cars, Toad.
- It's Tao.
- What?
It's not toad, it's Tao.
My name is Tao.
You were blowing it with that girl who was there.
Not that I give two shits about a Toad like you.
You don't know what you are talking about.
You are wrong egg roll.
I know exactly what I am talking about.
I may not be the most pleasant person to be around.
But I got the best woman who was ever on this planet to marry me.
I had to work at it.
That was the best thing that ever happened to me.
Hangs down.
But you... you know...
You let Click Clack, Ding Dong and Charlie Chan just walk out with what's-her-face.
She likes you, you know.
I don't know why.
Who?
Yum yum!
You know that girl in the purple sweater.
She's been looking at you all day, stupid.
- Do you mean, Wa Xam?
- Yeah, Yum Yum.Yeah.
Nice girl, very charming girl.
I talked with her.
But you let her just walk right out.
With the three stooges.
And you know why?
Cause you are big, fat pussy.
Well ...
I gotta go.
Good day.
Puss cake.
No, no more.
Okay, put them over there.
No.
No.
No more No more.
No more.
No more, please...
Is that chicken dumpling thing you brought before?
Alright.
Better than beef jerky all the time.
What's going on?
- What's going on?
-Tao is here to make amends.
- He is here to work for you.
-No, he isn't.
He's not gonna work for me.
My mom said dishonored the family.
And now he has to work off his dept.
- He starts tomorrow morning.
- Oh not tomorrow, not any time.
I don't even want him on my property.
I thought we went over all that.
It's very important to my mom that you accept.
And that would be an insult if you refuse.
Why is it being put back on me, all of this?
He is the one who tried to steal my car... all of the sudden I am a bad guy in this thing.
Look, my family is very traditional and would be very much upset if you don't let Tao repay.
If you doesn't want to do it, then let's just go.
Shut up!
Yeah, shut up.
All right, tomorrow, tomorrow.
Thank you.
Jesus, Joseph and Mary.
These Hmong broads are like badgers.
Son of a bitch.
I never thought he'd show.
All right, what are you good at?
- Like what?
- That's what I am asking.
You gonna work for me, I gotta know what you are good at.
- I gotta know what you can do.
- I don't know.
That's kind of half way what I expected you to say.
See that tree right there?
You just go over there and count the birds.
- You want me to count the birds?
- Yeah, you can count?
All you slopes are supposed to be good at math, right?
- Yeah, I can count.
- Good.
One, two ...
So, what do you have for me to do?
You want me to watch paint dry... or maybe count the clouds that pass by?
Don't get flip with me, boy.
I am not the one who is trying to steal, don't you forget that.
Go ahead.
I don't care if you insult me and say racist things.
- Cause you know what?
I'll take it.
- Of cause you'll take it.
Cause you have no teeth, you have no balls, kid.
Look, I am stuck here.
Why don't you find something useful for me to do.
Unlike you, I am not useless.
And I maintain my own property.
These swamp rats, on the other hand, you just can help it.
How long do I have you for?
Toad, how long?
Till next Friday.
All right.
Go get the ladder out of the garage.
When you got finished with that roof there.
You can take that gutter, and nail it back up.
I am tired looking at it for the last three years.
Yeah, you said it, brother.
Hello.
Grandpa says he want to know if you can have Tao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch?
Wasp nest?
That's terrible.
I think we can handle that after the lunch.
Lord All Mighty, knock it off.
It's my last day.
What else do have for me do?
Take a day-off.
You did enough.
Toad!
Nothing.
Nevermind.
Kowski?
Kowski?
Kowski?
Mr. Kowalski?
Good morning.
I looked over your paperwork and I think... we should immediately start a full battery of tests.
I feel that this would be the best way to go about checking all the issues that you've had.
Excuse me, what happened to Dr.Felmon, my regular doctor?
Dr. Felmon retired three years ago.
I am his replacement Dr. Chang.
- It's grandpa Walt.
- Pick it up.
You talk to him!
Mitch.
- I'm doing bills here.
- You talk to him, he is yours father.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Mitch.
It's me your dad.
Yeah, I know.
What's up?
Oh, nothing, nothing much really.
How is everything going?
I am fine, fine.
How about Karen and the kids?
Fine, everybody is great.
Doing fine.
Good.
How about work?
Busy.
Yeah, I suppose...
In fact, um, speaking of busy.
I got a lot on my plate right now, so if it is not something pressing.
No, not it all.
Why don't you call me this weekend?
Sure.
Ok, It was nice talking to you.
Thanks for talk.
Thanks.
This kid doesn't have a chance.
What do you know about faucets?
I know a lot about them, boy.
Tender side.
- Jesus.
For the love of Pete.
- What?
It must be a hundred degrees here.
Just, turn on the fan.
This place is wobbling apart.
Where did you get all the stuff?
- What are you talking about?
- All the tools and stuff.
Well, may come as surprise to a thief, but I bought this stuff.
Everything in here with my own money.
Yeah, yeah.
This is not what I meant.
I mean this is so much shit packed in here.
Yeah, well.
Every tool in here has a purpose.
Everything has a job to do.
- They are all used when necessary.
- Okay, so, what is that?
- It is a post hole digger.
- That?
Vice-grips.
Wire cutters, you know that's a trowel.
There is shears right there, and that's a saw.
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me kid.
Alright, what's on your mind.
It's just...
I can't afford to buy all this stuff.
Well, I guess, even a bonehead like you, could understand... that a man acquires it over the period of 50 years.
- Yeah, but...
- All right, look, here.
These three items right here, you can have this.
WD-40, vice grips and some duck tape.
Any man who is worth his salt, can do half of the house chores with just those three things.
Anything else you need you just borrow it, that's all.
Ok, cool.
- Fuck me.
- What's with that?
Nothing.
What?
Nothing, huh?
I just saw you've coughed out blood.
That's not good.
You should really see a doctor.
Look..
Those guys over here, the other night on my lawn, what about them?
- Just a gang.
A bunch of Hmong gang bangers.
I assume that.
What they were doing here?
They were going to take me away.
They were kind of pissed, that I blew my first initiation.
Yeah, well you are, you are a pussy.
You wanna hang out with guys like that.
What was your initiation supposed to be?
My Gran Torino?
Toad, you got a minute?
Here it is.
Here is the deal.
I take the top, cause that's the heaviest.
I'll pull on that.
And you stand right back here, and you push.
And help me push it up each step.
- Like that.
- Then, let me take the top.
No, no, I've got a top.
No, I'll take the top.
It looks pretty heavy.
Look I am not crippled.
I've got the top.
If you don't let me take the top.
I ain't helping.
I will go back home.
- Listen to me, zipper head--
- No, you listen, old man!
I am here because you need help.
So it is either top of I am out of here.
All right, you take the top and I'll push.
Don't let it slip off you little girl hands and crush me.
Don't give me any ideas.
That thing weighs a ton.
Runs like a clock.
They don't make them like this anymore.
- So what are you going to do with it?
- Sell it I guess.
- How much?
- 60 bucks.
I am tired of having this sit around down in the basement there.
Why?
You are looking for a freezer?
- Our downstairs one kind of died.
- Okay, 25 bucks and it's yours.
25?
You've just said 60.
I know, it will save me money putting an ad in the paper.
Come on, let haul it over your place.
- Kind of ironic, huh?
- What?
Toad washing a car they tried to steal from you.
Yeah, he misses one spot.
He is doing it all over again too.
It is nice of you to kind look after him like this.
He doesn't have any real role models in his life.
- Well, I am not a role model.
- But you are a good man, Wally.
- I wish our father would have been more like you.
- Don't go calling me Wally.
No, I am serious.
He was really hard on us.
Really traditional and really old school.
Well, I am old school.
Yeah, but you an American.
What's that supposed to me?
- You like him, don't you?
- Are you kidding?
He tried to steal my car.
And you spend time with him, teaching him how to fix things.
- Saved him from a fucked cousin of ours...
- Hey, watch your language, lady.
- And you're a good man
- I am not a good man.
Give me another beer, dragon lady.
This one is empty.
You know, Hmong consider gardening to be a woman's work.
Yeah, that probably why I see in the garden over there all the time.
- Besides we ain't in Hu-Mong.
- Funny.
You know you should quit.
That's bad for you.
Yeah?
So it's being in a gang, dipshit.
Didn't you hear what I've just said?
I saw you coughed out blood.
You should quit.
What's that emblem supposed to mean anyway?
Your ancient camp scout emblem?
1'st cavalry.
I've had it since 1951.
- So, what you wanna do with you life, kid?
- I was thinking maybe sales.
Sales?
My older son is in sales.
License to steal.
I worked in the Ford factory for 50 years, ...and he's out selling Japanese cars.
- You made cars?
Yeah.
I put the steering column in these...
Gran Torino 1972.
So you wanna be in sales?
What about going to school, maybe.
- But school costs money.
- Maybe you should get a job.
You can't just sit there and spread mulch in my garden for the rest of your life.
- Maybe you can just pay me.
- Yeah, very funny.
- What kind of job could I ever get?
- You're right, nobody would ever hire you.
Look I am just kidding, zip...
I mean.
You can get a job.
You can get a job everywhere.
Like what?
- How about construction?
- Me?
- Yeah.
- Construction?
- Yeah.
- Do you have Alzheimer's or something?
No, get a job in the construction.
I know people in the trades.
Of course I have to make a little adjustment and man you up a little bit.
- Man me up?
- Yeah.
And I think you ought to date Miss Yum Yum too.
Do you little good.
Get carbon off the vaults.
Now you just gonna learn, how guys talk.
You just listen the way Martin and I banter back and forth.
- You okay?
You are ready?
- Sure.
Let's go in.
Perfect.
A pollack and a chink.
How are you doing, Martin, you crazy Italian prick?
Walt, you cheap bastard, I should have known you'd come in, ...I was having such a pleasant day.
- What did you do?
Jew some poor blind guy out of his money.
- Giving him a wrong change?
- Who's the nip?
He is a pussy kid from next door.
I am just trying to man him up a little bit.
You see kid?
That's how guys talk to one another.
- They do?
- Do you have shit in your ears?
Now go out and come back in and talk to him like a man.
Like a real man.
Come on.
Get your ass out of here.
Come on back now.
Sorry about this.
That's ok.
What's up you, old Italian prick?
Get out of my shop before I blow your head off, you goddamn dick smoker.
Jesus Christ.
Shit.
Take it easy.
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
That's what you said.
That what you said men say.
You don't just come in and insult a man in his own shop.
What happens if you meet some stranger?
If you get the wrong one he's gonna blow you gook head right off.
- What should I've said then?
- Why don't you start with Hi or Hello.
Yeah just come in and say:
"Sir, I'd like a haircut if you have a time"
Yeah, be polite but don't kiss ass.
In fact you can talk about the construction job you just came from.
And bitch about your girl friend in your car.
"Son of a bitch, I've just got breaks fixed... and those sons of the bitches really nailed me.
They screwed right in the ass."
Yeah, don't swear at the guy.
Just talk about people who are not in the room.
You can bitch about your boss making you work overtime when it is bowling night.
Right, my old lady bitches for 2 goddamn hours about how... they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store.
And the minute I turn on a fucking game she starts crying we never talk.
See now go out, come back and talk to him.
And it ain't a rocket science for Christ sake.
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car, or a girlfriend.
Jesus, I should have blown his head off when I had a chance.
Maybe so, I want you to turn around and go outside and come back and don't talk about having no job, no car, no girlfriend, no future, no dick.
Ok, just turn around and go.
Excuse me sir, I need a hair cut if you ain't too busy.
You old Italian son of a bitch prick barber.
Boy, does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job.
Fuck me.
- All set to go through with this, right?
- Yeah, yeah.
Don't yeah, yeah me.
Just say:
Yes sir and I'll do my best.
- Yes, I'll do my best.
- Cause when I vouch for somebody that means I am give them my word.
I don't want you making me look bad.
No I am good.
Totally into this.
Don't lay down either.
Just look em straight in the eye.
And a man can tell a lot by your handshake.
- Here, put those in your back pocket.
- Cool.
Don't blow this.
- Hey, Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon.
- How the hell are you?
- I am shitty.
But who's gonna listen?
- Not me, that's for sure.
Help yourself there, Walt.
You dumb pollack.
Ok this is the kid, I was telling you about.
Tao, this is Tim Kennedy, he is super on this job.
What we got here, Walt?
Well, he knows construction and he is a smart kid.
He'll do anything you need him for.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
- You speak English?
- Yes, sir.
- Were you born here?
- You bet.
I see that Walt drove you here.
You got a vehicle?
- Not at the moment.
Taking a bus for now.
- Bus?
Jesus Christ.
You don't have a car?
My head gasket cracked and the goddamned pricks... at the shop wants to bend me over for $2100.
Oh please.
I just replaced the tranny in my Tahoe and the sons a bitches fucked me hard, just under $3200.
- Goddamned thieves.
It ain't right.
- You got that right.
Come on in on Monday and we'll find something for you to do.
Thanks, Mr. Kennedy.
- That's Tim, and what's you name again?
- Tao.
T. ..., okay.
You owe me one, Walt.
Well I'll buy a fruit cake for Christmas.
Fuck a fruit cake.
How about you just hand over the keys to that Gran Torino.
- What the hell does everybody want my car?
- Yeah, I am not surprised.
Yeah, you don't know a half of it.
Alright, come on, zipper head.
Let the Mick stay here and play with himself.
What are we doing?
What do you want to do?
Carry you tools in a rice bag?
Here.
You can use one of these ... and you'll need one of this here.
I can't afford any of this.
I'll cover it.
You can pay me back with your first pay check.
- Cool.
- Here, we need something like that.
This is what I am looking for here, tool belt.
There you go.
Not to bitch.
But won't I be needing some tools.
Tools I've got but I am not going to lend you my tool belt.
You can pick up tools as you go.
- I really appreciate all this.
- Forget it.
No, I really do.
Thank you.
What's up homeboy, what are you doing?
- What up man?
- What you got, punk?
- Checking up on my little cousin.
- Yeah, man.
- My little cousin...
- What's this?
- Where you come from, man?
- I am coming home from work, I know you guys don't know much about that.
- So that's true, you got a job.
- You can't just leave me alone?
What?
He is scared, huh?
- Who bought this shit for you?
Your dad?
- What you guys want with me?
- Your dad bought this shit for you?
- Keep your hands off my stuff.
- What's the fuck is that shit?
- What the fuck, you make me look bad?
- Keep your hands off my stuff!
- This massive my job, man.
- Give me that, that.
- Hey come on, this is my stuff.
You wanna smoke man?
Fuck it.
Let me go.
Give me that, man.
Give me that.
What's the phrase I am looking for?
Oh yeah, 'saving face'
Hey, there.
Hey.
I gotta run.
Haven't seen you for a few days.
Where you've been?
Been busy.
Busy, huh?
- What the hell happened to you?
- Don't worry about it.
What do you mean don't worry about it.
Look at your goddamn face.
I said don't worry about it.
Okay, it's not your problem.
When?
Grabbed me a couple of days ago, right after I go off work.
Cowards.
I did everything I can possibly do.
But they broke some of your tools.
- I will replace them.
- Don't worry about the tools.
Where is your cousin lives?
No, Walt.
I'll be ok.
- I don't want you to do anything.
- Right.
You could need extra tools, you just let me know.
- Well, I could use a roofing hammer.
- Good, go in my garage and get it.
This should be the last stop.
Here is the deal.
You stay away from Tao, understand?
You tell your friends to stay away from Tao.
You want to fight with us than I could sound don't want to see him anymore.
That's it, got it?
I'll take that as yes.
Cause if I have to come back here it is gonna get fucking ugly.
Get off of my way.
How do you want your dog?
I mean steak?
- Funny.
- I told you, we only eat cats.
I've never seen you like this before.
Well I am feeling good.
I god beautiful women, great food.
- And Tao.
- And even Tao isn't bugging me.
- You are having a good time, I see.
-Yeah.
And it never ends.
What happened to your knuckles anyways?
I slipped in a shower.
No big problem.
Look, Yum-Yum, if he doesn't ask you out I will ask you out.
Wa Xam, don't listen to him.
He is a white devil.
Yeah, I am.
I am a white devil.
I've loved to Walt, but he beat you to it.
Really?
No kidding!
Dinner and a movie, or what?
Yeah, they are taking a bus.
No, you can't take a bus.
You gonna get you something more stylish that that.
Like what?
Take a limo?
How about that?
- The Gran Torino?
- Yeah.
- You'd let me take the Gran Torino.
- Yeah, I let you take the Gran Torino.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Is everybody all right?
It's all right.
Where's grandma?
Where is Sue?
- Where is Sue?
- She went to our aunts.
- To her aunts?
Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Get on the phone and call her right now.
Sue...
I knew, this was gonna happen.
What the hell am I doing here?
Maybe some of her friends called her and she changed her plans.
Yeah.
At the war we just all of us lost a lot of friends but you gotta stand for it.
You can care to it.
Mr. Kowalski?
Are you Ok?
Yeah, I am Ok.
Police finally left, no one is talking.
One thing about Hmong, they keep their mouths shut.
Yeah, I've noticed that.
You know, Tao and Sue will never gonna find peace in this world as long as those gangs around.
Until they go away.
You know forever.
What are you saying?
You know what I am saying.
I took Sue to the hospital.
She is scared.
- They are all scared...
- Yeah.
Tao especially.
He's sitting out there right now staring at your front door.
You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.
What would you do?
- What should Tao do?
- I know what I would do if I was you.
- Or at least what you think you should do.
- Really?
If I was Tao I guess I'd wanted vengeance.
I'd wanted to stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys.
- And you?
- What would I do?
I'd come over here and talk to you, I guess.
I know you are close with these people, but this pisses me off too, Mr.Kowalski.
- Wanna beer?
- I'd love one.
There some in the chest, right over there behind you.
Damn all this.
- It just isn't fair.
- Nothing is fair, father.
So what you gonna do, Mr. Kowalski?
Call me Walt.
All right.
What you gonna do, Walt?
I don't know.
But I'll think of something.
Whatever it is, they won't have a chance.
What are you doing?
Thinking.
Thinking.
Thinking time is over.
Now it's time to knock shit out of these pricks.
I know you don't want to hear this, but now it's the time to stay calm.
Calm?
You want me to be calm?
We stay calm or else mistakes will get made.
We have to step back from this thing.
No, don't let me down, Walt.
Not you.
This is gonna end today.
Sit down.
I don't want to sit.
I said sit down.
Now, listen to me.
We gotta plan this, and plan it very carefully.
Can't make any mistakes.
You know I am the right man for this job.
I want to go home and stay calm, and come back here at 4 this afternoon.
- And this to be done will be done.
- I say we go now.
Right now.
And what?
Kill that cousin of yours and the rest of those zips.
Mr. Tough Guy is out for blood all of the sudden.
You know nothing about it.
Now go home.
You stay calm come back here at 4.
Ok?
Okay.
I know, I know.
Give me a break please, it's the first time I've ever smoked in the house.
Let a man enjoy himself, would you girl.
All finished. 10 dollars American.
I don't suppose your guinea hands are steady enough ...to do a straight shave?
- Straight shave?
You've never asked about straight shave ever.
I know but I always wondered about it.
- That's unless you are too busy.
- No, just let me heat up a towel.
Here is 20.
Keep the change.
It is just in case you hit my jugular.
Yes sir, it gonna take about one hour.
We gonna shorten these sleeves little bit.
Gonna fix at the shoulder.
- I never had a suited suit before.
Yes sir, look very good.
- What can I do for you, Mr. Kowalski?
- I am here for a confession.
- Lord Jesus, what have you done?
- Nothing, you just take it easy now.
- What are you up to?
- Are you gonna give a confession or not?
How long has it been since your last confession?
Forever.
- Bless me father, for I have sinned.
- What are your sins, my son?
In 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski at the factory Christmas party.
Dorothy was in the other room with the other wives.
It just happened.
Yes, go on.
Well, I made 900 dollars profit selling a boat and motor.
I didn't pay the taxes it is the same as stealing.
Yes, fine.
Lastly...
I was never very close with my two sons.
I don't know them.
I didn't know how.
- That's it?
- That's it.
It's bothered me most of my life.
Say ten "Hail Maries" and five "Our fathers".
God loves and forgives you and absolves you of all your sins.
In the name of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.
Thank you, padre.
Are you going to retaliate for what happened to Sue?
I'm going over to that house today, Mr. Kowalski.
- Is that so?
- It is.
And every other day until you see the folly of what you are planning.
- Busy day, gotta go.
- Go in peace.
Oh, I am at peace.
Jesus Christ.
So which one is mine?
- You ever fired a weapon before?
- No.
Why don't you put that one down.
I got something more to show you.
What?
In 1952 we were sent to take out a chink machine gun nest.
They trod us up pretty good.
I was the only one who came back out there.
For that they gave me a silver star.
Here it is.
Here I want you to have it.
Why?
Because we all knew the danger that night.
But we went anyway.
That's the way it might be tonight.
- There is always a chance you don't come back.
- The hell we won't.
We're will roll in there and tear ass.
Yeah, that's foolish.
That's the exact reaction they are waiting for.
Come on and close this up.
- How many?
- How many what?
How many men did you kill in Korea?
- 13, maybe more.
-What was it like to kill a man?
You don't want to know.
Now close it up.
Walt!
Walt!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
- Relax, you can't get out of there.
- You let me out right now !
Let me out.
You fuck let me out, I'll fucking kill you.
Shut the fuck up!
You want to know what is like to kill a man?
Well, that's goddamn awful.
The only thing worse is get a medal of valor for killing some poor kids... that wanted just to give up that's all.
Yeah, some scared little gook, just like you.
I shot them right in a face with that rifle you were holding in there a while ago.
So if the day goes by that I don't think about it.
You don't want that on your soul.
I got blood on my hands.
I am soiled.
That's why I am going alone tonight.
Walt, you take me with you right now!
let me out!
Look, you've come a long way.
I am proud to say that you are my friend.
But you got your whole life ahead of you.
But me, I finished things.
That's what I do, and I am going alone.
No, wait.
Walt!
Walt!
I need you to watch my dog.
Yeah I love you too.
Yeah, she is old too.
Her name is Daisy.
- Hello.
- It is Walt.
The keys to my house are under the ceramic turtle on the from porch.
Let yourself in.
Your brother is in the basement.
I gotta go.
Sorry father, we have to go.
I am telling if we are not here there will be a bloodshed.
We've been here for hours.
We can't afford to anchor a unit down to one location.
I am bagging you to stay.
Just got a word from my sergeant, we're pulling the plug.
- I am staying.
- No, you aren't.
We have specific orders you came with us, you are leaving with us.
Watch your head.
Sue, over here, over here.
Unlock this right now.
He left without me.
He went to Smokie without me.
Tao!
Any swamp rats in there.
- I didn't know your ass would came.
-Shut up, gook.
I have nothing to say to you, shrimp dick, lizard like you.
Yeah, yeah.
You go ahead watch out for your boyfriend.
Cause it was either he or you or something who raped one of their own family.
You own blood, for Christ sake.
Now go ahead and pull those pistols, like miniature cowboys.
Go ahead.
So where's Tao at?
That pussy motherfucker not gonna come.
Don't worry about Tao.
Tao's got not one second for you.
Says who?
You?
What the fuck you gonna do, old man?
What are you gonna do?
You bitch.
- Kind of jumpy, aren't we?
- Shut the fuck up.
You should the fuck up!
- Got a light?
- What the fuck?
No...
Me...
I've got a light...
"Hail Mary, full of grace..."
Yes, sergeant.
- What happened?
- You need to step back.
- He is a friend of mine.
- Said step back.
Hey, did you hear him?
Step back.
- What happened?
- Hey, step back.
He is my friend!
- Officer Chang!
Get those people back.
- Hey, step back now, Ok.
Get the fuck out of here!
Walt Kowalski once said to me that I didn't know anything about life or death.
Because I was an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who held the hands of superstitious old women and promised they eternity.
Walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it.
But he was right.
I knew really nothing about life or death, until I got to know Walt.
And boy did I learn.
And I want to leave my house to the church becouse Dorothy would've liked it now which brings to out last item.
And again please excuse the language... ..in Mr. Kowalski's will, I'm simply reading it as it was written.
And I'd like to leave my 1972 Gran Torino to... my friend...
Tao Vang Lor.
Under the condition that you... don't choptop top the roof like one of those beaners don't paint any idiotic flames on it like some white-trash hillbilly and don't put a big gay spoiler on the rear end
like you see on all the other zipper heads's cars.
It just looks like hell.
If you If you can refrain from doing any of that, it's yours.
I'm real sorry about Dorothy, Walt.
She was a real peach.
Thanks for coming, Al.
Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
Father.
Spirit.
Uh.
Holy Spirit.
WOMAN:
It's okay, I can move down.
Spectacles, testicles, wallet, and watch.
[CHILDREN LAUGH]
Look at the way the old man glared at Ashley.
Can't even tone it down for Mom's funeral.
What do you expect?
Dad's still living in the '50s.
He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly.
Well, your kid's wearing a Lions jersey.
I'm sure Dad appreciates that.
The point is that there's nothing anyone can do that won't disappoint the old man.
It's inevitable.
You know, that's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings.
You know, that deal with the boat motor, the broken birdbath.
It's always something.
What are we gonna do with him?
Don't you think he's gonna get in trouble, all by himself in the old neighborhood?
Well, why don't you have him move in with you?
[CHUCKLES]
Ha, ha, ha.
Hey.
Shh.
Death is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics.
Bitter in the pain, sweet in the salvation.
Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased and their families.
Sweet to those of us who know the salvation that awaits.
And some may ask, "What is death?
Is it the end?
Or is it the beginning?
And what is life?
What is this thing we call life?"
[BEEPS]
-All these questions can frustrate you.
KAREN:
Ashley, stop it.
JANOVICH:
That's why you have to turn to the Lord.
Jesus.
JANOVICH:
Because the Lord is the sweetness....
WOMAN:
This is so good.
MAN:
Did you have a chance to call Martha?
DAVID:
Is that Dad?
DANIEL:
No.
That's Grandpa Walt.
"Third platoon, E company, March 2nd, 1 952, Korea"?
Where's Korea?
A lot of people showed up after the service.
Well, I suppose they heard there's gonna be a lot of ham.
I'll go down in the basement and get some chairs.
-Oh, I can do that, Dad.
-No, I need them now, not next week.
Cool, I found a medal.
Look at this.
How much longer do we have to stay?
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell, and I'm bored.
Ashley, why don't you go help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?
-Me?
-Yes, you.
Go.
Go help him.
Grandpa Walt, would you like some help with this?
With your chairs?
No.
You probably just painted your nails.
KAREN:
Honey, come here.
Okay, well, your dad is driving me crazy.
-Why did you make me do that?
KAREN:
It's okay.
We're leaving soon.
W ALT :
Hey, girl.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come with me.
[PEOPLE SPEAKING IN HMONG]
How many swamp rats can you get in one room?
[SPITS]
[SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE]
Wow.
Grandpa, when did you get the vintage car?
1 972.
I never knew you had a cool old car.
Yeah.
Well, it's been here since before you were born.
So what are you gonna do with it when you, like, die?
What about that super-cool retro couch you have in the den?
Because I'm going to state next year and it would look really good in my room, and I don't have any furniture at all.
Oh, God.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
-Who are you?
What do you want?
-Hi.
-I live--
-Get the shit out of your mouth.
-Tell me what you want.
-Do you have jumper cables?
-My uncle's car is old and--
-We don't have any cables.
And have some respect, zipperhead.
We're in mourning here.
-How you holding up, Walt?
-Mr.
Kowalski.
Huh?
Mr. Kowalski, that's my name.
Right.
Mr. Kowalski.
Your wife and I became quite close these last few months.
She asked that I watch over you when she passed on.
I told her I watch over my flock.
But she made me promise I'd keep an extra-sharp eye on you.
Look, I appreciate the kindness you've shown to my wife.
Now that you've spoken your piece why don't you go tend to some of your other sheep?
Okay?
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her desire for you to go to confession.
She said she couldn't remember the last time you went.
-Is that so?
-It is.
Well, I confess that I never really cared for church very much.
The only reason I went was because of her.
And I confess that I have no desire to confess to a boy that's just out of the seminary.
[CHATTERING IN HMONG]
MAN:
Great to see you.
-Bye, dear.
-So long, Walt.
WOMAN:
Walt, can you get it started?
WALT:
Yeah, it'll be fine.
I wish I could help, Dad, but I gotta get the kids home.
-Kids are getting restless.
-Yeah, fine.
Just go.
I'll call you, see how you're doing.
All right.
Kill you to buy American?
Jesus.
Did you see the way he looked at the truck?
It's always rice-burner this, Jap-burner that, you know?
-Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go.
-He didn't say anything.
-He didn't need to.
-What do you expect?
The man worked at Ford all those years.
-I suppose that's my goddamn fault.
-Just give it a rest, just drive, okay?
Kids, want the radio on?
Anyone wanna listen to some music?
Good.

I want my daughter to find another husband.
If she married again there would be a man in the house.
[IN HMONG] What about Thao?
The man of the house is right there.

Look at him washing dishes.
He does whatever his sister orders him to do.
How could he ever become the man of the house?
Be patient, once he's older, he will be the man of the house.
No way.
[IN HMONG] Today is a blessed day, for a child is born.
I offer food to nurture this child's body.

The child is blessed with a mother and father.
Oh, spirit of this child return home and do not wander anymore.
Come home, spirit and soul, come home.
Live a good life and grow old.
Jesus.
Polarski would roll over in his grave if he could see his lawn now.
What the hell did Chinks have to move into this neighborhood for?
[IN HMONG] Why does that old white man stay here?
All the Americans have moved out of this neighborhood.
Why haven't you gone?
Why don't you strut away, you dumb rooster?
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Are you gone completely deaf or something?
Hi there, Walt.
I'm not a friend of yours, so why do you insist on calling me Walt?
Sorry.
Mr. Kowalski.
-What are you peddling today, Padre?
-Nothing.
I thought I'd drop by and see you.
I haven't seen you in church.
Now that you've done your good deed, why don't you take off down the road?
-I'd really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.
-Not in this lifetime, sonny.
Why?
Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
-You don't wanna know.
-No, I do.
Well, I think you're an over-educated 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold hands of ladies who are superstitious and promises them eternity.

Hey, Father J.

Hey there, Darrell.
-Hello, Father.
-Hi, Walt.
What brings you in here, Father?
The meat raffle?
No, I just came down to talk to Walt, if that's okay.
Damn, Padre, you are persistent, aren't you?
I promised your wife.
All right.
Let's get a booth.
I'll have a Pabst and a shot of Jack and whatever he's having.
-I'll have a Diet Coke.
-Bullshit, this is a bar.
You have a drink.
-Um, I'll have a gin and tonic.

So what do you want?
I promised your wife I'd get you to go to confession.
Now, why would you do that?
She was very insistent.
She made me.
You're kind of fond of promising things you can't deliver on.
Right, Father?
-Let's talk about something else.
-What?
Life and death.
Life and death.
What the hell do you know about life and death?
I'd like to think I know a lot.
I'm a priest.
Yeah.
You get up and preach about life and death but all you know is what you learned in priest school.
Right out of the rookie preacher's handbook.
I don't know about that.
I think--
Death is bittersweet.
Sort of bitter in its pain, but sweet in its salvation.
That's what you know about life and death, and it's pathetic.
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?
I know a lot.
I lived for almost three years in Korea with it.
Thanks.
We shot men stabbed them with bayonets, hacked 1 7-year-olds to death with shovels.
Stuff I'll remember till the day I die.
Horrible things, but things I'll live with.
And what about life?
Well, I survived the war.
Got married, had a family.
Sounds like you know a lot more about death than you do living.
Maybe so, Father.
Maybe so.

When things go wrong, you gotta act quickly.
When we were in Korea and a thousand screaming gooks came across our line we didn't call the police, we reacted.
We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski.
I've been thinking about our conversation on life and death.
About what you said.
About how you carry around all the horrible things you were forced to do horrible things that won't leave you.
It seems it would do you good to unload some of that burden.
Things done during war are terrible.
Being ordered to kill.
Killing to save yourself, killing to save others.
You're right.
Those are things I know nothing about but I do know about forgiveness and I've seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins admitted their guilt, and left their burdens behind them.
Stronger men than you.
Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things and are now at peace.
Well, I gotta hand it to you, Padre.
You came here with your guns loaded this time.
Thank you.
And you're right about one thing.
About stronger men than me reaching their salvation.
Well, halle-fucking-lujah.
But you're wrong about something else.
What's that, Mr. Kowalski?
The thing that haunts a man the most is what he isn't ordered to do.
There.
You finally look like a human being again.
You shouldn't wait so long between haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch.
Yeah.
Well, I'm surprised you're still around.
I was always hoping you'd die and they'd get somebody who knew what they were doing.
Instead you just keep hanging around like the doo-wop dago you are.
-That'll be 10 bucks, Walt.
-Ten bucks?
Jesus Christ, Martin.
What are you, half Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices.
It's been 10 bucks for the last five years, you hard-nosed, Polack son of a bitch.
-Yeah, well, keep the change.
-See you in three weeks, prick.
Not if I see you first, dipshit.
Since everything could go downhill after that.
-Yeah, that's true.
-That would suck.
-That's cool, you know?
Yeah.
MAN:
Ain't shit going on, man.
Ain't shit going on.
Man, look at this.
Look at this, Monk.
Check this out.
MONK:
Oooh.
Boy.
DUKE:
Oh, yeah.
Bring that little tight ass over here.
Come here, girl.
Don't be shy.
What, you can't say hi?
Why you acting all stuck-up and shit?
-What you supposed to be, man?
-Yo, it's cool, dog.
What the fuck you doing in my neighborhood, boy?
Nothing.
Just going down to Corner Spot, you know?
Get some CDs.
It's all good, bro.
See, he called you bro, Duke.
-He called you bro, man.
-It's all good, bro.
DUKE:
It's all good, huh?
MONK:
Shut the fuck up.
Call me bro again, man, I'll bite your motherfucking face off.
MONK:
Yeah, motherfucker.
Now, what the fuck y'all come down here for?
You here to bring me this little present?
Monk?
She bringing it to us?
This little Oriental yummy.
Don't worry.
I'm gonna take real good care of her.
-Fuck out of here, man.
-Fuck out of here, man.
[MEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
-I told you we're finished here.
MONK:
Oh, yeah.
Keep your ass right here.
Oh, great.
Another asshole who has a fetish for Asian girls?
God, that gets so old.
MONK:
Oh, shit.
-What's your name, girl?
My name?
Get your ass out of here, okay?
It's "Take your crude come-on to every woman who walks past and cram it." That's my name.
DUKE:
Mouthy little bitch.
-Who you think you talking to?
-Who does it look like?
-You think you real funny, don't you?
-Oh, shit.
Ain't she tough?
What?
You gonna hit me now?
That would pretty much complete the picture.
You need to keep your bitch on a leash.
Put a chain on that whore and yank that motherfucker.
Of course.
Right to the stereotype thesaurus.
Call me a whore and a bitch in the same sentence.
-This bitch is crazy.
DUKE:
I like them like that.
Man, take this bitch.
SUE:
Hey.
Get off me.
-You don't know when to quit, do you?
DUKE:
I'm gonna teach her a lesson.
SUE:
Stop.
Let go.
Get your ass over there.
What the fuck you looking at, old man?
-What the hell are you spooks up to?
-Spooks?
You better get your ass on, honky, while I still let you.
-That's what you better do.
-That's right, bitch.
Fuck you think you at?
Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while that you shouldn't have fucked with?
That's me.
Man, you fucking crazy, man.
Get out of here, man.
Why don't you get your ass up out of here before I kick your old, wrinkly, white ass?
Crazy motherfucker, man.
What's wrong with him, man?
What the fuck?
-This motherfucker crazy, man.
-What's wrong with this nigga, man?
What the hell?
Get in the truck.
This crazy motherfucker, man.
What's wrong with him, man?
MONK:
He put his finger at us.
-Oh, shit.
-Come on, now.
Hey, pops.
Come on, now.
Shut your fucking face.
You fucking don't listen, do you?
Now, get in the truck.
-Go on, get in the truck now.
Shit.
TREY:
Way to go, old man.
Shut up, pussy.
What is all this "bro" shit, anyway?
Want to be Super Spade or something?
These guys don't want to be your bro and I don't blame them.
Now, get your ofay, Paddy ass on down the road.
Take care, now.
Yeah, you too.
Oh, yeah.
Fuck, man, why y'all didn't fucking do nothing?
-Man, kick that nigga's ass.
-Man, you fucking--
Shit, man.
This fucker.
He had that cannon in your fucking face.
-You didn't do nothing.
-Trying to stay out.
What's the matter with you, for chrissake?
Trying to get yourself killed?
I thought you Asian girls were supposed to be smart.
Hanging around a neighborhood like that's a fast way to get you in the obituaries.
I know.
I know.
Take it easy.
And what about that goofball guy you were with?
Is that a date or something?
Yeah.
Kind of.
His name is Trey.
Well, you shouldn't be hanging out with him.
You should be hanging out with your own people, with other Humongs.
You mean Hmong?
We're Hmong, not "Humong."
Whatever.
Where the hell is Humong, I mean Hmong, anyway?
[SUE LAUGHS]
Wow.
You're so enlightened, you know that?
No, Hmong isn't a place.
It's a people.
Hmong people come from different parts of Laos, Thailand, and China.
Yeah.
Well, how did you end up in my neighborhood, then?
Why didn't you stay there?
It's a Vietnam thing.
We fought on your side.
And when the Americans quit, the Communists started killing all the Hmong.
So we came over here.
Yeah.
Well, I don't know how you ended up in the Midwest.
There's snow on the ground six months out of the year.
Why does a jungle people want to be in the great frozen tundra?
Hill people.
We were hill people.
Not jungle people.
Booga-booga-booga.
Yeah.
Whatever.
Blame the Lutherans.
They brought us over here.
Everybody blames the Lutherans.
[CHUCKLES]
Well, you'd think the cold would keep all the idiots out.
Thanks for the ride.
You know something, kid?
You're all right.
But what about that dimwit brother of yours?
-He a little slow or something?
-Thao is actually really smart.
He just doesn't know which direction to go in.
-Yeah.
Poor Toad.
-It's really common.
Hmong girls over here fit in better.
The girls go to college, and the boys go to jail.
Yeah.
That old hag hates my ass.
Well....
"Your birthday today." Daisy.
"This year, you have to make a choice between two life paths.
Second chances come your way.
Extraordinary events culminate in what might seem to be an anticlimax.
Your lucky numbers are 84, 23 11 , 78, and 99."
What a load of shit.
Yeah.
[GRUNTING]
[BOYS LAUGHING]
What the hell is it with kids nowadays?
All right.
THAO:
Hey, Mrs. V. Here, let me help you with those.
MRS. V:
Oh, thank you.
I just-- THAO:
I got it.
How about that?
THAO:
Here you go.
-How about that, Daisy?
THAO:
Yeah, I got it.
MRS. V.:
That was too heavy for the bag.
THAO:
No problem.
-Thank you.
-Go ahead, Karen, give it to him.
-Here you go.
-Well, what is it?
-It's a Gopher.
So you can reach stuff.
You know, it makes things a lot easier.
This is from me.
It's a phone.
-Oh, I can see that.
-I just thought--
Well, we thought that it would make things easier.
Well, thank you, Karen.
There's nothing wrong with making things less hard on yourself.
Karen's right, Dad.
You've worked hard your whole life.
Maybe it's time you started thinking about, you know, taking it easier.
Jeez.
That's another thing, Dad.
You really should get rid of the coffin nails.
But, I don't know, we were thinking about the house.
You know, what with Mom gone, it's gotta be a lot to maintain around here.
-Mm-hm.
-Let alone clean.
And, I don't know, you're here all alone.
Yeah, and there are these great places now, you know, these communities where you don't have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow where the people are like you, active and alert, but are alone and would benefit from being around folks their own age.
Yeah, Dad, look.
You gotta check it out.
We've brought some brochures.
These places are nothing like what you'd think they'd be.
-They're great.
-No, no, beautiful.
They're really nice.
They really are.
These are top-notch, like, resorts.
-It's like staying in a hotel practically.
-They're beautiful.
MITCH:
They really are.
-Yeah.
They take care of everything.
They'll clean up.
They're really nice.
They have wonderful stores.
You can buy new shoes.
MITCH:
They're amazing.
They really are.
KAREN:
You'd have a good time.
-Play some golf, maybe.
MITCH:
Meet other people.
Son of a bitch.
Kicking us out on his birthday.
-I told you this was a bad idea.
-I know.
You were right.
-He won't let anybody help him.
-Well, we tried.
Can we just drop it?
No one can say we didn't try.
The hell with him.
You know what we should've done?
We should've stayed home with Josh and Ashley.
At least they were smart enough to not come.
Goddamn kids have more sense than we do.
WALT:
We miss Mama, don't we, Daisy?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKING IN HMONG]
SUE:
Hey, Walt.
What are you up to?
We're having a barbecue.
You wanna come over?
-What do you think?
-There's tons of food.
Yeah.
Just keep your hands off my dog.
-No worries.
We only eat cats.
-Really?
No, I'm kidding, you moron.
Come on, you can be my special guest.
No, I'm fine right here.
Yeah.
[GROANS]
-Son of a bitch.
-Okay, so, what have you had to eat today?
Oh, I had a piece of cake and a little beef jerky.
Come on over and get something to eat.
We've got beer too.
Well, I might as well drink with strangers rather than drink alone.
After all, it is my birthday.
-Really?
Happy birthday, Wally.
-Don't call me Wally.
WALT:
Well, no Pabst, but plenty of beer.
-As they say, when in Humong.
-Ha, ha.
Hey, what am I doing wrong?
Every time I look at somebody, they look at the ground.
You're fine.
[SPEAKING IN HMONG]
WALT:
What's she saying?
-She said welcome to her home.
-Oh, no, she's not.
-Yeah, no, she didn't.
-She hates me.
Come on.
-Yeah, she hates you.
Okay.
Hey.
[PEOPLE MURMURING]
Hey, what are all you fish heads looking at anyway?
I think we should go into the other room.
Sorry.
SUE:
A lot of people in this house are very traditional.
Number one, never touch a Hmong person on their head, not even a child.
Hmong people believe that the soul resides on the head, so don't do that.
Well, sounds dumb, but fine.
Yeah, and a lot of Hmong people consider looking someone in the eye to be very rude.
That's why they look away when you look at them.
-Anything else?
-Yeah.
Some Hmong people tend to smile or grin when they're yelled at.
It's a cultural thing.
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity.
It's not that they're laughing at you or anything.
Yeah.
God, you people are nuts.
But the food does look good.
Smells good too.
Well, of course.
It's Hmong food.
Yeah.
Okay.
Can I come back for seconds?
-Here you go.
-Thanks.
You know, you mentioned about looking at people.
-He's been staring at me the whole evening.
-That's Kor Khue.
He's the Lor family shaman.
And what's that, some sort of a witch doctor or something?
-Something like that.
-Yeah.
Booga-booga.
Ha, ha.
Very funny, Wally.
[BOTH SPEAKING IN HMONG]
Kor Khue's interested in you.
He heard what you did.
He would like to read you.
It'd be rude not to allow him this.
It's a great honor.
-Yeah, sure, fine by me.
Sure.
-All right.
Take a seat.
WALT:
Here?
He says that people do not respect you.
They don't even wanna look at you.
He says the way you live, your food has no flavor.
You're worried about your life.
You made a mistake in your past life, like a mistake that you did you're not satisfied with.
He says you have no happiness in your life.
It's like you're not at peace.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm....
Yeah, I'm fine.
Fine.
I'm fine.
God, I've got more in common with these gooks than I do my own spoilt rotten family.
Jesus Christ.
Happy birthday.
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
You were bleeding.
No, I bit my tongue.
It's nothing.
Why don't we go and get some of that good gook food?
-You know, I'm starving.
-Okay.
Fantastic.
Well, you ladies are wonderful.
This stuff is really good.
Come on, you glutton.
-What's up?
-Let's go.
-What for?
SUE:
To mingle.
Mingle?
We're mingling right here.
Come on.
You told me not to leave you alone.
Thank you very much, but I have to go now.
I have to go now.
I'll be back.
Now, don't let anything go away.
[MUSIC PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]
Oh, great.
Well, well, well.
Look who's over there.
-Yeah, the kid who stole my Gran Torino.
-My brother, Thao.
Tried to, anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah, Toad.
It was a little wobbly, but that should fix it.
YOUA:
So where are you guys from?
-I'm not far from here.
-I'm from Texas.
-What's this?
-A little rice liquor.
Here, try it.
All right.
My friends and I were just wondering what you're doing here.
Well, that's a good question.
What am I doing here?
-Name's Walt.
-Hi, Walt.
I'm Youa.
-Yuam.
A pleasure.
-No.
Youa.
Youa, okay.
So, what do you do?
-Oh, I fix things, stuff like that.
-Like what?
Well, I just fixed that dryer there, I fixed my wife's friend's sink and I took old Aunt Mary to the doctor's to get her prescription fixed up.
And then I even fixed a door that hadn't even broken yet.
You're funny.
I've been called a lot of things, but never funny.
-Well, I'm gonna take off.
Enjoy yourself.
-Okay.
Yum Yum.
Pleasure.
Look, she's going, man.
Come on.
MAN:
Youa, wait up.
Relax, zipperhead.
I'm not gonna shoot you.
I'd look down too, if I was you.
I knew you were a dipshit the first time I ever saw you but I never thought you were worse with women than you are at stealing cars, Toad.
-It's Thao.
-What?
It's not Toad, it's Thao.
My name is Thao.
Yeah, well, you're blowing it with that girl who was there.
Not that I give two shits about a toad like you.
-You don't know what you're talking about.
-You're wrong.
I know exactly what I'm talking about.
I may not be the most pleasant person to be around but I got the best woman that was ever on this planet to marry me.
I worked at it.
It was the best thing that ever happened to me.
But you, you know, you're letting Click Clack, Ding Dong, and Charlie Chan just walk out with Miss What's-Her-Face.
She likes you, you know?
Though I don't know why.
Who?
Yum Yum.
You know, the girl in the purple sweater.
She's been looking at you all day, stupid.
You mean Youa.
Yeah, Yum Yum, yeah.
Nice girl.
Nice girl.
A very charming girl.
I talked with her.
Yeah.
But you, you let her just walk right out with the Three Stooges.
And you know why?
Because you're a big, fat pussy.
Well I gotta go.
Good day, puss-cake.
[WOMEN SPEAKING IN HMONG]
No.
No more.
Well, okay, put them over there.
Bye-bye.
No, no.
No, no more.
No more.
Come on.
No more, now.
No more, please.
I--
Is this that chicken-dumpling thing you brought the other--?
Oh, all right.
Come on, ladies.
Certainly better than beef jerky, I'll tell you.
What's going on?
Thao is here to make amends.
He's here to work for you.
[VU SPEAKING IN HMONG]
No, he isn't.
He's not gonna work for me.
My mom said he dishonored the family and now he has to work off his debt.
-He'll start tomorrow morning.
-Not tomorrow, not any time.
I don't even want him on my property.
I thought we went over all that.
It's very important that you accept, and it would be an insult if you refuse.
Why is this being put back on me?
He's the one who tried to steal my car.
All of a sudden, I'm the bad guy in this.
Look, my family is very traditional and would be very much upset if you don't let Thao repay.
If he doesn't wanna do it, then let's just go.
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Yeah.
Shut up.
All right.
Tomorrow, come on.
Tomorrow.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thank you.
Jesus, Joseph, and Mary, these Hmong broads are like badgers.
Son of a bitch, I never thought he'd show.
All right.
What are you good at?
Like what?
Well, that's what I'm asking.
If you're gonna work for me, I gotta know what you're good at.
I gotta know what you can do.
I don't know.
Well, that's kind of halfway what I expected you to say.
You see that tree right there?
You just go over there and count the birds.
You want me to count the birds?
Yeah, you can count.
All you slopes are supposed to be good at math, right?
-Yeah, I can count.
-Good.
One, two....
So, what do you have for me today?
You want me to watch paint dry?
-Maybe even count the clouds that pass by?
-Don't get flip with me, boy.
I'm not the one who tried to steal.
Don't you forget that.
Go ahead.
I don't care if you insult me or say racist things.
Because you know what?
I'll take it.
Yeah, course you'll take it, because you have no teeth, you have no balls, kid.
Look, I'm stuck here so why don't you just find something useful for me to do?
Because unlike you, I'm not useless, and I maintain my own property.
You swamp rats, on the other hand, you just can't help but....
How long do I have you for?
-Toad?
How long?
-Till next Friday.
Yeah.
[CHUCKLES]
All right.
Go get the ladder out of the garage.
When you get finished with that roof there, you can take that gutter and nail it back up.
I'm tired of looking at it the last three years.
[MAN SPEAKING IN HMONG]
Yeah.
Yeah, you said it, brother.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
Hello.
Grandpa says he wants to know if you can have Thao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch.
Wasp nest?
Well, that's terrible.
Yeah, well, I think we can handle that after lunch.
[GIRL SPEAKING IN HMONG]
[DOORBELL RINGING]
[COUGHING]
Jesus, Lord Almighty, knock it off.
Hey, it's my last day.
So, what else do you have for me to do?
Take the day off.
You've done enough.
Toad.
Nothing, never mind.
WOMAN:
The doctor will see you now.
Thank you.
Koski?
Mr. Kowalski?
Good morning.
I looked over your paperwork and I think we should immediately start a full battery of tests.
I feel that this would be the best way to go about...
-...checking out the issues that you've had--
-Excuse me.
What happened to Dr. Feldman, my regular doctor?
Dr. Feldman retired three years ago.
I'm his replacement, Dr. Chu.
[PHONE RINGING]
-It's Grandpa Walt.
-Pick it up.
-You talk to him.
-Mitch.
-I'm doing bills here.
KAREN:
You talk to him.
He's your father.
Hey, Dad.
WALT:
Hi, Mitch, it's-
- It's me, your dad.
Yeah, I know.
What's up?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing much, really.
-How's everything going?
-I'm fine.
Fine.
Doing fine.
Fine.
Good.
How about Karen and the kids?
Fine, everybody's great.
Doing fine.
-Good.
How about work?
-Busy.
- Yeah.
-Yeah, I suppose.
In fact, speaking of busy, I got a lot on my plate right now so if there's not something pressing....
No.
No, not at all.
So why don't you call me this weekend?
Sure.
Okay.
It was nice talking to you, Dad.
Thanks for calling.
Thanks.
Yeah.
[L.P., BUDDAH, CUZZ L.B.'S "APPRECIATION" PLAYS ON CAR STEREO]
This kid doesn't have a chance.
-What do you know about faucets?
-I know a lot about them, boy.
Stand aside.
-Jesus.
For the love of Pete.
-What?
It must be a hundred degrees in here.
Why don't you turn on the fan?
The place is falling apart.
THAO:
Man, where'd you get all this stuff?
-What are you talking about?
-All the tools and stuff.
Well, it may come as a surprise to a thief but I bought this stuff, everything in here, with my own money.
Yeah, yeah.
That's not what I meant.
I mean, there's just so much shit packed in here.
Yeah.
Well, every tool in here has a purpose.
Everything has a job to do.
They're all to use if necessary.
Okay, so, what's that?
-That's a post-hole digger.
-That?
Vise grips.
-That?
-Wire cutters.
You know it's a trowel, come on.
Those are shears there, and that's a saw.
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me, kid.
All right, what's on your mind?
It's just, I can't afford to buy all this stuff.
Well, I guess even a bonehead like you could understand that a man acquires this over a period of 50 years.
-Yeah, but....
-All right, look, here.
Take these three items, right here.
You can have this.
WD-40, vise grips and some duct tape.
Any man worth his salt can do half of the household chores with just those three things.
Anything else you need, you just borrow it, that's all.
Okay.
Cool.
[COUGHING]
-Fuck me.
-What's with that?
Nothing.
What?
Nothing, huh?
I just saw you coughed up blood.
That's not good.
You should really see a doctor.
Yeah.
Look those guys who were here the other night, on my lawn.
What about them?
Just a gang, a bunch of Hmong gangbangers.
Yeah, I assumed that, but what were they doing here?
They were gonna take me away.
They were kind of pissed that I blew my first initiation.
Yeah.
Well, you are a pussy, you know, you wanna hang out with guys like that.
What was your initiation supposed to be?
My Gran Torino?
Christ all Friday.
Shit.
Toad, you got a minute?
All right.
Okay.
Here it is.
Here's the deal.
I take the top because that's the heaviest.
I pull on that, and you stand right back here and you push and help me push it up each step.
-Just like that.
-Then let me take the top.
No, no, I've got the top.
Really, I'll take the top.
It looks heavy.
Look, I'm not crippled.
I've got the top.
If you don't let me take the top, I ain't helping.
-Now, listen to me, zipperhead--
-No, you listen, old man.
I'm here because you needed help.
So it's either top or I'm out of here.
[GROWLS]
All right.
You take the top, and I'll push.
Just don't let it slip out of your little-girl hands and crush me.
Don't give me any ideas, now.
-That thing weighs a ton.
-Yeah.
It runs like a clock, though.
They just don't make them like this anymore.
So, what are you gonna do with it?
Sell it, I guess.
How much?
60 bucks.
They....
I'm tired of having it sit around down in the basement there.
Why?
You looking for a freezer?
The downstairs one kind of died.
Okay. 25 bucks and it's yours.
Twenty-five?
But you just said 60.
I know, but this'll save me money putting an ad in the paper.
-Come on, let's wheel it over to your place.
-All right.
Okay.
-Kind of ironic, huh?
WALT:
What?
Toad washing the car that he tried to steal from you.
Yeah.
He misses one spot, he's doing it all over again too.
It's nice of you to look after him like this.
He doesn't have any real role models in his life.
Well, I'm not any role model.
But you're a good man, Wally.
I wish our father would've been more like you.
-Don't go calling me Wally.
-No, I'm serious.
He was really hard on us, really traditional, and really old-school.
-Yeah, well, I'm old-school.
-Yeah, but you're an American.
What's that supposed to mean?
You like him, don't you?
Are you kidding?
He tried to steal my car.
Uh-huh.
And you spend time with him teach him how to fix things, saved him from that fucked cousin of ours.
-Hey.
Watch your language, lady.
-And you're a good man.
I'm not a good man.
Get me another beer, dragon lady.
This one's empty.
You know, the Hmong consider gardening to be women's work.
Yeah.
That's probably why I see you in the garden over there all the time.
Besides, we ain't in Humong.
Funny.
You know, you should quit.
That's bad for you.
Yeah?
So is being in a gang, dipshit.
Didn't you hear what I just said?
I saw you cough up blood.
You should quit.
So, what's that emblem supposed to mean anyway?
Is it your ancient Cub Scout emblem?
First Cavalry.
I've had it since '51 .
So, what do you want to do with your life, kid?
Well, I was thinking about maybe sales.
Sales, huh?
My oldest son is in sales.
-Does he do well?
-Oh, yeah.
License to steal.
I work in the Ford factory for 50 years, and he's out selling Japanese cars.
-You made cars?
-Yeah.
I put the steering column in this Gran Torino in 1 972, right on the line.
Oh, you are old.
So cool.
Yeah.
So you wanna be in sales.
You thinking about going to school maybe?
-Kind of, but school costs money.
-Well, maybe you should get a job.
You can't just sit there and spread mulch in my garden the rest of your life.
-Well, maybe you could just pay me.
-Yeah.
Very funny.
Well, what kind of job could I ever get?
Yeah.
You're right.
Nobody would ever hire you.
Yeah, I know.
Look, I'm just kidding, zip.
I mean, you could get a job.
-You could get a job anywhere.
-Like what?
-Well, how about construction?
-Me?
-Yeah.
-Construction?
-You have Alzheimer's or something?
-No.
You could get a job in construction.
I know people in the trades.
Course, I have to make a little adjustment and man you up a little bit.
-Man me up?
-Yeah.
And I think you ought to date Miss Yum Yum too.
Do you a little good.
You know, get a little carbon off the valves.
Now you're just gonna learn how guys talk.
You just listen to the way Martin and I batter it back and forth.
-You okay?
You ready?
-Sure.
WALT:
All right.
Let's go in.
Perfect.
A Polack and a chink.
How you doing, Martin, you crazy Italian prick?
You cheap bastard, I should've known you'd come in.
I was having such a pleasant day.
What'd you do, Jew some poor blind guy out of his money?
-Gave him the wrong change?
-Who's the Nip?
Oh, he's a pussy kid from next door.
I'm just trying to man him up a little bit.
Mm.
You see, kid?
Now, that's how guys talk to one another.
-They do?
-What, you got shit in your ears?
Now go on out and come back in, and talk to him like a man.
Like a real man.
-Come on, Walt.
-Come on.
Get your ass out of here.
And come on back now.
-Sorry about this.
-It's okay.
What's up, you old Italian prick?
Get out of my shop before I blow your head off...
-...you goddamn dick-smoking gook!
-Jesus Christ.
Oh, shit.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
But that's what you said.
That what you said men say.
You don't just come in and insult the man in his shop.
You don't do that.
What happens if you meet some stranger and get the wrong one?
-He's gonna blow your gook head right off.
-What should I have said, then?
Yeah, kid, why don't you start with "Hi" or "Hello"?
Yeah, just come in and say:
"Sir, I'd like a haircut, if you have time."
Yeah, be polite, but don't kiss ass.
WALT:
You could talk about a construction job you just came from and bitch about your girlfriend and your car.
Son of a bitch, I just got my brakes fixed, and those sons of bitches really nailed me.
-I mean, they screwed me right in the ass.
WALT:
Don't swear at the guy.
Just talk about people who are not in the room.
You could bitch about your boss making you work overtime when it's bowling night.
Right.
Or my old lady bitches for two goddamn hours about how they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store and the minute I turn on the game, she starts crying how we never talk.
You see?
Now go out, come back and talk to him.
And it ain't rocket science, for chrissake.
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car or a girlfriend.
Jesus.
I should've blown his head off when I had the chance.
Yeah.
Maybe so.
Now, okay, I want you to turn around and go outside and come back, and don't talk about having no job no car, no girlfriend, no future, no dick.
Okay?
Just turn around and go.
Excuse me, sir.
I need a haircut, if you ain't too busy.
You old Italian son-of-a-bitch prick barber.
Boy, does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job.
Fuck me.
Jesus Christ.
-All set to go through with it, right?
-Yeah, yeah.
Don't "Yeah, yeah" me.
Just say, "Yes, sir," and, "I'll do my best."
THAO:
Yes.
I'll do my best.
Because when I vouch for somebody, that means I've given my word.
-And I don't want you making me look bad.
-No, I'm good.
Totally into this.
Don't lay down, either.
Just look them straight in the eye.
And a man can tell a lot by your handshake.
-Here.
Put those in your back pocket.
-Cool.
Don't blow this.
Hey, Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon.
How the hell are you?
-I'm shitty, but who's gonna listen?
WALT:
Not me, that's for sure.
Help yourself, there, Walt.
You dumb Polack.
Okay, this is the kid I was telling you about.
Thao, this is Tim Kennedy.
He's the super on this job.
TIM:
So, what do we got here, Walt?
Well, he knows construction, and he's a smart kid.
He'll do anything you need him for.
-You sure?
-Yeah.
-You speak English?
-Yes, sir.
-Were you born here?
-You bet.
I see that Walt drove you here.
You got a vehicle?
Not at the moment.
Taking the bus for now.
The bus.
Jesus Christ, you don't have a car?
My head gasket cracked.
And the goddamn prick at the shop wants to bend me over for 2 100.
Oh, please.
I replaced the tranny in my Tahoe, and the sons of bitches fucked me hard.
-Just under 3200.
-Goddamn thieves.
It ain't right.
You got that right.
Okay, come on in on Monday, and we'll find something for you to do.
-Thanks, Mr. Kennedy.
-It's Tim.
And what's your name again?
-Thao.
-"Tuh," okay.
You owe me one, Walt.
Yeah.
Well, I'll buy you a fruitcake for Christmas.
Fuck the fruitcake.
How about you just hand over them keys to that Gran Torino?
-Why the hell does everybody want my car?
-Well, I'm not surprised.
Yeah, you don't know the half of it.
All right, come on, zipperhead.
We'll let the mick stay here and play with himself.
What are we doing?
What do you wanna do?
Carry your tools in a rice bag?
Here we are.
You can use one of these.
And you'll need one of these.
Here.
THAO:
I can't afford any of this.
WALT:
I'll cover it.
You can pay me back on your first paycheck.
THAO:
Cool.
-Here.
You'll need something like that.
Now, this is what I'm looking for.
Here, tool belt.
-There you go.
-Not to bitch but won't I be needing some tools?
Tools I've got, but I'm not gonna lend my tool belt.
You can pick up tools as you go.
-I really appreciate all this.
-Forget it.
No.
I really do.
Thank you.
[HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR STEREO]
What's up, homeboy?
What you doing?
MAN 1 :
What up, man?
MAN 2:
What you got, punk?
-Just checking up on my little cousin.
SMOKIE:
Yeah, man.
-Our little cousin.
What's this?
SPIDER:
Where you coming from, man?
I'm coming home from work.
Not that you guys would know much about that.
SPIDER:
So it's true.
You got a job.
THAO:
You can't just leave me alone?
-What?
SMOKIE:
Hey, dog, check this out.
[SPEAKS IN HMONG]
MAN 3:
You scared, huh?
SPIDER:
Who bought this shit for you?
Your dad?
-What do you want?
-Your dad bought this?
THAO:
Keep your hands off my stuff.
SPIDER:
Give me the fucking hat.
-Why the fuck you gotta make me look bad?
THAO:
Keep your hands off my stuff!

-Yo, give me that.

That's my stuff.

Throw it over the fence, man, fuck it.

Let me go.

Hey, you little bitch.
Give me that, man.
Give me that.
[SPEAKS IN HMONG]
-What's the phrase I'm looking for?
MAN 3:
Fuck him up.
Oh, yeah.
Saving face.
[SCREAMING]
-Hey there.
-Hey.
I gotta run.
Haven't seen you in a few days.
Where you been?
-Been busy.
-Yeah.
Busy, huh?
Hey.
-What the hell happened to you?
-Don't worry about it.
What do you mean, don't worry about it?
Look at your face.
I said, don't worry about it.
Okay?
It's not your problem.
When?
Grabbed me a couple days ago, right after I got off work.
Cowards.
I did everything I could possibly do, but they broke some of your tools.
-I'll replace them.
-Don't worry about the tools.
Where does your cousin live?
No, Walt.
I'll be okay.
-I don't want you to do anything.
-All right.
If you need any extra tools, you just let me know.
Well, I could use a roofing hammer.
Good.
Go in my garage and get it.
That should be the last of them.
Hey.
All right.
Here's the deal.
You stay away from Thao, understand?
You tell your friends to stay away from Thao.
If they don't listen, tell them you don't wanna see them anymore.
That's it.
Got it?
I'll take that as a yes.
If I have to come back here it's gonna get fucking ugly.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
Get out of my way.
How do you want your dog?
I mean, steak?
THAO:
Funny.
-I told you, we only eat cats.
Yeah.
Well.
Whoa.
I've never seen you like this before.
I'm feeling good.
You know, I got beautiful women, great food.
THAO:
And Thao.
-And even Thao isn't bugging me.
-Having a good time, I see.
-Yeah.
THAO:
And it never ends.
-What happened to your knuckles anyways?
I slipped in the shower.
No big problem.
Look, now, Yum Yum, if he doesn't ask you out I'm gonna ask you out.
Youa, don't listen to him, Youa.
He's a white devil.
Yeah, I am.
I'm the white devil.
I'd love to, Walt, but he beat you to it.
Really?
No kidding.
Dinner and a movie or what?
Yeah.
They're taking the bus.
No, you can't take the bus.
We gotta get you something more stylish than that.
Like what?
Take a limo?
How about that?
-The Gran Torino?
-Yeah.
-You'd let me take the Gran Torino?
-Yeah, I'd let you take the Gran Torino.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Yeah.
Yeah.
MAN [ON TV]:
Here's the pitch.
And a strike.
[WOMEN SCREAMING]
WALT:
Is everybody all right?
[VU SPEAKING IN HMONG]
You're all right.
You're okay.
You've got a cut.
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
Where's grandma?
Where is Sue?
Where is Sue?
-She went to our aunt's.
-Your aunt's?
You sure?
-Yeah.
-Get on the phone and call right now.
[SPEAKING IN HMONG]
I knew this was gonna happen.
Tried to-
- What the hell am I doing here?
Well, maybe some of her friends called and they changed plans.
Yeah.
In the war, we just lost a lot of friends, but you're kind of set for it.
You're geared to it.
[SPEAKING IN HMONG]
No, no, no.
You fuck!
You rotten fuck!
Mr. Kowalski?
-You okay?
-Yeah.
I'm okay.
The police finally left.
No one's talking.
One thing about the Hmong, they keep their mouths shut.
Yeah, I've noticed that.
You know, Thao and Sue are never gonna find peace in this world as long as that gang's around.
Until they go away, you know, forever.
What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.
I took Sue to the hospital.
She's scared.
They're all scared.
Yeah.
Thao, especially.
He's sitting out there right now, staring at your front door.
You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.
What would you do?
-What should Thao do?
-I know what I would do if I was you.
-Or at least what you think you should do.
-Really?
If I was Thao, I guess I'd want vengeance.
I'd wanna stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys.
And you?
What would I do?
I'd come over here and talk to you, I guess.
I know you're close with these people, but this pisses me off too, Mr. Kowalski.
Want a beer?
I'd love one.
There's some in the chest right over there behind you.
Damn all this.
-Just isn't fair.
-Nothing's fair, Father.
So, what are you gonna do, Mr. Kowalski?
Call me Walt.
All right.
What are you gonna do, Walt?
I don't know but I'll think of something.
Whatever it is, they won't have a chance.
What are you doing?
-Thinking.
-Thinking?
Thinking time is over.
Now it's time to knock the shit out of those pricks.
I know you don't wanna hear this, but now's the time to stay calm.
Calm?
You want me to be calm?
We stay calm or else mistakes get made.
We have to step back from this thing.
No.
Don't let me down, Walt.
Not you.
This is gonna end today.
Sit down.
-I don't wanna sit.
-I said, sit down.
Now, listen to me.
We gotta plan this, and plan it very carefully.
We can't make any mistakes.
Now, you know I'm the right man for this job.
So I want you to go home and stay calm and come back here at 4 this afternoon.
-And what needs to be done will be done.
-I say we go now.
Right now.
And what?
Kill that cousin of yours and the rest of those zips?
Mr. Tough Guy out for blood all of a sudden?
You know nothing about it.
Now go home and you stay calm.
Come back here at 4.
All right?
Okay?
Okay.
Yeah.
I know, I know.
Give me a break, will you?
It's the first time I've ever smoked in the house.
Let a man enjoy himself, would you, girl?
All finished.
Ten dollars American.
I don't suppose your Guinea hands are steady enough to do a straight shave?
Straight shave?
You've never asked for a straight shave.
I know, but I've always wondered about it.
That's unless you're too busy.
-No, just let me heat up a towel.
-Yeah.
And here, here's a 20.
Keep the change.
That's just in case you hit my jugular.
It's gonna take about one hour.
We gonna shorten the sleeves a little bit.
Gonna fix the shoulder.
-Yeah.
I never had a fitted suit before.
-Yes, sir.
-Mm-hm.
-You look very good.
-What can I do for you, Mr. Kowalski?
-I'm here for a confession.
Oh, Lord Jesus.
What have you done?
-Nothing.
You just take it easy, now.
-What are you up to?
Are you gonna give me a confession or not?
How long has it been since your last confession?
WALT:
Oh, forever.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
What are your sins, my son?
Well, in 1 968, I kissed Betty Jablonski at the factory Christmas party.
Dorothy was in the other room with the other wives.
It just happened.
Yes, go on.
Well, I made a 900-dollar profit selling a boat and a motor.
I didn't pay the taxes.
It's the same as stealing.
Yes, fine.
Oh, lastly I was never very close with my two sons.
I don't know them.
I didn't know how.
That's it?
That's it?
It's bothered me most of my life.
Say 10 "Hail Marys" and five "Our Fathers."
God loves you and forgives you, and I absolve you of all your sins.
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Thank you, Padre.
Are you going to retaliate for what happened to Sue?
I'm going over to that house today, Mr. Kowalski.
WALT:
Is that so?
It is.
And every other day until you see the folly in what you're planning.
-Busy day.
Gotta go.
-Go in peace.
Oh, I am at peace.
Jesus Christ.
So which one's mine?
You ever fired a weapon before?
No.
Well, why don't you put that one down?
And I got something I wanna show you.
Come on.
THAO:
What?
1 952, we were sent up to take out a chink machine-gun nest.
Been shredding us up pretty good.
I was the only one that came back that day.
For that, they gave me a Silver Star.
Here it is.
Here.
I want you to have it.
Why?
Why?
Because we all knew the dangers that night, but we went anyway.
That's the way it might be tonight.
There's always a chance you don't come back.
The hell we won't.
We're gonna roll up in there and tear some ass.
That's foolish.
That's the exact reaction they're waiting for.
Go ahead and close this up.
-How many?
-How many what?
How many men did you kill in Korea?
-Thirteen.
Maybe more.
-What was it like to kill a man?
You don't wanna know.
Now close it up.
[DOOR SLAMS]
[LOCK CLICKS]
Walt.
Walt.
What are you doing?
-What are you doing?
-Relax.
You can't get out of there.
You let me out right now.
Let me out.
-Fucking let me out or I'll fucking kill you.
-Shut the fuck up.
You wanna know what it's like to kill a man?
Well, it's goddamn awful, that's what it is.
The only thing worse is getting a medal for killing some poor kid that wanted to just give up, that's all.
Yeah, some scared little gook just like you.
I shot him in the face with that rifle you were holding in there a while ago.
Not a day goes by that I don't think about it, and you don't want that on your soul.
Now, I got blood on my hands.
I'm soiled.
That's why I'm going it alone tonight.
Walt.
You take me with you right now.
Let me out!
Look, you've come a long way.
I'm proud to say that you're my friend but you got your whole life ahead of you.
But me, I finish things.
That's what I do.
And I'm going it alone.
No.
Wait!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
[grandma SPEAKING IN HMONG]

Her name is Daisy.

[PHONE RINGING]
-Hello?
W ALT :
It's Walt.
The keys to my house are under the ceramic turtle on the porch.
Let yourself in.
Your brother's in the basement.
I gotta go.
[grandma SPEAKING IN HMONG]
Sorry, Father, we have to go.
I'm telling you, if we're not here, there will be bloodshed.
We've been here for hours.
We can't afford to anchor a unit to one location.
I'm begging you to stay.
Just got word from my sergeant.
We're pulling the plug.
-I'm staying.
-No, you aren't.
We have specific orders.
You came with us, you're leaving with us.
Watch your head.
THAO:
Sue.
Over here.
Over here.
-Come unlock this.
SUE:
What's going on?
He left without me.
He went to Smokie's without me.
SUE:
Thao!
[GANGBANGERS CHATTERING]
MAN 1 :
What the fuck, man?
Any swamp rats in there?
-I didn't think your ass would've came.
-Shut up, gook.
I got nothing to say to you, shrimp-dick midget like you.
Yeah, yeah.
You go ahead, watch out for your boyfriend.
Because it was either he or you or someone who raped one of their own family.
Your own blood, for chrissake.
Now, go ahead and pull those pistols like miniature cowboys.
-Go ahead.
-So where's Thao at?
-That pussy motherfucker couldn't come?
-Don't worry about Thao.
Thao's got not one second for you.
SMOKIE:
Says who?
You?
What the fuck you gonna do, old man?
[GANGBANGERS CHUCKLE]
MAN 1 :
What you gonna do...
-...punk ass old man?
MAN 2:
Bitch.
-Kind of jumpy, aren't we?
-Shut the fuck up.
You shut the fuck up.
-Got a light?
SPIDER:
What the fuck?
No.
Me.
I've got a light.
Hail Mary, full of grace.
-Yes, Sergeant.
THAO:
What happened?
-You need to step back.
-He's a friend of mine.
I said, step back.
Hey, did you hear him?
Step back.
-What happened?
-Hey, step back.
He's my friend.
[IN HMONG] Please, it's important.
[IN HMONG] He went for his lighter and they shot him.
He didn't even have a gun on him.
This time we have witnesses.
These guys will be locked up for a long time.
Officer Chang!
Get those people back.
[IN ENGLISH] You have to step back now, okay?
Get them the fuck out of here.
Get them out of here.
Walt Kowalski once said to me that I didn't know anything about life or death because I was an over-educated, 27-year-old virgin who held the hands of superstitious old women and promised them eternity.
[PEOPLE CHUCKLE]
Walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it but he was right.
I knew really nothing about life or death until I got to know Walt.
And, boy, did I learn.
"And I wanna leave my house to the church because Dorothy would've liked it."
Now, which brings us to our last item, and again please excuse the language in Mr. Kowalski's will.
I'm simply reading it the way it was written.
"And I'd like to leave my 1 972 Gran Torino to my friend Thao Vang Lor on the condition that you don't chop-top the roof like one of those beaners don't paint any idiotic flames on it like some white-trash hillbilly and don't put a big, gay spoiler on the rear end like you see on all the other zipperheads' cars.
It just looks like hell.
If you can refrain from doing any of that, it's yours."
I'm real sorry about Dorothy, Walt.
She was a real peach.
Thanks for coming, Al.
Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
Father.
Spirit.
Uh.
Holy Spirit.
WOMAN:
It's okay, I can move down.
Spectacles, testicles, wallet, and watch.
[CHILDREN LAUGH]
Look at the way the old man glared at Ashley.
Can't even tone it down for Mom's funeral.
What do you expect?
Dad's still living in the '50s.
He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly.
Well, your kid's wearing a Lions jersey.
I'm sure Dad appreciates that.
The point is that there's nothing anyone can do that won't disappoint the old man.
It's inevitable.
You know, that's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings.
You know, that deal with the boat motor, the broken birdbath.
It's always something.
What are we gonna do with him?
Don't you think he's gonna get in trouble all by himself in the old neighborhood?
Well, why don't you have him move in with you?
[CHUCKLES]
Ha, ha, ha.
Hey.
Shh.
Death is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics.
Bitter in the pain, sweet in the salvation.
Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased and their families.
Sweet to those of us who know the salvation that awaits.
And some may ask, "What is death?
Is it the end?
Or is it the beginning?
And what is life?
What is this thing we call life?"
[BEEPS]
- All these questions can frustrate you.
KAREN:
Ashley, stop it.
JANOVICH:
That's why you have to turn to the Lord.
Jesus.
JANOVICH:
Because the Lord is the sweetness...
WOMAN:
This is so good.
MAN:
Did you have a chance to call Martha?
DAVID:
Is that Dad?
DANIEL:
No.
That's Grandpa Walt.
"Third platoon, E company, March 2nd, 1952, Korea"?
Where's Korea?
A lot of people showed up after the service.
Well, I suppose they heard there's gonna be a lot of ham.
I'll go down in the basement and get some chairs.
- Oh, I can do that, Dad.
- No, I need them now, not next week.
Cool, I found a medal.
Look at this.
How much longer do we have to stay?
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell, and I'm bored.
Ashley, why don't you go help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?
- Me?
- Yes, you.
Go.
Go help him.
Grandpa Walt, would you like some help with this?
With your chairs?
No.
You probably just painted your nails.
KAREN:
Honey, come here.
Okay, well, your dad is driving me crazy.
- Why did you make me do that?
KAREN:
It's okay.
We're leaving soon.
WALT:
Hey, girl.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come with me.
[PEOPLE SPEAKING IN HMONG]
How many swamp rats can you get in one room?
[SPITS]
[SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE]
Wow.
Grandpa, when did you get the vintage car?
1972.
I never knew you had a cool old car.
Yeah.
Well, it's been here since before you were born.
So what are you gonna do with it when you, like, die?
What about that super-cool retro couch you have in the den?
Because I'm going to state next year and it would look really good in my room and I don't have any furniture at all.
Oh, God.

- Who are you?
What do you want?
- Hi.
- I live...
- Get the shit out of your mouth.
- Tell me what you want.
- Do you have jumper cables?
- My uncle's car is old and...
- We don't have any cables.
And have some respect, zipperhead.
We're in mourning here.
- How you holding up, Walt?
- Mr. Kowalski.
Huh?
Mr. Kowalski, that's my name.
Right.
Mr. Kowalski.
Your wife and I became quite close these last few months.
She asked that I watch over you when she passed on.
I told her I watch over my flock.
But she made me promise I'd keep an extra-sharp eye on you.
Look, I appreciate the kindness you've shown to my wife.
Now that you've spoken your piece why don't you go tend to some of your other sheep?
Okay?
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her desire for you to go to confession.
She said she couldn't remember the last time you went.
- Is that so?
- It is.
Well, I confess that I never really cared for church very much.
The only reason I went was because of her.
And I confess that I have no desire to confess to a boy that's just out of the seminary.
[CHATTERING IN HMONG]
MAN:
Great to see you.
- Bye, dear.
- So long, Walt.
WOMAN:
Walt, can you get it started?
WALT:
Yeah, it'll be fine.
I wish I could help, Dad, but I gotta get the kids home.
- Kids are getting restless.
- Yeah, fine.
Just go.
I'll call you, see how you're doing.
All right.
Kill you to buy American?
Jesus.
Did you see the way he looked at the truck?
It's always rice-burner this, Jap-burner that, you know?
Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go.
He didn't say anything.
- He didn't need to.
- What do you expect?
The man worked at Ford all those years.
- I suppose that's my goddamn fault.
- Just give it a rest, just drive, okay?
Kids, want the radio on?
Anyone wanna listen to some music?
Good.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING IN HMONG]
[BIRD SQUAWKING]
Damn barbarians.
[IN HMONG] I'm just so brokenhearted.
I want my daughter to find another husband.
If she married again there would be a man in the house.
[IN HMONG] What about Thao?
The man of the house is right there.
GRANDMA:
Look at him washing dishes.
He does whatever his sister orders him to do.
How could he ever become the man of the house?
Be patient, once he's older, he will be the man of the house.
No way.
[IN HMONG] Today is a blessed day, for a child is born.
I offer food to nurture this child's body.
I offer clothing to protect this child's flesh.
The child is blessed with a mother and father.
Oh, spirit of this child return home and do not wander anymore.
Come home, spirit and soul, come home.
Live a good life and grow old.
Jesus.
Polarski would roll over in his grave if he could see his lawn now.
What the hell did Chinks have to move into this neighborhood for?
[IN HMONG] Why does that old white man stay here?
All the Americans have moved out of this neighborhood.
Why haven't you gone?
Why don't you strut away, you dumb rooster?
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Are you gone completely deaf or something?
Hi there, Walt.
I'm not a friend of yours, so why do you insist on calling me Walt?
Sorry.
Mr. Kowalski.
What are you peddling today, Padre?
Nothing.
I thought I'd drop by and see you.
I haven't seen you in church.
Now that you've done your good deed, why don't you take off down the road?
- I'd really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.
- Not in this lifetime, sonny.
Why?
Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
- You don't wanna know.
- No, I do.
Well, I think you're an over-educated 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold hands of ladies who are superstitious and promises them eternity.
[CONVO Y QBANITO'S "ESTO ES GUERRA" PLAYS ON CAR STEREO]

Nice.

Whoa.

Yo, now, that's a nice car.
Hell, yeah. 1972 Gran Torino, fastback.
- Yo.
- Cobra jet engine.
Yo, man, it's still in mint condition.
Yo, man.
It's in mint condition, man.
Oh, I've got one.
There's a Mexican, a Jew, and a colored guy go into a bar.
The bartender looks up and says, "Get the fuck out of here."
So here's where my flock congregates when they're not in church.
Hey, Father J.
Hi, Mel.
Hey there, Darrell.
- Hello, Father.
- Hi, Walt.
What brings you in here, Father?
The meat raffle?
No, I just came down to talk to Walt, if that's okay.
Damn, Padre, you are persistent, aren't you?
I promised your wife.
All right.
Let's get a booth.
I'll have a Pabst and a shot of Jack and whatever he's having.
- I'll have a Diet Coke.
- Bullshit, this is a bar.
You have a drink.
- Um, I'll have a gin and tonic.
WALT:
Attaboy.
So what do you want?
I promised your wife I'd get you to go to confession.
Now, why would you do that?
She was very insistent.
She made me.
You're kind of fond of promising things you can't deliver on.
Right, Father?
- Let's talk about something else.
- What?
Life and death.
Life and death.
What the hell do you know about life and death?
I'd like to think I know a lot.
I'm a priest.
Yeah.
You get up and preach about life and death but all you know is what you learned in priest school.
Right out of the rookie preacher's handbook.
I don't know about that.
I think...
Death is bittersweet.
Sort of bitter in its pain, but sweet in its salvation.
That's what you know about life and death, and it's pathetic.
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?
I know a lot.
I lived for almost three years in Korea with it.
Thanks.
We shot men stabbed them with bayonets, hacked 17-year-olds to death with shovels.
Stuff I'll remember till the day I die.
Horrible things, but things I'll live with.
And what about life?
Well, I survived the war.
Got married, had a family.
Sounds like you know a lot more about death than you do living.
Maybe so, Father.
Maybe so.

What?
No.
Nothing.
I mean, what would I want?
Well, I don't know.
Your wife's already gone through all your mother's jewelry.
No, Dad, I'm just calling to see how you're doing.
Just...
Anything new with the old neighborhood?
Yeah.
No.
Great.
Smooth sailing.
Yeah.
- Okay, good.
Good, then.
Oh, hey, Dad.

Get up.
- Get off my lawn.
Listen, old man, you don't wanna fuck with me.
Did you hear me?
I said, get off my lawn now.
Are you fucking crazy?
Go back in the house.
Yeah.
I blow a hole in your face, and then I go in the house.
And I sleep like a baby.
You can count on that.
We used to stack fucks like you five feet high in Korea use you for sandbags.
Okay.
- But you better watch your back.
- Fuck it, man, he's crazy.

No, no.
No, no, no.

No more.
No more.
What...?
Stay right there.
Stay right there.
Why can't you just leave me alone?
We brought you some shallots to plant.
- I don't want them.
- They're perennials.
They come back every year.
Why are you bringing me all this garbage?
Because...
- Because you saved Thao.
- I didn't save anybody.
I just...
I kept a bunch of jabbering gooks off of my lawn, that's all.
- You're a hero to the neighborhood.
- I'm not a hero.
They think you are.
That's why they keep bringing you gifts.
- Please, take them.
- They're wrong.
Now, I just want to be left alone.
Thank you.
[SPEAKS IN HMONG]
SUE:
Wait.
This is my mom, Vu, I'm Sue, and that's my brother, Thao.
- We live next door.
- So?
Thao wants to say something.
I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?
- For trying to steal your car.
Let me tell you something, boy.
You step on this property again, you're done.
Good afternoon, Walt.
I told you I'm not going to confession.
- Why didn't you just call the police?
- What?
I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I heard there was trouble in the neighborhood.
Why didn't you call the police?
Well...
You know, I prayed that they would show up but nobody answered.
What were you thinking?
Someone could have been killed.
We're talking life and death here.
When things go wrong, you gotta act quickly.
When we were in Korea and a thousand screaming gooks came across our line we didn't call the police, we reacted.
We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski.
I've been thinking about our conversation on life and death.
About what you said.
About how you carry around all the horrible things you were forced to do horrible things that won't leave you.
It seems it would do you good to unload some of that burden.
Things done during war are terrible.
Being ordered to kill.
Killing to save yourself, killing to save others.
You're right.
Those are things I know nothing about but I do know about forgiveness and I've seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins admitted their guilt, and left their burdens behind them.
Stronger men than you.
Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things and are now at peace.
Well, I gotta hand it to you, Padre.
You came here with your guns loaded this time.
Thank you.
And you're right about one thing.
About stronger men than me reaching their salvation.
Well, halle-fucking-lujah.
But you're wrong about something else.
What's that, Mr. Kowalski?
The thing that haunts a man the most is what he isn't ordered to do.
There.
You finally look like a human being again.
You shouldn't wait so long between haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch.
Yeah.
Well, I'm surprised you're still around.
I was always hoping you'd die and they'd get somebody who knew what they were doing.
Instead you just keep hanging around like the doo-wop dago you are.
- That'll be 10 bucks, Walt.
- Ten bucks?
Jesus Christ, Martin.
What are you, half Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices.
It's been 10 bucks for the last five years you hard-nosed, Polack son of a bitch.
- Yeah, well, keep the change.
- See you in three weeks, prick.
Not if I see you first, dipshit.
Since everything could go downhill after that.
- Yeah, that's true.
- That would suck.
- That's cool, you know?
Yeah.

Ain't shit going on, man.

It's all good, bro.

- He called you bro, man.
- It's all good, bro.

It's all good, huh?

Shut the fuck up.
Call me bro again, man, I'll bite your motherfucking face off.

You here to bring me this little present?

- Fuck out of here, man.

- Who you think you talking to?
- Who does it look like?
- You think you real funny, don't you?
- Oh, shit.

That would pretty much complete the picture.
You need to keep your bitch on a leash.

- What the hell are you spooks up to?
- Spooks?
You better get your ass on, honky, while I still let you.
- That's what you better do.
- That's right, bitch.
Fuck you think you at?
Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while that you shouldn't have fucked with?
That's me.
Man, you fucking crazy, man.
Get out of here, man.
Why don't you get your ass up out of here before I kick your old, wrinkly, white ass?
Crazy motherfucker, man.
What's wrong with him, man?
What the fuck?
- This motherfucker crazy, man.
- What's wrong with this nigga, man?
What the hell?

What's wrong with him, man?

He put his finger at us.
Oh, shit.

Come on, now.
Shut your fucking face.
You fucking don't listen, do you?
Now, get in the truck.
- Go on, get in the truck now.
Shit.
TREY:
Way to go, old man.
Shut up, pussy.
What is all this "bro" shit, anyway?
Want to be Super Spade or something?
These guys don't want to be your bro and I don't blame them.
Now, get your ofay, Paddy ass on down the road.
Take care, now.
Yeah, you too.
Oh, yeah.
Fuck, man, why y'all didn't fucking do nothing?
- Man, kick that nigga's ass.
- Man, you fucking...
Shit, man.
This fucker.
He had that cannon in your fucking face.
- You didn't do nothing.
- Trying to stay out.
What's the matter with you, for chrissake?
Trying to get yourself killed?
I thought you Asian girls were supposed to be smart.
Hanging around a neighborhood like that's a fast way to get you in the obituaries.
I know.
I know.
Take it easy.
And what about that goofball guy you were with?
Is that a date or something?
Yeah.
Kind of.
His name is Trey.
Well, you shouldn't be hanging out with him.
You should be hanging out with your own people, with other Humongs.
You mean Hmong?
We're Hmong, not "Humong."
Whatever.
Where the hell is Humong, I mean Hmong, anyway?
[SUE LAUGHS]
Wow.
You're so enlightened, you know that?
No, Hmong isn't a place.
It's a people.
Hmong people come from different parts of Laos, Thailand, and China.
Yeah.
Well, how did you end up in my neighborhood, then?
Why didn't you stay there?
It's a Vietnam thing.
We fought on your side.
And when the Americans quit the Communists started killing all the Hmong.
So we came over here.
Yeah.
Well, I don't know how you ended up in the Midwest.
There's snow on the ground six months out of the year.
Why does a jungle people want to be in the great frozen tundra?
Hill people.
We were hill people.
Not jungle people.
Booga-booga-booga.
Yeah.
Whatever.
Blame the Lutherans.
They brought us over here.
Everybody blames the Lutherans.
[CHUCKLES]
Well, you'd think the cold would keep all the idiots out.
Thanks for the ride.
You know something, kid?
You're all right.
But what about that dimwit brother of yours?
- He a little slow or something?
- Thao is actually really smart.
He just doesn't know which direction to go in.
- Yeah.
Poor Toad.
- It's really common.
Hmong girls over here fit in better.
The girls go to college, and the boys go to jail.
Yeah.
That old hag hates my ass.
Well...
"Your birthday today." Daisy.
"This year, you have to make a choice between two life paths.
Second chances come your way.

- Go ahead, Karen, give it to him.
- Here you go.
- Well, what is it?
- It's a Gopher.
So you can reach stuff.
You know, it makes things a lot easier.
This is from me.
It's a phone.
- Oh, I can see that.
- I just thought...
Well, we thought that it would make things easier.
Well, thank you, Karen.
There's nothing wrong with making things less hard on yourself.
Karen's right, Dad.
You've worked hard your whole life.
Maybe it's time you started thinking about, you know, taking it easier.
Jeez.
That's another thing, Dad.
You really should get rid of the coffin nails.
But, I don't know, we were thinking about the house.
You know, what with Mom gone, it's gotta be a lot to maintain around here.
- Mm-hm.
- Let alone clean.
And, I don't know, you're here all alone.
Yeah, and there are these great places now, you know, these communities where you don't have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow where the people are like you, active and alert, but are alone and would benefit from being around folks their own age.
Yeah, Dad, look.
You gotta check it out.
We've brought some brochures.
These places are nothing like what you'd think they'd be.
- They're great.
- No, no, beautiful.
They're really nice.
They really are.
These are top-notch, like, resorts.
- It's like staying in a hotel practically.
- They're beautiful.
MITCH:
They really are.
- Yeah.
They take care of everything.
They'll clean up.
They're really nice.
They have wonderful stores.
You can buy new shoes.
MITCH:
They're amazing.
They really are.

You'd have a good time.
- Play some golf, maybe.
MITCH:
Meet other people.

Kicking us out on his birthday.
- I told you this was a bad idea.
- I know.
You were right.
- He won't let anybody help him.
- Well, we tried.
Can we just drop it?
No one can say we didn't try.
The hell with him.
You know what we should've done?
We should've stayed home with Josh and Ashley.
At least they were smart enough to not come.

Oh, I had a piece of cake and a little beef jerky.
Come on over and get something to eat.

Every time I look at somebody, they look at the ground.
You're fine.
[SPEAKING IN HMONG]
WALT:
What's she saying?
- She said welcome to her home.
- Oh, no, she's not.
- Yeah, no, she didn't.
- She hates me.
Come on.
- Yeah, she hates you.
Okay.
Hey.
[PEOPLE MURMURING]
Hey, what are all you fish heads looking at anyway?
I think we should go into the other room.
Sorry.
SUE:
A lot of people in this house are very traditional.
Number one, never touch a Hmong person on their head, not even a child.
Hmong people believe that the soul resides on the head, so don't do that.
Well, sounds dumb, but fine.
Yeah, and a lot of Hmong people consider looking someone in the eye to be very rude.
That's why they look away when you look at them.
- Anything else?
- Yeah.
Some Hmong people tend to smile or grin when they're yelled at.
It's a cultural thing.
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity.
It's not that they're laughing at you or anything.
Yeah.
God, you people are nuts.
But the food does look good.
Smells good too.
Well, of course.
It's Hmong food.
Yeah.
Okay.
Can I come back for seconds?
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
You know, you mentioned about looking at people.
He's been staring at me the whole evening.
That's Kor Khue.
He's the Lor family shaman.
And what's that, some sort of a witch doctor or something?
- Something like that.
- Yeah.
Booga-booga.
Ha, ha.
Very funny, Wally.
[BOTH SPEAKING IN HMONG]
Kor Khue's interested in you.
He heard what you did.
He would like to read you.
It'd be rude not to allow him this.
It's a great honor.
- Yeah, sure, fine by me.
Sure.
- All right.
Take a seat.
WALT:
Here?
He says that people do not respect you.
They don't even wanna look at you.
He says the way you live, your food has no flavor.
You're worried about your life.
You made a mistake in your past life, like a mistake that you did you're not satisfied with.
He says you have no happiness in your life.
It's like you're not at peace.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm...
Yeah, I'm fine.
Fine.
I'm fine.
God, I've got more in common with these gooks than I do my own spoilt rotten family.
Jesus Christ.
Happy birthday.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
You were bleeding.
No, I bit my tongue.
It's nothing.
Why don't we go and get some of that good gook food?
- You know, I'm starving.
- Okay.
Fantastic.
Well, you ladies are wonderful.
This stuff is really good.
Come on, you glutton.
- What's up?
- Let's go.
- What for?
SUE:
To mingle.
Mingle?
We're mingling right here.
Come on.
You told me not to leave you alone.
Thank you very much, but I have to go now.
I have to go now.
I'll be back.
Now, don't let anything go away.
[MUSIC PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]
Oh, great.
Well, well, well.
Look who's over there.
- Yeah, the kid who stole my Gran Torino.
- My brother, Thao.
Tried to, anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah, Toad.
It was a little wobbly, but that should fix it.
YOUA:
So where are you guys from?
- I'm not far from here.
- I'm from Texas.
- What's this?
- A little rice liquor.
Here, try it.
All right.
My friends and I were just wondering what you're doing here.
Well, that's a good question.
What am I doing here?
- Name's Walt.
- Hi, Walt.
I'm Youa.
- Yuam.
A pleasure.
- No.
Youa.
Youa, okay.
So, what do you do?
- Oh, I fix things, stuff like that.
- Like what?
Well, I just fixed that dryer there, I fixed my wife's friend's sink and I took old Aunt Mary to the doctor's to get her prescription fixed up.
And then I even fixed a door that hadn't even broken yet.
You're funny.
I've been called a lot of things, but never funny.
- Well, I'm gonna take off.
Enjoy yourself.
- Okay.
Yum Yum.
Pleasure.
Look, she's going, man.
Come on.
MAN:
Youa, wait up.
Relax, zipperhead.
I'm not gonna shoot you.
I'd look down too, if I was you.
I knew you were a dipshit the first time I ever saw you but I never thought you were worse with women than you are at stealing cars, Toad.
- It's Thao.
- What?
It's not Toad, it's Thao.
My name is Thao.
Yeah, well, you're blowing it with that girl who was there.
Not that I give two shits about a toad like you.
You don't know what you're talking about.
You're wrong.
I know exactly what I'm talking about.
I may not be the most pleasant person to be around but I got the best woman that was ever on this planet to marry me.
I worked at it.
It was the best thing that ever happened to me.
But you, you know, you're letting Click Clack, Ding Dong, and Charlie Chan just walk out with Miss What's-Her-Face.
She likes you, you know?
Though I don't know why.
Who?
Yum Yum.
You know, the girl in the purple sweater.
She's been looking at you all day, stupid.
You mean Youa.
Yeah, Yum Yum, yeah.
Nice girl.
Nice girl.
A very charming girl.
I talked with her.
Yeah.
But you, you let her just walk right out with the Three Stooges.
And you know why?
Because you're a big, fat pussy.
Well I gotta go.
Good day, puss-cake.
[WOMEN SPEAKING IN HMONG]
No.
No more.
Well, okay, put them over there.
Bye-bye.
No, no.
No, no more.
No more.
Come on.
No more, now.
No more, please.
L...
Is this that chicken-dumpling thing you brought the other...?
Oh, all right.
Come on, ladies.
Certainly better than beef jerky, I'll tell you.
What's going on?
What's going on?
Thao is here to make amends.
He's here to work for you.
[VU SPEAKING IN HMONG]
No, he isn't.
He's not gonna work for me.
My mom said he dishonored the family and now he has to work off his debt.
- He'll start tomorrow morning.
- Not tomorrow, not any time.
I don't even want him on my property.
I thought we went over all that.
It's very important that you accept, and it would be an insult if you refuse.
Why is this being put back on me?
He's the one who tried to steal my car.
All of a sudden, I'm the bad guy in this.
Look, my family is very traditional and would be very much upset if you don't let Thao repay.
If he doesn't wanna do it, then let's just go.
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Yeah.
Shut up.
All right.
Tomorrow, come on.
Tomorrow.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thank you.
Jesus, Joseph, and Mary, these Hmong broads are like badgers.
Son of a bitch, I never thought he'd show.
All right.
What are you good at?
Like what?
Well, that's what I'm asking.
If you're gonna work for me, I gotta know what you're good at.
I gotta know what you can do.
I don't know.
Well, that's kind of halfway what I expected you to say.
You see that tree right there?
You just go over there and count the birds.
You want me to count the birds?
Yeah, you can count.
All you slopes are supposed to be good at math, right?
- Yeah, I can count.
- Good.
One, two...
So, what do you have for me today?
You want me to watch paint dry?
Maybe even count the clouds that pass by?
Don't get flip with me, boy.
I'm not the one who tried to steal.
Don't you forget that.
Go ahead.
I don't care if you insult me or say racist things.
Because you know what?
I'll take it.
Yeah, course you'll take it, because you have no teeth, you have no balls, kid.
Look, I'm stuck here so why don't you just find something useful for me to do?
Because unlike you, I'm not useless, and I maintain my own property.
You swamp rats, on the other hand, you just can't help but...
How long do I have you for?
- Toad?
How long?
- Till next Friday.
Yeah.
[CHUCKLES]
All right.
Go get the ladder out of the garage.
When you get finished with that roof there you can take that gutter and nail it back up.
I'm tired of looking at it the last three years.
[MAN SPEAKING IN HMONG]
Yeah.
Yeah, you said it, brother.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
Hello.
Grandpa says he wants to know if you can have Thao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch.
Wasp nest?
Well, that's terrible.
Yeah, well, I think we can handle that after lunch.
[GIRL SPEAKING IN HMONG]
[DOORBELL RINGING]
[COUGHING]
Jesus, Lord Almighty, knock it off.
Hey, it's my last day.
So, what else do you have for me to do?
Take the day off.
You've done enough.
Toad.
Nothing, never mind.
WOMAN:
The doctor will see you now.
Thank you.
Koski?
Koski?
Koski?
Mr. Kowalski?
Good morning.
I looked over your paperwork and I think we should immediately start a full battery of tests.
I feel that this would be the best way to go about checking out the issues that you've had...
Excuse me.
What happened to Dr. Feldman, my regular doctor?
Dr. Feldman retired three years ago.
I'm his replacement, Dr. Chu.
[PHONE RINGING]
- It's Grandpa Walt.
- Pick it up.
- You talk to him.
- Mitch.
I'm doing bills here.
KAREN:
You talk to him.
He's your father.
Hey, Dad.
WALT:
Hi, Mitch, it's...
It's me, your dad.
Yeah, I know.
What's up?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing much, really.
- How's everything going?
- I'm fine.
Fine.
Doing fine.
Fine.
Good.
How about Karen and the kids?
Fine, everybody's great.
Doing fine.
- Good.
How about work?
- Busy.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I suppose.
In fact, speaking of busy, I got a lot on my plate right now so if there's not something pressing...
No.
No, not at all.
So why don't you call me this weekend?
Sure.
Okay.
It was nice talking to you, Dad.
Thanks for calling.
Thanks.
Yeah.
[L.P., BUDDAH, CUZZ L.B.'S "APPRECIATION" PLAYS ON CAR STEREO]
This kid doesn't have a chance.
- What do you know about faucets?
- I know a lot about them, boy.
Stand aside.
- Jesus.
For the love of Pete.
- What?
It must be a hundred degrees in here.
Why don't you turn on the fan?
The place is falling apart.
THAO:
Man, where'd you get all this stuff?
- What are you talking about?
- All the tools and stuff.
Well, it may come as a surprise to a thief but I bought this stuff, everything in here, with my own money.
Yeah, yeah.
That's not what I meant.
I mean, there's just so much shit packed in here.
Yeah.
Well, every tool in here has a purpose.
Everything has a job to do.
They're all to use if necessary.
Okay, so, what's that?
- That's a post-hole digger.
- That?
Vise grips.
- That?
- Wire cutters.
You know it's a trowel, come on.
Those are shears there, and that's a saw.
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me, kid.
All right, what's on your mind?
It's just, I can't afford to buy all this stuff.
Well, I guess even a bonehead like you could understand that a man acquires this over a period of 50 years.
- Yeah, but...
- All right, look, here.
Take these three items, right here.
You can have this.
WD-40, vise grips and some duct tape.
Any man worth his salt can do half of the household chores with just those three things.
Anything else you need, you just borrow it, that's all.
Okay.
Cool.
[COUGHING]
- Fuck me.
- What's with that?
Nothing.
What?
Nothing, huh?
I just saw you coughed up blood.
That's not good.
You should really see a doctor.
Yeah.
Look those guys who were here the other night, on my lawn.
What about them?
Just a gang, a bunch of Hmong gangbangers.
Yeah, I assumed that, but what were they doing here?
They were gonna take me away.
They were kind of pissed that I blew my first initiation.
Yeah.
Well, you are a pussy, you know, you wanna hang out with guys like that.
What was your initiation supposed to be?
My Gran Torino?
Christ all Friday.
Shit.
Toad, you got a minute?
All right.
Okay.
Here it is.
Here's the deal.
I take the top because that's the heaviest.
I pull on that, and you stand right back here and you push and help me push it up each step.
- Just like that.
- Then let me take the top.
No, no, I've got the top.
Really, I'll take the top.
It looks heavy.
Look, I'm not crippled.
I've got the top.
If you don't let me take the top, I ain't helping.
- Now, listen to me, zipperhead...
- No, you listen, old man.
I'm here because you needed help.
So it's either top or I'm out of here.
[GROWLS]
All right.
You take the top, and I'll push.
Just don't let it slip out of your little-girl hands and crush me.
Don't give me any ideas, now.
- That thing weighs a ton.
- Yeah.
It runs like a clock, though.
They just don't make them like this anymore.
So, what are you gonna do with it?
Sell it, I guess.
How much?
60 bucks.
They...
I'm tired of having it sit around down in the basement there.
Why?
You looking for a freezer?
The downstairs one kind of died.
Okay. 25 bucks and it's yours.
Twenty-five?
But you just said 60.
I know, but this'll save me money putting an ad in the paper.
- Let's wheel it over to your place.
- All right.
Okay.
- Kind of ironic, huh?
WALT:
What?
Toad washing the car that he tried to steal from you.
Yeah.
He misses one spot, he's doing it all over again too.
It's nice of you to look after him like this.
He doesn't have any real role models in his life.
Well, I'm not any role model.
But you're a good man, Wally.
I wish our father would've been more like you.
- Don't go calling me Wally.
- No, I'm serious.
He was really hard on us, really traditional, and really old-school.
- Yeah, well, I'm old-school.
- Yeah, but you're an American.
What's that supposed to mean?
You like him, don't you?
Are you kidding?
He tried to steal my car.
Uh-huh.
And you spend time with him teach him how to fix things, saved him from that fucked cousin of ours.
- Hey.
Watch your language, lady.
- And you're a good man.
I'm not a good man.
Get me another beer, dragon lady.
This one's empty.
You know, the Hmong consider gardening to be women's work.
Yeah.
That's probably why I see you in the garden over there all the time.
Besides, we ain't in Humong.
Funny.
You know, you should quit.
That's bad for you.
Yeah?
So is being in a gang, dipshit.
Didn't you hear what I just said?
I saw you cough up blood.
You should quit.
So, what's that emblem supposed to mean anyway?
Is it your ancient Cub Scout emblem?
First Cavalry.
I've had it since '51.
So, what do you want to do with your life, kid?
Well, I was thinking about maybe sales.
Sales, huh?
My oldest son is in sales.
- Does he do well?
- Oh, yeah.
License to steal.
I work in the Ford factory for 50 years, and he's out selling Japanese cars.
- You made cars?
- Yeah.
I put the steering column in this Gran Torino in 1972, right on the line.
Oh, you are old.
So cool.
Yeah.
So you wanna be in sales.
You thinking about going to school maybe?
- Kind of, but school costs money.
- Well, maybe you should get a job.
You can't just sit there and spread mulch in my garden the rest of your life.
- Well, maybe you could just pay me.
- Yeah.
Very funny.
Well, what kind of job could I ever get?
Yeah.
You're right.
Nobody would ever hire you.
Yeah, I know.
Look, I'm just kidding, zip.
I mean, you could get a job.
- You could get a job anywhere.
- Like what?
- Well, how about construction?
- Me?
- Yeah.
- Construction?
- You have Alzheimer's or something?
- No.
You could get a job in construction.
I know people in the trades.
Course, I have to make a little adjustment and man you up a little bit.
- Man me up?
- Yeah.
And I think you ought to date Miss Yum Yum too.
Do you a little good.
You know, get a little carbon off the valves.
Now you're just gonna learn how guys talk.
You just listen to the way Martin and I batter it back and forth.
- You okay?
You ready?
- Sure.
WALT:
All right.
Let's go in.
Perfect.
A Polack and a chink.
How you doing, Martin, you crazy Italian prick?
You cheap bastard, I should've known you'd come in.
I was having such a pleasant day.
What'd you do, Jew some poor blind guy out of his money?
- Gave him the wrong change?
- Who's the Nip?
Oh, he's a pussy kid from next door.
I'm just trying to man him up a little bit.
Mm.
You see, kid?
Now, that's how guys talk to one another.
- They do?
- What, you got shit in your ears?
Now go on out and come back in, and talk to him like a man.
Like a real man.
- Come on, Walt.
- Come on.
Get your ass out of here.
And come on back now.
- Sorry about this.
- It's okay.
What's up, you old Italian prick?
Get out of my shop before I blow your head off you goddamn dick-smoking gook!
- Jesus Christ.
Oh, shit.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
But that's what you said.
That what you said men say.
You don't just come in and insult the man in his shop.
You don't do that.
What happens if you meet some stranger and get the wrong one?
He's gonna blow your gook head right off.
What should I have said, then?
Yeah, kid, why don't you start with "Hi" or "Hello"?
Yeah, just come in and say:
"Sir, I'd like a haircut, if you have time."
Yeah, be polite, but don't kiss ass.
WALT:
You could talk about a construction job you just came from and bitch about your girlfriend and your car.
Son of a bitch, I just got my brakes fixed and those sons of bitches really nailed me.
I mean, they screwed me right in the ass.
WALT:
Don't swear at the guy.
Just talk about people who are not in the room.
You could bitch about your boss making you work overtime when it's bowling night.
Right.
Or my old lady bitches for two goddamn hours about how they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store and the minute I turn on the game, she starts crying how we never talk.
You see?
Now go out, come back and talk to him.
And it ain't rocket science, for chrissake.
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car or a girlfriend.
Jesus.
I should've blown his head off when I had the chance.
Yeah.
Maybe so.
Now, okay, I want you to turn around and go outside and come back, and don't talk about having no job no car, no girlfriend, no future, no dick.
Okay?
Just turn around and go.
Excuse me, sir.
I need a haircut, if you ain't too busy.
You old Italian son-of-a-bitch prick barber.
Boy, does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job.
Fuck me.
Jesus Christ.
- All set to go through with it, right?
- Yeah, yeah.
Don't "Yeah, yeah" me.
Just say, "Yes, sir," and, "I'll do my best."
THAO:
Yes.
I'll do my best.
Because when I vouch for somebody, that means I've given my word.
And I don't want you making me look bad.
No, I'm good.
Totally into this.
Don't lay down, either.
Just look them straight in the eye.
And a man can tell a lot by your handshake.
- Here.
Put those in your back pocket.
- Cool.
Don't blow this.
Hey, Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon.
How the hell are you?
- I'm shitty, but who's gonna listen?
WALT:
Not me, that's for sure.
Help yourself, there, Walt.
You dumb Polack.
Okay, this is the kid I was telling you about.
Thao, this is Tim Kennedy.
He's the super on this job.
TIM:
So, what do we got here, Walt?
Well, he knows construction, and he's a smart kid.
He'll do anything you need him for.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
- You speak English?
- Yes, sir.
- Were you born here?
- You bet.
I see that Walt drove you here.
You got a vehicle?
Not at the moment.
Taking the bus for now.
The bus.
Jesus Christ, you don't have a car?
My head gasket cracked.
And the goddamn prick at the shop wants to bend me over for 2100.
Oh, please.
I replaced the tranny in my Tahoe, and the sons of bitches fucked me hard.
- Just under 3200.
- Goddamn thieves.
It ain't right.
You got that right.
Okay, come on in on Monday, and we'll find something for you to do.
- Thanks, Mr. Kennedy.
- It's Tim.
And what's your name again?
- Thao.
- "Tuh," okay.
You owe me one, Walt.
Yeah.
Well, I'll buy you a fruitcake for Christmas.
Fuck the fruitcake.
How about you just hand over them keys to that Gran Torino?
Why the hell does everybody want my car?
Well, I'm not surprised.
Yeah, you don't know the half of it.
All right, come on, zipperhead.
We'll let the mick stay here and play with himself.
What are we doing?
What do you wanna do?
Carry your tools in a rice bag?
Here we are.
You can use one of these.
And you'll need one of these.
Here.
THAO:
I can't afford any of this.
WALT:
I'll cover it.
You can pay me back on your first paycheck.
THAO:
Cool.
- Here.
You'll need something like that.
Now, this is what I'm looking for.
Here, tool belt.
- There you go.
- Not to bitch but won't I be needing some tools?
Tools I've got, but I'm not gonna lend my tool belt.
You can pick up tools as you go.
- I really appreciate all this.
- Forget it.
No.
I really do.
Thank you.

[SCREAMING]
- Hey there.
- Hey.
I gotta run.
Haven't seen you in a few days.
Where you been?
- Been busy.
- Yeah.
Busy, huh?
Hey.
- What the hell happened to you?
- Don't worry about it.
What do you mean, don't worry about it?
Look at your face.
I said, don't worry about it.
Okay?
It's not your problem.
When?
Grabbed me a couple days ago, right after I got off work.
Cowards.
I did everything I could possibly do, but they broke some of your tools.
- I'll replace them.
- Don't worry about the tools.
Where does your cousin live?
No, Walt.
I'll be okay.
- I don't want you to do anything.
- All right.
If you need any extra tools, you just let me know.
Well, I could use a roofing hammer.
Good.
Go in my garage and get it.
That should be the last of them.
Hey.
All right.
Here's the deal.
You stay away from Thao, understand?
You tell your friends to stay away from Thao.
If they don't listen, tell them you don't wanna see them anymore.
That's it.
Got it?
I'll take that as a yes.
If I have to come back here it's gonna get fucking ugly.
Get out of my way.
How do you want your dog?
I mean, steak?

- I told you, we only eat cats.
Yeah.

I've never seen you like this before.
I'm feeling good.

- And even Thao isn't bugging me.
- Having a good time, I see.
- Yeah.

What happened to your knuckles anyways?
I slipped in the shower.
No big problem.
Look, now, Yum Yum, if he doesn't ask you out I'm gonna ask you out.
Youa, don't listen to him, Youa.
He's a white devil.
Yeah, I am.
I'm the white devil.
I'd love to, Walt, but he beat you to it.
Really?
No kidding.
Dinner and a movie or what?
Yeah.
They're taking the bus.
No, you can't take the bus.
We gotta get you something more stylish than that.
Like what?
Take a limo?
How about that?
- The Gran Torino?
- Yeah.
- You'd let me take the Gran Torino?
- Yeah, I'd let you take the Gran Torino.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Yeah.
Yeah.
MAN [ON TV]:
Here's the pitch.
And a strike.
[WOMEN SCREAMING]
WALT:
Is everybody all right?
[VU SPEAKING IN HMONG]
You're all right.
You're okay.
You've got a cut.
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
Where's grandma?
Where is Sue?
Where is Sue?
- She went to our aunt's.
- Your aunt's?
You sure?
- Yeah.
- Get on the phone and call right now.
[SPEAKING IN HMONG]
I knew this was gonna happen.
Tried to...
What the hell am I doing here?
Well, maybe some of her friends called and they changed plans.
Yeah.
In the war, we just lost a lot of friends, but you're kind of set for it.
You're geared to it.
[SPEAKING IN HMONG]
No, no, no.
You fuck!
You rotten fuck!
Mr. Kowalski?
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I'm okay.
The police finally left.
No one's talking.
One thing about the Hmong, they keep their mouths shut.
Yeah, I've noticed that.
You know, Thao and Sue are never gonna find peace in this world as long as that gang's around.
Until they go away, you know, forever.
What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.
I took Sue to the hospital.
She's scared.
They're all scared.
Yeah.
Thao, especially.
He's sitting out there right now, staring at your front door.
You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.
What would you do?
- What should Thao do?
- I know what I would do if I was you.
Or at least what you think you should do.
Really?
If I was Thao, I guess I'd want vengeance.
I'd wanna stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys.
And you?
What would I do?
I'd come over here and talk to you, I guess.
I know you're close with these people, but this pisses me off too, Mr. Kowalski.
Want a beer?
I'd love one.
There's some in the chest right over there behind you.
Damn all this.
- Just isn't fair.
- Nothing's fair, Father.
So, what are you gonna do, Mr. Kowalski?
Call me Walt.
All right.
What are you gonna do, Walt?
I don't know but I'll think of something.
Whatever it is, they won't have a chance.
What are you doing?
- Thinking.
- Thinking?
Thinking time is over.
Now it's time to knock the shit out of those pricks.
I know you don't wanna hear this, but now's the time to stay calm.
Calm?
You want me to be calm?
We stay calm or else mistakes get made.
We have to step back from this thing.
No.
Don't let me down, Walt.
Not you.
This is gonna end today.
Sit down.
- I don't wanna sit.
- I said, sit down.
Now, listen to me.
We gotta plan this, and plan it very carefully.
We can't make any mistakes.
Now, you know I'm the right man for this job.
So I want you to go home and stay calm and come back here at 4 this afternoon.
And what needs to be done will be done.
I say we go now.
Right now.
And what?
Kill that cousin of yours and the rest of those zips?
Mr. Tough Guy out for blood all of a sudden?
You know nothing about it.
Now go home and you stay calm.
Come back here at 4.
All right?
Okay?
Okay.
Yeah.
I know, I know.
Give me a break, will you?
It's the first time I've ever smoked in the house.
Let a man enjoy himself, would you, girl?
All finished.
Ten dollars American.
I don't suppose your Guinea hands are steady enough to do a straight shave?
Straight shave?
You've never asked for a straight shave.
I know, but I've always wondered about it.
That's unless you're too busy.
- No, just let me heat up a towel.
- Yeah.
And here, here's a 20.
Keep the change.
That's just in case you hit my jugular.
It's gonna take about one hour.
We gonna shorten the sleeves a little bit.
Gonna fix the shoulder.
- Yeah.
I never had a fitted suit before.
- Yes, sir.
- Mm-hm.
- You look very good.
- What can I do for you, Mr. Kowalski?
- I'm here for a confession.
Oh, Lord Jesus.
What have you done?
- Nothing.
You just take it easy, now.
- What are you up to?
Are you gonna give me a confession or not?
How long has it been since your last confession?
WALT:
Oh, forever.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
What are your sins, my son?
Well, in 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski at the factory Christmas party.
Dorothy was in the other room with the other wives.
It just happened.
Yes, go on.
Well, I made a 900-dollar profit selling a boat and a motor.
I didn't pay the taxes.
It's the same as stealing.
Yes, fine.
Oh, lastly I was never very close with my two sons.
I don't know them.
I didn't know how.
That's it?
That's it?
It's bothered me most of my life.
Say 10 "Hail Marys" and five "Our Fathers."
God loves you and forgives you, and I absolve you of all your sins.
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Thank you, Padre.
Are you going to retaliate for what happened to Sue?
I'm going over to that house today, Mr. Kowalski.
WALT:
Is that so?
It is.
And every other day until you see the folly in what you're planning.
- Busy day.
Gotta go.
- Go in peace.
Oh, I am at peace.
Jesus Christ.
So which one's mine?
You ever fired a weapon before?
No.
Well, why don't you put that one down?
And I got something I wanna show you.
Come on.
THAO:
What?
1952, we were sent up to take out a chink machine-gun nest.
Been shredding us up pretty good.
I was the only one that came back that day.
For that, they gave me a Silver Star.
Here it is.
Here.
I want you to have it.
Why?
Why?
Because we all knew the dangers that night, but we went anyway.
That's the way it might be tonight.
There's always a chance you don't come back.
The hell we won't.
We're gonna roll up in there and tear some ass.
That's foolish.
That's the exact reaction they're waiting for.
Go ahead and close this up.
- How many?
- How many what?
How many men did you kill in Korea?
- Thirteen.
Maybe more.
- What was it like to kill a man?
You don't wanna know.
Now close it up.
[DOOR SLAMS]
[LOCK CLICKS]
Walt.
Walt.
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Relax.
You can't get out of there.
You let me out right now.
Let me out.
- Fucking let me out or I'll fucking kill you.
- Shut the fuck up.
You wanna know what it's like to kill a man?
Well, it's goddamn awful, that's what it is.
The only thing worse is getting a medal for killing some poor kid that wanted to just give up, that's all.
Yeah, some scared little gook just like you.
I shot him in the face with that rifle you were holding in there a while ago.
Not a day goes by that I don't think about it and you don't want that on your soul.
Now, I got blood on my hands.
I'm soiled.
That's why I'm going it alone tonight.
Walt.
You take me with you right now.
Let me out!
Look, you've come a long way.
I'm proud to say that you're my friend but you got your whole life ahead of you.
But me, I finish things.
That's what I do.
And I'm going it alone.
No.
Wait!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
[GRANDMA SPEAKING IN HMONG]
Look, I need you to watch my dog.
Yeah, I love you too.
Yeah, she's old too.
Bye-bye, sweetheart.
Take it easy.
Her name is Daisy.
[WHIMPERS]
[PHONE RINGING]
- Hello?
WALT:
It's Walt.
The keys to my house are under the ceramic turtle on the porch.
Let yourself in.
Your brother's in the basement.
I gotta go.
[GRANDMA SPEAKING IN HMONG]
Sorry, Father, we have to go.
I'm telling you, if we're not here, there will be bloodshed.
We've been here for hours.
We can't afford to anchor a unit to one location.
I'm begging you to stay.
Just got word from my sergeant.
We're pulling the plug.
- I'm staying.
- No, you aren't.
We have specific orders.
You came with us, you're leaving with us.
Watch your head.
THAO:
Sue.
Over here.
Over here.
- Come unlock this.
SUE:
What's going on?
He left without me.
He went to Smokie's without me.
SUE:
Thao!
[GANGBANGERS CHATTERING]
MAN 1:
What the fuck, man?
Any swamp rats in there?
- I didn't think your ass would've came.
- Shut up, gook.
I got nothing to say to you, shrimp-dick midget like you.
Yeah, yeah.
You go ahead, watch out for your boyfriend.
Because it was either he or you or someone who raped one of their own family.
Your own blood, for chrissake.
Now, go ahead and pull those pistols like miniature cowboys.
- Go ahead.
- So where's Thao at?
- That pussy motherfucker couldn't come?
- Don't worry about Thao.
Thao's got not one second for you.
SMOKIE:
Says who?
You?
What the fuck you gonna do, old man?
[GANGBANGERS CHUCKLE]
MAN 1:
What you gonna do punk ass old man?
MAN 2:
Bitch.
- Kind of jumpy, aren't we?
- Shut the fuck up.
You shut the fuck up.
- Got a light?
SPIDER:
What the fuck?
No.
Me.
I've got a light.
Hail Mary, full of grace.
- Yes, Sergeant.
THAO:
What happened?
- You need to step back.
- He's a friend of mine.
I said, step back.
Hey, did you hear him?
Step back.
- What happened?
- Hey, step back.
He's my friend.
[IN HMONG] Please, it's important.
[IN HMONG] He went for his lighter and they shot him.
He didn't even have a gun on him.
This time we have witnesses.
These guys will be locked up for a long time.
Officer Chang!
Get those people back.
[IN ENGLISH] You have to step back now, okay?
Get them the fuck out of here.
Get them out of here.
Walt Kowalski once said to me that I didn't know anything about life or death because I was an over-educated, 27-year-old virgin who held the hands of superstitious old women and promised them eternity.
[PEOPLE CHUCKLE]
Walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it but he was right.
I knew really nothing about life or death until I got to know Walt.
And, boy, did I learn.
"And I wanna leave my house to the church because Dorothy would've liked it."
Now, which brings us to our last item, and again please excuse the language in Mr. Kowalski's will.
I'm simply reading it the way it was written.
"And I'd like to leave my 1972 Gran Torino to my friend Thao Vang Lor on the condition that you don't chop-top the roof like one of those beaners don't paint any idiotic flames on it like some white-trash hillbilly and don't put a big, gay spoiler on the rear end like you see on all the other zipperheads' cars.
It just looks like hell.
If you can refrain from doing any of that, it's yours."
I'm real sorry about Dorothy, Walt.
She was a real peach.
Thanks for coming, Al.
Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
Father.
Spirit.
Uh.
Holy Spirit.
WOMAN:
It's okay, I can move down.
Spectacles, testicles, wallet, and watch.
[CHILDREN LAUGH]
Look at the way the old man glared at Ashley.
Can't even tone it down for Mom's funeral.
What do you expect?
Dad's still living in the '50s.
He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly.
Well, your kid's wearing a Lions jersey.
I'm sure Dad appreciates that.
The point is that there's nothing anyone can do that won't disappoint the old man.
It's inevitable.
You know, that's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings.
You know, that deal with the boat motor, the broken birdbath.
It's always something.
What are we gonna do with him?
Don't you think he's gonna get in trouble, all by himself in the old neighborhood?
Well, why don't you have him move in with you?
[CHUCKLES]
Ha, ha, ha.
Hey.
Shh.
Death is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics.
Bitter in the pain, sweet in the salvation.
Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased and their families.
Sweet to those of us who know the salvation that awaits.
And some may ask, "What is death?
Is it the end?
Or is it the beginning?
And what is life?
What is this thing we call life?"
[BEEPS]
-All these questions can frustrate you.
KAREN:
Ashley, stop it.
JANOVICH:
That's why you have to turn to the Lord.
Jesus.
JANOVICH:
Because the Lord is the sweetness....
WOMAN:
This is so good.
MAN:
Did you have a chance to call Martha?
DAVID:
Is that Dad?
DANIEL:
No.
That's Grandpa Walt.
"Third platoon, E company, March 2nd, 1 952, Korea"?
Where's Korea?
A lot of people showed up after the service.
Well, I suppose they heard there's gonna be a lot of ham.
I'll go down in the basement and get some chairs.
-Oh, I can do that, Dad.
-No, I need them now, not next week.
Cool, I found a medal.
Look at this.
How much longer do we have to stay?
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell, and I'm bored.
Ashley, why don't you go help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?
-Me?
-Yes, you.
Go.
Go help him.
Grandpa Walt, would you like some help with this?
With your chairs?
No.
You probably just painted your nails.
KAREN:
Honey, come here.
Okay, well, your dad is driving me crazy.
-Why did you make me do that?
KAREN:
It's okay.
We're leaving soon.
W ALT :
Hey, girl.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come with me.
[PEOPLE SPEAKING IN HMONG]
How many swamp rats can you get in one room?
[SPITS]
[SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE]
Wow.
Grandpa, when did you get the vintage car?
1 972.
I never knew you had a cool old car.
Yeah.
Well, it's been here since before you were born.
So what are you gonna do with it when you, like, die?
What about that super-cool retro couch you have in the den?
Because I'm going to state next year and it would look really good in my room, and I don't have any furniture at all.
Oh, God.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
-Who are you?
What do you want?
-Hi.
-I live--
-Get the shit out of your mouth.
-Tell me what you want.
-Do you have jumper cables?
-My uncle's car is old and--
-We don't have any cables.
And have some respect, zipperhead.
We're in mourning here.
-How you holding up, Walt?
-Mr.
Kowalski.
Huh?
Mr. Kowalski, that's my name.
Right.
Mr. Kowalski.
Your wife and I became quite close these last few months.
She asked that I watch over you when she passed on.
I told her I watch over my flock.
But she made me promise I'd keep an extra-sharp eye on you.
Look, I appreciate the kindness you've shown to my wife.
Now that you've spoken your piece why don't you go tend to some of your other sheep?
Okay?
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her desire for you to go to confession.
She said she couldn't remember the last time you went.
-Is that so?
-It is.
Well, I confess that I never really cared for church very much.
The only reason I went was because of her.
And I confess that I have no desire to confess to a boy that's just out of the seminary.
[CHATTERING IN HMONG]
MAN:
Great to see you.
-Bye, dear.
-So long, Walt.
WOMAN:
Walt, can you get it started?
WALT:
Yeah, it'll be fine.
I wish I could help, Dad, but I gotta get the kids home.
-Kids are getting restless.
-Yeah, fine.
Just go.
I'll call you, see how you're doing.
All right.
Kill you to buy American?
Jesus.
Did you see the way he looked at the truck?
It's always rice-burner this, Jap-burner that, you know?
-Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go.
-He didn't say anything.
-He didn't need to.
-What do you expect?
The man worked at Ford all those years.
-I suppose that's my goddamn fault.
-Just give it a rest, just drive, okay?
Kids, want the radio on?
Anyone wanna listen to some music?
Good.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING IN HMONG]
[BIRD SQUAWKING]
Damn barbarians.
[IN HMONG] I'm just so brokenhearted.
I want my daughter to find another husband.
If she married again there would be a man in the house.
[IN HMONG] What about Thao?
The man of the house is right there.
grandma:
Look at him washing dishes.
He does whatever his sister orders him to do.
How could he ever become the man of the house?
Be patient, once he's older, he will be the man of the house.
No way.
[IN HMONG] Today is a blessed day, for a child is born.
I offer food to nurture this child's body.
I offer clothing to protect this child's flesh.
The child is blessed with a mother and father.
Oh, spirit of this child return home and do not wander anymore.
Come home, spirit and soul, come home.
Live a good life and grow old.
Jesus.
Polarski would roll over in his grave if he could see his lawn now.
What the hell did Chinks have to move into this neighborhood for?
[IN HMONG] Why does that old white man stay here?
All the Americans have moved out of this neighborhood.
Why haven't you gone?
Why don't you strut away, you dumb rooster?
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Are you gone completely deaf or something?
Hi there, Walt.
I'm not a friend of yours, so why do you insist on calling me Walt?
Sorry.
Mr. Kowalski.
-What are you peddling today, Padre?
-Nothing.
I thought I'd drop by and see you.
I haven't seen you in church.
Now that you've done your good deed, why don't you take off down the road?
-I'd really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.
-Not in this lifetime, sonny.
Why?
Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
-You don't wanna know.
-No, I do.
Well, I think you're an over-educated 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold hands of ladies who are superstitious and promises them eternity.

There's a Mexican, a Jew, and a colored guy go into a bar.
The bartender looks up and says, "Get the fuck out of here."
So here's where my flock congregates when they're not in church.
Hey, Father J.
Hi, Mel.
Hey there, Darrell.
-Hello, Father.
-Hi, Walt.
What brings you in here, Father?
The meat raffle?
No, I just came down to talk to Walt, if that's okay.
Damn, Padre, you are persistent, aren't you?
I promised your wife.
All right.
Let's get a booth.
I'll have a Pabst and a shot of Jack and whatever he's having.
-I'll have a Diet Coke.
-Bullshit, this is a bar.
You have a drink.
-Um, I'll have a gin and tonic.
WALT:
Attaboy.
So what do you want?
I promised your wife I'd get you to go to confession.
Now, why would you do that?
She was very insistent.
She made me.
You're kind of fond of promising things you can't deliver on.
Right, Father?
-Let's talk about something else.
-What?
Life and death.
Life and death.
What the hell do you know about life and death?
I'd like to think I know a lot.
I'm a priest.
Yeah.
You get up and preach about life and death but all you know is what you learned in priest school.
Right out of the rookie preacher's handbook.
I don't know about that.
I think--
Death is bittersweet.
Sort of bitter in its pain, but sweet in its salvation.
That's what you know about life and death, and it's pathetic.
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?
I know a lot.
I lived for almost three years in Korea with it.
Thanks.
We shot men stabbed them with bayonets, hacked 1 7-year-olds to death with shovels.
Stuff I'll remember till the day I die.
Horrible things, but things I'll live with.
And what about life?
Well, I survived the war.
Got married, had a family.
Sounds like you know a lot more about death than you do living.
Maybe so, Father.
Maybe so.

Yo, what's up?
What are you guys doing out here, man?
THAO:
Nothing.
SUE:
Minding our own business.
THAO:
Just hanging out.
What are you guys doing here?
-What?
THAO:
I told you guys already--
Can't I just come hang out with my little cousin?
Huh?
We have good news for you, man.
Oh, really?
And what's that?
Only for guy talk.
-I don't think so.
-Why not?
Come on, man.
We gonna give you another shot, man.
-Don't go, Thao.
SMOKIE:
Mind your own business, girl.
-Come on, let's go.
SPIDER:
Come.
-Yeah, what are you gonna do, huh?
SMOKIE:
Come on, dog.

[ALL CHATTERING IN HMONG]
SPIDER:
Look.
You've broken Daddy's gnome.
WALT:
What the hell is this?
MAN 1 :
Get up.
-Get off my lawn.
Listen, old man, you don't wanna fuck with me.
Did you hear me?
I said, get off my lawn now.
Are you fucking crazy?
Go back in the house.
Yeah.
I blow a hole in your face, and then I go in the house.
And I sleep like a baby.
You can count on that.
We used to stack fucks like you five feet high in Korea use you for sandbags.
Okay.
-But you better watch your back.
-Fuck it, man, he's crazy.
MAN 2:
We'll get this cracker next time.
Thank you.
Get off my lawn.
[THUDDING]
What the hell is this?
Christ.
No, no.
No, no, no.
Come on, no more.
No more.
No more.
What--?
Stay right there.
Stay right there.
Why can't you just leave me alone?
We brought you some shallots to plant.
-I don't want them.
-They're perennials.
-They come back every year.
-Why are you bringing me all this garbage?
Because....
-Because you saved Thao.
-I didn't save anybody.
I just-
- I kept a bunch of jabbering gooks off of my lawn, that's all.
-You're a hero to the neighborhood.
-I'm not a hero.
They think you are.
That's why they keep bringing you gifts.
-Please, take them.
-They're wrong.
Now, I just want to be left alone.
Thank you.
[SPEAKS IN HMONG]
SUE:
Wait.
This is my mom, Vu, I'm Sue, and that's my brother, Thao.
-We live next door.
-So?
Thao wants to say something.
I'm sorry.
-Sorry for what?
-For trying to steal your car.
Let me tell you something, boy.
You step on this property again, you're done.
Good afternoon, Walt.
I told you I'm not going to confession.
-Why didn't you just call the police?
-What?
I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I heard there was trouble in the neighborhood.
Why didn't you call the police?
Well....
You know, I prayed that they would show up but nobody answered.
What were you thinking?
Someone could have been killed.
We're talking life and death here.
When things go wrong, you gotta act quickly.
When we were in Korea and a thousand screaming gooks came across our line we didn't call the police, we reacted.
We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski.
I've been thinking about our conversation on life and death.
About what you said.
About how you carry around all the horrible things you were forced to do horrible things that won't leave you.
It seems it would do you good to unload some of that burden.
Things done during war are terrible.
Being ordered to kill.
Killing to save yourself, killing to save others.
You're right.
Those are things I know nothing about but I do know about forgiveness and I've seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins admitted their guilt, and left their burdens behind them.
Stronger men than you.
Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things and are now at peace.
Well, I gotta hand it to you, Padre.
You came here with your guns loaded this time.
Thank you.
And you're right about one thing.
About stronger men than me reaching their salvation.
Well, halle-fucking-lujah.
But you're wrong about something else.
What's that, Mr. Kowalski?
The thing that haunts a man the most is what he isn't ordered to do.
There.
You finally look like a human being again.
You shouldn't wait so long between haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch.
Yeah.
Well, I'm surprised you're still around.
I was always hoping you'd die and they'd get somebody who knew what they were doing.
Instead you just keep hanging around like the doo-wop dago you are.
-That'll be 10 bucks, Walt.
-Ten bucks?
Jesus Christ, Martin.
What are you, half Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices.
It's been 10 bucks for the last five years, you hard-nosed, Polack son of a bitch.
-Yeah, well, keep the change.
-See you in three weeks, prick.
Not if I see you first, dipshit.
Since everything could go downhill after that.
-Yeah, that's true.
-That would suck.
-That's cool, you know?
Yeah.
MAN:
Ain't shit going on, man.
Ain't shit going on.
Man, look at this.
Look at this, Monk.
Check this out.
MONK:
Oooh.
Boy.
DUKE:
Oh, yeah.
Bring that little tight ass over here.
Come here, girl.
Don't be shy.
What, you can't say hi?
Why you acting all stuck-up and shit?
-What you supposed to be, man?
-Yo, it's cool, dog.
What the fuck you doing in my neighborhood, boy?
Nothing.
Just going down to Corner Spot, you know?
Get some CDs.
It's all good, bro.
See, he called you bro, Duke.
-He called you bro, man.
-It's all good, bro.
DUKE:
It's all good, huh?
MONK:
Shut the fuck up.
Call me bro again, man, I'll bite your motherfucking face off.
MONK:
Yeah, motherfucker.
Now, what the fuck y'all come down here for?
You here to bring me this little present?
Monk?
She bringing it to us?
This little Oriental yummy.
Don't worry.
I'm gonna take real good care of her.
-Fuck out of here, man.
-Fuck out of here, man.
[MEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
-I told you we're finished here.
MONK:
Oh, yeah.
Keep your ass right here.
Oh, great.
Another asshole who has a fetish for Asian girls?
God, that gets so old.
MONK:
Oh, shit.
-What's your name, girl?
My name?
Get your ass out of here, okay?
It's "Take your crude come-on to every woman who walks past and cram it." That's my name.
DUKE:
Mouthy little bitch.
-Who you think you talking to?
-Who does it look like?
-You think you real funny, don't you?
-Oh, shit.
Ain't she tough?
What?
You gonna hit me now?
That would pretty much complete the picture.
You need to keep your bitch on a leash.
Put a chain on that whore and yank that motherfucker.
Of course.
Right to the stereotype thesaurus.
Call me a whore and a bitch in the same sentence.
-This bitch is crazy.
DUKE:
I like them like that.
Man, take this bitch.
SUE:
Hey.
Get off me.
-You don't know when to quit, do you?
DUKE:
I'm gonna teach her a lesson.
SUE:
Stop.
Let go.
Get your ass over there.
What the fuck you looking at, old man?
-What the hell are you spooks up to?
-Spooks?
You better get your ass on, honky, while I still let you.
-That's what you better do.
-That's right, bitch.
Fuck you think you at?
Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while that you shouldn't have fucked with?
That's me.
Man, you fucking crazy, man.
Get out of here, man.
Why don't you get your ass up out of here before I kick your old, wrinkly, white ass?
Crazy motherfucker, man.
What's wrong with him, man?
What the fuck?
-This motherfucker crazy, man.
-What's wrong with this nigga, man?
What the hell?
Get in the truck.
This crazy motherfucker, man.
What's wrong with him, man?
MONK:
He put his finger at us.
-Oh, shit.
-Come on, now.
Hey, pops.
Come on, now.
Shut your fucking face.
You fucking don't listen, do you?
Now, get in the truck.
-Go on, get in the truck now.
Shit.
TREY:
Way to go, old man.
Shut up, pussy.
What is all this "bro" shit, anyway?
Want to be Super Spade or something?
These guys don't want to be your bro and I don't blame them.
Now, get your ofay, Paddy ass on down the road.
Take care, now.
Yeah, you too.
Oh, yeah.
Fuck, man, why y'all didn't fucking do nothing?
-Man, kick that nigga's ass.
-Man, you fucking--
Shit, man.
This fucker.
He had that cannon in your fucking face.
-You didn't do nothing.
-Trying to stay out.
What's the matter with you, for chrissake?
Trying to get yourself killed?
I thought you Asian girls were supposed to be smart.
Hanging around a neighborhood like that's a fast way to get you in the obituaries.
I know.
I know.
Take it easy.
And what about that goofball guy you were with?
Is that a date or something?
Yeah.
Kind of.
His name is Trey.
Well, you shouldn't be hanging out with him.
You should be hanging out with your own people, with other Humongs.
You mean Hmong?
We're Hmong, not "Humong."
Whatever.
Where the hell is Humong, I mean Hmong, anyway?
[SUE LAUGHS]
Wow.
You're so enlightened, you know that?
No, Hmong isn't a place.
It's a people.
Hmong people come from different parts of Laos, Thailand, and China.
Yeah.
Well, how did you end up in my neighborhood, then?
Why didn't you stay there?
It's a Vietnam thing.
We fought on your side.
And when the Americans quit, the Communists started killing all the Hmong.
So we came over here.
Yeah.
Well, I don't know how you ended up in the Midwest.
There's snow on the ground six months out of the year.
Why does a jungle people want to be in the great frozen tundra?
Hill people.
We were hill people.
Not jungle people.
Booga-booga-booga.
Yeah.
Whatever.
Blame the Lutherans.
They brought us over here.
Everybody blames the Lutherans.
[CHUCKLES]
Well, you'd think the cold would keep all the idiots out.
Thanks for the ride.
You know something, kid?
You're all right.
But what about that dimwit brother of yours?
-He a little slow or something?
-Thao is actually really smart.
He just doesn't know which direction to go in.
-Yeah.
Poor Toad.
-It's really common.
Hmong girls over here fit in better.
The girls go to college, and the boys go to jail.
Yeah.
That old hag hates my ass.
Well....
"Your birthday today." Daisy.
"This year, you have to make a choice between two life paths.
Second chances come your way.
Extraordinary events culminate in what might seem to be an anticlimax.
Your lucky numbers are 84, 23 11 , 78, and 99."
What a load of shit.
Yeah.
[GRUNTING]
[BOYS LAUGHING]
What the hell is it with kids nowadays?
All right.
THAO:
Hey, Mrs. V. Here, let me help you with those.
MRS. V:
Oh, thank you.
I just-- THAO:
I got it.
How about that?
THAO:
Here you go.
-How about that, Daisy?
THAO:
Yeah, I got it.
MRS. V.:
That was too heavy for the bag.
THAO:
No problem.
-Thank you.
-Go ahead, Karen, give it to him.
-Here you go.
-Well, what is it?
-It's a Gopher.
So you can reach stuff.
You know, it makes things a lot easier.
This is from me.
It's a phone.
-Oh, I can see that.
-I just thought--
Well, we thought that it would make things easier.
Well, thank you, Karen.
There's nothing wrong with making things less hard on yourself.
Karen's right, Dad.
You've worked hard your whole life.
Maybe it's time you started thinking about, you know, taking it easier.
Jeez.
That's another thing, Dad.
You really should get rid of the coffin nails.
But, I don't know, we were thinking about the house.
You know, what with Mom gone, it's gotta be a lot to maintain around here.
-Mm-hm.
-Let alone clean.
And, I don't know, you're here all alone.
Yeah, and there are these great places now, you know, these communities where you don't have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow where the people are like you, active and alert, but are alone and would benefit from being around folks their own age.
Yeah, Dad, look.
You gotta check it out.
We've brought some brochures.
These places are nothing like what you'd think they'd be.
-They're great.
-No, no, beautiful.
They're really nice.
They really are.
These are top-notch, like, resorts.
-It's like staying in a hotel practically.
-They're beautiful.
MITCH:
They really are.
-Yeah.
They take care of everything.
They'll clean up.
They're really nice.
They have wonderful stores.
You can buy new shoes.
MITCH:
They're amazing.
They really are.
KAREN:
You'd have a good time.
-Play some golf, maybe.
MITCH:
Meet other people.
Son of a bitch.
Kicking us out on his birthday.
-I told you this was a bad idea.
-I know.
You were right.
-He won't let anybody help him.
-Well, we tried.
Can we just drop it?
No one can say we didn't try.
The hell with him.
You know what we should've done?
We should've stayed home with Josh and Ashley.
At least they were smart enough to not come.
Goddamn kids have more sense than we do.
WALT:
We miss Mama, don't we, Daisy?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKING IN HMONG]
SUE:
Hey, Walt.
What are you up to?
We're having a barbecue.
You wanna come over?
-What do you think?
-There's tons of food.
Yeah.
Just keep your hands off my dog.
-No worries.
We only eat cats.
-Really?
No, I'm kidding, you moron.
Come on, you can be my special guest.
No, I'm fine right here.
Yeah.
[GROANS]
-Son of a bitch.
-Okay, so, what have you had to eat today?
Oh, I had a piece of cake and a little beef jerky.
Come on over and get something to eat.
We've got beer too.
Well, I might as well drink with strangers rather than drink alone.
After all, it is my birthday.
-Really?
Happy birthday, Wally.
-Don't call me Wally.
WALT:
Well, no Pabst, but plenty of beer.
-As they say, when in Humong.
-Ha, ha.
Hey, what am I doing wrong?
Every time I look at somebody, they look at the ground.
You're fine.
[SPEAKING IN HMONG]
WALT:
What's she saying?
-She said welcome to her home.
-Oh, no, she's not.
-Yeah, no, she didn't.
-She hates me.
Come on.
-Yeah, she hates you.
Okay.
Hey.
[PEOPLE MURMURING]
Hey, what are all you fish heads looking at anyway?
I think we should go into the other room.
Sorry.
SUE:
A lot of people in this house are very traditional.
Number one, never touch a Hmong person on their head, not even a child.
Hmong people believe that the soul resides on the head, so don't do that.
Well, sounds dumb, but fine.
Yeah, and a lot of Hmong people consider looking someone in the eye to be very rude.
That's why they look away when you look at them.
-Anything else?
-Yeah.
Some Hmong people tend to smile or grin when they're yelled at.
It's a cultural thing.
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity.
It's not that they're laughing at you or anything.
Yeah.
God, you people are nuts.
But the food does look good.
Smells good too.
Well, of course.
It's Hmong food.
Yeah.
Okay.
Can I come back for seconds?
-Here you go.
-Thanks.
You know, you mentioned about looking at people.
-He's been staring at me the whole evening.
-That's Kor Khue.
He's the Lor family shaman.
And what's that, some sort of a witch doctor or something?
-Something like that.
-Yeah.
Booga-booga.
Ha, ha.
Very funny, Wally.
[BOTH SPEAKING IN HMONG]
Kor Khue's interested in you.
He heard what you did.
He would like to read you.
It'd be rude not to allow him this.
It's a great honor.
-Yeah, sure, fine by me.
Sure.
-All right.
Take a seat.
WALT:
Here?
He says that people do not respect you.
They don't even wanna look at you.
He says the way you live, your food has no flavor.
You're worried about your life.
You made a mistake in your past life, like a mistake that you did you're not satisfied with.
He says you have no happiness in your life.
It's like you're not at peace.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm....
Yeah, I'm fine.
Fine.
I'm fine.
God, I've got more in common with these gooks than I do my own spoilt rotten family.
Jesus Christ.
Happy birthday.
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
You were bleeding.
No, I bit my tongue.
It's nothing.
Why don't we go and get some of that good gook food?
-You know, I'm starving.
-Okay.
Fantastic.
Well, you ladies are wonderful.
This stuff is really good.
Come on, you glutton.
-What's up?
-Let's go.
-What for?
SUE:
To mingle.
Mingle?
We're mingling right here.
Come on.
You told me not to leave you alone.
Thank you very much, but I have to go now.
I have to go now.
I'll be back.
Now, don't let anything go away.
[MUSIC PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]
Oh, great.
Well, well, well.
Look who's over there.
-Yeah, the kid who stole my Gran Torino.
-My brother, Thao.
Tried to, anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah, Toad.
It was a little wobbly, but that should fix it.
YOUA:
So where are you guys from?
-I'm not far from here.
-I'm from Texas.
-What's this?
-A little rice liquor.
Here, try it.
All right.
My friends and I were just wondering what you're doing here.
Well, that's a good question.
What am I doing here?
-Name's Walt.
-Hi, Walt.
I'm Youa.
-Yuam.
A pleasure.
-No.
Youa.
Youa, okay.
So, what do you do?
-Oh, I fix things, stuff like that.
-Like what?
Well, I just fixed that dryer there, I fixed my wife's friend's sink and I took old Aunt Mary to the doctor's to get her prescription fixed up.
And then I even fixed a door that hadn't even broken yet.
You're funny.
I've been called a lot of things, but never funny.
-Well, I'm gonna take off.
Enjoy yourself.
-Okay.
Yum Yum.
Pleasure.
Look, she's going, man.
Come on.
MAN:
Youa, wait up.
Relax, zipperhead.
I'm not gonna shoot you.
I'd look down too, if I was you.
I knew you were a dipshit the first time I ever saw you but I never thought you were worse with women than you are at stealing cars, Toad.
-It's Thao.
-What?
It's not Toad, it's Thao.
My name is Thao.
Yeah, well, you're blowing it with that girl who was there.
Not that I give two shits about a toad like you.
-You don't know what you're talking about.
-You're wrong.
I know exactly what I'm talking about.
I may not be the most pleasant person to be around but I got the best woman that was ever on this planet to marry me.
I worked at it.
It was the best thing that ever happened to me.
But you, you know, you're letting Click Clack, Ding Dong, and Charlie Chan just walk out with Miss What's-Her-Face.
She likes you, you know?
Though I don't know why.
Who?
Yum Yum.
You know, the girl in the purple sweater.
She's been looking at you all day, stupid.
You mean Youa.
Yeah, Yum Yum, yeah.
Nice girl.
Nice girl.
A very charming girl.
I talked with her.
Yeah.
But you, you let her just walk right out with the Three Stooges.
And you know why?
Because you're a big, fat pussy.
Well I gotta go.
Good day, puss-cake.
[WOMEN SPEAKING IN HMONG]
No.
No more.
Well, okay, put them over there.
Bye-bye.
No, no.
No, no more.
No more.
Come on.
No more, now.
No more, please.
I--
Is this that chicken-dumpling thing you brought the other--?
Oh, all right.
Come on, ladies.
Certainly better than beef jerky, I'll tell you.
What's going on?
Thao is here to make amends.
He's here to work for you.
[VU SPEAKING IN HMONG]
No, he isn't.
He's not gonna work for me.
My mom said he dishonored the family and now he has to work off his debt.
-He'll start tomorrow morning.
-Not tomorrow, not any time.
I don't even want him on my property.
I thought we went over all that.
It's very important that you accept, and it would be an insult if you refuse.
Why is this being put back on me?
He's the one who tried to steal my car.
All of a sudden, I'm the bad guy in this.
Look, my family is very traditional and would be very much upset if you don't let Thao repay.
If he doesn't wanna do it, then let's just go.
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Yeah.
Shut up.
All right.
Tomorrow, come on.
Tomorrow.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thank you.
Jesus, Joseph, and Mary, these Hmong broads are like badgers.
Son of a bitch, I never thought he'd show.
All right.
What are you good at?
Like what?
Well, that's what I'm asking.
If you're gonna work for me, I gotta know what you're good at.
I gotta know what you can do.
I don't know.
Well, that's kind of halfway what I expected you to say.
You see that tree right there?
You just go over there and count the birds.
You want me to count the birds?
Yeah, you can count.
All you slopes are supposed to be good at math, right?
-Yeah, I can count.
-Good.
One, two....
So, what do you have for me today?
You want me to watch paint dry?
-Maybe even count the clouds that pass by?
-Don't get flip with me, boy.
I'm not the one who tried to steal.
Don't you forget that.
Go ahead.
I don't care if you insult me or say racist things.
Because you know what?
I'll take it.
Yeah, course you'll take it, because you have no teeth, you have no balls, kid.
Look, I'm stuck here so why don't you just find something useful for me to do?
Because unlike you, I'm not useless, and I maintain my own property.
You swamp rats, on the other hand, you just can't help but....
How long do I have you for?
-Toad?
How long?
-Till next Friday.
Yeah.
[CHUCKLES]
All right.
Go get the ladder out of the garage.
When you get finished with that roof there, you can take that gutter and nail it back up.
I'm tired of looking at it the last three years.
[MAN SPEAKING IN HMONG]
Yeah.
Yeah, you said it, brother.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
Hello.
Grandpa says he wants to know if you can have Thao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch.
Wasp nest?
Well, that's terrible.
Yeah, well, I think we can handle that after lunch.
[GIRL SPEAKING IN HMONG]
[DOORBELL RINGING]
[COUGHING]
Jesus, Lord Almighty, knock it off.
Hey, it's my last day.
So, what else do you have for me to do?
Take the day off.
You've done enough.
Toad.
Nothing, never mind.
WOMAN:
The doctor will see you now.
Thank you.
Koski?
Mr. Kowalski?
Good morning.
I looked over your paperwork and I think we should immediately start a full battery of tests.
I feel that this would be the best way to go about...
-...checking out the issues that you've had--
-Excuse me.
What happened to Dr. Feldman, my regular doctor?
Dr. Feldman retired three years ago.
I'm his replacement, Dr. Chu.
[PHONE RINGING]
-It's Grandpa Walt.
-Pick it up.
-You talk to him.
-Mitch.
-I'm doing bills here.
KAREN:
You talk to him.
He's your father.
Hey, Dad.
WALT:
Hi, Mitch, it's-
- It's me, your dad.
Yeah, I know.
What's up?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing much, really.
-How's everything going?
-I'm fine.
Fine.
Doing fine.
Fine.
Good.
How about Karen and the kids?
Fine, everybody's great.
Doing fine.
-Good.
How about work?
-Busy.
- Yeah.
-Yeah, I suppose.
In fact, speaking of busy, I got a lot on my plate right now so if there's not something pressing....
No.
No, not at all.
So why don't you call me this weekend?
Sure.
Okay.
It was nice talking to you, Dad.
Thanks for calling.
Thanks.
Yeah.
[L.P., BUDDAH, CUZZ L.B.'S "APPRECIATION" PLAYS ON CAR STEREO]
This kid doesn't have a chance.
-What do you know about faucets?
-I know a lot about them, boy.
Stand aside.
-Jesus.
For the love of Pete.
-What?
It must be a hundred degrees in here.
Why don't you turn on the fan?
The place is falling apart.
THAO:
Man, where'd you get all this stuff?
-What are you talking about?
-All the tools and stuff.
Well, it may come as a surprise to a thief but I bought this stuff, everything in here, with my own money.
Yeah, yeah.
That's not what I meant.
I mean, there's just so much shit packed in here.
Yeah.
Well, every tool in here has a purpose.
Everything has a job to do.
They're all to use if necessary.
Okay, so, what's that?
-That's a post-hole digger.
-That?
Vise grips.
-That?
-Wire cutters.
You know it's a trowel, come on.
Those are shears there, and that's a saw.
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me, kid.
All right, what's on your mind?
It's just, I can't afford to buy all this stuff.
Well, I guess even a bonehead like you could understand that a man acquires this over a period of 50 years.
-Yeah, but....
-All right, look, here.
Take these three items, right here.
You can have this.
WD-40, vise grips and some duct tape.
Any man worth his salt can do half of the household chores with just those three things.
Anything else you need, you just borrow it, that's all.
Okay.
Cool.
[COUGHING]
-Fuck me.
-What's with that?
Nothing.
What?
Nothing, huh?
I just saw you coughed up blood.
That's not good.
You should really see a doctor.
Yeah.
Look those guys who were here the other night, on my lawn.
What about them?
Just a gang, a bunch of Hmong gangbangers.
Yeah, I assumed that, but what were they doing here?
They were gonna take me away.
They were kind of pissed that I blew my first initiation.
Yeah.
Well, you are a pussy, you know, you wanna hang out with guys like that.
What was your initiation supposed to be?
My Gran Torino?
Christ all Friday.
Shit.
Toad, you got a minute?
All right.
Okay.
Here it is.
Here's the deal.
I take the top because that's the heaviest.
I pull on that, and you stand right back here and you push and help me push it up each step.
-Just like that.
-Then let me take the top.
No, no, I've got the top.
Really, I'll take the top.
It looks heavy.
Look, I'm not crippled.
I've got the top.
If you don't let me take the top, I ain't helping.
-Now, listen to me, zipperhead--
-No, you listen, old man.
I'm here because you needed help.
So it's either top or I'm out of here.
[GROWLS]
All right.
You take the top, and I'll push.
Just don't let it slip out of your little-girl hands and crush me.
Don't give me any ideas, now.
-That thing weighs a ton.
-Yeah.
It runs like a clock, though.
They just don't make them like this anymore.
So, what are you gonna do with it?
Sell it, I guess.
How much?
60 bucks.
They....
I'm tired of having it sit around down in the basement there.
Why?
You looking for a freezer?
The downstairs one kind of died.
Okay. 25 bucks and it's yours.
Twenty-five?
But you just said 60.
I know, but this'll save me money putting an ad in the paper.
-Come on, let's wheel it over to your place.
-All right.
Okay.
-Kind of ironic, huh?
WALT:
What?
Toad washing the car that he tried to steal from you.
Yeah.
He misses one spot, he's doing it all over again too.
It's nice of you to look after him like this.
He doesn't have any real role models in his life.
Well, I'm not any role model.
But you're a good man, Wally.
I wish our father would've been more like you.
-Don't go calling me Wally.
-No, I'm serious.
He was really hard on us, really traditional, and really old-school.
-Yeah, well, I'm old-school.
-Yeah, but you're an American.
What's that supposed to mean?
You like him, don't you?
Are you kidding?
He tried to steal my car.
Uh-huh.
And you spend time with him teach him how to fix things, saved him from that fucked cousin of ours.
-Hey.
Watch your language, lady.
-And you're a good man.
I'm not a good man.
Get me another beer, dragon lady.
This one's empty.
You know, the Hmong consider gardening to be women's work.
Yeah.
That's probably why I see you in the garden over there all the time.
Besides, we ain't in Humong.
Funny.
You know, you should quit.
That's bad for you.
Yeah?
So is being in a gang, dipshit.
Didn't you hear what I just said?
I saw you cough up blood.
You should quit.
So, what's that emblem supposed to mean anyway?
Is it your ancient Cub Scout emblem?
First Cavalry.
I've had it since '51 .
So, what do you want to do with your life, kid?
Well, I was thinking about maybe sales.
Sales, huh?
My oldest son is in sales.
-Does he do well?
-Oh, yeah.
License to steal.
I work in the Ford factory for 50 years, and he's out selling Japanese cars.
-You made cars?
-Yeah.
I put the steering column in this Gran Torino in 1 972, right on the line.
Oh, you are old.
So cool.
Yeah.
So you wanna be in sales.
You thinking about going to school maybe?
-Kind of, but school costs money.
-Well, maybe you should get a job.
You can't just sit there and spread mulch in my garden the rest of your life.
-Well, maybe you could just pay me.
-Yeah.
Very funny.
Well, what kind of job could I ever get?
Yeah.
You're right.
Nobody would ever hire you.
Yeah, I know.
Look, I'm just kidding, zip.
I mean, you could get a job.
-You could get a job anywhere.
-Like what?
-Well, how about construction?
-Me?
-Yeah.
-Construction?
-You have Alzheimer's or something?
-No.
You could get a job in construction.
I know people in the trades.
Course, I have to make a little adjustment and man you up a little bit.
-Man me up?
-Yeah.
And I think you ought to date Miss Yum Yum too.
Do you a little good.
You know, get a little carbon off the valves.
Now you're just gonna learn how guys talk.
You just listen to the way Martin and I batter it back and forth.
-You okay?
You ready?
-Sure.
WALT:
All right.
Let's go in.
Perfect.
A Polack and a chink.
How you doing, Martin, you crazy Italian prick?
You cheap bastard, I should've known you'd come in.
I was having such a pleasant day.
What'd you do, Jew some poor blind guy out of his money?
-Gave him the wrong change?
-Who's the Nip?
Oh, he's a pussy kid from next door.
I'm just trying to man him up a little bit.
Mm.
You see, kid?
Now, that's how guys talk to one another.
-They do?
-What, you got shit in your ears?
Now go on out and come back in, and talk to him like a man.
Like a real man.
-Come on, Walt.
-Come on.
Get your ass out of here.
And come on back now.
-Sorry about this.
-It's okay.
What's up, you old Italian prick?
Get out of my shop before I blow your head off...
-...you goddamn dick-smoking gook!
-Jesus Christ.
Oh, shit.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
But that's what you said.
That what you said men say.
You don't just come in and insult the man in his shop.
You don't do that.
What happens if you meet some stranger and get the wrong one?
-He's gonna blow your gook head right off.
-What should I have said, then?
Yeah, kid, why don't you start with "Hi" or "Hello"?
Yeah, just come in and say:
"Sir, I'd like a haircut, if you have time."
Yeah, be polite, but don't kiss ass.
WALT:
You could talk about a construction job you just came from and bitch about your girlfriend and your car.
Son of a bitch, I just got my brakes fixed, and those sons of bitches really nailed me.
-I mean, they screwed me right in the ass.
WALT:
Don't swear at the guy.
Just talk about people who are not in the room.
You could bitch about your boss making you work overtime when it's bowling night.
Right.
Or my old lady bitches for two goddamn hours about how they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store and the minute I turn on the game, she starts crying how we never talk.
You see?
Now go out, come back and talk to him.
And it ain't rocket science, for chrissake.
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car or a girlfriend.
Jesus.
I should've blown his head off when I had the chance.
Yeah.
Maybe so.
Now, okay, I want you to turn around and go outside and come back, and don't talk about having no job no car, no girlfriend, no future, no dick.
Okay?
Just turn around and go.
Excuse me, sir.
I need a haircut, if you ain't too busy.
You old Italian son-of-a-bitch prick barber.
Boy, does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job.
Fuck me.
Jesus Christ.
-All set to go through with it, right?
-Yeah, yeah.
Don't "Yeah, yeah" me.
Just say, "Yes, sir," and, "I'll do my best."
THAO:
Yes.
I'll do my best.
Because when I vouch for somebody, that means I've given my word.
-And I don't want you making me look bad.
-No, I'm good.
Totally into this.
Don't lay down, either.
Just look them straight in the eye.
And a man can tell a lot by your handshake.
-Here.
Put those in your back pocket.
-Cool.
Don't blow this.
Hey, Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon.
How the hell are you?
-I'm shitty, but who's gonna listen?
WALT:
Not me, that's for sure.
Help yourself, there, Walt.
You dumb Polack.
Okay, this is the kid I was telling you about.
Thao, this is Tim Kennedy.
He's the super on this job.
TIM:
So, what do we got here, Walt?
Well, he knows construction, and he's a smart kid.
He'll do anything you need him for.
-You sure?
-Yeah.
-You speak English?
-Yes, sir.
-Were you born here?
-You bet.
I see that Walt drove you here.
You got a vehicle?
Not at the moment.
Taking the bus for now.
The bus.
Jesus Christ, you don't have a car?
My head gasket cracked.
And the goddamn prick at the shop wants to bend me over for 2 100.
Oh, please.
I replaced the tranny in my Tahoe, and the sons of bitches fucked me hard.
-Just under 3200.
-Goddamn thieves.
It ain't right.
You got that right.
Okay, come on in on Monday, and we'll find something for you to do.
-Thanks, Mr. Kennedy.
-It's Tim.
And what's your name again?
-Thao.
-"Tuh," okay.
You owe me one, Walt.
Yeah.
Well, I'll buy you a fruitcake for Christmas.
Fuck the fruitcake.
How about you just hand over them keys to that Gran Torino?
-Why the hell does everybody want my car?
-Well, I'm not surprised.
Yeah, you don't know the half of it.
All right, come on, zipperhead.
We'll let the mick stay here and play with himself.
What are we doing?
What do you wanna do?
Carry your tools in a rice bag?
Here we are.
You can use one of these.
And you'll need one of these.
Here.
THAO:
I can't afford any of this.
WALT:
I'll cover it.
You can pay me back on your first paycheck.
THAO:
Cool.
-Here.
You'll need something like that.
Now, this is what I'm looking for.
Here, tool belt.
-There you go.
-Not to bitch but won't I be needing some tools?
Tools I've got, but I'm not gonna lend my tool belt.
You can pick up tools as you go.
-I really appreciate all this.
-Forget it.
No.
I really do.
Thank you.
[HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR STEREO]
What's up, homeboy?
What you doing?
MAN 1 :
What up, man?
MAN 2:
What you got, punk?
-Just checking up on my little cousin.
SMOKIE:
Yeah, man.
-Our little cousin.
What's this?
SPIDER:
Where you coming from, man?
I'm coming home from work.
Not that you guys would know much about that.
SPIDER:
So it's true.
You got a job.
THAO:
You can't just leave me alone?
-What?
SMOKIE:
Hey, dog, check this out.
[SPEAKS IN HMONG]
MAN 3:
You scared, huh?
SPIDER:
Who bought this shit for you?
Your dad?
-What do you want?
-Your dad bought this?
THAO:
Keep your hands off my stuff.
SPIDER:
Give me the fucking hat.
-Why the fuck you gotta make me look bad?
THAO:
Keep your hands off my stuff!
Smashing's my job, man.
-Yo, give me that.
THAO:
Hey, come on.
That's my stuff.
MAN 1 :
Throw it over the fence, man, fuck it.
THAO:
Let me go.
Let me go.
MAN 2:
Hey, you little bitch.
Give me that, man.
Give me that.
[SPEAKS IN HMONG]
-What's the phrase I'm looking for?
MAN 3:
Fuck him up.
Oh, yeah.
Saving face.
[SCREAMING]
-Hey there.
-Hey.
I gotta run.
Haven't seen you in a few days.
Where you been?
-Been busy.
-Yeah.
Busy, huh?
Hey.
-What the hell happened to you?
-Don't worry about it.
What do you mean, don't worry about it?
Look at your face.
I said, don't worry about it.
Okay?
It's not your problem.
When?
Grabbed me a couple days ago, right after I got off work.
Cowards.
I did everything I could possibly do, but they broke some of your tools.
-I'll replace them.
-Don't worry about the tools.
Where does your cousin live?
No, Walt.
I'll be okay.
-I don't want you to do anything.
-All right.
If you need any extra tools, you just let me know.
Well, I could use a roofing hammer.
Good.
Go in my garage and get it.
That should be the last of them.
Hey.
All right.
Here's the deal.
You stay away from Thao, understand?
You tell your friends to stay away from Thao.
If they don't listen, tell them you don't wanna see them anymore.
That's it.
Got it?
I'll take that as a yes.
If I have to come back here it's gonna get fucking ugly.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
Get out of my way.
How do you want your dog?
I mean, steak?
THAO:
Funny.
-I told you, we only eat cats.
Yeah.
Well.
Whoa.
I've never seen you like this before.
I'm feeling good.
You know, I got beautiful women, great food.
THAO:
And Thao.
-And even Thao isn't bugging me.
-Having a good time, I see.
-Yeah.
THAO:
And it never ends.
-What happened to your knuckles anyways?
I slipped in the shower.
No big problem.
Look, now, Yum Yum, if he doesn't ask you out I'm gonna ask you out.
Youa, don't listen to him, Youa.
He's a white devil.
Yeah, I am.
I'm the white devil.
I'd love to, Walt, but he beat you to it.
Really?
No kidding.
Dinner and a movie or what?
Yeah.
They're taking the bus.
No, you can't take the bus.
We gotta get you something more stylish than that.
Like what?
Take a limo?
How about that?
-The Gran Torino?
-Yeah.
-You'd let me take the Gran Torino?
-Yeah, I'd let you take the Gran Torino.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Yeah.
Yeah.
MAN [ON TV]:
Here's the pitch.
And a strike.
[WOMEN SCREAMING]
WALT:
Is everybody all right?
[VU SPEAKING IN HMONG]
You're all right.
You're okay.
You've got a cut.
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
Where's grandma?
Where is Sue?
Where is Sue?
-She went to our aunt's.
-Your aunt's?
You sure?
-Yeah.
-Get on the phone and call right now.
[SPEAKING IN HMONG]
I knew this was gonna happen.
Tried to-
- What the hell am I doing here?
Well, maybe some of her friends called and they changed plans.
Yeah.
In the war, we just lost a lot of friends, but you're kind of set for it.
You're geared to it.
[SPEAKING IN HMONG]
No, no, no.
You fuck!
You rotten fuck!
Mr. Kowalski?
-You okay?
-Yeah.
I'm okay.
The police finally left.
No one's talking.
One thing about the Hmong, they keep their mouths shut.
Yeah, I've noticed that.
You know, Thao and Sue are never gonna find peace in this world as long as that gang's around.
Until they go away, you know, forever.
What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.
I took Sue to the hospital.
She's scared.
They're all scared.
Yeah.
Thao, especially.
He's sitting out there right now, staring at your front door.
You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.
What would you do?
-What should Thao do?
-I know what I would do if I was you.
-Or at least what you think you should do.
-Really?
If I was Thao, I guess I'd want vengeance.
I'd wanna stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys.
And you?
What would I do?
I'd come over here and talk to you, I guess.
I know you're close with these people, but this pisses me off too, Mr. Kowalski.
Want a beer?
I'd love one.
There's some in the chest right over there behind you.
Damn all this.
-Just isn't fair.
-Nothing's fair, Father.
So, what are you gonna do, Mr. Kowalski?
Call me Walt.
All right.
What are you gonna do, Walt?
I don't know but I'll think of something.
Whatever it is, they won't have a chance.
What are you doing?
-Thinking.
-Thinking?
Thinking time is over.
Now it's time to knock the shit out of those pricks.
I know you don't wanna hear this, but now's the time to stay calm.
Calm?
You want me to be calm?
We stay calm or else mistakes get made.
We have to step back from this thing.
No.
Don't let me down, Walt.
Not you.
This is gonna end today.
Sit down.
-I don't wanna sit.
-I said, sit down.
Now, listen to me.
We gotta plan this, and plan it very carefully.
We can't make any mistakes.
Now, you know I'm the right man for this job.
So I want you to go home and stay calm and come back here at 4 this afternoon.
-And what needs to be done will be done.
-I say we go now.
Right now.
And what?
Kill that cousin of yours and the rest of those zips?
Mr. Tough Guy out for blood all of a sudden?
You know nothing about it.
Now go home and you stay calm.
Come back here at 4.
All right?
Okay?
Okay.
Yeah.
I know, I know.
Give me a break, will you?
It's the first time I've ever smoked in the house.
Let a man enjoy himself, would you, girl?
All finished.
Ten dollars American.
I don't suppose your Guinea hands are steady enough to do a straight shave?
Straight shave?
You've never asked for a straight shave.
I know, but I've always wondered about it.
That's unless you're too busy.
-No, just let me heat up a towel.
-Yeah.
And here, here's a 20.
Keep the change.
That's just in case you hit my jugular.
It's gonna take about one hour.
We gonna shorten the sleeves a little bit.
Gonna fix the shoulder.
-Yeah.
I never had a fitted suit before.
-Yes, sir.
-Mm-hm.
-You look very good.
-What can I do for you, Mr. Kowalski?
-I'm here for a confession.
Oh, Lord Jesus.
What have you done?
-Nothing.
You just take it easy, now.
-What are you up to?
Are you gonna give me a confession or not?
How long has it been since your last confession?
WALT:
Oh, forever.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
What are your sins, my son?
Well, in 1 968, I kissed Betty Jablonski at the factory Christmas party.
Dorothy was in the other room with the other wives.
It just happened.
Yes, go on.
Well, I made a 900-dollar profit selling a boat and a motor.
I didn't pay the taxes.
It's the same as stealing.
Yes, fine.
Oh, lastly I was never very close with my two sons.
I don't know them.
I didn't know how.
That's it?
That's it?
It's bothered me most of my life.
Say 10 "Hail Marys" and five "Our Fathers."
God loves you and forgives you, and I absolve you of all your sins.
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Thank you, Padre.
Are you going to retaliate for what happened to Sue?
I'm going over to that house today, Mr. Kowalski.
WALT:
Is that so?
It is.
And every other day until you see the folly in what you're planning.
-Busy day.
Gotta go.
-Go in peace.
Oh, I am at peace.
Jesus Christ.
So which one's mine?
You ever fired a weapon before?
No.
Well, why don't you put that one down?
And I got something I wanna show you.
Come on.
THAO:
What?
1 952, we were sent up to take out a chink machine-gun nest.
Been shredding us up pretty good.
I was the only one that came back that day.
For that, they gave me a Silver Star.
Here it is.
Here.
I want you to have it.
Why?
Why?
Because we all knew the dangers that night, but we went anyway.
That's the way it might be tonight.
There's always a chance you don't come back.
The hell we won't.
We're gonna roll up in there and tear some ass.
That's foolish.
That's the exact reaction they're waiting for.
Go ahead and close this up.
-How many?
-How many what?
How many men did you kill in Korea?
-Thirteen.
Maybe more.
-What was it like to kill a man?
You don't wanna know.
Now close it up.
[DOOR SLAMS]
[LOCK CLICKS]
Walt.
Walt.
What are you doing?
-What are you doing?
-Relax.
You can't get out of there.
You let me out right now.
Let me out.
-Fucking let me out or I'll fucking kill you.
-Shut the fuck up.
You wanna know what it's like to kill a man?
Well, it's goddamn awful, that's what it is.
The only thing worse is getting a medal for killing some poor kid that wanted to just give up, that's all.
Yeah, some scared little gook just like you.
I shot him in the face with that rifle you were holding in there a while ago.
Not a day goes by that I don't think about it, and you don't want that on your soul.
Now, I got blood on my hands.
I'm soiled.
That's why I'm going it alone tonight.
Walt.
You take me with you right now.
Let me out!
Look, you've come a long way.
I'm proud to say that you're my friend but you got your whole life ahead of you.
But me, I finish things.
That's what I do.
And I'm going it alone.
No.
Wait!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
[grandma SPEAKING IN HMONG]
Look, I need you to watch my dog.
Yeah, I love you too.
Yeah, she's old too.
Bye-bye, sweetheart.
Take it easy.
Her name is Daisy.

[PHONE RINGING]
-Hello?
W ALT :
It's Walt.
The keys to my house are under the ceramic turtle on the porch.
Let yourself in.
Your brother's in the basement.
I gotta go.
[grandma SPEAKING IN HMONG]
Sorry, Father, we have to go.
I'm telling you, if we're not here, there will be bloodshed.
We've been here for hours.
We can't afford to anchor a unit to one location.
I'm begging you to stay.
Just got word from my sergeant.
We're pulling the plug.
-I'm staying.
-No, you aren't.
We have specific orders.
You came with us, you're leaving with us.
Watch your head.
THAO:
Sue.
Over here.
Over here.
-Come unlock this.
SUE:
What's going on?
He left without me.
He went to Smokie's without me.
SUE:
Thao!
[GANGBANGERS CHATTERING]
MAN 1 :
What the fuck, man?
Any swamp rats in there?
-I didn't think your ass would've came.
-Shut up, gook.
I got nothing to say to you, shrimp-dick midget like you.
Yeah, yeah.
You go ahead, watch out for your boyfriend.
Because it was either he or you or someone who raped one of their own family.
Your own blood, for chrissake.
Now, go ahead and pull those pistols like miniature cowboys.
-Go ahead.
-So where's Thao at?
-That pussy motherfucker couldn't come?
-Don't worry about Thao.
Thao's got not one second for you.
SMOKIE:
Says who?
You?
What the fuck you gonna do, old man?
[GANGBANGERS CHUCKLE]
MAN 1 :
What you gonna do...
-...punk ass old man?
MAN 2:
Bitch.
-Kind of jumpy, aren't we?
-Shut the fuck up.
You shut the fuck up.
-Got a light?
SPIDER:
What the fuck?
No.
Me.
I've got a light.
Hail Mary, full of grace.
-Yes, Sergeant.
THAO:
What happened?
-You need to step back.
-He's a friend of mine.
I said, step back.
Hey, did you hear him?
Step back.
-What happened?
-Hey, step back.
He's my friend.
[IN HMONG] Please, it's important.
[IN HMONG] He went for his lighter and they shot him.
He didn't even have a gun on him.
This time we have witnesses.
These guys will be locked up for a long time.
Officer Chang!
Get those people back.
[IN ENGLISH] You have to step back now, okay?
Get them the fuck out of here.
Get them out of here.
Walt Kowalski once said to me that I didn't know anything about life or death because I was an over-educated, 27-year-old virgin who held the hands of superstitious old women and promised them eternity.
[PEOPLE CHUCKLE]
Walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it but he was right.
I knew really nothing about life or death until I got to know Walt.
And, boy, did I learn.
"And I wanna leave my house to the church because Dorothy would've liked it."
Now, which brings us to our last item, and again please excuse the language in Mr. Kowalski's will.
I'm simply reading it the way it was written.
"And I'd like to leave my 1 972 Gran Torino to my friend Thao Vang Lor on the condition that you don't chop-top the roof like one of those beaners don't paint any idiotic flames on it like some white-trash hillbilly and don't put a big, gay spoiler on the rear end like you see on all the other zipperheads' cars.
It just looks like hell.
If you can refrain from doing any of that, it's yours."
Encoded by Judas Enjoy!
I'm real sorry about Dorothy, Walt.
She was a real peach.
Thanks for coming, Al.
Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
Father.
Spirit.
Uh.
Holy Spirit.
WOMAN:
It's okay, I can move down.
Spectacles, testicles, wallet, and watch.
Look at the way the old man glared at Ashley.
Can't even tone it down for Mom's funeral.
What do you expect?
Dad's still living in the '50s.
He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly.
Well, your kid's wearing a Lions jersey.
I'm sure Dad appreciates that.
The point is that there's nothing anyone can do that won't disappoint the old man.
It's inevitable.
You know, that's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings.
You know, that deal with the boat motor, the broken birdbath. lt's always something.
What are we gonna do with him?
Don't you think he's gonna get in trouble, all by himself in the old neighborhood?
Well, why don't you have him move in with you?
Ha, ha, ha.
Hey.
Shh.
Death is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics.
Bitter in the pain, sweet in the salvation.
Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased and their families.
Sweet to those of us who know the salvation that awaits.
And some may ask, "What is death?
is it the end?
Or is it the beginning?
And what is life?
What is this thing we call life?"
-All these questions can frustrate you.
KAREN:
Ashley, stop it.
JANOVlCH:
That's why you have to turn to the Lord.
Jesus.
JANOVlCH:
Because the Lord is the sweetness....
WOMAN:
This is so good.
MAN:
Did you have a chance to call Martha?
david:
is that Dad?
daniel:
No.
That's Grandpa Walt.
"Third platoon, E company, March 2nd, 1 952, Korea"?
Where's Korea?
A lot of people showed up after the service.
Well, I suppose they heard there's gonna be a lot of ham.
I'll go down in the basement and get some chairs.
-Oh, I can do that, Dad.
-No, I need them now, not next week.
Cool, I found a medal.
Look at this.
How much longer do we have to stay?
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell, and I'm bored.
Ashley, why don't you go help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?
-Me?
-Yes, you.
Go.
Go help him.
Grandpa Walt, would you like some help with this?
With your chairs?
No.
You probably just painted your nails.
KAREN:
Honey, come here.
Okay, well, your dad is driving me crazy.
-Why did you make me do that?
KAREN:
It's okay.
We're leaving soon.
W ALT :
Hey, girl.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come with me.
How many swamp rats can you get in one room?
Wow.
Grandpa, when did you get the vintage car?
1 972.
I never knew you had a cool old car.
Yeah.
Well, it's been here since before you were born.
So what are you gonna do with it when you, like, die?
What about that super-cool retro couch you have in the den?
Because I'm going to state next year and it would look really good in my room, and I don't have any furniture at all.
Oh, God.
-Who are you?
What do you want?
-Hi.
-l live--
-Get the shit out of your mouth.
-Tell me what you want.
-Do you have jumper cables?
-My uncle's car is old and--
-We don't have any cables.
And have some respect, zipperhead.
We're in mourning here.
-How you holding up, Walt?
-Mr.
Kowalski.
Huh?
Mr. Kowalski, that's my name.
Right.
Mr. Kowalski.
Your wife and I became quite close these last few months.
She asked that I watch over you when she passed on.
I told her I watch over my flock.
But she made me promise I'd keep an extra-sharp eye on you.
Look, I appreciate the kindness you've shown to my wife.
Now that you've spoken your piece why don't you go tend to some of your other sheep?
Okay?
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her desire for you to go to confession.
She said she couldn't remember the last time you went.
-ls that so?
-lt is.
Well, I confess that I never really cared for church very much.
The only reason I went was because of her.
And I confess that I have no desire to confess to a boy that's just out of the seminary.
MAN:
Great to see you.
-Bye, dear.
-So long, Walt.
WOMAN:
Walt, can you get it started?
WALT:
Yeah, it'll be fine.
I wish I could help, Dad, but I gotta get the kids home.
-Kids are getting restless.
-Yeah, fine.
Just go.
I'll call you, see how you're doing.
All right.
Kill you to buy American?
Jesus.
Did you see the way he looked at the truck?
It's always rice-burner this, Jap-burner that, you know?
-Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go.
-He didn't say anything.
-He didn't need to.
-What do you expect?
The man worked at Ford all those years.
-l suppose that's my goddamn fault.
-Just give it a rest, just drive, okay?
Kids, want the radio on?
Anyone wanna listen to some music?
Good.
Damn barbarians.
I'm just so brokenhearted.
I want my daughter to find another husband.
If she married again there would be a man in the house.
What about Thao?
The man of the house is right there.
GRANDMA:
Look at him washing dishes.
He does whatever his sister orders him to do.
How could he ever become the man of the house?
Be patient, once he's older, he will be the man of the house.
No way.
Today is a blessed day, for a child is born.
I offer food to nurture this child's body.
I offer clothing to protect this child's flesh.
The child is blessed with a mother and father.
Oh, spirit of this child return home and do not wander anymore.
Come home, spirit and soul, come home.
Live a good life and grow old.
Jesus.
Polarski would roll over in his grave if he could see his lawn now.
What the hell did Chinks have to move into this neighborhood for?
Why does that old white man stay here?
All the Americans have moved out of this neighborhood.
Why haven't you gone?
Why don't you strut away, you dumb rooster?
Are you gone completely deaf or something?
Hi there, Walt.
I'm not a friend of yours, so why do you insist on calling me Walt?
Sorry.
Mr. Kowalski.
-What are you peddling today, Padre?
-Nothing. I thought I'd drop by and see you.
I haven't seen you in church.
Now that you've done your good deed, why don't you take off down the road?
-l'd really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.
-Not in this lifetime, sonny.
Why?
Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
-You don't wanna know.
-No, I do.
Well, I think you're an over-educated 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold hands of ladies who are superstitious and promises them eternity.
Yo!
Hey!
is you--?
is you a boy or is you a girl, man?
I can't tell.
Hey, chinito, hey, if you was in the pen I'd be fucking you in the ass.
You'd be my bitch.
MAN 1 :
What are you reading, Jackass and the Rice Stalk?
Yeah, that's right, keep walking!
Keep walking!
Look at me when I talk to you, homes!
MAN 2:
Fucking slopes, man, everywhere you look, man.
MAN 1 :
Slopes everywhere we go, man.
MAN 3:

MAN 4:

-That's my little cousin over there.
-You sure that's your cousin, man?
-Fuck, yeah, that's my little cousin.
-He tight with anybody?
No, he flies solo, man.
You wanna do something?
Man, let's go down there and see what the fuck they doing over there.
MAN 2:
I like your sandals too.
-Hey.
Yo, what's up?
What's up?
-Yo, what's up, motherfuckers?
They fucking with you?
Man, fuck you, homeboy!
-What you got?
MAN 2:
Hey, we can do this right now.
-You go fucking back to your country.
-Fuck you, man.
Oh, good, more fucking rice niggers.
Aren't you supposed to cook me some Chinese food, huh?
-How many bullets you got?
-We'll catch you on the rebound, homey.
spider:

SMOKlE:

Thao.
-Get with us, man.

Man, fuck it.

Why you gotta be a little girl?
Tomorrow.

SMOKlE:
Let's get the fuck out of here.
-We've got the strap.
MAN 5:
Let's get the fuck out of here.
-Fuck that pussy.
MAN 6:
Pussy.
Hey, Thao.
Hey, what's up?
What's up, Thao?
What are you doing, little man?
-Why you doing women's work?
-What do you want?
What?
I can't just come and talk to my little cousin?
-He doesn't wanna talk to you.
-Well, I'm here, right?
SMOKlE:
Hey, Spider, who that?
spider:
What's up?
Spider?
is that what he just called you, Fong?
Spider.
-ls there something wrong with Spider?
-What are you doing here?
Hey, so how old is you anyways?
-Mentally, I'm way too old for you.
-What?
You guys are stupid. I'm going inside.
-What?
-Sue.
Help your little bro do this gardening.
Bite it, stupid.
Hey.
You wanna roll with us, man?
Come on.
-Dude.
-Come on, ride with us.
Come on.
Come on, chill with us.
You need somebody to protect you.
That's what your big coz is for.
Look, dog, I been there, done it, and I seen it, man.
Back in the day, everybody used to wanna beat me up.
But now, nobody wanna fuck with me.
-Come on, man, let's go.
-We're coz, right?
SMOKlE:
Come on.
-We're coz, right?
We're family.
Look, a brother to Spider is a brother to me.
Come on.
Dude, man, take this shit off.
Come on.
SMOKlE:
Come on, roll with us.
Come on.
spider:
That's woman's work, man.
MAN:
Don't get your hands dirty, man.
So, what do I have to do?
Spider told me that our boy next door got a bad-ass whip.
Come on.
Nice.
Yeah, my little cousin being a little man.
Whoa.
SMOKlE:
Yo, now, that's a nice car.
Hell, yeah. 1972 Gran Torino, fastback.
-Yo.
-Cobra jet engine.
Yo, man, it's still in mint condition.
Yo, man. lt's in mint condition, man.
Oh, I've got one.
There's a Mexican, a Jew, and a colored guy go into a bar.
The bartender looks up and says, "Get the fuck out of here."
So here's where my flock congregates when they're not in church.
Hey, Father J.
Hi, Mel.
Hey there, Darrell.
-Hello, Father.
-Hi, Walt.
What brings you in here, Father?
The meat raffle?
No, I just came down to talk to Walt, if that's okay.
Damn, Padre, you are persistent, aren't you?
I promised your wife.
All right.
Let's get a booth.
I'll have a Pabst and a shot of Jack and whatever he's having.
-l'll have a Diet Coke.
-Bullshit, this is a bar.
You have a drink.
-Um, I'll have a gin and tonic.
WALT:
Attaboy.
So what do you want?
I promised your wife I'd get you to go to confession.
Now, why would you do that?
She was very insistent.
She made me.
You're kind of fond of promising things you can't deliver on.
Right, Father?
-Let's talk about something else.
-What?
Life and death.
Life and death.
What the hell do you know about life and death?
I'd like to think I know a lot. I'm a priest.
Yeah.
You get up and preach about life and death but all you know is what you learned in priest school.
Right out of the rookie preacher's handbook.
I don't know about that. I think--
Death is bittersweet.
Sort of bitter in its pain, but sweet in its salvation.
That's what you know about life and death, and it's pathetic.
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?
I know a lot. I lived for almost three years in Korea with it.
Thanks.
We shot men stabbed them with bayonets, hacked 1 7-year-olds to death with shovels.
Stuff I'll remember till the day I die.
Horrible things, but things I'll live with.
And what about life?
Well, I survived the war.
Got married, had a family.
Sounds like you know a lot more about death than you do living.
Maybe so, Father.
Maybe so.
Son of a bitch.
spider:
Come on, get in the car!
Thao, what the fuck?
Get in!
-Get in, Thao.
-Come on, let's go.
Get in.
Fuck, man?
Get in!
-Hello?
-Hey.
Morning, Dad.
It's your number one son, Mitch.
Morning?
It's after 1 in the afternoon, it's not morning.
Oh, right.
Afternoon, then.
So, what do you want?
What?
No.
Nothing.
I mean, what would I want?
Well, I don't know.
Your wife's already gone through all your mother's jewelry.
No, Dad, I'm just calling to see how you're doing.
Just....
Anything new with the old neighborhood?
Yeah.
No.
Great.
Smooth sailing.
Yeah.
-Okay, good.
Good, then.
Oh, hey, Dad.
-Yeah.
You wouldn't happen to still know that guy that has the Lions season tickets?
Oh, you fuck.
Dad--
Ain't she sweet.
Come on, girl.
Yo, what's up?
What are you guys doing out here, man?
THAO:
Nothing.
SUE:
Minding our own business.
THAO:
Just hanging out.
What are you guys doing here?
-What?
THAO:
I told you guys already--
Can't I just come hang out with my little cousin?
Huh?
We have good news for you, man.
Oh, really?
And what's that?
Only for guy talk.
-l don't think so.
-Why not?
Come on, man.
We gonna give you another shot, man.
-Don't go, Thao.
SMOKlE:
Mind your own business, girl.
-Come on, let's go.
spider:
Come.
-Yeah, what are you gonna do, huh?
SMOKlE:
Come on, dog.
spider:
Look.
You've broken Daddy's gnome.
WALT:
What the hell is this?
MAN 1 :
Get up.
-Get off my lawn.
Listen, old man, you don't wanna fuck with me.
Did you hear me?
I said, get off my lawn now.
Are you fucking crazy?
Go back in the house.
Yeah. I blow a hole in your face, and then I go in the house.
And I sleep like a baby.
You can count on that.
We used to stack fucks like you five feet high in Korea use you for sandbags.
Okay.
-But you better watch your back.
-Fuck it, man, he's crazy.
MAN 2:
We'll get this cracker next time.
Thank you.
Get off my lawn.
What the hell is this?
Christ.
No, no.
No, no, no.
Come on, no more.
No more.
No more.
What--?
Stay right there.
Stay right there.
Why can't you just leave me alone?
We brought you some shallots to plant.
-l don't want them.
-They're perennials.
-They come back every year.
-Why are you bringing me all this garbage?
Because....
-Because you saved Thao.
-l didn't save anybody.
I just-- l kept a bunch of jabbering gooks off of my lawn, that's all.
-You're a hero to the neighborhood.
-l'm not a hero.
They think you are.
That's why they keep bringing you gifts.
-Please, take them.
-They're wrong.
Now, I just want to be left alone.
Thank you.
SUE:
Wait.
This is my mom, Vu, I'm Sue, and that's my brother, Thao.
-We live next door.
-So?
Thao wants to say something.
I'm sorry.
-Sorry for what?
-For trying to steal your car.
Let me tell you something, boy.
You step on this property again, you're done.
Good afternoon, Walt.
I told you I'm not going to confession.
-Why didn't you just call the police?
-What?
I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I heard there was trouble in the neighborhood.
Why didn't you call the police?
Well....
You know, I prayed that they would show up but nobody answered.
What were you thinking?
Someone could have been killed.
We're talking life and death here.
When things go wrong, you gotta act quickly.
When we were in Korea and a thousand screaming gooks came across our line we didn't call the police, we reacted.
We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski.
I've been thinking about our conversation on life and death.
About what you said.
About how you carry around all the horrible things you were forced to do horrible things that won't leave you.
It seems it would do you good to unload some of that burden.
Things done during war are terrible.
Being ordered to kill.
Killing to save yourself, killing to save others.
You're right.
Those are things I know nothing about but I do know about forgiveness and I've seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins admitted their guilt, and left their burdens behind them.
Stronger men than you.
Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things and are now at peace.
Well, I gotta hand it to you, Padre.
You came here with your guns loaded this time.
Thank you.
And you're right about one thing.
About stronger men than me reaching their salvation.
Well, halle-fucking-lujah.
But you're wrong about something else.
What's that, Mr. Kowalski?
The thing that haunts a man the most is what he isn't ordered to do.
There.
You finally look like a human being again.
You shouldn't wait so long between haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch.
Yeah.
Well, I'm surprised you're still around.
I was always hoping you'd die and they'd get somebody who knew what they were doing.
Instead you just keep hanging around like the doo-wop dago you are.
-That'll be 10 bucks, Walt.
-Ten bucks?
Jesus Christ, Martin.
What are you, half Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices.
It's been 10 bucks for the last five years, you hard-nosed, Polack son of a bitch.
-Yeah, well, keep the change.
-See you in three weeks, prick.
Not if I see you first, dipshit.
Since everything could go downhill after that.
-Yeah, that's true.
-That would suck.
-That's cool, you know?
Yeah.
MAN:
Ain't shit going on, man.
Ain't shit going on.
Man, look at this.
Look at this, Monk.
Check this out.
MONK:
Oooh.
Boy.
DUKE:
Oh, yeah.
Bring that little tight ass over here.
Come here, girl.
Don't be shy.
What, you can't say hi?
Why you acting all stuck-up and shit?
-What you supposed to be, man?
-Yo, it's cool, dog.
What the fuck you doing in my neighborhood, boy?
Nothing.
Just going down to Corner Spot, you know?
Get some CDs.
It's all good, bro.
See, he called you bro, Duke.
-He called you bro, man.
-lt's all good, bro.
DUKE:
It's all good, huh?
MONK:
Shut the fuck up.
Call me bro again, man, I'll bite your motherfucking face off.
MONK:
Yeah, motherfucker.
Now, what the fuck y'all come down here for?
You here to bring me this little present?
Monk?
She bringing it to us?
This little Oriental yummy.
Don't worry.
I'm gonna take real good care of her.
-Fuck out of here, man.
-Fuck out of here, man.
-l told you we're finished here.
MONK:
Oh, yeah.
Keep your ass right here.
Oh, great.
Another asshole who has a fetish for Asian girls?
God, that gets so old.
MONK:
Oh, shit.
-What's your name, girl?
My name?
Get your ass out of here, okay?
It's "Take your crude come-on to every woman who walks past and cram it." That's my name.
DUKE:
Mouthy little bitch.
-Who you think you talking to?
-Who does it look like?
-You think you real funny, don't you?
-Oh, shit.
Ain't she tough?
What?
You gonna hit me now?
That would pretty much complete the picture.
You need to keep your bitch on a leash.
Put a chain on that whore and yank that motherfucker.
Of course.
Right to the stereotype thesaurus.
Call me a whore and a bitch in the same sentence.
-This bitch is crazy.
DUKE:
I like them like that.
Man, take this bitch.
SUE:
Hey.
Get off me.
-You don't know when to quit, do you?
DUKE:
I'm gonna teach her a lesson.
SUE:
Stop.
Let go.
Get your ass over there.
What the fuck you looking at, old man?
-What the hell are you spooks up to?
-Spooks?
You better get your ass on, honky, while I still let you.
-That's what you better do.
-That's right, bitch.
Fuck you think you at?
Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while that you shouldn't have fucked with?
That's me.
Man, you fucking crazy, man.
Get out of here, man.
Why don't you get your ass up out of here before I kick your old, wrinkly, white ass?
Crazy motherfucker, man.
What's wrong with him, man?
What the fuck?
-This motherfucker crazy, man.
-What's wrong with this nigga, man?
What the hell?
Get in the truck.
This crazy motherfucker, man.
What's wrong with him, man?
MONK:
He put his finger at us.
-Oh, shit.
-Come on, now.
Hey, pops.
Come on, now.
Shut your fucking face.
You fucking don't listen, do you?
Now, get in the truck.
-Go on, get in the truck now.
Shit.
TREY:
Way to go, old man.
Shut up, pussy.
What is all this "bro" shit, anyway?
Want to be Super Spade or something?
These guys don't want to be your bro and I don't blame them.
Now, get your ofay, Paddy ass on down the road.
Take care, now.
Yeah, you too.
Oh, yeah.
Fuck, man, why y'all didn't fucking do nothing?
-Man, kick that nigga's ass.
-Man, you fucking--
Shit, man.
This fucker.
He had that cannon in your fucking face.
-You didn't do nothing.
-Trying to stay out.
What's the matter with you, for chrissake?
Trying to get yourself killed?
I thought you Asian girls were supposed to be smart.
Hanging around a neighborhood like that's a fast way to get you in the obituaries.
I know. I know.
Take it easy.
And what about that goofball guy you were with?
is that a date or something?
Yeah.
Kind of.
His name is Trey.
Well, you shouldn't be hanging out with him.
You should be hanging out with your own people, with other Humongs.
You mean Hmong?
We're Hmong, not "Humong."
Whatever.
Where the hell is Humong, I mean Hmong, anyway?
Wow.
You're so enlightened, you know that?
No, Hmong isn't a place. lt's a people.
Hmong people come from different parts of Laos, Thailand, and China.
Yeah.
Well, how did you end up in my neighborhood, then?
Why didn't you stay there?
It's a Vietnam thing.
We fought on your side.
And when the Americans quit, the Communists started killing all the Hmong.
So we came over here.
Yeah.
Well, I don't know how you ended up in the Midwest.
There's snow on the ground six months out of the year.
Why does a jungle people want to be in the great frozen tundra?
Hill people.
We were hill people.
Not jungle people.
Booga-booga-booga.
Yeah.
Whatever.
Blame the Lutherans.
They brought us over here.
Everybody blames the Lutherans.
Well, you'd think the cold would keep all the idiots out.
Thanks for the ride.
You know something, kid?
You're all right.
But what about that dimwit brother of yours?
-He a little slow or something?
-Thao is actually really smart.
He just doesn't know which direction to go in.
-Yeah.
Poor Toad.
-lt's really common.
Hmong girls over here fit in better.
The girls go to college, and the boys go to jail.
Yeah.
That old hag hates my ass.
Well....
"Your birthday today." Daisy.
"This year, you have to make a choice between two life paths.
Second chances come your way.
Extraordinary events culminate in what might seem to be an anticlimax.
Your lucky numbers are 84, 23 1 1 , 78, and 99."
What a load of shit.
Yeah.
What the hell is it with kids nowadays?
All right.
THAO:
Hey, Mrs. V. Here, let me help you with those.
MRS. V:
Oh, thank you. I just-- THAO:
I got it.
How about that?
THAO:
Here you go.
-How about that, Daisy?
THAO:
Yeah, I got it.
MRS. V.:
That was too heavy for the bag.
THAO:
No problem.
-Thank you.
-Go ahead, Karen, give it to him.
-Here you go.
-Well, what is it?
-lt's a Gopher.
So you can reach stuff.
You know, it makes things a lot easier.
This is from me.
It's a phone.
-Oh, I can see that.
-l just thought--
Well, we thought that it would make things easier.
Well, thank you, Karen.
There's nothing wrong with making things less hard on yourself.
Karen's right, Dad.
You've worked hard your whole life.
Maybe it's time you started thinking about, you know, taking it easier.
Jeez.
That's another thing, Dad.
You really should get rid of the coffin nails.
But, I don't know, we were thinking about the house.
You know, what with Mom gone, it's gotta be a lot to maintain around here.
-Mm-hm.
-Let alone clean.
And, I don't know, you're here all alone.
Yeah, and there are these great places now, you know, these communities where you don't have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow where the people are like you, active and alert, but are alone and would benefit from being around folks their own age.
Yeah, Dad, look.
You gotta check it out.
We've brought some brochures.
These places are nothing like what you'd think they'd be.
-They're great.
-No, no, beautiful.
They're really nice.
They really are.
These are top-notch, like, resorts.
-lt's like staying in a hotel practically.
-They're beautiful.
mitch:
They really are.
-Yeah.
They take care of everything.
They'll clean up.
They're really nice.
They have wonderful stores.
You can buy new shoes.
mitch:
They're amazing.
They really are.
KAREN:
You'd have a good time.
-Play some golf, maybe.
mitch:
Meet other people.
Son of a bitch.
Kicking us out on his birthday.
-l told you this was a bad idea.
-l know.
You were right.
-He won't let anybody help him.
-Well, we tried.
Can we just drop it?
No one can say we didn't try.
The hell with him.
You know what we should've done?
We should've stayed home with Josh and Ashley.
At least they were smart enough to not come.
Goddamn kids have more sense than we do.
WALT:
We miss Mama, don't we, Daisy?
Yeah.
Yeah.
SUE:
Hey, Walt.
What are you up to?
We're having a barbecue.
You wanna come over?
-What do you think?
-There's tons of food.
Yeah.
Just keep your hands off my dog.
-No worries.
We only eat cats.
-Really?
No, I'm kidding, you moron.
Come on, you can be my special guest.
No, I'm fine right here.
Yeah.
-Son of a bitch.
-Okay, so, what have you had to eat today?
Oh, I had a piece of cake and a little beef jerky.
Come on over and get something to eat.
We've got beer too.
Well, I might as well drink with strangers rather than drink alone.
After all, it is my birthday.
-Really?
Happy birthday, Wally.
-Don't call me Wally.
WALT:
Well, no Pabst, but plenty of beer.
-As they say, when in Humong.
-Ha, ha.
Hey, what am I doing wrong?
Every time I look at somebody, they look at the ground.
You're fine.
WALT:
What's she saying?
-She said welcome to her home.
-Oh, no, she's not.
-Yeah, no, she didn't.
-She hates me.
Come on.
-Yeah, she hates you.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey, what are all you fish heads looking at anyway?
I think we should go into the other room.
Sorry.
SUE:
A lot of people in this house are very traditional.
Number one, never touch a Hmong person on their head, not even a child.
Hmong people believe that the soul resides on the head, so don't do that.
Well, sounds dumb, but fine.
Yeah, and a lot of Hmong people consider looking someone in the eye to be very rude.
That's why they look away when you look at them.
-Anything else?
-Yeah.
Some Hmong people tend to smile or grin when they're yelled at.
It's a cultural thing.
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity.
It's not that they're laughing at you or anything.
Yeah.
God, you people are nuts.
But the food does look good.
Smells good too.
Well, of course. lt's Hmong food.
Yeah.
Okay.
Can I come back for seconds?
-Here you go.
-Thanks.
You know, you mentioned about looking at people.
-He's been staring at me the whole evening.
-That's Kor Khue.
He's the Lor family shaman.
And what's that, some sort of a witch doctor or something?
-Something like that.
-Yeah.
Booga-booga.
Ha, ha.
Very funny, Wally.
Kor Khue's interested in you.
He heard what you did.
He would like to read you.
It'd be rude not to allow him this.
It's a great honor.
-Yeah, sure, fine by me.
Sure.
-All right.
Take a seat.
WALT:
Here?
He says that people do not respect you.
They don't even wanna look at you.
He says the way you live, your food has no flavor.
You're worried about your life.
You made a mistake in your past life, like a mistake that you did you're not satisfied with.
He says you have no happiness in your life.
It's like you're not at peace.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm....
Yeah, I'm fine.
Fine. I'm fine.
God, I've got more in common with these gooks than I do my own spoilt rotten family.
Jesus Christ.
Happy birthday.
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
You were bleeding.
No, I bit my tongue. lt's nothing.
Why don't we go and get some of that good gook food?
-You know, I'm starving.
-Okay.
Fantastic.
Well, you ladies are wonderful.
This stuff is really good.
Come on, you glutton.
-What's up?
-Let's go.
-What for?
SUE:
To mingle.
Mingle?
We're mingling right here.
Come on.
You told me not to leave you alone.
Thank you very much, but I have to go now. I have to go now.
I'll be back.
Now, don't let anything go away.
Oh, great.
Well, well, well.
Look who's over there.
-Yeah, the kid who stole my Gran Torino.
-My brother, Thao.
Tried to, anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah, Toad.
It was a little wobbly, but that should fix it.
YOUA:
So where are you guys from?
-l'm not far from here.
-l'm from Texas.
-What's this?
-A little rice liquor.
Here, try it.
All right.
My friends and I were just wondering what you're doing here.
Well, that's a good question.
What am I doing here?
-Name's Walt.
-Hi, Walt. I'm Youa.
-Yuam.
A pleasure.
-No.
Youa.
Youa, okay.
So, what do you do?
-Oh, I fix things, stuff like that.
-Like what?
Well, I just fixed that dryer there, I fixed my wife's friend's sink and I took old Aunt Mary to the doctor's to get her prescription fixed up.
And then I even fixed a door that hadn't even broken yet.
You're funny.
I've been called a lot of things, but never funny.
-Well, I'm gonna take off.
Enjoy yourself.
-Okay.
Yum Yum.
Pleasure.
Look, she's going, man.
Come on.
MAN:
Youa, wait up.
Relax, zipperhead.
I'm not gonna shoot you.
I'd look down too, if I was you.
I knew you were a dipshit the first time I ever saw you but I never thought you were worse with women than you are at stealing cars, Toad.
-lt's Thao.
-What?
It's not Toad, it's Thao.
My name is Thao.
Yeah, well, you're blowing it with that girl who was there.
Not that I give two shits about a toad like you.
-You don't know what you're talking about.
-You're wrong.
I know exactly what I'm talking about.
I may not be the most pleasant person to be around but I got the best woman that was ever on this planet to marry me.
I worked at it. lt was the best thing that ever happened to me.
But you, you know, you're letting Click Clack, Ding Dong, and Charlie Chan just walk out with Miss What's-Her-Face.
She likes you, you know?
Though I don't know why.
Who?
Yum Yum.
You know, the girl in the purple sweater.
She's been looking at you all day, stupid.
You mean Youa.
Yeah, Yum Yum, yeah.
Nice girl.
Nice girl.
A very charming girl.
I talked with her.
Yeah.
But you, you let her just walk right out with the Three Stooges.
And you know why?
Because you're a big, fat pussy.
Well I gotta go.
Good day, puss-cake.
No.
No more.
Well, okay, put them over there.
Bye-bye.
No, no.
No, no more.
No more.
Come on.
No more, now.
No more, please. l-- ls this that chicken-dumpling thing you brought the other--?
Oh, all right.
Come on, ladies.
Certainly better than beef jerky, I'll tell you.
What's going on?
Thao is here to make amends.
He's here to work for you.
No, he isn't.
He's not gonna work for me.
My mom said he dishonored the family and now he has to work off his debt.
-He'll start tomorrow morning.
-Not tomorrow, not any time.
I don't even want him on my property.
I thought we went over all that.
It's very important that you accept, and it would be an insult if you refuse.
Why is this being put back on me?
He's the one who tried to steal my car.
All of a sudden, I'm the bad guy in this.
Look, my family is very traditional and would be very much upset if you don't let Thao repay.
If he doesn't wanna do it, then let's just go.
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Yeah.
Shut up.
All right.
Tomorrow, come on.
Tomorrow.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thank you.
Jesus, Joseph, and Mary, these Hmong broads are like badgers.
Son of a bitch, I never thought he'd show.
All right.
What are you good at?
Like what?
Well, that's what I'm asking.
If you're gonna work for me, I gotta know what you're good at.
I gotta know what you can do.
I don't know.
Well, that's kind of halfway what I expected you to say.
You see that tree right there?
You just go over there and count the birds.
You want me to count the birds?
Yeah, you can count.
All you slopes are supposed to be good at math, right?
-Yeah, I can count.
-Good.
One, two....
So, what do you have for me today?
You want me to watch paint dry?
-Maybe even count the clouds that pass by?
-Don't get flip with me, boy.
I'm not the one who tried to steal.
Don't you forget that.
Go ahead. I don't care if you insult me or say racist things.
Because you know what?
I'll take it.
Yeah, course you'll take it, because you have no teeth, you have no balls, kid.
Look, I'm stuck here so why don't you just find something useful for me to do?
Because unlike you, I'm not useless, and I maintain my own property.
You swamp rats, on the other hand, you just can't help but....
How long do I have you for?
-Toad?
How long?
-Till next Friday.
Yeah.
All right.
Go get the ladder out of the garage.
When you get finished with that roof there, you can take that gutter and nail it back up.
I'm tired of looking at it the last three years.
Yeah.
Yeah, you said it, brother.
Hello.
Grandpa says he wants to know if you can have Thao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch.
Wasp nest?
Well, that's terrible.
Yeah, well, I think we can handle that after lunch.
Jesus, Lord Almighty, knock it off.
Hey, it's my last day.
So, what else do you have for me to do?
Take the day off.
You've done enough.
Toad.
Nothing, never mind.
WOMAN:
The doctor will see you now.
Thank you.
Koski?
Mr. Kowalski?
Good morning.
I looked over your paperwork and I think we should immediately start a full battery of tests.
I feel that this would be the best way to go about...
-...checking out the issues that you've had--
-Excuse me.
What happened to Dr. Feldman, my regular doctor?
Dr. Feldman retired three years ago.
I'm his replacement, Dr. Chu.
-lt's Grandpa Walt.
-Pick it up.
-You talk to him.
-Mitch.
-l'm doing bills here.
KAREN:
You talk to him.
He's your father.
Hey, Dad.
WALT:
Hi, Mitch, it's-- lt's me, your dad.
Yeah, I know.
What's up?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing much, really.
-How's everything going?
-l'm fine.
Fine.
Doing fine.
Fine.
Good.
How about Karen and the kids?
Fine, everybody's great.
Doing fine.
-Good.
How about work?
-Busy.
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I suppose.
In fact, speaking of busy, I got a lot on my plate right now so if there's not something pressing....
No.
No, not at all.
So why don't you call me this weekend?
Sure.
Okay. lt was nice talking to you, Dad.
Thanks for calling.
Thanks.
Yeah.
This kid doesn't have a chance.
-What do you know about faucets?
-l know a lot about them, boy.
Stand aside.
-Jesus.
For the love of Pete.
-What?
It must be a hundred degrees in here.
Why don't you turn on the fan?
The place is falling apart.
THAO:
Man, where'd you get all this stuff?
-What are you talking about?
-All the tools and stuff.
Well, it may come as a surprise to a thief but I bought this stuff, everything in here, with my own money.
Yeah, yeah.
That's not what I meant.
I mean, there's just so much shit packed in here.
Yeah.
Well, every tool in here has a purpose.
Everything has a job to do.
They're all to use if necessary.
Okay, so, what's that?
-That's a post-hole digger.
-That?
Vise grips.
-That?
-Wire cutters.
You know it's a trowel, come on.
Those are shears there, and that's a saw.
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me, kid.
All right, what's on your mind?
It's just, I can't afford to buy all this stuff.
Well, I guess even a bonehead like you could understand that a man acquires this over a period of 50 years.
-Yeah, but....
-All right, look, here.
Take these three items, right here.
You can have this.
WD-40, vise grips and some duct tape.
Any man worth his salt can do half of the household chores with just those three things.
Anything else you need, you just borrow it, that's all.
Okay.
Cool.
-Fuck me.
-What's with that?
Nothing.
What?
Nothing, huh?
I just saw you coughed up blood.
That's not good.
You should really see a doctor.
Yeah.
Look those guys who were here the other night, on my lawn.
What about them?
Just a gang, a bunch of Hmong gangbangers.
Yeah, I assumed that, but what were they doing here?
They were gonna take me away.
They were kind of pissed that I blew my first initiation.
Yeah.
Well, you are a pussy, you know, you wanna hang out with guys like that.
What was your initiation supposed to be?
My Gran Torino?
Christ all Friday.
Shit.
Toad, you got a minute?
All right.
Okay.
Here it is.
Here's the deal. I take the top because that's the heaviest.
I pull on that, and you stand right back here and you push and help me push it up each step.
-Just like that.
-Then let me take the top.
No, no, I've got the top.
Really, I'll take the top.
It looks heavy.
Look, I'm not crippled. I've got the top.
If you don't let me take the top, I ain't helping.
-Now, listen to me, zipperhead--
-No, you listen, old man.
I'm here because you needed help.
So it's either top or I'm out of here.
All right.
You take the top, and I'll push.
Just don't let it slip out of your little-girl hands and crush me.
Don't give me any ideas, now.
-That thing weighs a ton.
-Yeah.
It runs like a clock, though.
They just don't make them like this anymore.
So, what are you gonna do with it?
Sell it, I guess.
How much?
60 bucks.
They....
l'm tired of having it sit around down in the basement there.
Why?
You looking for a freezer?
The downstairs one kind of died.
Okay. 25 bucks and it's yours.
Twenty-five?
But you just said 60.
I know, but this'll save me money putting an ad in the paper.
-Come on, let's wheel it over to your place.
-All right.
Okay.
-Kind of ironic, huh?
WALT:
What?
Toad washing the car that he tried to steal from you.
Yeah.
He misses one spot, he's doing it all over again too.
It's nice of you to look after him like this.
He doesn't have any real role models in his life.
Well, I'm not any role model.
But you're a good man, Wally.
I wish our father would've been more like you.
-Don't go calling me Wally.
-No, I'm serious.
He was really hard on us, really traditional, and really old-school.
-Yeah, well, I'm old-school.
-Yeah, but you're an American.
What's that supposed to mean?
You like him, don't you?
Are you kidding?
He tried to steal my car.
Uh-huh.
And you spend time with him teach him how to fix things, saved him from that fucked cousin of ours.
-Hey.
Watch your language, lady.
-And you're a good man.
I'm not a good man.
Get me another beer, dragon lady.
This one's empty.
You know, the Hmong consider gardening to be women's work.
Yeah.
That's probably why I see you in the garden over there all the time.
Besides, we ain't in Humong.
Funny.
You know, you should quit.
That's bad for you.
Yeah?
So is being in a gang, dipshit.
Didn't you hear what I just said?
I saw you cough up blood.
You should quit.
So, what's that emblem supposed to mean anyway?
is it your ancient Cub Scout emblem?
First Cavalry. I've had it since '51 .
So, what do you want to do with your life, kid?
Well, I was thinking about maybe sales.
Sales, huh?
My oldest son is in sales.
-Does he do well?
-Oh, yeah.
License to steal.
I work in the Ford factory for 50 years, and he's out selling Japanese cars.
-You made cars?
-Yeah.
I put the steering column in this Gran Torino in 1 972, right on the line.
Oh, you are old.
So cool.
Yeah.
So you wanna be in sales.
You thinking about going to school maybe?
-Kind of, but school costs money.
-Well, maybe you should get a job.
You can't just sit there and spread mulch in my garden the rest of your life.
-Well, maybe you could just pay me.
-Yeah.
Very funny.
Well, what kind of job could I ever get?
Yeah.
You're right.
Nobody would ever hire you.
Yeah, I know.
Look, I'm just kidding, zip.
I mean, you could get a job.
-You could get a job anywhere.
-Like what?
-Well, how about construction?
-Me?
-Yeah.
-Construction?
-You have Alzheimer's or something?
-No.
You could get a job in construction.
I know people in the trades.
Course, I have to make a little adjustment and man you up a little bit.
-Man me up?
-Yeah.
And I think you ought to date Miss Yum Yum too.
Do you a little good.
You know, get a little carbon off the valves.
Now you're just gonna learn how guys talk.
You just listen to the way Martin and I batter it back and forth.
-You okay?
You ready?
-Sure.
WALT:
All right.
Let's go in.
Perfect.
A Polack and a chink.
How you doing, Martin, you crazy Italian prick?
You cheap bastard, I should've known you'd come in. I was having such a pleasant day.
What'd you do, Jew some poor blind guy out of his money?
-Gave him the wrong change?
-Who's the Nip?
Oh, he's a pussy kid from next door.
I'm just trying to man him up a little bit.
Mm.
You see, kid?
Now, that's how guys talk to one another.
-They do?
-What, you got shit in your ears?
Now go on out and come back in, and talk to him like a man.
Like a real man.
-Come on, Walt.
-Come on.
Get your ass out of here.
And come on back now.
-Sorry about this.
-lt's okay.
What's up, you old Italian prick?
Get out of my shop before I blow your head off...
-...you goddamn dick-smoking gook!
-Jesus Christ.
Oh, shit.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
But that's what you said.
That what you said men say.
You don't just come in and insult the man in his shop.
You don't do that.
What happens if you meet some stranger and get the wrong one?
-He's gonna blow your gook head right off.
-What should I have said, then?
Yeah, kid, why don't you start with "Hi" or "Hello"?
Yeah, just come in and say:
"Sir, I'd like a haircut, if you have time."
Yeah, be polite, but don't kiss ass.
WALT:
You could talk about a construction job you just came from and bitch about your girlfriend and your car.
Son of a bitch, I just got my brakes fixed, and those sons of bitches really nailed me.
-l mean, they screwed me right in the ass.
WALT:
Don't swear at the guy.
Just talk about people who are not in the room.
You could bitch about your boss making you work overtime when it's bowling night.
Right.
Or my old lady bitches for two goddamn hours about how they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store and the minute I turn on the game, she starts crying how we never talk.
You see?
Now go out, come back and talk to him.
And it ain't rocket science, for chrissake.
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car or a girlfriend.
Jesus. I should've blown his head off when I had the chance.
Yeah.
Maybe so.
Now, okay, I want you to turn around and go outside and come back, and don't talk about having no job no car, no girlfriend, no future, no dick.
Okay?
Just turn around and go.
Excuse me, sir. I need a haircut, if you ain't too busy.
You old Italian son-of-a-bitch prick barber.
Boy, does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job.
Fuck me.
Jesus Christ.
-All set to go through with it, right?
-Yeah, yeah.
Don't "Yeah, yeah" me.
Just say, "Yes, sir," and, "l'll do my best."
THAO:
Yes. I'll do my best.
Because when I vouch for somebody, that means I've given my word.
-And I don't want you making me look bad.
-No, I'm good.
Totally into this.
Don't lay down, either.
Just look them straight in the eye.
And a man can tell a lot by your handshake.
-Here.
Put those in your back pocket.
-Cool.
Don't blow this.
Hey, Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon.
How the hell are you?
-l'm shitty, but who's gonna listen?
WALT:
Not me, that's for sure.
Help yourself, there, Walt.
You dumb Polack.
Okay, this is the kid I was telling you about.
Thao, this is Tim Kennedy.
He's the super on this job.
tim:
So, what do we got here, Walt?
Well, he knows construction, and he's a smart kid.
He'll do anything you need him for.
-You sure?
-Yeah.
-You speak English?
-Yes, sir.
-Were you born here?
-You bet.
I see that Walt drove you here.
You got a vehicle?
Not at the moment.
Taking the bus for now.
The bus.
Jesus Christ, you don't have a car?
My head gasket cracked.
And the goddamn prick at the shop wants to bend me over for 2 100.
Oh, please.
I replaced the tranny in my Tahoe, and the sons of bitches fucked me hard.
-Just under 3200.
-Goddamn thieves. lt ain't right.
You got that right.
Okay, come on in on Monday, and we'll find something for you to do.
-Thanks, Mr. Kennedy.
-lt's Tim.
And what's your name again?
-Thao.
-"Tuh," okay.
You owe me one, Walt.
Yeah.
Well, I'll buy you a fruitcake for Christmas.
Fuck the fruitcake.
How about you just hand over them keys to that Gran Torino?
-Why the hell does everybody want my car?
-Well, I'm not surprised.
Yeah, you don't know the half of it.
All right, come on, zipperhead.
We'll let the mick stay here and play with himself.
What are we doing?
What do you wanna do?
Carry your tools in a rice bag?
Here we are.
You can use one of these.
And you'll need one of these.
Here.
THAO:
I can't afford any of this.
WALT:
I'll cover it.
You can pay me back on your first paycheck.
THAO:
Cool.
-Here.
You'll need something like that.
Now, this is what I'm looking for.
Here, tool belt.
-There you go.
-Not to bitch but won't I be needing some tools?
Tools l've got, but I'm not gonna lend my tool belt.
You can pick up tools as you go.
-l really appreciate all this.
-Forget it.
No. I really do.
Thank you.
What's up, homeboy?
What you doing?
MAN 1 :
What up, man?
MAN 2:
What you got, punk?
-Just checking up on my little cousin.
SMOKlE:
Yeah, man.
-Our little cousin.
What's this?
spider:
Where you coming from, man?
I'm coming home from work.
Not that you guys would know much about that.
spider:
So it's true.
You got a job.
THAO:
You can't just leave me alone?
-What?
SMOKlE:
Hey, dog, check this out.
MAN 3:
You scared, huh?
spider:
Who bought this shit for you?
Your dad?
-What do you want?
-Your dad bought this?
THAO:
Keep your hands off my stuff.
spider:
Give me the fucking hat.
-Why the fuck you gotta make me look bad?
THAO:
Keep your hands off my stuff!
Smashing's my job, man.
-Yo, give me that.
THAO:
Hey, come on.
That's my stuff.
MAN 1 :
Throw it over the fence, man, fuck it.
THAO:
Let me go.
Let me go.
MAN 2:
Hey, you little bitch.
Give me that, man.
Give me that.
-What's the phrase I'm looking for?
MAN 3:
Fuck him up.
Oh, yeah.
Saving face.
-Hey there.
-Hey. I gotta run.
Haven't seen you in a few days.
Where you been?
-Been busy.
-Yeah.
Busy, huh?
Hey.
-What the hell happened to you?
-Don't worry about it.
What do you mean, don't worry about it?
Look at your face.
I said, don't worry about it.
Okay?
It's not your problem.
When?
Grabbed me a couple days ago, right after I got off work.
Cowards.
I did everything I could possibly do, but they broke some of your tools.
-l'll replace them.
-Don't worry about the tools.
Where does your cousin live?
No, Walt. I'll be okay.
-l don't want you to do anything.
-All right.
If you need any extra tools, you just let me know.
Well, I could use a roofing hammer.
Good.
Go in my garage and get it.
That should be the last of them.
Hey.
All right.
Here's the deal.
You stay away from Thao, understand?
You tell your friends to stay away from Thao.
If they don't listen, tell them you don't wanna see them anymore.
That's it.
Got it?
I'll take that as a yes.
If I have to come back here it's gonna get fucking ugly.
Get out of my way.
How do you want your dog?
I mean, steak?
THAO:
Funny.
-l told you, we only eat cats.
Yeah.
Well.
Whoa. I've never seen you like this before.
I'm feeling good.
You know, I got beautiful women, great food.
THAO:
And Thao.
-And even Thao isn't bugging me.
-Having a good time, I see.
-Yeah.
THAO:
And it never ends.
-What happened to your knuckles anyways?
I slipped in the shower.
No big problem.
Look, now, Yum Yum, if he doesn't ask you out I'm gonna ask you out.
Youa, don't listen to him, Youa.
He's a white devil.
Yeah, I am. I'm the white devil.
I'd love to, Walt, but he beat you to it.
Really?
No kidding.
Dinner and a movie or what?
Yeah.
They're taking the bus.
No, you can't take the bus.
We gotta get you something more stylish than that.
Like what?
Take a limo?
How about that?
-The Gran Torino?
-Yeah.
-You'd let me take the Gran Torino?
-Yeah, I'd let you take the Gran Torino.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Yeah.
Yeah.
MAN:
Here's the pitch.
And a strike.
WALT:
is everybody all right?
You're all right.
You're okay.
You've got a cut.
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
Where's grandma?
Where is Sue?
Where is Sue?
-She went to our aunt's.
-Your aunt's?
You sure?
-Yeah.
-Get on the phone and call right now.
I knew this was gonna happen.
Tried to-
- What the hell am I doing here?
Well, maybe some of her friends called and they changed plans.
Yeah.
In the war, we just lost a lot of friends, but you're kind of set for it.
You're geared to it.
No, no, no.
You fuck!
You rotten fuck!
Mr. Kowalski?
-You okay?
-Yeah. I'm okay.
The police finally left.
No one's talking.
One thing about the Hmong, they keep their mouths shut.
Yeah, I've noticed that.
You know, Thao and Sue are never gonna find peace in this world as long as that gang's around.
Until they go away, you know, forever.
What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.
I took Sue to the hospital.
She's scared.
They're all scared.
Yeah.
Thao, especially.
He's sitting out there right now, staring at your front door.
You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.
What would you do?
-What should Thao do?
-l know what I would do if I was you.
-Or at least what you think you should do.
-Really?
If I was Thao, I guess I'd want vengeance.
I'd wanna stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys.
And you?
What would I do?
I'd come over here and talk to you, I guess.
I know you're close with these people, but this pisses me off too, Mr. Kowalski.
Want a beer?
I'd love one.
There's some in the chest right over there behind you.
Damn all this.
-Just isn't fair.
-Nothing's fair, Father.
So, what are you gonna do, Mr. Kowalski?
Call me Walt.
All right.
What are you gonna do, Walt?
I don't know but I'll think of something.
Whatever it is, they won't have a chance.
What are you doing?
-Thinking.
-Thinking?
Thinking time is over.
Now it's time to knock the shit out of those pricks.
I know you don't wanna hear this, but now's the time to stay calm.
Calm?
You want me to be calm?
We stay calm or else mistakes get made.
We have to step back from this thing.
No.
Don't let me down, Walt.
Not you.
This is gonna end today.
Sit down.
-l don't wanna sit.
-l said, sit down.
Now, listen to me.
We gotta plan this, and plan it very carefully.
We can't make any mistakes.
Now, you know I'm the right man for this job.
So I want you to go home and stay calm and come back here at 4 this afternoon.
-And what needs to be done will be done.
-l say we go now.
Right now.
And what?
Kill that cousin of yours and the rest of those zips?
Mr. Tough Guy out for blood all of a sudden?
You know nothing about it.
Now go home and you stay calm.
Come back here at 4.
All right?
Okay?
Okay.
Yeah. I know, I know.
Give me a break, will you?
It's the first time I've ever smoked in the house.
Let a man enjoy himself, would you, girl?
All finished.
Ten dollars American.
I don't suppose your Guinea hands are steady enough to do a straight shave?
Straight shave?
You've never asked for a straight shave.
I know, but I've always wondered about it.
That's unless you're too busy.
-No, just let me heat up a towel.
-Yeah.
And here, here's a 20.
Keep the change.
That's just in case you hit my jugular.
It's gonna take about one hour.
We gonna shorten the sleeves a little bit.
Gonna fix the shoulder.
-Yeah. I never had a fitted suit before.
-Yes, sir.
-Mm-hm.
-You look very good.
-What can I do for you, Mr. Kowalski?
-l'm here for a confession.
Oh, Lord Jesus.
What have you done?
-Nothing.
You just take it easy, now.
-What are you up to?
Are you gonna give me a confession or not?
How long has it been since your last confession?
WALT:
Oh, forever.
Bless me, Father, for l have sinned.
What are your sins, my son?
Well, in 1 968, I kissed Betty Jablonski at the factory Christmas party.
Dorothy was in the other room with the other wives.
It just happened.
Yes, go on.
Well, I made a 900-dollar profit selling a boat and a motor.
I didn't pay the taxes.
It's the same as stealing.
Yes, fine.
Oh, lastly I was never very close with my two sons.
I don't know them. I didn't know how.
That's it?
That's it?
It's bothered me most of my life.
Say 10 "Hail Marys" and five "Our Fathers."
God loves you and forgives you, and I absolve you of all your sins.
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Thank you, Padre.
Are you going to retaliate for what happened to Sue?
I'm going over to that house today, Mr. Kowalski.
WALT:
is that so?
It is.
And every other day until you see the folly in what you're planning.
-Busy day.
Gotta go.
-Go in peace.
Oh, I am at peace.
Jesus Christ.
So which one's mine?
You ever fired a weapon before?
No.
Well, why don't you put that one down?
And I got something I wanna show you.
Come on.
THAO:
What?
1 952, we were sent up to take out a chink machine-gun nest.
Been shredding us up pretty good.
I was the only one that came back that day.
For that, they gave me a Silver Star.
Here it is.
Here. I want you to have it.
Why?
Why?
Because we all knew the dangers that night, but we went anyway.
That's the way it might be tonight.
There's always a chance you don't come back.
The hell we won't.
We're gonna roll up in there and tear some ass.
That's foolish.
That's the exact reaction they're waiting for.
Go ahead and close this up.
-How many?
-How many what?
How many men did you kill in Korea?
-Thirteen.
Maybe more.
-What was it like to kill a man?
You don't wanna know.
Now close it up.
Walt.
Walt.
What are you doing?
-What are you doing?
-Relax.
You can't get out of there.
You let me out right now.
Let me out.
-Fucking let me out or I'll fucking kill you.
-Shut the fuck up.
You wanna know what it's like to kill a man?
Well, it's goddamn awful, that's what it is.
The only thing worse is getting a medal for killing some poor kid that wanted to just give up, that's all.
Yeah, some scared little gook just like you.
I shot him in the face with that rifle you were holding in there a while ago.
Not a day goes by that I don't think about it, and you don't want that on your soul.
Now, I got blood on my hands.
I'm soiled.
That's why I'm going it alone tonight.
Walt.
You take me with you right now.
Let me out!
Look, you've come a long way.
I'm proud to say that you're my friend but you got your whole life ahead of you.
But me, I finish things.
That's what I do.
And I'm going it alone.
No.
Wait!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
Look, I need you to watch my dog.
Yeah, I love you too.
Yeah, she's old too.
Bye-bye, sweetheart.
Take it easy.
Her name is Daisy.
-Hello?
W ALT:
It's Walt.
The keys to my house are under the ceramic turtle on the porch.
Let yourself in.
Your brother's in the basement. I gotta go.
Sorry, Father, we have to go.
I'm telling you, if we're not here, there will be bloodshed.
We've been here for hours.
We can't afford to anchor a unit to one location.
I'm begging you to stay.
Just got word from my sergeant.
We're pulling the plug.
-l'm staying.
-No, you aren't.
We have specific orders.
You came with us, you're leaving with us.
Watch your head.
THAO:
Sue.
Over here.
Over here.
-Come unlock this.
SUE:
What's going on?
He left without me.
He went to Smokie's without me.
SUE:
Thao!
MAN 1 :
What the fuck, man?
Any swamp rats in there?
-l didn't think your ass would've came.
-Shut up, gook.
I got nothing to say to you, shrimp-dick midget like you.
Yeah, yeah.
You go ahead, watch out for your boyfriend.
Because it was either he or you or someone who raped one of their own family.
Your own blood, for chrissake.
Now, go ahead and pull those pistols like miniature cowboys.
-Go ahead.
-So where's Thao at?
-That pussy motherfucker couldn't come?
-Don't worry about Thao.
Thao's got not one second for you.
SMOKlE:
Says who?
You?
What the fuck you gonna do, old man?
MAN 1 :
What you gonna do...
-...punk ass old man?
MAN 2:
Bitch.
-Kind of jumpy, aren't we?
-Shut the fuck up.
You shut the fuck up.
-Got a light?
spider:
What the fuck?
No.
Me. I've got a light.
Hail Mary, full of grace.
-Yes, Sergeant.
THAO:
What happened?
-You need to step back.
-He's a friend of mine.
I said, step back.
Hey, did you hear him?
Step back.
-What happened?
-Hey, step back.
He's my friend.
Please, it's important.
He went for his lighter and they shot him.
He didn't even have a gun on him.
This time we have witnesses.
These guys will be locked up for a long time.
Officer Chang!
Get those people back.
You have to step back now, okay?
Get them the fuck out of here.
Get them out of here.
Walt Kowalski once said to me that I didn't know anything about life or death because I was an over-educated, 27-year-old virgin who held the hands of superstitious old women and promised them eternity.
Walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it but he was right.
I knew really nothing about life or death until I got to know Walt.
And, boy, did I learn.
"And I wanna leave my house to the church because Dorothy would've liked it."
Now, which brings us to our last item, and again please excuse the language in Mr. Kowalski's will.
I'm simply reading it the way it was written.
"And I'd like to leave my 1 972 Gran Torino to my friend Thao Vang Lor on the condition that you don't chop-top the roof like one of those beaners don't paint any idiotic flames on it like some white-trash hillbilly and don't put a big, gay spoiler on the rear end like you see on all the other zipperheads' cars.
It just looks like hell.
If you can refrain from doing any of that, it's yours."
I'm real sorry about Dorothy, Walt.
She was a real peach.
Thanks for coming, Al.
Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
Father.
Spirit.
Holy Spirit.
It's okay, I can move down.
Spectacles, testicles, wallet, and watch.
Look at the way the old man glared at Ashley.
Can't even tone it down for Mom's funeral.
What do you expect?
Dad's still living in the '50s.
He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly.
Well, your kid's wearing a Lions jersey.
I'm sure Dad appreciates that.
The point is that there's nothing anyone can do that won't disappoint the old man.
It's inevitable.
You know, that's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings.
You know, that deal with the boat motor, the broken birdbath.
It's always something.
What are we gonna do with him?
Don't you think he's gonna get in trouble, all by himself in the old neighborhood?
Well, why don't you have him move in with you?
Ha, ha, ha.
Hey.
Shh.
Death is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics.
Bitter in the pain, sweet in the salvation.
Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased and their families.
Sweet to those of us who know the salvation that awaits.
And some may ask, "What is death?
Is it the end?
Or is it the beginning?
And what is life?
What is this thing we call life?"
- All these questions can frustrate you.
Ashley, stop it.
That's why you have to turn to the Lord.
Jesus.
Because the Lord is the sweetness...
This is so good.
Did you have a chance to call Martha?
Is that Dad?
No.
That's Grandpa Walt.
"Third platoon, E company, March 2nd, 1952, Korea"?
Where's Korea?
A lot of people showed up after the service.
Well, I suppose they heard there's gonna be a lot of ham.
I'll go down in the basement and get some chairs.
- Oh, I can do that, Dad.
- No, I need them now, not next week.
Cool, I found a medal.
Look at this.
How much longer do we have to stay?
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell, and I'm bored.
Ashley, why don't you go help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?
- Me?
- Yes, you.
Go.
Go help him.
Grandpa Walt, would you like some help with this?
With your chairs?
No.
You probably just painted your nails.
Honey, come here.
Okay, well, your dad is driving me crazy.
- Why did you make me do that?
It's okay.
We're leaving soon.
Hey, girl.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come with me.
How many swamp rats can you get in one room?
Wow.
Grandpa, when did you get the vintage car?
1972.
I never knew you had a cool old car.
Yeah.
Well, it's been here since before you were born.
So what are you gonna do with it when you, like, die?
What about that super-cool retro couch you have in the den?
Because I'm going to state next year and it would look really good in my room, and I don't have any furniture at all.
Oh, God.
- Who are you?
What do you want?
- Hi.
- I live...
- Get the shit out of your mouth.
- Tell me what you want.
- Do you have jumper cables?
- My uncle's car is old and...
- We don't have any cables.
And have some respect, zipperhead.
We're in mourning here.
- How you holding up, Walt?
- Mr. Kowalski.
Huh?
Mr. Kowalski, that's my name.
Right.
Mr. Kowalski.
Your wife and I became quite close these last few months.
She asked that I watch over you when she passed on.
I told her I watch over my flock.
But she made me promise I'd keep an extra-sharp eye on you.
Look, I appreciate the kindness you've shown to my wife.
Now that you've spoken your piece why don't you go tend to some of your other sheep?
Okay?
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her desire for you to go to confession.
She said she couldn't remember the last time you went.
- Is that so?
- It is.
Well, I confess that I never really cared for church very much.
The only reason I went was because of her.
And I confess that I have no desire to confess to a boy that's just out of the seminary.
Great to see you.
- Bye, dear.
- So long, Walt.
Walt, can you get it started?
Yeah, it'll be fine.
I wish I could help, Dad, but I gotta get the kids home.
- Kids are getting restless.
- Yeah, fine.
Just go.
I'll call you, see how you're doing.
All right.
Kill you to buy American?
Jesus.
Did you see the way he looked at the truck?
It's always rice-burner this, Jap-burner that, you know?
- Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go.
- He didn't say anything.
- He didn't need to.
- What do you expect?
The man worked at Ford all those years.
- I suppose that's my goddamn fault.
- Just give it a rest, just drive, okay?
Kids, want the radio on?
Anyone wanna listen to some music?
Good.
Damn barbarians.
I'm just so brokenhearted.
I want my daughter to find another husband.
If she married again there would be a man in the house.
What about Thao?
The man of the house is right there.
grandma:
Look at him washing dishes.
He does whatever his sister orders him to do.
How could he ever become the man of the house?
Be patient, once he's older, he will be the man of the house.
No way.
Today is a blessed day, for a child is born.
I offer food to nurture this child's body.
I offer clothing to protect this child's flesh.
The child is blessed with a mother and father.
Oh, spirit of this child return home and do not wander anymore.
Come home, spirit and soul, come home.
Live a good life and grow old.
Jesus.
Polarski would roll over in his grave if he could see his lawn now.
What the hell did Chinks have to move into this neighborhood for?
Why does that old white man stay here?
All the Americans have moved out of this neighborhood.
Why haven't you gone?
Why don't you strut away, you dumb rooster?
Are you gone completely deaf or something?
Hi there, Walt.
I'm not a friend of yours, so why do you insist on calling me Walt?
Sorry.
Mr. Kowalski.
- What are you peddling today, Padre?
- Nothing.
I thought I'd drop by and see you.
I haven't seen you in church.
Now that you've done your good deed, why don't you take off down the road?
- I'd really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.
- Not in this lifetime, sonny.
Why?
Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
- You don't wanna know.
- No, I do.
Well, I think you're an over-educated 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold hands of ladies who are superstitious and promises them eternity.
Yo!
Hey!
Is you...?
Is you a boy or is you a girl, man?
I can't tell.
Hey, chinito, hey, if you was in the pen I'd be fucking you in the ass.
You'd be my bitch.
What are you reading, Jackass and the Rice Stalk?
Yeah, that's right, keep walking!
Keep walking!
Look at me when I talk to you, homes!
Fucking slopes, man, everywhere you look, man.
Slopes everywhere we go, man.
Go back to your rice paddy.
What you looking at, man?
- That's my little cousin over there.
- You sure that's your cousin, man?
- Fuck, yeah, that's my little cousin.
- He tight with anybody?
No, he flies solo, man.
You wanna do something?
Man, let's go down there and see what the fuck they doing over there.
I like your sandals too.
- Hey.
Yo, what's up?
What's up?
- Yo, what's up, motherfuckers?
They fucking with you?
Man, fuck you, homeboy!
- What you got?
Hey, we can do this right now.
- You go fucking back to your country.
- Fuck you, man.
Oh, good, more fucking rice niggers.
Aren't you supposed to cook me some Chinese food, huh?
- How many bullets you got?
- We'll catch you on the rebound, homey.
Thao!
Come on, man.
Get in the car, man.
Thao.
- Get with us, man.
- Get in the car.
Fuck, man, get in the car, man.
Thao!
Those punk-ass Mexicans messing with you?
Dog, we just bailed your ass out, dog.
Come on, dog, get the fuck in here.
What you doing, man?
Get in the car, man, come on.
Chill with us, man.
Come on, man.
We just bailed your ass out, dog!
Come on.
Come on, Thao, man.
You need a big coz to take care of you, man.
Man, fuck it.
Hey.
Forget it, man.
Let's go, dude.
Fuck his ass.
- Tomorrow, I'll see your ass.
Why you gotta be a little girl?
Tomorrow.
Come on, man, let's go.
We got the gun, man.
Fuck you.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
- We've got the strap.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
- Fuck that pussy.
Pussy.
Hey, Thao.
Hey, what's up?
What's up, Thao?
What are you doing, little man?
- Why you doing women's work?
- What do you want?
What?
I can't just come and talk to my little cousin?
- He doesn't wanna talk to you.
- Well, I'm here, right?
Hey, Spider, who that?
What's up?
Spider?
Is that what he just called you, Fong?
Spider.
- Is there something wrong with Spider?
- What are you doing here?
Hey, so how old is you anyways?
- Mentally, I'm way too old for you.
- What?
You guys are stupid.
I'm going inside.
- What?
- Sue.
Help your little bro do this gardening.
Bite it, stupid.
Hey.
You wanna roll with us, man?
Come on.
- Dude.
- Come on, ride with us.
Come on.
Come on, chill with us.
You need somebody to protect you.
That's what your big coz is for.
Look, dog, I been there, done it, and I seen it, man.
Back in the day, everybody used to wanna beat me up.
But now, nobody wanna fuck with me.
- Come on, man, let's go.
- We're coz, right?
Come on.
- We're coz, right?
We're family.
Look, a brother to Spider is a brother to me.
Come on.
Dude, man, take this shit off.
Come on.
Come on, roll with us.
Come on.
That's woman's work, man.
Don't get your hands dirty, man.
So, what do I have to do?
Spider told me that our boy next door got a bad-ass whip.
Come on.
Nice.
Yeah, my little cousin being a little man.
Whoa.
Yo, now, that's a nice car.
Hell, yeah. 1972 Gran Torino, fastback.
- Yo.
- Cobra jet engine.
Yo, man, it's still in mint condition.
Yo, man.
It's in mint condition, man.
Oh, I've got one.
There's a Mexican, a Jew, and a colored guy go into a bar.
The bartender looks up and says, "Get the fuck out of here. "
So here's where my flock congregates when they're not in church.
Hey, Father J.
Hi, Mel.
Hey there, Darrell.
- Hello, Father.
- Hi, Walt.
What brings you in here, Father?
The meat raffle?
No, I just came down to talk to Walt, if that's okay.
Damn, Padre, you are persistent, aren't you?
I promised your wife.
All right.
Let's get a booth.
I'll have a Pabst and a shot of Jack and whatever he's having.
- I'll have a Diet Coke.
- Bullshit, this is a bar.
You have a drink.
- Um, I'll have a gin and tonic.
Attaboy.
So what do you want?
I promised your wife I'd get you to go to confession.
Now, why would you do that?
She was very insistent.
She made me.
You're kind of fond of promising things you can't deliver on.
Right, Father?
- Let's talk about something else.
- What?
Life and death.
Life and death.
What the hell do you know about life and death?
I'd like to think I know a lot.
I'm a priest.
Yeah.
You get up and preach about life and death but all you know is what you learned in priest school.
Right out of the rookie preacher's handbook.
I don't know about that.
I think...
Death is bittersweet.
Sort of bitter in its pain, but sweet in its salvation.
That's what you know about life and death, and it's pathetic.
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?
I know a lot.
I lived for almost three years in Korea with it.
Thanks.
We shot men stabbed them with bayonets, hacked 17-year-olds to death with shovels.
Stuff I'll remember till the day I die.
Horrible things, but things I'll live with.
And what about life?
Well, I survived the war.
Got married, had a family.
Sounds like you know a lot more about death than you do living.
Maybe so, Father.
Maybe so.
Son of a bitch.
Come on, get in the car!
Thao, what the fuck?
Get in!
- Get in, Thao.
- Come on, let's go.
Get in.
Fuck, man?
Get in!
- Hello?
- Hey.
Morning, Dad.
It's your number one son, Mitch.
Morning?
It's after 1 in the afternoon, it's not morning.
Oh, right.
Afternoon, then.
So, what do you want?
What?
No.
Nothing.
I mean, what would I want?
Well, I don't know.
Your wife's already gone through all your mother's jewelry.
No, Dad, I'm just calling to see how you're doing.
Just...
Anything new with the old neighborhood?
Yeah.
No.
Great.
Smooth sailing.
Yeah.
- Okay, good.
Good, then.
Oh, hey, Dad.
- Yeah.
You wouldn't happen to still know that guy that has the Lions season tickets?
Oh, you fuck.
Dad...
Ain't she sweet.
Come on, girl.
Yo, what's up?
What are you guys doing out here, man?
Nothing.
Minding our own business.
Just hanging out.
What are you guys doing here?
- What?
I told you guys already...
Can't I just come hang out with my little cousin?
Huh?
We have good news for you, man.
Oh, really?
And what's that?
Only for guy talk.
- I don't think so.
- Why not?
Come on, man.
We gonna give you another shot, man.
- Don't go, Thao.
Mind your own business, girl.
- Come on, let's go.
Come.
- Yeah, what are you gonna do, huh?
Come on, dog.
Look.
You've broken Daddy's gnome.
What the hell is this?
Get up.
- Get off my lawn.
Listen, old man, you don't wanna fuck with me.
Did you hear me?
I said, get off my lawn now.
Are you fucking crazy?
Go back in the house.
Yeah.
I blow a hole in your face, and then I go in the house.
And I sleep like a baby.
You can count on that.
We used to stack fucks like you five feet high in Korea use you for sandbags.
Okay.
- But you better watch your back.
- Fuck it, man, he's crazy.
We'll get this cracker next time.
Thank you.
Get off my lawn.
What the hell is this?
Christ.
No, no.
No, no, no.
Come on, no more.
No more.
No more.
What...?
Stay right there.
Stay right there.
Why can't you just leave me alone?
We brought you some shallots to plant.
- I don't want them.
- They're perennials.
- They come back every year.
- Why are you bringing me all this garbage?
Because...
- Because you saved Thao.
- I didn't save anybody.
I just...
I kept a bunch of jabbering gooks off of my lawn, that's all.
- You're a hero to the neighborhood.
- I'm not a hero.
They think you are.
That's why they keep bringing you gifts.
- Please, take them.
- They're wrong.
Now, I just want to be left alone.
Thank you.
Wait.
This is my mom, Vu, I'm Sue, and that's my brother, Thao.
- We live next door.
- So?
Thao wants to say something.
I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?
- For trying to steal your car.
Let me tell you something, boy.
You step on this property again, you're done.
Good afternoon, Walt.
I told you I'm not going to confession.
- Why didn't you just call the police?
- What?
I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I heard there was trouble in the neighborhood.
Why didn't you call the police?
Well...
You know, I prayed that they would show up but nobody answered.
What were you thinking?
Someone could have been killed.
We're talking life and death here.
When things go wrong, you gotta act quickly.
When we were in Korea and a thousand screaming gooks came across our line we didn't call the police, we reacted.
We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski.
I've been thinking about our conversation on life and death.
About what you said.
About how you carry around all the horrible things you were forced to do horrible things that won't leave you.
It seems it would do you good to unload some of that burden.
Things done during war are terrible.
Being ordered to kill.
Killing to save yourself, killing to save others.
You're right.
Those are things I know nothing about but I do know about forgiveness and I've seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins admitted their guilt, and left their burdens behind them.
Stronger men than you.
Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things and are now at peace.
Well, I gotta hand it to you, Padre.
You came here with your guns loaded this time.
Thank you.
And you're right about one thing.
About stronger men than me reaching their salvation.
Well, halle-fucking-lujah.
But you're wrong about something else.
What's that, Mr. Kowalski?
The thing that haunts a man the most is what he isn't ordered to do.
There.
You finally look like a human being again.
You shouldn't wait so long between haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch.
Yeah.
Well, I'm surprised you're still around.
I was always hoping you'd die and they'd get somebody who knew what they were doing.
Instead you just keep hanging around like the doo-wop dago you are.
- That'll be 10 bucks, Walt.
- Ten bucks?
Jesus Christ, Martin.
What are you, half Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices.
It's been 10 bucks for the last five years, you hard-nosed, Polack son of a bitch.
- Yeah, well, keep the change.
- See you in three weeks, prick.
Not if I see you first, dipshit.
Since everything could go downhill after that.
- Yeah, that's true.
- That would suck.
- That's cool, you know?
Yeah.
Ain't shit going on, man.
Ain't shit going on.
Man, look at this.
Look at this, Monk.
Check this out.
Oooh.
Boy.
Oh, yeah.
Bring that little tight ass over here.
Come here, girl.
Don't be shy.
What, you can't say hi?
Why you acting all stuck-up and shit?
- What you supposed to be, man?
- Yo, it's cool, dog.
What the fuck you doing in my neighborhood, boy?
Nothing.
Just going down to Corner Spot, you know?
Get some CDs.
It's all good, bro.
See, he called you bro, Duke.
- He called you bro, man.
- It's all good, bro.
It's all good, huh?
Shut the fuck up.
Call me bro again, man, I'll bite your motherfucking face off.
Yeah, motherfucker.
Now, what the fuck y'all come down here for?
You here to bring me this little present?
Monk?
She bringing it to us?
This little Oriental yummy.
Don't worry.
I'm gonna take real good care of her.
- Fuck out of here, man.
- Fuck out of here, man.
- I told you we're finished here.
Oh, yeah.
Keep your ass right here.
Oh, great.
Another asshole who has a fetish for Asian girls?
God, that gets so old.
Oh, shit.
- What's your name, girl?
My name?
Get your ass out of here, okay?
It's "Take your crude come-on to every woman who walks past and cram it. " That's my name.
Mouthy little bitch.
- Who you think you talking to?
- Who does it look like?
- You think you real funny, don't you?
- Oh, shit.
Ain't she tough?
What?
You gonna hit me now?
That would pretty much complete the picture.
You need to keep your bitch on a leash.
Put a chain on that whore and yank that motherfucker.
Of course.
Right to the stereotype thesaurus.
Call me a whore and a bitch in the same sentence.
- This bitch is crazy.
I like them like that.
Man, take this bitch.
Hey.
Get off me.
- You don't know when to quit, do you?
I'm gonna teach her a lesson.
Stop.
Let go.
Get your ass over there.
What the fuck you looking at, old man?
- What the hell are you spooks up to?
- Spooks?
You better get your ass on, honky, while I still let you.
- That's what you better do.
- That's right, bitch.
Fuck you think you at?
Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while that you shouldn't have fucked with?
That's me.
Man, you fucking crazy, man.
Get out of here, man.
Why don't you get your ass up out of here before I kick your old, wrinkly, white ass?
Crazy motherfucker, man.
What's wrong with him, man?
What the fuck?
- This motherfucker crazy, man.
- What's wrong with this nigga, man?
What the hell?
Get in the truck.
This crazy motherfucker, man.
What's wrong with him, man?
He put his finger at us.
- Oh, shit.
- Come on, now.
Hey, pops.
Come on, now.
Shut your fucking face.
You fucking don't listen, do you?
Now, get in the truck.
- Go on, get in the truck now.
Shit.
Way to go, old man.
Shut up, pussy.
What is all this "bro" shit, anyway?
Want to be Super Spade or something?
These guys don't want to be your bro and I don't blame them.
Now, get your ofay, Paddy ass on down the road.
Take care, now.
Yeah, you too.
Oh, yeah.
Fuck, man, why y'all didn't fucking do nothing?
- Man, kick that nigga's ass.
- Man, you fucking...
Shit, man.
This fucker.
He had that cannon in your fucking face.
- You didn't do nothing.
- Trying to stay out.
What's the matter with you, for chrissake?
Trying to get yourself killed?
I thought you Asian girls were supposed to be smart.
Hanging around a neighborhood like that's a fast way to get you in the obituaries.
I know.
I know.
Take it easy.
And what about that goofball guy you were with?
Is that a date or something?
Yeah.
Kind of.
His name is Trey.
Well, you shouldn't be hanging out with him.
You should be hanging out with your own people, with other Humongs.
You mean Hmong?
We're Hmong, not "Humong. "
Whatever.
Where the hell is Humong, I mean Hmong, anyway?
Wow.
You're so enlightened, you know that?
No, Hmong isn't a place.
It's a people.
Hmong people come from different parts of Laos, Thailand, and China.
Yeah.
Well, how did you end up in my neighborhood, then?
Why didn't you stay there?
It's a Vietnam thing.
We fought on your side.
And when the Americans quit, the Communists started killing all the Hmong.
So we came over here.
Yeah.
Well, I don't know how you ended up in the Midwest.
There's snow on the ground six months out of the year.
Why does a jungle people want to be in the great frozen tundra?
Hill people.
We were hill people.
Not jungle people.
Booga-booga-booga.
Yeah.
Whatever.
Blame the Lutherans.
They brought us over here.
Everybody blames the Lutherans.
Well, you'd think the cold would keep all the idiots out.
Thanks for the ride.
You know something, kid?
You're all right.
But what about that dimwit brother of yours?
- He a little slow or something?
- Thao is actually really smart.
He just doesn't know which direction to go in.
- Yeah.
Poor Toad.
- It's really common.
Hmong girls over here fit in better.
The girls go to college, and the boys go to jail.
Yeah.
That old hag hates my ass.
Well...
"Your birthday today. " Daisy.
"This year, you have to make a choice between two life paths.
Second chances come your way.
Extraordinary events culminate in what might seem to be an anticlimax.
Your lucky numbers are 84, 23 11, 78, and 99."
What a load of shit.
Yeah.
What the hell is it with kids nowadays?
All right.
Hey, Mrs. V. Here, let me help you with those.
Oh, thank you.
I just...
I got it.
How about that?
Here you go.
- How about that, Daisy?
Yeah, I got it.
That was too heavy for the bag.
No problem.
- Thank you.
- Go ahead, Karen, give it to him.
- Here you go.
- Well, what is it?
- It's a Gopher.
So you can reach stuff.
You know, it makes things a lot easier.
This is from me.
It's a phone.
- Oh, I can see that.
- I just thought...
Well, we thought that it would make things easier.
Well, thank you, Karen.
There's nothing wrong with making things less hard on yourself.
Karen's right, Dad.
You've worked hard your whole life.
Maybe it's time you started thinking about, you know, taking it easier.
Jeez.
That's another thing, Dad.
You really should get rid of the coffin nails.
But, I don't know, we were thinking about the house.
You know, what with Mom gone, it's gotta be a lot to maintain around here.
- Mm-hm.
- Let alone clean.
And, I don't know, you're here all alone.
Yeah, and there are these great places now, you know, these communities where you don't have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow where the people are like you, active and alert, but are alone and would benefit from being around folks their own age.
Yeah, Dad, look.
You gotta check it out.
We've brought some brochures.
These places are nothing like what you'd think they'd be.
- They're great.
- No, no, beautiful.
They're really nice.
They really are.
These are top-notch, like, resorts.
- It's like staying in a hotel practically.
- They're beautiful.
They really are.
- Yeah.
They take care of everything.
They'll clean up.
They're really nice.
They have wonderful stores.
You can buy new shoes.
They're amazing.
They really are.
You'd have a good time.
- Play some golf, maybe.
Meet other people.
Son of a bitch.
Kicking us out on his birthday.
- I told you this was a bad idea.
- I know.
You were right.
- He won't let anybody help him.
- Well, we tried.
Can we just drop it?
No one can say we didn't try.
The hell with him.
You know what we should've done?
We should've stayed home with Josh and Ashley.
At least they were smart enough to not come.
Goddamn kids have more sense than we do.
We miss Mama, don't we, Daisy?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, Walt.
What are you up to?
We're having a barbecue.
You wanna come over?
- What do you think?
- There's tons of food.
Yeah.
Just keep your hands off my dog.
- No worries.
We only eat cats.
- Really?
No, I'm kidding, you moron.
Come on, you can be my special guest.
No, I'm fine right here.
Yeah.
- Son of a bitch.
- Okay, so, what have you had to eat today?
Oh, I had a piece of cake and a little beef jerky.
Come on over and get something to eat.
We've got beer too.
Well, I might as well drink with strangers rather than drink alone.
After all, it is my birthday.
- Really?
Happy birthday, Wally.
- Don't call me Wally.
Well, no Pabst, but plenty of beer.
- As they say, when in Humong.
- Ha, ha.
Hey, what am I doing wrong?
Every time I look at somebody, they look at the ground.
You're fine.
What's she saying?
- She said welcome to her home.
- Oh, no, she's not.
- Yeah, no, she didn't.
- She hates me.
Come on.
- Yeah, she hates you.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey, what are all you fish heads looking at anyway?
I think we should go into the other room.
Sorry.
A lot of people in this house are very traditional.
Number one, never touch a Hmong person on their head, not even a child.
Hmong people believe that the soul resides on the head, so don't do that.
Well, sounds dumb, but fine.
Yeah, and a lot of Hmong people consider looking someone in the eye to be very rude.
That's why they look away when you look at them.
- Anything else?
- Yeah.
Some Hmong people tend to smile or grin when they're yelled at.
It's a cultural thing.
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity.
It's not that they're laughing at you or anything.
Yeah.
God, you people are nuts.
But the food does look good.
Smells good too.
Well, of course.
It's Hmong food.
Yeah.
Okay.
Can I come back for seconds?
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
You know, you mentioned about looking at people.
- He's been staring at me the whole evening.
- That's Kor Khue.
He's the Lor family shaman.
And what's that, some sort of a witch doctor or something?
- Something like that.
- Yeah.
Booga-booga.
Ha, ha.
Very funny, Wally.
Kor Khue's interested in you.
He heard what you did.
He would like to read you.
It'd be rude not to allow him this.
It's a great honor.
- Yeah, sure, fine by me.
Sure.
- All right.
Take a seat.
Here?
He says that people do not respect you.
They don't even wanna look at you.
He says the way you live, your food has no flavor.
You're worried about your life.
You made a mistake in your past life, like a mistake that you did you're not satisfied with.
He says you have no happiness in your life.
It's like you're not at peace.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm...
Yeah, I'm fine.
Fine.
I'm fine.
God, I've got more in common with these gooks than I do my own spoilt rotten family.
Jesus Christ.
Happy birthday.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
You were bleeding.
No, I bit my tongue.
It's nothing.
Why don't we go and get some of that good gook food?
- You know, I'm starving.
- Okay.
Fantastic.
Well, you ladies are wonderful.
This stuff is really good.
Come on, you glutton.
- What's up?
- Let's go.
- What for?
To mingle.
Mingle?
We're mingling right here.
Come on.
You told me not to leave you alone.
Thank you very much, but I have to go now.
I have to go now.
I'll be back.
Now, don't let anything go away.
Oh, great.
Well, well, well.
Look who's over there.
- Yeah, the kid who stole my Gran Torino.
- My brother, Thao.
Tried to, anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah, Toad.
It was a little wobbly, but that should fix it.
So where are you guys from?
- I'm not far from here.
- I'm from Texas.
- What's this?
- A little rice liquor.
Here, try it.
All right.
My friends and I were just wondering what you're doing here.
Well, that's a good question.
What am I doing here?
- Name's Walt.
- Hi, Walt.
I'm Youa.
- Yuam.
A pleasure.
- No.
Youa.
Youa, okay.
So, what do you do?
- Oh, I fix things, stuff like that.
- Like what?
Well, I just fixed that dryer there, I fixed my wife's friend's sink and I took old Aunt Mary to the doctor's to get her prescription fixed up.
And then I even fixed a door that hadn't even broken yet.
You're funny.
I've been called a lot of things, but never funny.
- Well, I'm gonna take off.
Enjoy yourself.
- Okay.
Yum Yum.
Pleasure.
Look, she's going, man.
Come on.
Youa, wait up.
Relax, zipperhead.
I'm not gonna shoot you.
I'd look down too, if I was you.
I knew you were a dipshit the first time I ever saw you but I never thought you were worse with women than you are at stealing cars, Toad.
- It's Thao.
- What?
It's not Toad, it's Thao.
My name is Thao.
Yeah, well, you're blowing it with that girl who was there.
Not that I give two shits about a toad like you.
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- You're wrong.
I know exactly what I'm talking about.
I may not be the most pleasant person to be around but I got the best woman that was ever on this planet to marry me.
I worked at it.
It was the best thing that ever happened to me.
But you, you know, you're letting Click Clack, Ding Dong, and Charlie Chan just walk out with Miss What's-Her-Face.
She likes you, you know?
Though I don't know why.
Who?
Yum Yum.
You know, the girl in the purple sweater.
She's been looking at you all day, stupid.
You mean Youa.
Yeah, Yum Yum, yeah.
Nice girl.
Nice girl.
A very charming girl.
I talked with her.
Yeah.
But you, you let her just walk right out with the Three Stooges.
And you know why?
Because you're a big, fat pussy.
Well I gotta go.
Good day, puss-cake.
No.
No more.
Well, okay, put them over there.
Bye-bye.
No, no.
No, no more.
No more.
Come on.
No more, now.
No more, please.
L...
Is this that chicken-dumpling thing you brought the other...?
Oh, all right.
Come on, ladies.
Certainly better than beef jerky, I'll tell you.
What's going on?
Thao is here to make amends.
He's here to work for you.
No, he isn't.
He's not gonna work for me.
My mom said he dishonored the family and now he has to work off his debt.
- He'll start tomorrow morning.
- Not tomorrow, not any time.
I don't even want him on my property.
I thought we went over all that.
It's very important that you accept, and it would be an insult if you refuse.
Why is this being put back on me?
He's the one who tried to steal my car.
All of a sudden, I'm the bad guy in this.
Look, my family is very traditional and would be very much upset if you don't let Thao repay.
If he doesn't wanna do it, then let's just go.
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Yeah.
Shut up.
All right.
Tomorrow, come on.
Tomorrow.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thank you.
Jesus, Joseph, and Mary, these Hmong broads are like badgers.
Son of a bitch, I never thought he'd show.
All right.
What are you good at?
Like what?
Well, that's what I'm asking.
If you're gonna work for me, I gotta know what you're good at.
I gotta know what you can do.
I don't know.
Well, that's kind of halfway what I expected you to say.
You see that tree right there?
You just go over there and count the birds.
You want me to count the birds?
Yeah, you can count.
All you slopes are supposed to be good at math, right?
- Yeah, I can count.
- Good.
One, two...
So, what do you have for me today?
You want me to watch paint dry?
- Maybe even count the clouds that pass by?
- Don't get flip with me, boy.
I'm not the one who tried to steal.
Don't you forget that.
Go ahead.
I don't care if you insult me or say racist things.
Because you know what?
I'll take it.
Yeah, course you'll take it, because you have no teeth, you have no balls, kid.
Look, I'm stuck here so why don't you just find something useful for me to do?
Because unlike you, I'm not useless, and I maintain my own property.
You swamp rats, on the other hand, you just can't help but...
How long do I have you for?
- Toad?
How long?
- Till next Friday.
Yeah.
All right.
Go get the ladder out of the garage.
When you get finished with that roof there, you can take that gutter and nail it back up.
I'm tired of looking at it the last three years.
Yeah.
Yeah, you said it, brother.
Hello.
Grandpa says he wants to know if you can have Thao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch.
Wasp nest?
Well, that's terrible.
Yeah, well, I think we can handle that after lunch.
Jesus, Lord Almighty, knock it off.
Hey, it's my last day.
So, what else do you have for me to do?
Take the day off.
You've done enough.
Toad.
Nothing, never mind.
The doctor will see you now.
Thank you.
Koski?
Mr. Kowalski?
Good morning.
I looked over your paperwork and I think we should immediately start a full battery of tests.
I feel that this would be the best way to go about checking out the issues that you've had...
- Excuse me.
What happened to Dr. Feldman, my regular doctor?
Dr. Feldman retired three years ago.
I'm his replacement, Dr. Chu.
- It's Grandpa Walt.
- Pick it up.
- You talk to him.
- Mitch.
- I'm doing bills here.
You talk to him.
He's your father.
Hey, Dad.
Hi, Mitch, it's...
It's me, your dad.
Yeah, I know.
What's up?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing much, really.
- How's everything going?
- I'm fine.
Fine.
Doing fine.
Fine.
Good.
How about Karen and the kids?
Fine, everybody's great.
Doing fine.
- Good.
How about work?
- Busy.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I suppose.
In fact, speaking of busy, I got a lot on my plate right now so if there's not something pressing...
No.
No, not at all.
So why don't you call me this weekend?
Sure.
Okay.
It was nice talking to you, Dad.
Thanks for calling.
Thanks.
Yeah.
This kid doesn't have a chance.
- What do you know about faucets?
- I know a lot about them, boy.
Stand aside.
- Jesus.
For the love of Pete.
- What?
It must be a hundred degrees in here.
Why don't you turn on the fan?
The place is falling apart.
Man, where'd you get all this stuff?
- What are you talking about?
- All the tools and stuff.
Well, it may come as a surprise to a thief but I bought this stuff, everything in here, with my own money.
Yeah, yeah.
That's not what I meant.
I mean, there's just so much shit packed in here.
Yeah.
Well, every tool in here has a purpose.
Everything has a job to do.
They're all to use if necessary.
Okay, so, what's that?
- That's a post-hole digger.
- That?
Vise grips.
- That?
- Wire cutters.
You know it's a trowel, come on.
Those are shears there, and that's a saw.
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me, kid.
All right, what's on your mind?
It's just, I can't afford to buy all this stuff.
Well, I guess even a bonehead like you could understand that a man acquires this over a period of 50 years.
- Yeah, but...
- All right, look, here.
Take these three items, right here.
You can have this.
WD-40, vise grips and some duct tape.
Any man worth his salt can do half of the household chores with just those three things.
Anything else you need, you just borrow it, that's all.
Okay.
Cool.
- Fuck me.
- What's with that?
Nothing.
What?
Nothing, huh?
I just saw you coughed up blood.
That's not good.
You should really see a doctor.
Yeah.
Look those guys who were here the other night, on my lawn.
What about them?
Just a gang, a bunch of Hmong gangbangers.
Yeah, I assumed that, but what were they doing here?
They were gonna take me away.
They were kind of pissed that I blew my first initiation.
Yeah.
Well, you are a pussy, you know, you wanna hang out with guys like that.
What was your initiation supposed to be?
My Gran Torino?
Christ all Friday.
Shit.
Toad, you got a minute?
All right.
Okay.
Here it is.
Here's the deal.
I take the top because that's the heaviest.
I pull on that, and you stand right back here and you push and help me push it up each step.
- Just like that.
- Then let me take the top.
No, no, I've got the top.
Really, I'll take the top.
It looks heavy.
Look, I'm not crippled.
I've got the top.
If you don't let me take the top, I ain't helping.
- Now, listen to me, zipperhead...
- No, you listen, old man.
I'm here because you needed help.
So it's either top or I'm out of here.
All right.
You take the top, and I'll push.
Just don't let it slip out of your little-girl hands and crush me.
Don't give me any ideas, now.
- That thing weighs a ton.
- Yeah.
It runs like a clock, though.
They just don't make them like this anymore.
So, what are you gonna do with it?
Sell it, I guess.
How much?
60 bucks.
They...
I'm tired of having it sit around down in the basement there.
Why?
You looking for a freezer?
The downstairs one kind of died.
Okay. 25 bucks and it's yours.
Twenty-five?
But you just said 60.
I know, but this'll save me money putting an ad in the paper.
- Come on, let's wheel it over to your place.
- All right.
Okay.
- Kind of ironic, huh?
What?
Toad washing the car that he tried to steal from you.
Yeah.
He misses one spot, he's doing it all over again too.
It's nice of you to look after him like this.
He doesn't have any real role models in his life.
Well, I'm not any role model.
But you're a good man, Wally.
I wish our father would've been more like you.
- Don't go calling me Wally.
- No, I'm serious.
He was really hard on us, really traditional, and really old-school.
- Yeah, well, I'm old-school.
- Yeah, but you're an American.
What's that supposed to mean?
You like him, don't you?
Are you kidding?
He tried to steal my car.
Uh-huh.
And you spend time with him teach him how to fix things, saved him from that fucked cousin of ours.
- Hey.
Watch your language, lady.
- And you're a good man.
I'm not a good man.
Get me another beer, dragon lady.
This one's empty.
You know, the Hmong consider gardening to be women's work.
Yeah.
That's probably why I see you in the garden over there all the time.
Besides, we ain't in Humong.
Funny.
You know, you should quit.
That's bad for you.
Yeah?
So is being in a gang, dipshit.
Didn't you hear what I just said?
I saw you cough up blood.
You should quit.
So, what's that emblem supposed to mean anyway?
Is it your ancient Cub Scout emblem?
First Cavalry.
I've had it since '51.
So, what do you want to do with your life, kid?
Well, I was thinking about maybe sales.
Sales, huh?
My oldest son is in sales.
- Does he do well?
- Oh, yeah.
License to steal.
I work in the Ford factory for 50 years, and he's out selling Japanese cars.
- You made cars?
- Yeah.
I put the steering column in this Gran Torino in 1972, right on the line.
Oh, you are old.
So cool.
Yeah.
So you wanna be in sales.
You thinking about going to school maybe?
- Kind of, but school costs money.
- Well, maybe you should get a job.
You can't just sit there and spread mulch in my garden the rest of your life.
- Well, maybe you could just pay me.
- Yeah.
Very funny.
Well, what kind of job could I ever get?
Yeah.
You're right.
Nobody would ever hire you.
Yeah, I know.
Look, I'm just kidding, zip.
I mean, you could get a job.
- You could get a job anywhere.
- Like what?
- Well, how about construction?
- Me?
- Yeah.
- Construction?
- You have Alzheimer's or something?
- No.
You could get a job in construction.
I know people in the trades.
Course, I have to make a little adjustment and man you up a little bit.
- Man me up?
- Yeah.
And I think you ought to date Miss Yum Yum too.
Do you a little good.
You know, get a little carbon off the valves.
Now you're just gonna learn how guys talk.
You just listen to the way Martin and I batter it back and forth.
- You okay?
You ready?
- Sure.
All right.
Let's go in.
Perfect.
A Polack and a chink.
How you doing, Martin, you crazy Italian prick?
You cheap bastard, I should've known you'd come in.
I was having such a pleasant day.
What'd you do, Jew some poor blind guy out of his money?
- Gave him the wrong change?
- Who's the Nip?
Oh, he's a pussy kid from next door.
I'm just trying to man him up a little bit.
Mm.
You see, kid?
Now, that's how guys talk to one another.
- They do?
- What, you got shit in your ears?
Now go on out and come back in, and talk to him like a man.
Like a real man.
- Come on, Walt.
- Come on.
Get your ass out of here.
And come on back now.
- Sorry about this.
- It's okay.
What's up, you old Italian prick?
Get out of my shop before I blow your head off you goddamn dick-smoking gook!
- Jesus Christ.
Oh, shit.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
But that's what you said.
That what you said men say.
You don't just come in and insult the man in his shop.
You don't do that.
What happens if you meet some stranger and get the wrong one?
- He's gonna blow your gook head right off.
- What should I have said, then?
Yeah, kid, why don't you start with "Hi" or "Hello"?
Yeah, just come in and say:
"Sir, I'd like a haircut, if you have time. "
Yeah, be polite, but don't kiss ass.
You could talk about a construction job you just came from and bitch about your girlfriend and your car.
Son of a bitch, I just got my brakes fixed, and those sons of bitches really nailed me.
- I mean, they screwed me right in the ass.
Don't swear at the guy.
Just talk about people who are not in the room.
You could bitch about your boss making you work overtime when it's bowling night.
Right.
Or my old lady bitches for two goddamn hours about how they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store and the minute I turn on the game, she starts crying how we never talk.
You see?
Now go out, come back and talk to him.
And it ain't rocket science, for chrissake.
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car or a girlfriend.
Jesus.
I should've blown his head off when I had the chance.
Yeah.
Maybe so.
Now, okay, I want you to turn around and go outside and come back, and don't talk about having no job no car, no girlfriend, no future, no dick.
Okay?
Just turn around and go.
Excuse me, sir.
I need a haircut, if you ain't too busy.
You old Italian son-of-a-bitch prick barber.
Boy, does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job.
Fuck me.
Jesus Christ.
- All set to go through with it, right?
- Yeah, yeah.
Don't "Yeah, yeah" me.
Just say, "Yes, sir," and, "I'll do my best. "
Yes.
I'll do my best.
Because when I vouch for somebody, that means I've given my word.
- And I don't want you making me look bad.
- No, I'm good.
Totally into this.
Don't lay down, either.
Just look them straight in the eye.
And a man can tell a lot by your handshake.
- Here.
Put those in your back pocket.
- Cool.
Don't blow this.
Hey, Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon.
How the hell are you?
- I'm shitty, but who's gonna listen?
Not me, that's for sure.
Help yourself, there, Walt.
You dumb Polack.
Okay, this is the kid I was telling you about.
Thao, this is Tim Kennedy.
He's the super on this job.
So, what do we got here, Walt?
Well, he knows construction, and he's a smart kid.
He'll do anything you need him for.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
- You speak English?
- Yes, sir.
- Were you born here?
- You bet.
I see that Walt drove you here.
You got a vehicle?
Not at the moment.
Taking the bus for now.
The bus.
Jesus Christ, you don't have a car?
My head gasket cracked.
And the goddamn prick at the shop wants to bend me over for 2100.
Oh, please.
I replaced the tranny in my Tahoe, and the sons of bitches fucked me hard.
- Just under 3200.
- Goddamn thieves.
It ain't right.
You got that right.
Okay, come on in on Monday, and we'll find something for you to do.
- Thanks, Mr. Kennedy.
- It's Tim.
And what's your name again?
- Thao.
- "Tuh," okay.
You owe me one, Walt.
Yeah.
Well, I'll buy you a fruitcake for Christmas.
Fuck the fruitcake.
How about you just hand over them keys to that Gran Torino?
- Why the hell does everybody want my car?
- Well, I'm not surprised.
Yeah, you don't know the half of it.
All right, come on, zipperhead.
We'll let the mick stay here and play with himself.
What are we doing?
What do you wanna do?
Carry your tools in a rice bag?
Here we are.
You can use one of these.
And you'll need one of these.
Here.
I can't afford any of this.
I'll cover it.
You can pay me back on your first paycheck.
Cool.
- Here.
You'll need something like that.
Now, this is what I'm looking for.
Here, tool belt.
- There you go.
- Not to bitch but won't I be needing some tools?
Tools I've got, but I'm not gonna lend my tool belt.
You can pick up tools as you go.
- I really appreciate all this.
- Forget it.
No.
I really do.
Thank you.
What's up, homeboy?
What you doing?
What up, man?
What you got, punk?
- Just checking up on my little cousin.
Yeah, man.
- Our little cousin.
What's this?
Where you coming from, man?
I'm coming home from work.
Not that you guys would know much about that.
So it's true.
You got a job.
You can't just leave me alone?
- What?
Hey, dog, check this out.
You scared, huh?
Who bought this shit for you?
Your dad?
- What do you want?
- Your dad bought this?
Keep your hands off my stuff.
Give me the fucking hat.
- Why the fuck you gotta make me look bad?
Keep your hands off my stuff!
Smashing's my job, man.
- Yo, give me that.
Hey, come on.
That's my stuff.
Throw it over the fence, man, fuck it.
Let me go.
Let me go.
Hey, you little bitch.
Give me that, man.
Give me that.
- What's the phrase I'm looking for?
Fuck him up.
Oh, yeah.
Saving face.
- Hey there.
- Hey.
I gotta run.
Haven't seen you in a few days.
Where you been?
- Been busy.
- Yeah.
Busy, huh?
Hey.
- What the hell happened to you?
- Don't worry about it.
What do you mean, don't worry about it?
Look at your face.
I said, don't worry about it.
Okay?
It's not your problem.
When?
Grabbed me a couple days ago, right after I got off work.
Cowards.
I did everything I could possibly do, but they broke some of your tools.
- I'll replace them.
- Don't worry about the tools.
Where does your cousin live?
No, Walt.
I'll be okay.
- I don't want you to do anything.
- All right.
If you need any extra tools, you just let me know.
Well, I could use a roofing hammer.
Good.
Go in my garage and get it.
That should be the last of them.
Hey.
All right.
Here's the deal.
You stay away from Thao, understand?
You tell your friends to stay away from Thao.
If they don't listen, tell them you don't wanna see them anymore.
That's it.
Got it?
I'll take that as a yes.
If I have to come back here it's gonna get fucking ugly.
Get out of my way.
How do you want your dog?
I mean, steak?
Funny.
- I told you, we only eat cats.
Yeah.
Well.
Whoa.
I've never seen you like this before.
I'm feeling good.
You know, I got beautiful women, great food.
And Thao.
- And even Thao isn't bugging me.
- Having a good time, I see.
- Yeah.
And it never ends.
- What happened to your knuckles anyways?
I slipped in the shower.
No big problem.
Look, now, Yum Yum, if he doesn't ask you out I'm gonna ask you out.
Youa, don't listen to him, Youa.
He's a white devil.
Yeah, I am.
I'm the white devil.
I'd love to, Walt, but he beat you to it.
Really?
No kidding.
Dinner and a movie or what?
Yeah.
They're taking the bus.
No, you can't take the bus.
We gotta get you something more stylish than that.
Like what?
Take a limo?
How about that?
- The Gran Torino?
- Yeah.
- You'd let me take the Gran Torino?
- Yeah, I'd let you take the Gran Torino.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Here's the pitch.
And a strike.
Is everybody all right?
You're all right.
You're okay.
You've got a cut.
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
Where's grandma?
Where is Sue?
Where is Sue?
- She went to our aunt's.
- Your aunt's?
You sure?
- Yeah.
- Get on the phone and call right now.
I knew this was gonna happen.
Tried to...
What the hell am I doing here?
Well, maybe some of her friends called and they changed plans.
Yeah.
In the war, we just lost a lot of friends, but you're kind of set for it.
You're geared to it.
No, no, no.
You fuck!
You rotten fuck!
Mr. Kowalski?
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I'm okay.
The police finally left.
No one's talking.
One thing about the Hmong, they keep their mouths shut.
Yeah, I've noticed that.
You know, Thao and Sue are never gonna find peace in this world as long as that gang's around.
Until they go away, you know, forever.
What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.
I took Sue to the hospital.
She's scared.
They're all scared.
Yeah.
Thao, especially.
He's sitting out there right now, staring at your front door.
You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.
What would you do?
- What should Thao do?
- I know what I would do if I was you.
- Or at least what you think you should do.
- Really?
If I was Thao, I guess I'd want vengeance.
I'd wanna stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys.
And you?
What would I do?
I'd come over here and talk to you, I guess.
I know you're close with these people, but this pisses me off too, Mr. Kowalski.
Want a beer?
I'd love one.
There's some in the chest right over there behind you.
Damn all this.
- Just isn't fair.
- Nothing's fair, Father.
So, what are you gonna do, Mr. Kowalski?
Call me Walt.
All right.
What are you gonna do, Walt?
I don't know but I'll think of something.
Whatever it is, they won't have a chance.
What are you doing?
- Thinking.
- Thinking?
Thinking time is over.
Now it's time to knock the shit out of those pricks.
I know you don't wanna hear this, but now's the time to stay calm.
Calm?
You want me to be calm?
We stay calm or else mistakes get made.
We have to step back from this thing.
No.
Don't let me down, Walt.
Not you.
This is gonna end today.
Sit down.
- I don't wanna sit.
- I said, sit down.
Now, listen to me.
We gotta plan this, and plan it very carefully.
We can't make any mistakes.
Now, you know I'm the right man for this job.
So I want you to go home and stay calm and come back here at 4 this afternoon.
- And what needs to be done will be done.
- I say we go now.
Right now.
And what?
Kill that cousin of yours and the rest of those zips?
Mr. Tough Guy out for blood all of a sudden?
You know nothing about it.
Now go home and you stay calm.
Come back here at 4.
All right?
Okay?
Okay.
Yeah.
I know, I know.
Give me a break, will you?
It's the first time I've ever smoked in the house.
Let a man enjoy himself, would you, girl?
All finished.
Ten dollars American.
I don't suppose your Guinea hands are steady enough to do a straight shave?
Straight shave?
You've never asked for a straight shave.
I know, but I've always wondered about it.
That's unless you're too busy.
- No, just let me heat up a towel.
- Yeah.
And here, here's a 20.
Keep the change.
That's just in case you hit my jugular.
It's gonna take about one hour.
We gonna shorten the sleeves a little bit.
Gonna fix the shoulder.
- Yeah.
I never had a fitted suit before.
- Yes, sir.
- Mm-hm.
- You look very good.
- What can I do for you, Mr. Kowalski?
- I'm here for a confession.
Oh, Lord Jesus.
What have you done?
- Nothing.
You just take it easy, now.
- What are you up to?
Are you gonna give me a confession or not?
How long has it been since your last confession?
Oh, forever.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
What are your sins, my son?
Well, in 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski at the factory Christmas party.
Dorothy was in the other room with the other wives.
It just happened.
Yes, go on.
Well, I made a 900-dollar profit selling a boat and a motor.
I didn't pay the taxes.
It's the same as stealing.
Yes, fine.
Oh, lastly I was never very close with my two sons.
I don't know them.
I didn't know how.
That's it?
That's it?
It's bothered me most of my life.
Say 10 "Hail Marys" and five "Our Fathers. "
God loves you and forgives you, and I absolve you of all your sins.
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Thank you, Padre.
Are you going to retaliate for what happened to Sue?
I'm going over to that house today, Mr. Kowalski.
Is that so?
It is.
And every other day until you see the folly in what you're planning.
- Busy day.
Gotta go.
- Go in peace.
Oh, I am at peace.
Jesus Christ.
So which one's mine?
You ever fired a weapon before?
No.
Well, why don't you put that one down?
And I got something I wanna show you.
Come on.
What?
1952, we were sent up to take out a chink machine-gun nest.
Been shredding us up pretty good.
I was the only one that came back that day.
For that, they gave me a Silver Star.
Here it is.
Here.
I want you to have it.
Why?
Why?
Because we all knew the dangers that night, but we went anyway.
That's the way it might be tonight.
There's always a chance you don't come back.
The hell we won't.
We're gonna roll up in there and tear some ass.
That's foolish.
That's the exact reaction they're waiting for.
Go ahead and close this up.
- How many?
- How many what?
How many men did you kill in Korea?
- Thirteen.
Maybe more.
- What was it like to kill a man?
You don't wanna know.
Now close it up.
Walt.
Walt.
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Relax.
You can't get out of there.
You let me out right now.
Let me out.
- Fucking let me out or I'll fucking kill you.
- Shut the fuck up.
You wanna know what it's like to kill a man?
Well, it's goddamn awful, that's what it is.
The only thing worse is getting a medal for killing some poor kid that wanted to just give up, that's all.
Yeah, some scared little gook just like you.
I shot him in the face with that rifle you were holding in there a while ago.
Not a day goes by that I don't think about it, and you don't want that on your soul.
Now, I got blood on my hands.
I'm soiled.
That's why I'm going it alone tonight.
Walt.
You take me with you right now.
Let me out!
Look, you've come a long way.
I'm proud to say that you're my friend but you got your whole life ahead of you.
But me, I finish things.
That's what I do.
And I'm going it alone.
No.
Wait!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
Look, I need you to watch my dog.
Yeah, I love you too.
Yeah, she's old too.
Bye-bye, sweetheart.
Take it easy.
Her name is Daisy.
- Hello?
It's Walt.
The keys to my house are under the ceramic turtle on the porch.
Let yourself in.
Your brother's in the basement.
I gotta go.
Sorry, Father, we have to go.
I'm telling you, if we're not here, there will be bloodshed.
We've been here for hours.
We can't afford to anchor a unit to one location.
I'm begging you to stay.
Just got word from my sergeant.
We're pulling the plug.
- I'm staying.
- No, you aren't.
We have specific orders.
You came with us, you're leaving with us.
Watch your head.
Sue.
Over here.
Over here.
- Come unlock this.
What's going on?
He left without me.
He went to Smokie's without me.
Thao!
What the fuck, man?
Any swamp rats in there?
- I didn't think your ass would've came.
- Shut up, gook.
I got nothing to say to you, shrimp-dick midget like you.
Yeah, yeah.
You go ahead, watch out for your boyfriend.
Because it was either he or you or someone who raped one of their own family.
Your own blood, for chrissake.
Now, go ahead and pull those pistols like miniature cowboys.
- Go ahead.
- So where's Thao at?
- That pussy motherfucker couldn't come?
- Don't worry about Thao.
Thao's got not one second for you.
Says who?
You?
What the fuck you gonna do, old man?
What you gonna do punk ass old man?
Bitch.
- Kind of jumpy, aren't we?
- Shut the fuck up.
You shut the fuck up.
- Got a light?
What the fuck?
No.
Me.
I've got a light.
Hail Mary, full of grace.
- Yes, Sergeant.
What happened?
- You need to step back.
- He's a friend of mine.
I said, step back.
Hey, did you hear him?
Step back.
- What happened?
- Hey, step back.
He's my friend.
Please, it's important.
He went for his lighter and they shot him.
He didn't even have a gun on him.
This time we have witnesses.
These guys will be locked up for a long time.
Officer Chang!
Get those people back.
You have to step back now, okay?
Get them the fuck out of here.
Get them out of here.
Walt Kowalski once said to me that I didn't know anything about life or death because I was an over-educated, 27-year-old virgin who held the hands of superstitious old women and promised them eternity.
Walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it but he was right.
I knew really nothing about life or death until I got to know Walt.
And, boy, did I learn.
"And I wanna leave my house to the church because Dorothy would've liked it. "
Now, which brings us to our last item, and again please excuse the language in Mr. Kowalski's will.
I'm simply reading it the way it was written.
"And I'd like to leave my 1972 Gran Torino to my friend Thao Vang Lor on the condition that you don't chop-top the roof like one of those beaners don't paint any idiotic flames on it like some white-trash hillbilly and don't put a big, gay spoiler on the rear end like you see on all the other zipperheads' cars.
It just looks like hell.
If you can refrain from doing any of that, it's yours. "
I'm just so brokenhearted.
I want my daughter to find another husband.
If she married again there would be a man in the house.
What about Thao?
The man of the house is right there.
Look at him washing dishes.
He does whatever his sister orders him to do.
How could he ever become the man of the house?
Be patient, once he's older, he will be the man of the house.
No way.
Today is a blessed day, for a child is born.
I offer food to nurture this child's body.
I offer clothing to protect this child's flesh.
The child is blessed with a mother and father.
Oh, spirit of this child return home and do not wander anymore.
Come home, spirit and soul, come home.
Live a good life and grow old.
Why does that old white man stay here?
All the Americans have moved out of this neighborhood.
Why haven't you gone?
Why don't you strut away, you dumb rooster?
Those punk-ass Mexicans messing with you?
Please, it's important.
He went for his lighter and they shot him.
He didn't even have a gun on him.
This time we have witnesses.
These guys will be locked up for a long time.
I'm real sorry about Dorothy, Walt.
She was a real peach.
Thanks for coming, Al.
Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
Father.
Spirit.
Uh.
Holy Spirit.
WOMAN:
It's okay, I can move down.
Spectacles, testicles, wallet, and watch.
[CHILDREN LAUGH]
Look at the way the old man glared at Ashley.
Can't even tone it down for Mom's funeral.
What do you expect?
Dad's still living in the '50s.
He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly.
Well, your kid's wearing a Lions jersey.
I'm sure Dad appreciates that.
The point is that there's nothing anyone can do that won't disappoint the old man.
It's inevitable.
You know, that's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings.
You know, that deal with the boat motor, the broken birdbath.
It's always something.
What are we gonna do with him?
Don't you think he's gonna get in trouble, all by himself in the old neighborhood?
Well, why don't you have him move in with you?
[CHUCKLES]
Ha, ha, ha.
Hey.
Shh.
Death is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics.
Bitter in the pain, sweet in the salvation.
Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased and their families.
Sweet to those of us who know the salvation that awaits.
And some may ask, "What is death?
Is it the end?
Or is it the beginning?
And what is life?
What is this thing we call life?"
[BEEPS]
- All these questions can frustrate you.
KAREN:
Ashley, stop it.
JANOVICH:
That's why you have to turn to the Lord.
Jesus.
JANOVICH:
Because the Lord is the sweetness...
WOMAN:
This is so good.
MAN:
Did you have a chance to call Martha?
DAVID:
Is that Dad?
DANIEL:
No.
That's Grandpa Walt.
"Third platoon, E company, March 2nd, 1952, Korea"?
Where's Korea?
A lot of people showed up after the service.
Well, I suppose they heard there's gonna be a lot of ham.
I'll go down in the basement and get some chairs.
- Oh, I can do that, Dad.
- No, I need them now, not next week.
Cool, I found a medal.
Look at this.
How much longer do we have to stay?
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell, and I'm bored.
Ashley, why don't you go help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?
- Me?
- Yes, you.
Go.
Go help him.
Grandpa Walt, would you like some help with this?
With your chairs?
No.
You probably just painted your nails.
KAREN:
Honey, come here.
Okay, well, your dad is driving me crazy.
- Why did you make me do that?
KAREN:
It's okay.
We're leaving soon.

Hey, girl.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come with me.

How many swamp rats can you get in one room?
[SPITS]
[SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE]
Wow.
Grandpa, when did you get the vintage car?
1972.
I never knew you had a cool old car.
Yeah.
Well, it's been here since before you were born.
So what are you gonna do with it when you, like, die?
What about that super-cool retro couch you have in the den?
Because I'm going to state next year and it would look really good in my room, and I don't have any furniture at all.
Oh, God.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
- Who are you?
What do you want?
- Hi.
- I live...
- Get the shit out of your mouth.
- Tell me what you want.
- Do you have jumper cables?
- My uncle's car is old and...
- We don't have any cables.
And have some respect, zipperhead.
We're in mourning here.
- How you holding up, Walt?
- Mr. Kowalski.
Huh?
Mr. Kowalski, that's my name.
Right.
Mr. Kowalski.
Your wife and I became quite close these last few months.
She asked that I watch over you when she passed on.
I told her I watch over my flock.
But she made me promise I'd keep an extra-sharp eye on you.
Look, I appreciate the kindness you've shown to my wife.
Now that you've spoken your piece why don't you go tend to some of your other sheep?
Okay?
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her desire for you to go to confession.
She said she couldn't remember the last time you went.
- Is that so?
- It is.
Well, I confess that I never really cared for church very much.
The only reason I went was because of her.
And I confess that I have no desire to confess to a boy that's just out of the seminary.
[CHATTERING IN HMONG]
MAN:
Great to see you.
- Bye, dear.
- So long, Walt.
WOMAN:
Walt, can you get it started?
WALT:
Yeah, it'll be fine.
I wish I could help, Dad, but I gotta get the kids home.
- Kids are getting restless.
- Yeah, fine.
Just go.
I'll call you, see how you're doing.
All right.
Kill you to buy American?
Jesus.
Did you see the way he looked at the truck?
It's always rice-burner this, Jap-burner that, you know?
- Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go.
- He didn't say anything.
- He didn't need to.
- What do you expect?
The man worked at Ford all those years.
- I suppose that's my goddamn fault.
- Just give it a rest, just drive, okay?
Kids, want the radio on?
Anyone wanna listen to some music?
Good.

Damn barbarians.
[IN HMONG] I'm just so brokenhearted.
I want my daughter to find another husband.
If she married again there would be a man in the house.
[IN HMONG] What about Thao?
The man of the house is right there.
grandma:
Look at him washing dishes.
He does whatever his sister orders him to do.
How could he ever become the man of the house?
Be patient, once he's older, he will be the man of the house.
No way.
[IN HMONG] Today is a blessed day, for a child is born.
I offer food to nurture this child's body.

Come home, spirit and soul, come home.
Live a good life and grow old.

Why haven't you gone?
Why don't you strut away, you dumb rooster?
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Are you gone completely deaf or something?
Hi there, Walt.
I'm not a friend of yours, so why do you insist on calling me Walt?
Sorry.
Mr. Kowalski.
- What are you peddling today, Padre?
- Nothing.
I thought I'd drop by and see you.
I haven't seen you in church.
Now that you've done your good deed, why don't you take off down the road?
- I'd really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.
- Not in this lifetime, sonny.
Why?
Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
- You don't wanna know.
- No, I do.
Well, I think you're an over-educated 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold hands of ladies who are superstitious and promises them eternity.

There's a Mexican, a Jew, and a colored guy go into a bar.

So here's where my flock congregates when they're not in church.
Hey, Father J.
Hi, Mel.
Hey there, Darrell.
- Hello, Father.
- Hi, Walt.
What brings you in here, Father?
The meat raffle?
No, I just came down to talk to Walt, if that's okay.
Damn, Padre, you are persistent, aren't you?
I promised your wife.
All right.
Let's get a booth.
I'll have a Pabst and a shot of Jack and whatever he's having.
- I'll have a Diet Coke.
- Bullshit, this is a bar.
You have a drink.
- Um, I'll have a gin and tonic.
WALT:
Attaboy.
So what do you want?
I promised your wife I'd get you to go to confession.
Now, why would you do that?
She was very insistent.
She made me.
You're kind of fond of promising things you can't deliver on.
Right, Father?
- Let's talk about something else.
- What?
Life and death.
Life and death.
What the hell do you know about life and death?
I'd like to think I know a lot.
I'm a priest.
Yeah.
You get up and preach about life and death but all you know is what you learned in priest school.
Right out of the rookie preacher's handbook.
I don't know about that.
I think...
Death is bittersweet.
Sort of bitter in its pain, but sweet in its salvation.
That's what you know about life and death, and it's pathetic.
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?
I know a lot.
I lived for almost three years in Korea with it.
Thanks.
We shot men stabbed them with bayonets, hacked 17-year-olds to death with shovels.
Stuff I'll remember till the day I die.
Horrible things, but things I'll live with.
And what about life?
Well, I survived the war.
Got married, had a family.
Sounds like you know a lot more about death than you do living.
Maybe so, Father.
Maybe so.

- Why are you bringing me all this garbage?
Because...
- Because you saved Thao.
- I didn't save anybody.
I just...
I kept a bunch of jabbering gooks off of my lawn, that's all.
- You're a hero to the neighborhood.
- I'm not a hero.
They think you are.
That's why they keep bringing you gifts.
- Please, take them.
- They're wrong.
Now, I just want to be left alone.
Thank you.

This is my mom, Vu, I'm Sue, and that's my brother, Thao.

Thao wants to say something.
I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?
- For trying to steal your car.
Let me tell you something, boy.
You step on this property again, you're done.
Good afternoon, Walt.
I told you I'm not going to confession.
- Why didn't you just call the police?
- What?
I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I heard there was trouble in the neighborhood.
Why didn't you call the police?
Well...
You know, I prayed that they would show up but nobody answered.
What were you thinking?
Someone could have been killed.
We're talking life and death here.
When things go wrong, you gotta act quickly.
When we were in Korea and a thousand screaming gooks came across our line we didn't call the police, we reacted.
We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski.
I've been thinking about our conversation on life and death.
About what you said.
About how you carry around all the horrible things you were forced to do horrible things that won't leave you.
It seems it would do you good to unload some of that burden.
Things done during war are terrible.
Being ordered to kill.
Killing to save yourself, killing to save others.
You're right.
Those are things I know nothing about but I do know about forgiveness and I've seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins admitted their guilt, and left their burdens behind them.
Stronger men than you.
Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things and are now at peace.
Well, I gotta hand it to you, Padre.
You came here with your guns loaded this time.
Thank you.
And you're right about one thing.
About stronger men than me reaching their salvation.
Well, halle-fucking-lujah.
But you're wrong about something else.
What's that, Mr. Kowalski?
The thing that haunts a man the most is what he isn't ordered to do.
There.
You finally look like a human being again.
You shouldn't wait so long between haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch.
Yeah.
Well, I'm surprised you're still around.
I was always hoping you'd die and they'd get somebody who knew what they were doing.
Instead you just keep hanging around like the doo-wop dago you are.
- That'll be 10 bucks, Walt.
- Ten bucks?
Jesus Christ, Martin.
What are you, half Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices.
It's been 10 bucks for the last five years, you hard-nosed, Polack son of a bitch.
- Yeah, well, keep the change.
- See you in three weeks, prick.
Not if I see you first, dipshit.
Since everything could go downhill after that.
- Yeah, that's true.
- That would suck.
- That's cool, you know?
Yeah.

- Trying to stay out.
What's the matter with you, for chrissake?
Trying to get yourself killed?
I thought you Asian girls were supposed to be smart.
Hanging around a neighborhood like that's a fast way to get you in the obituaries.
I know.
I know.
Take it easy.
And what about that goofball guy you were with?
Is that a date or something?
Yeah.
Kind of.
His name is Trey.
Well, you shouldn't be hanging out with him.
You should be hanging out with your own people, with other Humongs.
You mean Hmong?
We're Hmong, not "Humong."
Whatever.
Where the hell is Humong, I mean Hmong, anyway?
[SUE LAUGHS]
Wow.
You're so enlightened, you know that?
No, Hmong isn't a place.
It's a people.
Hmong people come from different parts of Laos, Thailand, and China.
Yeah.
Well, how did you end up in my neighborhood, then?
Why didn't you stay there?
It's a Vietnam thing.
We fought on your side.
And when the Americans quit, the Communists started killing all the Hmong.
So we came over here.
Yeah.
Well, I don't know how you ended up in the Midwest.
There's snow on the ground six months out of the year.
Why does a jungle people want to be in the great frozen tundra?
Hill people.
We were hill people.
Not jungle people.
Booga-booga-booga.
Yeah.
Whatever.
Blame the Lutherans.
They brought us over here.
Everybody blames the Lutherans.

He just doesn't know which direction to go in.

Well, we thought that it would make things easier.
Well, thank you, Karen.
There's nothing wrong with making things less hard on yourself.
Karen's right, Dad.
You've worked hard your whole life.
Maybe it's time you started thinking about, you know, taking it easier.
Jeez.
That's another thing, Dad.
You really should get rid of the coffin nails.
But, I don't know, we were thinking about the house.
You know, what with Mom gone, it's gotta be a lot to maintain around here.
- Mm-hm.
- Let alone clean.
And, I don't know, you're here all alone.
Yeah, and there are these great places now, you know, these communities where you don't have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow where the people are like you, active and alert, but are alone and would benefit from being around folks their own age.
Yeah, Dad, look.
You gotta check it out.
We've brought some brochures.
These places are nothing like what you'd think they'd be.
- They're great.
- No, no, beautiful.
They're really nice.
They really are.
These are top-notch, like, resorts.
- It's like staying in a hotel practically.

What are you up to?
We're having a barbecue.
You wanna come over?
- What do you think?
- There's tons of food.
Yeah.
Just keep your hands off my dog.
- No worries.
We only eat cats.
- Really?
No, I'm kidding, you moron.
Come on, you can be my special guest.
No, I'm fine right here.
Yeah.
[GROANS]
- Son of a bitch.
- Okay, so, what have you had to eat today?
Oh, I had a piece of cake and a little beef jerky.
Come on over and get something to eat.
We've got beer too.
Well, I might as well drink with strangers rather than drink alone.
After all, it is my birthday.
- Really?
Happy birthday, Wally.
- Don't call me Wally.
WALT:
Well, no Pabst, but plenty of beer.
- As they say, when in Humong.
- Ha, ha.
Hey, what am I doing wrong?
Every time I look at somebody, they look at the ground.
You're fine.
[SPEAKING IN HMONG]
WALT:
What's she saying?
- She said welcome to her home.
- Oh, no, she's not.
- Yeah, no, she didn't.
- She hates me.
Come on.
- Yeah, she hates you.
Okay.
Hey.
[PEOPLE MURMURING]
Hey, what are all you fish heads looking at anyway?
I think we should go into the other room.
Sorry.
SUE:
A lot of people in this house are very traditional.
Number one, never touch a Hmong person on their head, not even a child.
Hmong people believe that the soul resides on the head, so don't do that.
Well, sounds dumb, but fine.
Yeah, and a lot of Hmong people consider looking someone in the eye to be very rude.
That's why they look away when you look at them.
- Anything else?
- Yeah.
Some Hmong people tend to smile or grin when they're yelled at.
It's a cultural thing.
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity.
It's not that they're laughing at you or anything.
Yeah.
God, you people are nuts.
But the food does look good.
Smells good too.
Well, of course.
It's Hmong food.
Yeah.
Okay.
Can I come back for seconds?
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
You know, you mentioned about looking at people.
- He's been staring at me the whole evening.
- That's Kor Khue.
He's the Lor family shaman.
And what's that, some sort of a witch doctor or something?
- Something like that.
- Yeah.
Booga-booga.
Ha, ha.
Very funny, Wally.
[BOTH SPEAKING IN HMONG]
Kor Khue's interested in you.
He heard what you did.
He would like to read you.
It'd be rude not to allow him this.
It's a great honor.
- Yeah, sure, fine by me.
Sure.
- All right.
Take a seat.
WALT:
Here?
He says that people do not respect you.
They don't even wanna look at you.
He says the way you live, your food has no flavor.
You're worried about your life.
You made a mistake in your past life, like a mistake that you did you're not satisfied with.
He says you have no happiness in your life.
It's like you're not at peace.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm...
Yeah, I'm fine.
Fine.
I'm fine.
God, I've got more in common with these gooks than I do my own spoilt rotten family.
Jesus Christ.
Happy birthday.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
You were bleeding.
No, I bit my tongue.
It's nothing.
Why don't we go and get some of that good gook food?
- You know, I'm starving.
- Okay.
Fantastic.
Well, you ladies are wonderful.
This stuff is really good.
Come on, you glutton.
- What's up?
- Let's go.
- What for?
SUE:
To mingle.
Mingle?
We're mingling right here.
Come on.
You told me not to leave you alone.
Thank you very much, but I have to go now.
I have to go now.
I'll be back.
Now, don't let anything go away.
[MUSIC PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]
Oh, great.
Well, well, well.
Look who's over there.
- Yeah, the kid who stole my Gran Torino.
- My brother, Thao.
Tried to, anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah, Toad.
It was a little wobbly, but that should fix it.
YOUA:
So where are you guys from?
- I'm not far from here.
- I'm from Texas.
- What's this?
- A little rice liquor.
Here, try it.
All right.
My friends and I were just wondering what you're doing here.
Well, that's a good question.
What am I doing here?
- Name's Walt.
- Hi, Walt.
I'm Youa.
- Yuam.
A pleasure.
- No.
Youa.
Youa, okay.
So, what do you do?
- Oh, I fix things, stuff like that.
- Like what?
Well, I just fixed that dryer there, I fixed my wife's friend's sink and I took old Aunt Mary to the doctor's to get her prescription fixed up.
And then I even fixed a door that hadn't even broken yet.
You're funny.
I've been called a lot of things, but never funny.
- Well, I'm gonna take off.
Enjoy yourself.
- Okay.
Yum Yum.
Pleasure.
Look, she's going, man.
Come on.
MAN:
Youa, wait up.
Relax, zipperhead.
I'm not gonna shoot you.
I'd look down too, if I was you.
I knew you were a dipshit the first time I ever saw you but I never thought you were worse with women than you are at stealing cars, Toad.
- It's Thao.
- What?
It's not Toad, it's Thao.
My name is Thao.
Yeah, well, you're blowing it with that girl who was there.
Not that I give two shits about a toad like you.
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- You're wrong.
I know exactly what I'm talking about.
I may not be the most pleasant person to be around but I got the best woman that was ever on this planet to marry me.
I worked at it.
It was the best thing that ever happened to me.
But you, you know, you're letting Click Clack, Ding Dong, and Charlie Chan just walk out with Miss What's-Her-Face.
She likes you, you know?
Though I don't know why.
Who?
Yum Yum.
You know, the girl in the purple sweater.
She's been looking at you all day, stupid.
You mean Youa.
Yeah, Yum Yum, yeah.
Nice girl.
Nice girl.
A very charming girl.
I talked with her.
Yeah.
But you, you let her just walk right out with the Three Stooges.
And you know why?
Because you're a big, fat pussy.
Well I gotta go.
Good day, puss-cake.
[WOMEN SPEAKING IN HMONG]
No.
No more.
Well, okay, put them over there.
Bye-bye.
No, no.
No, no more.
No more.
Come on.
No more, now.
No more, please.
L...
Is this that chicken-dumpling thing you brought the other...?
Oh, all right.
Come on, ladies.
Certainly better than beef jerky, I'll tell you.
What's going on?
Thao is here to make amends.
He's here to work for you.
[VU SPEAKING IN HMONG]
No, he isn't.
He's not gonna work for me.
My mom said he dishonored the family and now he has to work off his debt.
- He'll start tomorrow morning.
- Not tomorrow, not any time.
I don't even want him on my property.
I thought we went over all that.
It's very important that you accept, and it would be an insult if you refuse.
Why is this being put back on me?
He's the one who tried to steal my car.
All of a sudden, I'm the bad guy in this.
Look, my family is very traditional and would be very much upset if you don't let Thao repay.
If he doesn't wanna do it, then let's just go.
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Yeah.
Shut up.
All right.
Tomorrow, come on.
Tomorrow.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thank you.
Jesus, Joseph, and Mary, these Hmong broads are like badgers.
Son of a bitch, I never thought he'd show.
All right.
What are you good at?
Like what?
Well, that's what I'm asking.
If you're gonna work for me, I gotta know what you're good at.
I gotta know what you can do.
I don't know.
Well, that's kind of halfway what I expected you to say.
You see that tree right there?
You just go over there and count the birds.
You want me to count the birds?
Yeah, you can count.
All you slopes are supposed to be good at math, right?
- Yeah, I can count.
- Good.
One, two...
So, what do you have for me today?
You want me to watch paint dry?
- Maybe even count the clouds that pass by?
- Don't get flip with me, boy.
I'm not the one who tried to steal.
Don't you forget that.
Go ahead.
I don't care if you insult me or say racist things.
Because you know what?
I'll take it.
Yeah, course you'll take it, because you have no teeth, you have no balls, kid.
Look, I'm stuck here so why don't you just find something useful for me to do?
Because unlike you, I'm not useless, and I maintain my own property.
You swamp rats, on the other hand, you just can't help but...
How long do I have you for?
- Toad?
How long?
- Till next Friday.
Yeah.
[CHUCKLES]
All right.
Go get the ladder out of the garage.
When you get finished with that roof there, you can take that gutter and nail it back up.
I'm tired of looking at it the last three years.
[MAN SPEAKING IN HMONG]
Yeah.
Yeah, you said it, brother.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
Hello.
Grandpa says he wants to know if you can have Thao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch.
Wasp nest?
Well, that's terrible.
Yeah, well, I think we can handle that after lunch.
[GIRL SPEAKING IN HMONG]
[DOORBELL RINGING]
[COUGHING]
Jesus, Lord Almighty, knock it off.
Hey, it's my last day.
So, what else do you have for me to do?
Take the day off.
You've done enough.
Toad.
Nothing, never mind.
WOMAN:
The doctor will see you now.
Thank you.
Koski?
Mr. Kowalski?
Good morning.
I looked over your paperwork and I think we should immediately start a full battery of tests.
I feel that this would be the best way to go about checking out the issues that you've had...
- Excuse me.
What happened to Dr. Feldman, my regular doctor?
Dr. Feldman retired three years ago.
I'm his replacement, Dr. Chu.
[PHONE RINGING]
- It's Grandpa Walt.
- Pick it up.
- You talk to him.
- Mitch.
- I'm doing bills here.
KAREN:
You talk to him.
He's your father.
Hey, Dad.
WALT:
Hi, Mitch, it's...
It's me, your dad.
Yeah, I know.
What's up?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing much, really.
- How's everything going?
- I'm fine.
Fine.
Doing fine.
Fine.
Good.
How about Karen and the kids?
Fine, everybody's great.
Doing fine.
- Good.
How about work?
- Busy.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I suppose.
In fact, speaking of busy, I got a lot on my plate right now so if there's not something pressing...
No.
No, not at all.
So why don't you call me this weekend?
Sure.
Okay.
It was nice talking to you, Dad.
Thanks for calling.
Thanks.
Yeah.
[L.P., BUDDAH, CUZZ L.B.'S "APPRECIATION" PLAYS ON CAR STEREO]
This kid doesn't have a chance.
- What do you know about faucets?
- I know a lot about them, boy.
Stand aside.
- Jesus.
For the love of Pete.
- What?
It must be a hundred degrees in here.
Why don't you turn on the fan?
The place is falling apart.
THAO:
Man, where'd you get all this stuff?
- What are you talking about?
- All the tools and stuff.
Well, it may come as a surprise to a thief but I bought this stuff, everything in here, with my own money.
Yeah, yeah.
That's not what I meant.
I mean, there's just so much shit packed in here.
Yeah.
Well, every tool in here has a purpose.
Everything has a job to do.
They're all to use if necessary.
Okay, so, what's that?
- That's a post-hole digger.
- That?
Vise grips.
- That?
- Wire cutters.
You know it's a trowel, come on.
Those are shears there, and that's a saw.
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me, kid.
All right, what's on your mind?
It's just, I can't afford to buy all this stuff.
Well, I guess even a bonehead like you could understand that a man acquires this over a period of 50 years.
- Yeah, but...
- All right, look, here.
Take these three items, right here.
You can have this.
WD-40, vise grips and some duct tape.
Any man worth his salt can do half of the household chores with just those three things.
Anything else you need, you just borrow it, that's all.
Okay.
Cool.
[COUGHING]
- Fuck me.
- What's with that?
Nothing.
What?
Nothing, huh?
I just saw you coughed up blood.
That's not good.
You should really see a doctor.
Yeah.
Look those guys who were here the other night, on my lawn.
What about them?
Just a gang, a bunch of Hmong gangbangers.
Yeah, I assumed that, but what were they doing here?
They were gonna take me away.
They were kind of pissed that I blew my first initiation.
Yeah.
Well, you are a pussy, you know, you wanna hang out with guys like that.
What was your initiation supposed to be?
My Gran Torino?
Christ all Friday.
Shit.
Toad, you got a minute?
All right.
Okay.
Here it is.
Here's the deal.
I take the top because that's the heaviest.
I pull on that, and you stand right back here and you push and help me push it up each step.
- Just like that.
- Then let me take the top.
No, no, I've got the top.
Really, I'll take the top.
It looks heavy.
Look, I'm not crippled.
I've got the top.
If you don't let me take the top, I ain't helping.
- Now, listen to me, zipperhead...
- No, you listen, old man.
I'm here because you needed help.
So it's either top or I'm out of here.
[GROWLS]
All right.
You take the top, and I'll push.
Just don't let it slip out of your little-girl hands and crush me.
Don't give me any ideas, now.
- That thing weighs a ton.
- Yeah.
It runs like a clock, though.
They just don't make them like this anymore.
So, what are you gonna do with it?
Sell it, I guess.
How much?
60 bucks.
They...
I'm tired of having it sit around down in the basement there.
Why?
You looking for a freezer?
The downstairs one kind of died.
Okay. 25 bucks and it's yours.
Twenty-five?
But you just said 60.
I know, but this'll save me money putting an ad in the paper.
- Come on, let's wheel it over to your place.
- All right.
Okay.
- Kind of ironic, huh?
WALT:
What?
Toad washing the car that he tried to steal from you.
Yeah.
He misses one spot, he's doing it all over again too.
It's nice of you to look after him like this.
He doesn't have any real role models in his life.
Well, I'm not any role model.
But you're a good man, Wally.
I wish our father would've been more like you.
- Don't go calling me Wally.
- No, I'm serious.
He was really hard on us, really traditional, and really old-school.
- Yeah, well, I'm old-school.
- Yeah, but you're an American.
What's that supposed to mean?
You like him, don't you?
Are you kidding?
He tried to steal my car.
Uh-huh.
And you spend time with him teach him how to fix things, saved him from that fucked cousin of ours.
- Hey.
Watch your language, lady.
- And you're a good man.
I'm not a good man.
Get me another beer, dragon lady.
This one's empty.
You know, the Hmong consider gardening to be women's work.
Yeah.
That's probably why I see you in the garden over there all the time.
Besides, we ain't in Humong.
Funny.
You know, you should quit.
That's bad for you.
Yeah?
So is being in a gang, dipshit.
Didn't you hear what I just said?
I saw you cough up blood.
You should quit.
So, what's that emblem supposed to mean anyway?
Is it your ancient Cub Scout emblem?
First Cavalry.
I've had it since '51.
So, what do you want to do with your life, kid?
Well, I was thinking about maybe sales.
Sales, huh?
My oldest son is in sales.
- Does he do well?
- Oh, yeah.
License to steal.
I work in the Ford factory for 50 years, and he's out selling Japanese cars.
- You made cars?
- Yeah.
I put the steering column in this Gran Torino in 1972, right on the line.
Oh, you are old.
So cool.
Yeah.
So you wanna be in sales.
You thinking about going to school maybe?
- Kind of, but school costs money.
- Well, maybe you should get a job.
You can't just sit there and spread mulch in my garden the rest of your life.
- Well, maybe you could just pay me.
- Yeah.
Very funny.
Well, what kind of job could I ever get?
Yeah.
You're right.
Nobody would ever hire you.
Yeah, I know.
Look, I'm just kidding, zip.
I mean, you could get a job.
- You could get a job anywhere.
- Like what?
- Well, how about construction?
- Me?
- Yeah.
- Construction?
- You have Alzheimer's or something?
- No.
You could get a job in construction.
I know people in the trades.
Course, I have to make a little adjustment and man you up a little bit.
- Man me up?
- Yeah.
And I think you ought to date Miss Yum Yum too.
Do you a little good.
You know, get a little carbon off the valves.
Now you're just gonna learn how guys talk.
You just listen to the way Martin and I batter it back and forth.
- You okay?
You ready?
- Sure.
WALT:
All right.
Let's go in.
Perfect.
A Polack and a chink.
How you doing, Martin, you crazy Italian prick?
You cheap bastard, I should've known you'd come in.
I was having such a pleasant day.
What'd you do, Jew some poor blind guy out of his money?
- Gave him the wrong change?
- Who's the Nip?
Oh, he's a pussy kid from next door.
I'm just trying to man him up a little bit.
Mm.
You see, kid?
Now, that's how guys talk to one another.
- They do?
- What, you got shit in your ears?
Now go on out and come back in, and talk to him like a man.
Like a real man.
- Come on, Walt.
- Come on.
Get your ass out of here.
And come on back now.
- Sorry about this.
- It's okay.
What's up, you old Italian prick?
Get out of my shop before I blow your head off you goddamn dick-smoking gook!
- Jesus Christ.
Oh, shit.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
But that's what you said.
That what you said men say.
You don't just come in and insult the man in his shop.
You don't do that.
What happens if you meet some stranger and get the wrong one?
- He's gonna blow your gook head right off.
- What should I have said, then?
Yeah, kid, why don't you start with "Hi" or "Hello"?
Yeah, just come in and say:
"Sir, I'd like a haircut, if you have time."
Yeah, be polite, but don't kiss ass.
WALT:
You could talk about a construction job you just came from and bitch about your girlfriend and your car.
Son of a bitch, I just got my brakes fixed, and those sons of bitches really nailed me.
- I mean, they screwed me right in the ass.
WALT:
Don't swear at the guy.
Just talk about people who are not in the room.
You could bitch about your boss making you work overtime when it's bowling night.
Right.
Or my old lady bitches for two goddamn hours about how they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store and the minute I turn on the game, she starts crying how we never talk.
You see?
Now go out, come back and talk to him.
And it ain't rocket science, for chrissake.
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car or a girlfriend.
Jesus.
I should've blown his head off when I had the chance.
Yeah.
Maybe so.
Now, okay, I want you to turn around and go outside and come back, and don't talk about having no job no car, no girlfriend, no future, no dick.
Okay?
Just turn around and go.
Excuse me, sir.
I need a haircut, if you ain't too busy.
You old Italian son-of-a-bitch prick barber.
Boy, does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job.
Fuck me.
Jesus Christ.
- All set to go through with it, right?
- Yeah, yeah.
Don't "Yeah, yeah" me.
Just say, "Yes, sir," and, "I'll do my best."
THAO:
Yes.
I'll do my best.
Because when I vouch for somebody, that means I've given my word.
- And I don't want you making me look bad.
- No, I'm good.
Totally into this.
Don't lay down, either.
Just look them straight in the eye.
And a man can tell a lot by your handshake.
- Here.
Put those in your back pocket.
- Cool.
Don't blow this.
Hey, Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon.
How the hell are you?
- I'm shitty, but who's gonna listen?
WALT:
Not me, that's for sure.
Help yourself, there, Walt.
You dumb Polack.
Okay, this is the kid I was telling you about.
Thao, this is Tim Kennedy.
He's the super on this job.
TIM:
So, what do we got here, Walt?
Well, he knows construction, and he's a smart kid.
He'll do anything you need him for.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
- You speak English?
- Yes, sir.
- Were you born here?
- You bet.
I see that Walt drove you here.
You got a vehicle?
Not at the moment.
Taking the bus for now.
The bus.
Jesus Christ, you don't have a car?
My head gasket cracked.
And the goddamn prick at the shop wants to bend me over for 2100.
Oh, please.
I replaced the tranny in my Tahoe, and the sons of bitches fucked me hard.
- Just under 3200.
- Goddamn thieves.
It ain't right.
You got that right.
Okay, come on in on Monday, and we'll find something for you to do.
- Thanks, Mr. Kennedy.
- It's Tim.
And what's your name again?
- Thao.
- "Tuh," okay.
You owe me one, Walt.
Yeah.
Well, I'll buy you a fruitcake for Christmas.
Fuck the fruitcake.
How about you just hand over them keys to that Gran Torino?
- Why the hell does everybody want my car?
- Well, I'm not surprised.
Yeah, you don't know the half of it.
All right, come on, zipperhead.
We'll let the mick stay here and play with himself.
What are we doing?
What do you wanna do?
Carry your tools in a rice bag?
Here we are.
You can use one of these.
And you'll need one of these.
Here.
THAO:
I can't afford any of this.
WALT:
I'll cover it.
You can pay me back on your first paycheck.
THAO:
Cool.
- Here.
You'll need something like that.
Now, this is what I'm looking for.
Here, tool belt.
- There you go.
- Not to bitch but won't I be needing some tools?
Tools I've got, but I'm not gonna lend my tool belt.
You can pick up tools as you go.
- I really appreciate all this.
- Forget it.
No.
I really do.
Thank you.

[SCREAMING]
- Hey there.
- Hey.
I gotta run.
Haven't seen you in a few days.
Where you been?
- Been busy.
- Yeah.
Busy, huh?
Hey.
- What the hell happened to you?
- Don't worry about it.
What do you mean, don't worry about it?
Look at your face.
I said, don't worry about it.
Okay?
It's not your problem.
When?
Grabbed me a couple days ago, right after I got off work.
Cowards.
I did everything I could possibly do, but they broke some of your tools.
- I'll replace them.
- Don't worry about the tools.
Where does your cousin live?
No, Walt.
I'll be okay.
- I don't want you to do anything.
- All right.
If you need any extra tools, you just let me know.
Well, I could use a roofing hammer.
Good.
Go in my garage and get it.
That should be the last of them.
Hey.
All right.
Here's the deal.
You stay away from Thao, understand?
You tell your friends to stay away from Thao.
If they don't listen, tell them you don't wanna see them anymore.
That's it.
Got it?
I'll take that as a yes.
If I have to come back here it's gonna get fucking ugly.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]

Whoa.
I've never seen you like this before.
I'm feeling good.
You know, I got beautiful women, great food.
THAO:
And Thao.
- And even Thao isn't bugging me.
- Having a good time, I see.
- Yeah.
THAO:
And it never ends.
- What happened to your knuckles anyways?
I slipped in the shower.
No big problem.
Look, now, Yum Yum, if he doesn't ask you out I'm gonna ask you out.
Youa, don't listen to him, Youa.
He's a white devil.
Yeah, I am.
I'm the white devil.
I'd love to, Walt, but he beat you to it.
Really?
No kidding.
Dinner and a movie or what?
Yeah.
They're taking the bus.
No, you can't take the bus.
We gotta get you something more stylish than that.
Like what?
Take a limo?
How about that?
- The Gran Torino?
- Yeah.
- You'd let me take the Gran Torino?
- Yeah, I'd let you take the Gran Torino.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Yeah.
Yeah.
MAN [ON TV]:
Here's the pitch.
And a strike.
[WOMEN SCREAMING]
WALT:
Is everybody all right?
[VU SPEAKING IN HMONG]
You're all right.
You're okay.
You've got a cut.
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
Where's grandma?
Where is Sue?
Where is Sue?
- She went to our aunt's.
- Your aunt's?
You sure?
- Yeah.
- Get on the phone and call right now.
[SPEAKING IN HMONG]
I knew this was gonna happen.
Tried to...
What the hell am I doing here?
Well, maybe some of her friends called and they changed plans.
Yeah.
In the war, we just lost a lot of friends, but you're kind of set for it.
You're geared to it.
[SPEAKING IN HMONG]
No, no, no.
You fuck!
You rotten fuck!
Mr. Kowalski?
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I'm okay.
The police finally left.
No one's talking.
One thing about the Hmong, they keep their mouths shut.
Yeah, I've noticed that.
You know, Thao and Sue are never gonna find peace in this world as long as that gang's around.
Until they go away, you know, forever.
What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.
I took Sue to the hospital.
She's scared.
They're all scared.
Yeah.
Thao, especially.
He's sitting out there right now, staring at your front door.
You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.
What would you do?
- What should Thao do?
- I know what I would do if I was you.
- Or at least what you think you should do.
- Really?
If I was Thao, I guess I'd want vengeance.
I'd wanna stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys.
And you?
What would I do?
I'd come over here and talk to you, I guess.
I know you're close with these people, but this pisses me off too, Mr. Kowalski.
Want a beer?
I'd love one.
There's some in the chest right over there behind you.
Damn all this.
- Just isn't fair.
- Nothing's fair, Father.
So, what are you gonna do, Mr. Kowalski?
Call me Walt.
All right.
What are you gonna do, Walt?
I don't know but I'll think of something.
Whatever it is, they won't have a chance.
What are you doing?
- Thinking.
- Thinking?
Thinking time is over.
Now it's time to knock the shit out of those pricks.
I know you don't wanna hear this, but now's the time to stay calm.
Calm?
You want me to be calm?
We stay calm or else mistakes get made.
We have to step back from this thing.
No.
Don't let me down, Walt.
Not you.
This is gonna end today.
Sit down.
- I don't wanna sit.
- I said, sit down.
Now, listen to me.
We gotta plan this, and plan it very carefully.
We can't make any mistakes.
Now, you know I'm the right man for this job.
So I want you to go home and stay calm and come back here at 4 this afternoon.
- And what needs to be done will be done.
- I say we go now.
Right now.
And what?
Kill that cousin of yours and the rest of those zips?
Mr. Tough Guy out for blood all of a sudden?
You know nothing about it.
Now go home and you stay calm.
Come back here at 4.
All right?
Okay?
Okay.
Yeah.
I know, I know.
Give me a break, will you?
It's the first time I've ever smoked in the house.
Let a man enjoy himself, would you, girl?
All finished.
Ten dollars American.
I don't suppose your Guinea hands are steady enough to do a straight shave?
Straight shave?
You've never asked for a straight shave.
I know, but I've always wondered about it.
That's unless you're too busy.
- No, just let me heat up a towel.
- Yeah.
And here, here's a 20.
Keep the change.
That's just in case you hit my jugular.
It's gonna take about one hour.
We gonna shorten the sleeves a little bit.
Gonna fix the shoulder.
- Yeah.
I never had a fitted suit before.
- Yes, sir.
- Mm-hm.
- You look very good.
- What can I do for you, Mr. Kowalski?
- I'm here for a confession.
Oh, Lord Jesus.
What have you done?
- Nothing.
You just take it easy, now.
- What are you up to?
Are you gonna give me a confession or not?
How long has it been since your last confession?
WALT:
Oh, forever.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
What are your sins, my son?
Well, in 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski at the factory Christmas party.
Dorothy was in the other room with the other wives.
It just happened.
Yes, go on.
Well, I made a 900-dollar profit selling a boat and a motor.
I didn't pay the taxes.
It's the same as stealing.
Yes, fine.
Oh, lastly I was never very close with my two sons.
I don't know them.
I didn't know how.
That's it?
That's it?
It's bothered me most of my life.
Say 10 "Hail Marys" and five "Our Fathers."
God loves you and forgives you, and I absolve you of all your sins.
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Thank you, Padre.
Are you going to retaliate for what happened to Sue?
I'm going over to that house today, Mr. Kowalski.
WALT:
Is that so?
It is.
And every other day until you see the folly in what you're planning.
- Busy day.
Gotta go.
- Go in peace.
Oh, I am at peace.
Jesus Christ.
So which one's mine?
You ever fired a weapon before?
No.
Well, why don't you put that one down?
And I got something I wanna show you.
Come on.
THAO:
What?
1952, we were sent up to take out a chink machine-gun nest.
Been shredding us up pretty good.
I was the only one that came back that day.
For that, they gave me a Silver Star.
Here it is.
Here.
I want you to have it.
Why?
Why?
Because we all knew the dangers that night, but we went anyway.
That's the way it might be tonight.
There's always a chance you don't come back.
The hell we won't.
We're gonna roll up in there and tear some ass.
That's foolish.
That's the exact reaction they're waiting for.
Go ahead and close this up.
- How many?
- How many what?
How many men did you kill in Korea?
- Thirteen.
Maybe more.
- What was it like to kill a man?
You don't wanna know.
Now close it up.
[DOOR SLAMS]
[LOCK CLICKS]
Walt.
Walt.
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Relax.
You can't get out of there.
You let me out right now.
Let me out.
- Fucking let me out or I'll fucking kill you.
- Shut the fuck up.
You wanna know what it's like to kill a man?
Well, it's goddamn awful, that's what it is.
The only thing worse is getting a medal for killing some poor kid that wanted to just give up, that's all.
Yeah, some scared little gook just like you.
I shot him in the face with that rifle you were holding in there a while ago.
Not a day goes by that I don't think about it, and you don't want that on your soul.
Now, I got blood on my hands.
I'm soiled.
That's why I'm going it alone tonight.
Walt.
You take me with you right now.
Let me out!
Look, you've come a long way.
I'm proud to say that you're my friend but you got your whole life ahead of you.
But me, I finish things.
That's what I do.
And I'm going it alone.
No.
Wait!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
[grandma SPEAKING IN HMONG]
Look, I need you to watch my dog.
Yeah, I love you too.
Yeah, she's old too.
Bye-bye, sweetheart.
Take it easy.
Her name is Daisy.
[WHIMPERS]
[PHONE RINGING]
- Hello?
W ALT:
It's Walt.
The keys to my house are under the ceramic turtle on the porch.
Let yourself in.
Your brother's in the basement.
I gotta go.
[grandma SPEAKING IN HMONG]
Sorry, Father, we have to go.
I'm telling you, if we're not here, there will be bloodshed.
We've been here for hours.
We can't afford to anchor a unit to one location.
I'm begging you to stay.
Just got word from my sergeant.
We're pulling the plug.
- I'm staying.
- No, you aren't.
We have specific orders.
You came with us, you're leaving with us.
Watch your head.
THAO:
Sue.
Over here.
Over here.
- Come unlock this.
SUE:
What's going on?
He left without me.
He went to Smokie's without me.
SUE:
Thao!
[GANGBANGERS CHATTERING]
MAN 1:
What the fuck, man?
Any swamp rats in there?
- I didn't think your ass would've came.
- Shut up, gook.
I got nothing to say to you, shrimp-dick midget like you.
Yeah, yeah.
You go ahead, watch out for your boyfriend.
Because it was either he or you or someone who raped one of their own family.
Your own blood, for chrissake.
Now, go ahead and pull those pistols like miniature cowboys.
- Go ahead.
- So where's Thao at?
- That pussy motherfucker couldn't come?
- Don't worry about Thao.
Thao's got not one second for you.
SMOKIE:
Says who?
You?
What the fuck you gonna do, old man?
[GANGBANGERS CHUCKLE]
MAN 1:
What you gonna do punk ass old man?
MAN 2:
Bitch.
- Kind of jumpy, aren't we?
- Shut the fuck up.
You shut the fuck up.
- Got a light?
SPIDER:
What the fuck?
No.
Me.
I've got a light.
Hail Mary, full of grace.
- Yes, Sergeant.
THAO:
What happened?
- You need to step back.
- He's a friend of mine.
I said, step back.
Hey, did you hear him?
Step back.
- What happened?
- Hey, step back.
He's my friend.
[IN HMONG] Please, it's important.
[IN HMONG] He went for his lighter and they shot him.
He didn't even have a gun on him.
This time we have witnesses.
These guys will be locked up for a long time.
Officer Chang!
Get those people back.
[IN ENGLISH] You have to step back now, okay?
Get them the fuck out of here.
Get them out of here.
Walt Kowalski once said to me that I didn't know anything about life or death because I was an over-educated, 27-year-old virgin who held the hands of superstitious old women and promised them eternity.
[PEOPLE CHUCKLE]
Walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it but he was right.
I knew really nothing about life or death until I got to know Walt.
And, boy, did I learn.
"And I wanna leave my house to the church because Dorothy would've liked it."
Now, which brings us to our last item, and again please excuse the language in Mr. Kowalski's will.
I'm simply reading it the way it was written.
"And I'd like to leave my 1972 Gran Torino to my friend Thao Vang Lor on the condition that you don't chop-top the roof like one of those beaners don't paint any idiotic flames on it like some white-trash hillbilly and don't put a big, gay spoiler on the rear end like you see on all the other zipperheads' cars.
It just looks like hell.
If you can refrain from doing any of that, it's yours."
God, I am sorry for Dorothy, Walt.
She was a real peach.
Thanks for coming, Al.
Spectacles, testicles, wallet and watch.
Look at the Old Man glaring at Ashley.
He can't even tone it down at Mom's funeral?
What do you expect?
Dad's still living in the '50s.
He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly.
Yeah, well your kid's wearing a Timberwolves jersey.
I'm sure Dad appreciates that.
The point I am trying to make is that there's nothing anyone can do that won't disappoint the Old Man.
It's inevitable.
That's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings.
the deal with the boat motor, the broken bird bath,
It's always something.
What are we going to do with him?
Don't you think he'll get in trouble over there all by himself in the old neighborhood?
Why don't you have him move in with you?
Death is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics.
Bitter in the pain.
Sweet in the salvation.
Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased.
... and their families
Sweet to those who know the salvation that awaits.
And some may ask, what is death?
Is it the end?
Or is it the beginning?
And what is life?
What is this thing we call life?
All these questions can frustrate you at times like this.
And that's why you have to turn to the Lord.
- Jesus ...
Because the Lord is the sweetness.
Is that dad?
- No, that's grandpa Walt.
There is a platoon, E-Company, March 2, 1952.
Korea?
- Where's Korea?
Well, people showed up after the service, huh?
Yeah, well, I suppose they heard there'd be a lot of ham.
I'll go down the basement and get some chairs.
Oh, I can do that, Dad..
- No, we need them now not next week.
Cool, I found a medal.
Look at this.
How much longer do we have to stay?
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell and I'm bored.
Ashley, honey.
Why don't you help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?
Me?
- Yes, you.
Grandpa Walt, would you like some help with these four chairs.
No, you probably just painted your nails.
Your dad is driving me crazy.
Why didn't you guys make him a hint we're leaving soon?
Come on, let's go.
Jesus Christ, how many swamp rats can get in one room?
Grandpa, when'd you get the vintage car?
1972.
I never knew you had a cool old car.
Yeah, it's been here since before you were born.
So, what are you going do with it when you like... die?
Then what about that super cool retro couch that you have in the den
Cause I was thinking I'm going to State next year, and I think it would look really good in my dorm room.
And I don't have any furniture at all.
God.
Who are you?
- Hi, I am Tao.
- What do you want?
I live next door.
- Come on, get the shit out of your mouth.
I am ...
- Tell me what you want.
Do you have jumper cables?
My uncle's car is old and.....
- No we don't any jumper cables .
And have some respect, zipper head, we're mourning here..
How you holding up, Walt?
Mr. Kowalski.
Huh?
- Mr. Kowalski, that's my name.
Right, Mr. Kowalski.
Your wife and I became quite close these last few months.
She asked that I watch over you when she passed on.
I told her I watch out for my entire flock.
But she made me promise I'd keep an extra sharp eye on you.
I appreciate your kindness you've shown to my wife.
Now that you've spoken your piece, why don't go and attend some of your other sheep?
Ok?
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her desire for you to go to confession.
She said she couldn't remember the last time you went.
Is that so?
- It is.
Well, I confess that I never really cared for church very much.
The only reason I went was because of her.
And I confess that I have no desire to confess to a boy that is just out of the seminary.
Wish I could help dad, but gotta get kids home.
Kids getting restless.
- Yeah, fine, just go.
I'll call in a few, see how you're doing.
- Alright.
Kill you to buy American.
Huh ...
Did you see the way he looked at the truck?
Jesus.
It's always Rice-Burner this or Jap-Burner that.
You know.
Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go.
At least he didn't say anything this time.
-He didn't need to.
Well, what do you expect, Mitch?
The man worked at a Ford plant for a lot of years.
I suppose that's my goddamned fault?
Just give it a rest.
Drive.
Ok?
Kids, do you want the radio on?
Yes.
You want to listen to some music?
Good.
Damn, barbarians
Oh, Jesus ...
Polarski would roll over in his grave if he could see his lawn now.
What the hell the chinks had to move in this neighborhood for?
Have you gone completely deaf or something?
Hi there, Walt.
I kind of not a friend of yours.
Why do you insist on calling me Walt?
Sorry , Mr.Kowalski.
What are you peddling today, padre?
- Nothing.
Thought I'd drop by and see how you are doing.
I haven't seen you in church in a while
Okay.
Well now when you tipped on your good deed, now why don't you just take off down the road?
I'd really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.
- Not in this lifetime, sonny.
Why?
Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
- You don't want to know.
No, I do.
Well I think you're an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold the hands of old ladies who are superstitious and promises them eternity.
Is you a boy or is you a girl, I can't tell
Hey, Chicito.
If you was in pink, I would fuck you and your ass would be my bitch.
What you reading, jackass and The rice stalk?
That's right, you keep walking.
Look at me when I am talking to you.
-Fucking slopes everywhere you look, man.
Fucking pigs
Look at that, man.
That's my little cousin, over there.
- You sure that's your cousin, man?
Fuck yes, that's my little cousin.
- He tight with anybody?
No he is flying solo, man.
- Flying solo?
Let's go down and see what the fucking they're doing to him.
I love your jungles too.
Hey, they fucking with you?
They fucking with you?
We can do this right now.
You go fucking back here, don't you?
Yeah!
You are fucking rise niggers!
Ok go!
Tao, come on man, get in the car.
Dog, get in the car.
We just bailed your ass out, dawg.
Come on, dawg, get the fuck in here.
Get in the car, man, come on.

- Fuck him, man, let's go.
Come on Spider.
- Fuck it.
Get it man, let's go.

Tomorrow, I have to see your ass.
- Don't be like a little girl!
Tomorrow.
Come let's go, man.
We've got a gun, man.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Let's get this strapped.
Pussy!
Hey, Tao.
Hey what's up?
What's up, Tao?
What are you doing little man?
Why are you doing woman's work?
What do you want?
What?
We can't just come and talk to my little cousin?
He doesn't want to talk to you.
I am here right.
- Hey, Spider, who is that?
What's up?
- Spider?
Is that what he just called you, Fong?
Spider?
- Is there something wrong with Spider?
What are you doing here?
Hey, so how old are you anyways?
Mentally, I am way too old for you.
- What?
You are just stupid.
I am going inside.
Sue!
How your little brother, do this gardening.
Fine, stupid.
Hey, you will roll with us man, come on?
Come on ride with us.
- Chill with us.
You need somebody to protect you, man.
That's what your big cousins are for.
Look, dawg.
I've been there, I've done it and I've seen it.
Back in a day everybody wanted to beat me, dawg.
But now look, nobody wants to fuck with me.
Come on man, let's go.
- We are cousins right?
Come on.
- We are cousins right?
We are a family.
Look, I am brother to Spider, as he is brother to me.
Come on.
Take this shit off.
That's a woman's work man.
- Come get your hands dirty, man.
So what do I have to do?
Spider told that old boy next door had a bad ass whip.
Told you we got him.
Come on.
Nice.
- Ya, my little cousin being little man.
Yo, that's a nice car.
1972 Gran Torino, Fastback.
Cobra jet engine.
- Yo man it can still in mint condition.
Yo man, it's in mint condition man.
I've got one.
A Mexican, a Jew and a colored guy go into the bar.
The bartender looks up and says:
"Get the fuck out of here!"
So, here's where my flock congregates when they're not in church..
Hey Father J.
- Hey, Mel.
Hey, Darrel.
Hey father.
- Hi, Walt.
What brings you in here, father.
Meat raffle?
No, I just came down to talk Walt if that's ok.
Damn, padre.
You are persistent, aren't you?
I promised your wife.
All right, let's get booze.
I'll have Pabst and a shot of Jack.
And whatever he's having.
I'll have a Diet Coke.
- Bullshit.
This is a bar.
You have a drink.
I'll have a gin and tonic.
- Attaboy!
So, what you want?
I promised your wife I'd get you to go to confession.
Now, why would you do that?
- She was very insistent.
She made me.
Well you're kinda found of promising things you can't deliver on, right, father?
Let's talk about something else.
- What?
Life and death.
Life and death.
What the hell do you know about life and death?
I'd like to think I know a lot.
I'm a priest..
Yeah, you get up and preach about life and death.
But all what you know is what you learned in a priest school.
Right out of the rookie Preacher's Handbook
I don't know about that.
I think...
That is bittersweet.
Sort of bitter in its pain.
But sweet in its salvation.
That's what you know of life and death, and that's pathetic.
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?
I know a lot.
I lived there almost three years in Korea.
Thanks.
We shot men.
We stabbed them with bayonets, hacked seventeen-year-olds to death with shovels
Stuff I'll remember till the day I die.
Horrible things, but things I live with.
And what about life?
Well, I ...
I survived the war.
got married... and had a family.
Sounds like you know more about death than you do living.
Maybe so, father.
Maybe so.
Son of a bitch.
Hey, man, get in a car!
- Tao, what the fuck, get in!
Come on Tao.
- Come, let's go,man, get in!
Fuck man, get in!
Hello?
Morning, Dad, it's your number one son, Mitch.
Morning?
It's after one in the afternoon.
It's not morning.
Oh, right.
Afternoon, then.
So what do you want?
- What?
Me?
Nothing.
I mean, what would I want?
Well, I don't know.
Your wife has already gone through all of your mother's jewelry.
No, dad.
I was just calling to see how are you doing?
Well, anything new with the old neighborhood?
No.
- Great.
Smooth sailing then.
Yah.
- Ok, good, good, then.
Oh, hey, dead.
- Yeah.
You wouldn't happen to still know that guy from the plant who has Lion season tickets?
Dad?
Ain't she sweet?
Come on.
Hey, what's up?
What are you doing here, man?
- Nothing.
Minding our own business.
- Just hanging out.
What are you guys doing here?
What?
Can I just come here to hang with my little cousin?
We have good new for you.
- Really, and what's that?
Only for guy talk.
- I don't think so.
Why not?
- Come on, man, we are going to give you another shot.
Don't go, Tao.
- Mind your own business girl.
Come on, let's go
- Come.
What the hell is this?
Get up.
- Gåt off my lawn.
Listen old man, you don't want to fuck with me.
Did you hear me?
I said get off my lawn, now.
Are you fucking crazy?
Go back in a house.
Yeah, I'll blow the hole in your face and then I'll go in a house.
And I'll sleep like a baby You can count on that.
We used to stack fucks like you five feet high in Korea, used you for sandbags.
Ok.
You better watch your back...
Thank you.
Get off my lawn.
What the hell is this?
No, no, no, no more.
Stay right there.
Why can't you people just leave me alone?
We brought you some shallots to plant in the garden.
I don't want them.
They're perennials, they come back every year.
Look, why are bringing me all this garbage anyway.
Because
Because you saved, Tao.
I didn't save anybody.
I just.
I kept a bunch of jabbering gooks off of my lawn .
You are a hero to the neighborhood.
I am not a hero.
Too bad, they think you are and that's why they're keep bringing you the gifts.
Please take them.
- All they are wrong.
I just want to be left alone, thank you.
- Wait!
This is my mom, Vu, I'm Sue and that's my brother, Tao.
We live next door.
- So?
Tao wants to say something.
I am sorry.
- Sorry for what?
For trying to steal your car.
Let me tell you something boy.
You step on this property again, you are done...
Good afternoon, Walt.
I told you I'm not going to confession..
- Why didn't you just call the police?
What?
I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I heard there was some trouble in the neighborhood.
Why didn't call the police?
Well ...
You know why, I've prayed that they would show up, but..
.. nobody answered.
- What were you thinking?
Someone could have been killed.
We're talking life and death here.
When things go wrong, you gotta act quickly.
When we were in Korea and a thousand screaming gooks came across our land..
... we didn't call the police.
We reacted.
- We are not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski,
I've been thinking about our conversation on life and death.
About what you said.
About how you carry around all the horrible things you were forced to do
Horrible things that won't leave you.
It seems that it would do you good to unload some of that burden.
Things done during war are terrible.
being ordered to kill ... killing to save yourself, killing to save others.
You're right, those are things I know nothing about.
But I do know about forgiveness.
And I've seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins, admitted their guilt and left their burdens behind them.
Stronger men than you!
Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things... and are now at peace.
Well I got to hand it to you, padre, You came here with your guns loaded this time.
Thank you!
- And you're right about one thing.
About stronger men than me, reaching their salvation.
Well, Hallefuckinlujah.
- But you are wrong about something else.
- What's that, Mr. Kowalski?
The thing that haunts a man the most is what he isn't ordered to do.
There, finally, you look like a human being again. .
You shouldn't wait so long between haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch.
Well I am surprised you are still around.
I was always hoping that you die off and they get somebody in here they knew what the hell they are doing.
Instead you just keep hanging around, like the dump wop dago you are.
- That'll be ten dollars, Walt.
- Ten bucks, Jesus Christ, Martin.
What are you half-Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices all the time.
It's been ten bucks for the last five years and you hard-mellows, Pollack son of a bitch.
Keep the change.
- See you in three weeks, prick.
Not if I see you first, dipshit.
That's cool, you know.
Look at this.
You tight ass over here.
Come here girl.
You can't say hi?
Or are you acting like stuck-up and shit.
What are you supposed to be man?
- Yo, it's cool dog.
The fuck are you doing in my neighborhood, boy?
None, Just going to the corner spot, you know get some CDs, sound good, bro?
He called, you bro!
- Come on sound good, bro?
Sound good.

Yeah, motherfucker.
- Now what the fuck you come down here for?
You here to bring this little present?
Oriental yummy?
Don't worry, I'll take a real good care with her.
Fuck out of here, .
- Fuck out of here, man!
Oh shit, you have a bitch with you.
Keep your ass right here.
Oh great.
Another asshole who has a fetish for Asian girls.
God, it gets so old.
Oh, shit, what's your name girl?
My name?
Get your ass out of here, okay.
It's 'take your crude, overly obvious come-on to every woman who walks past and cram it.'
That's my name.
Who do you think you are talking to?
Who does it look like?
Man she's tough.
- What?
You gonna hit me now?
That'd pretty much complete the picture.
You need to keep your bitch on a leash.
Put a choke chain on her and yank that motherfucker.
Oh, of course, right to the stereotype thesaurus
- Oh yeah
Call me a whore and a bitch in the same sentence.
-Bitch is crazy.
I like her like that
- Now take that bitch.
You don't know when to quit do you, girl?
- Let me teach you a lesson
Stop!
Let me go!
Take your ass over there.
What the fuck are you looking at old man?
What the hell are you spooks up to?
Spooks?
You'd better get your ass on honkey, while I still let you.
That's you'd better do.
What the fuck he thinks he is?
Have you noticed how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't fucking with?
That's me.
You are fucking crazy, get out of here, man.
Why don't you get your ass out of here before we kicked your wrinkly white ass.
What's wrong with him man?
The motherfucker's crazy!
-What is this thing?
What the hell?
Get in a truck.
Crazy motherfucker.
- What's wrong with him, man.
Hey pops come on now.
- Shut your fucking face!
You don't fucking listen, do you?
Now get in a truck.
- Go get in a truck girl.
Let her go, old man!
Shut up pussy.
What is this 'bro' shit anyway?
You want to be superb page, or something
These guy don't want to be your bro and I don't blame them.
Now get your old faint paddy ass on down the road.
Take care now.
You too.
Oh, yeah.
Why didn't you do nothing?
Man you fucking!
Shit man.
If he had cannon at your fucking face, you would do nothing.
What's the matter with you, for Christ sake?
Trying to get yourself killed?
I thought you Asian girls were supposed to be smart.
Hanging around in the neighborhood like that is the fast way to get you in the obituaries.
I know, I know.
Take it easy.
And what about that goofball guy you were with.
Is that a date or something?
Yeah, kind of.
His name is Trey.
- You should be hanging out with them.
You should be hanging out with your own people.
The other Hummongs.
- You mean, Hmong?
Hmong, not Hummong
- Whatever.
What the hell is Hmong, I mean Mong anyway?
Wow, you so enlighten you know that?
No, Hmong is not a place, it is a people.
My people come from different parts of Laos, Thailand and China.
Well how you ended up in my neighborhood?
Why didn't you stay there?
It's Vietnam thing.
We thought on your side And when American quit the communists started killing all the Hmong.
So we came over here.
Yeah, well I don't know how you ended up in Midwest.
Snow on the ground six months in the year.
What is it?
Jungle people wanted to be on great frozen tundra?
Hill people.
We are hill people.
Not jungle people.
BOO-ga, ga-Boo, BOO-ga!
Yeah, whatever ...
Blame the Lutherans.
They brought us up here.
Everybody blames the Lutherans.
Well, you'd think the cold will keep all the idiots out.
Thanks for the ride.
You know something kid, you are all right.
But what about that dimwit brother of yours?
He is little slow or something?
Tao is actually really smart.
He just doesn't know what direction to go in.
Poor toad.
- It is really common.
Hmong girls over here fit in better.
The girls go to college and the boys go to jail.
That old hag hates my ass.
Your birthday today, Daisy.
This year you have to make a choice between two life paths.
Second chances come your way.
Extraordinary events culminate in what might seem to be an anticlimax.
You lucky numbers are: 84, 23, 11, 78 and 99.
What a load of shit.
Yea.
What the hell is it with kids nowadays?
All right.
Let me help you with those.
- Oh, thank you.
How about that?
How about that, Daisy?
It's too heavy for a bag.
- No problem.
Good, Karen, give it to him.
-Here you go.
Well, what is it?
-It's a Gopher.
So you can reach stuff.
It makes things a lot of easier.
This is from me.
It's a phone.
Oh, I can see that.
I just thought...well, we thought that it would make things easier.
Thank you, Karen.
There's nothing wrong with making things less hard on yourself.
You know Karen's right, Dad.
You've worked hard your whole life.
Maybe it's time you start thinking about taking it a easier?
And some other thing, Dad.
You really should get rid of the coffin nails.
We were thinking about the house.
You know, when Mom's gone, it's got to be a lot to maintain around here.
Let alone clean.
And you are here all alone ...
Yeah, you know, there's these great places now, you know, these communities
Where you don't have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow.
You know, People who are like you, active and alert, but are alone.
And would benefit from being around folks their own age.
Yeah Dad, look.
You got to check it out.
We brought some brochures.
These places are nothing like that you think they would be.
They are great.
- No, they are beautiful.
They are really nice They really are.
These are top-notch like resorts.
It is like staying in a hotel, practically.
- They're beautiful.
They really are.
- Yeah.
They care of everything.
They clean up.
They're really nice.
Oh, there are wonderful stores, where you can buy new shoes.
They are amazing, they really are.
You have a good time, play some golf maybe.
Meet other people.
Son of a bitch.
Kicked us out on his birthday.
I've told you that was a bad idea.
I know, you were right
- He won't let anybody help him.
Well, we tried.
Now can we just drop it?
No one can say we didn't try
What the hell with him, we shouldn't have done it.
We should've stayed home with Josh and Ashley.
At least they were smart enough to not come here.
The goddamn kids have more sense than we do.
We miss mom, don't we Daisy?
Hey, Walt.
What are you up to?
We're having a barbecue.
You want to come over?
What do you think?
- There's tons of food.
Just keep you hands off my dog.
-No worries.
We only eat cats.
Really?
- No I am kidding, you moron.
Come on you can be my special guest.
-No, I am fine right here.
Yeah ...
Son of a bitch.
- Okay, so, what have you had to eat today?
I had a piece of cake.
And a little beef jerky.
Come on over and get something to eat.
We've got beer too.
Well ...
I might as well drink with strangers better than drinking alone.
It is my birthday.
Really.
Happy birthday Wally
- Don't call me Wally.
You have no Pabts among the beer.
- As they say, "when in Hmong."
What am I doing wrong?
Every time I look at somebody they always look at the ground.
What is she saying?
- She said welcome to our home.
Oh no, she is not.
- Yes, she didn't.
She hates me.
Yeah, she hates you.
Okay.
What?
!
What are all you fish heads looking at anyway?
I think we should go to other room.
Sorry.
All the people in this house are very traditional.
Number 1.
Never touch a Hmong person on the head, not even a child..
Hmong-people believe that the soul resides on the head.
So, don't do that.
- Sounds dumb, but fine.
And a lot of Hmong people consider looking at someone eye to be very rude.
That's why they look away, when you look at them.
- Anything else?
Yeah, some Hmong people tend to smile or grin when they're yelled at.
It's a cultural thing.
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity, it's not that they're laughing at you, really.
You people are nuts
But the food..
It looks good, smells good too.
-Of course, its Hmong food.
Okay, and I come back in few seconds.
Here you go.
- Thanks.
You mentioned about..
looking at people, he's been staring at me the whole evening.
That's Kor Khue.
He is the Lor's family shaman.
What's that some sort of witch doctor or something.
- Something like that.
Boeki Boo.
- You're funny, Wally.
Kor Khue's interested in you.
He heard what you did.
He would like to read you.
It would be rude not allow him this.
It's a great honor.
Yeah sure.
It's fine by me.
- All right, take a seat.
He says people do not respect you.
They don't even want to look at you.
He says the way you live, your food has no flavor.
You wearied by your life.
You made a mistake.
And you past life is like a mistake what you did.
You are not satisfied with.
He says, you have no happiness in your life.
It's like you are not at peace.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I am fine.
Fine, I am fine.
God, I've got more in common with these gooks than I have with my own spoiled-rotten family.
Jesus Christ ...
Happy Birthday.
Are you ok?
Yeah, I am fine.
You were bleeding.
- No, I bit my tongue.
It's nothing.
Why don't we get down and get some of that good gook food.
I am starving.
Okay.
You ladies are wonderful.
That stuff is really good.
Come on you glutton!
- What's up?
Let's go.
- What for?
To mingle.
- We can mingle right here.
No.
You told me not to leave you alone.
Thank you very much.
I have to go now.
I'll be back.
Don't let me go right of it .
Well, well, look he is over there.
- Yeah, the kid who steal my Gran Torino.
My brother Tao.
- Tried to anyway, yeah, toad.
It was wobby a bit.
But it should fix it.
What's this?
Little rice liquor Here, try it.
All right.
My friends and I were just wondering what you're doing here?
That's a good question.
What am I doing here?
My name is Walt.
- Hey, Walt.
I am Wa Xam.
Wa Yum?
- No Wa Xam.
Wa Xam, Ok.
- So what do you do?
I fix things.
Stuff like that.
- Like what?
I've just fixed that dryer over there.
I fixed my wife's friend sink.
I took old aunt Merry to doctor to get a prescription.
Fixed up.
I've even the fixed the door, what had't even broken yet.
You're funny
I've been called a lot of things, but never funny.
Well, I have to take off.
Enjoy yourself.
- Okay, Yum Yum.
Later.
Come on.
Relax, zipper headed.
I am not gonna shoot you.
I'd look down too if I was you.
You know, I knew you were a dipshit the first time I ever saw you.
You're worse with women than you are with stealing cars, Toad.
It's Tao.
- What?
It's not toad, it's Tao.
My name is Tao.
You were blowing it with that girl who was there.
Not that I give two shits about a Toad like you.
You don't what you are talking about.
You are wrong egg roll.
I know exactly what I am talking about.
I may not be the most pleasant person to be around.
But I got the best woman who was ever on this planet to marry me.
I had to work at it.
That was the best thing that ever happened to me.
Hangs down.
But you ... you know
You let Click Clack, Ding Dong and Charlie Chan just walk out with what's-her-face.
She likes you, you know.
I don't know why.
Who?
Yum yum!
You know that girl in the purple sweater.
She's been looking at you all day, stupid.
Do you mean, Wa Xam?
- Yeah, Yum Yum.Yeah.
Nice girl, very charming girl.
I talked with her.
But you let her just walk right out.
With the three stooges.
And you know why?
Cause you are big, fat pussy.
Well ...
I gotta go.
Good day.
Puss cake.
No, no more.
Okay, put them over there.
No.
No.
No more No more.
No more.
No more, please ...
Is that chicken dumpling thing you brought before?
Alright.
Better than beef jerky all the time.
What's going on?
What's going on?
-Tao is here to make amends.
He is here to work for you.
-No, he isn't.
He's not gonna work for me.
My mom said dishonored the family.
And now he has to work off his dept.
He starts tomorrow morning.
- Oh not tomorrow, not any time.
I don't even want him on my property I thought we went over all that.
It is very important to my mom that you accept.
And that would be an insult if you refuse.
Why is it being put back on me, all of this?
He is the one who tried to steal my car ... all of the sudden I am a bad guy in this thing.
Look my family is very traditional and would be very much upset if you don't let Tao repay.
If you doesn't want to do it, then let's just go.
Shut up!
Yeah, shut up.
All right, tomorrow, tomorrow.
Thank you.
Jesus, Joseph and Mary.
These Hmong broads are like badgers.
Son of a bitch.
I never thought he'd show.
All right, what are you good at?
Like what?
- That's what I am asking.
You gonna work for me, I gotta know what you are good at.
I gotta know what you can do.
- I don't know.
That's kind of half way what I expected you to say.
See that tree right there?
You just go over there and count the birds.
You want me to count the birds?
- Yeah, you can count?
All you slopes are supposed to be good at math, right?
Yeah, I can count.
- Good.
One, two ...
So, what do you have for me to do?
You want me to watch paint dry or maybe count the clouds that pass by?
Don't get flip with me, boy.
I am not the one who is trying to steal, don't you forget that.
Go ahead.
I don't care if you insult me and say racist things.
Cause you know what?
I'll take it.
- Of cause you'll take it.
Cause you have no teeth, you have no balls, kid.
Look, I am stuck here.
Why don't you find something useful for me to do.
Unlike you, I am not useless.
And I maintain my own property.
These swamp rats, on the other hand, you just can help it.
How long do I have you for?
Toad, how long?
Till next Friday.
All right.
Go get the ladder out of the garage.
When you got finished with that roof there.
You can take that gutter, and nail it back up.
I am tired looking at it for the last three years.
Yeah, you said it, brother.
Hello.
Grandpa says he want to know if you can have Tao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch?
Wasp nest?
That's terrible.
I think we can handle that after the lunch.
Lord All Mighty, knock it off.
It's my last day.
What else do have for me do?
Take a day-off.
You did enough.
Toad!
Nothing.
Nevermind.
Kowski?
Kowski?
Kowski?
Mr. Kowalski?
Good morning.
I looked over your paperwork and I think we should immediately start a full battery of tests
I feel that this would be the best way to go about checking all the issues that you've had.
Excuse me, what happened to Dr.Felmon, my regular doctor?
Dr. Felmon retired three years ago.
I am his replacement Dr. Chang.
It's grandpa Walt.
- Pick it up.
You talk to him!
Mitch.
I'm doing bills here.
- You talk to him, he is yours father.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Mitch.
It's me your dad.
Yeah, I know.
What's up?
Oh, nothing, nothing much really.
How is everything going?
I am fine, fine.
How about Karen and the kids?
Fine, everybody is great.
Doing fine.
Good.
How about work?
Busy.
Yeah, I suppose...
In fact, um, speaking of busy.
I got a lot on my plate right now, so if it is not something pressing.
No, not it all.
Why don't you call me this weekend?
Sure.
Ok, It was nice talking to you.
Thanks for talk.
Thanks.
This kid doesn't have a chance.
What do you know about faucets?
I know a lot about them, boy.
Tender side.
Jesus.
For the love of Pete.
- What?
It must be a hundred degrees here.
Just, turn on the fan.
This place is wobbling apart.
Where did you get all the stuff?
What are you talking about?
- All the tools and stuff.
Well, may come as surprise to a thief, but I bought this stuff.
Everything in here with my own money.
Yeah, yeah.
This is not what I meant.
I mean this is so much shit packed in here.
Yeah, well.
Every tool in here has a purpose.
Everything has a job to do.
They are all used when necessary.
- Okay, so, what is that?
it is a post hole digger.
- That
Vice-grips.
Wire cutters, you know that's a trowel.
There is shears right there, and that's a saw.
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me kid.
Alright, what's on your mind.
It's just..
I can't afford to buy all this stuff.
Well, I guess, even a bonehead like you, could understand... that a man acquires it over the period of 50 years.
Yeah, but...
All right, look, here.
These three items right here, you can have this.
WD-40, vice grips and some duck tape.
Any man who is worth his salt, can do half of the house chores with just those three things.
Anything else you need you just borrow it, that's all.
Ok, cool.
Fuck me.
- What's with that?
Nothing.
What?
Nothing, huh?
I just saw you've coughed out blood.
That's not good.
You should really see a doctor.
Look..
Those guys over here, the other night ... on my lawn, what a bout them?
- Just a gang.
A bunch of Hmong gang bangers.
I assume that.
What they were doing here?
They were going to take me away.
They were kind of pissed, that I blew my first initiation.
Yeah, well you are, you are a pussy.
You wanna hang out with guys like that.
What was your initiation supposed to be?
My Gran Torino?
Toad, you got a minute?
Here it is.
Here is the deal.
I take the top, cause that's the heaviest.
I'll pull on that.
And you stand right back here, and you push.
And help me push it up each step.
like that.
- Then, let me take the top.
No, no, I've got a top.
No, I'll take the top.
It looks pretty heavy.
Look I am not crippled.
I've got the top.
If you don't let me take the top.
I ain't helping.
I will go back home.
Listen to me, zipper head.
No, you listen, old man!
I am here because you need help.
So it is either top of I am out of here.
All right, you take the top and I'll push.
Don't let it slip off you little girl hands and crush me.
Don't give me any ideas.
That thing weighs a ton.
Runs like a clock.
They don't make them like this anymore.
So what are you going to do with it?
- Sell it I guess.
How much?
- 60 bucks.
I am tired of having this sit around down in the basement there.
Why?
You are looking for a freezer?
Our downstairs one kind of died.
- Okay, 25 bucks and it's yours.
25?
You've just said 60.
I know, it will save me money putting an ad in the paper.
Come on, let haul it over your place.
Kind of ironic, huh?
- What?
Toad washing a car they tried to steal from you.
Yeah, he misses one spot.
He is doing it all over again too.
It is nice of you to kind look after him like this.
He doesn't have any real role models in his life.
Well, I am not a role model.
But you are a good man, Wally.
I wish our father would have been more like you.
Don't go calling me Wally.
No, I am serious.
He was really hard on us.
Really traditional... and really old school.
Well, I am old school.
yeah, but you an American.
What's that supposed to me?
You like him, don't you?
- Are you kidding?
He tried to steal my car.
And you spend time with him, teaching him how to fix things.
Saved him from a fucked cousin of ours...
- Hey, what you language lady.
And you're a good man
- I am not a good man.
Give me another beer, dragon lady.
This one is empty.
You know, Hmong consider gardening to be a woman's work.
Yeah, that probably why I see in the garden over there all the time.
Besides we ain't in Hu-Mong.
- Funny.
You know you should quit.
That's bad for you.
Yeah?
So it is being in a gang, dipshit.
Didn't you hear what I've just said?
I saw you coughed out blood.
You should quit.
What's that emblem supposed to mean anyway?
Your ancient camp scout emblem?
1'st cavalry.
I've had it since 1951.
So what you wanna do with you life kid.
I was thinking maybe sales.
So you wanna be in sales?
What about going to school, maybe.
But school costs money.
Maybe you should get a job.
You can't just sit there and spread mulch in my garden for the rest of your life.
Maybe you can just pay me.
Yeah, very funny.
What kind of job could I ever get?
- Yeah you're right, nobody would ever hire you.
Look I am just kidding zip...
I mean.
You can get a job.
You can get a job everywhere.
Like what?
How about construction?
- Me?
Yeah.
- Construction?
Yeah.
- Do you have Alzheimer's or something?
.
No, get a job in the construction.
I know people in the trades.
Of course I have to make a little adjustment and man you up a little bit.
Man me up?
- Yeah.
And I think you ought to date Miss Yum Yum too.
Do you little good.
Get carbon off the vaults.
Now you just gonna learn, how guys talk.
You just listen the way Martin and I banter back and forth.
You okay?
You are ready?
- Sure.
Let's go in.
Perfect.
A pollack and a chink.
How are you doing, Martin, you crazy Italian prick.
Walt, you cheap bastard, I should have known you'd come in,
I was having such a pleasant day
- What did you do?
Jew some poor blind guy out of his money.
Giving him a wrong change?
- Who's the nip?
He is a pussy kid from next door.
I am just trying to man him up a little bit.
You see kid?
That's how guys talk to one another .
They do?
-Do you have shit in your ears?
Now go out and come back in and talk to him like a man.
Like a real man.
Come on.
Get your ass out of here.
Come on back now.
Sorry about this.
That's ok.
What's up you old Italian prick?
Get out of my shop before I blow your head off you goddamn dick smoker.
Jesus Christ.
Shit.
Take it easy.
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
That's what you said.
That what you said men say.
You don't just come in and insult a man in his own shop.
What happens if you meet some stranger?
If you get the wrong one he's gonna blow you gook head right off.
What should I've said then?
- Why don't you start with Hi or Hello.
Yeah just come in and say: 'Sir, I'd like a haircut if you have a time'
Yeah, be polite but don't kiss ass.
In fact you can talk about the construction job you just came from.
And bitch about your girl friend in your car.
Son of a bitch, I've just got breaks fixed and those sons of the bitches really nailed me.
They screwed right in the ass.
Yeah, don't swear at the guy.
Just talk about people who are not in the room.
You can bitch about your boss making you work overtime when it is bowling night.
Right, my old lady bitches for two goddamn hours about how..
they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store.
and the minute I turn on a fucking game she starts crying we never talk.
See now go out, come back and talk to him.
And it ain't a rocket science for Christ sake.
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car, or a girlfriend.
Jesus, I should have blown his head off when I had a chance.
Maybe so, I want you to turn around and go outside and come back and don't talk about having no job, no car, no girlfriend, no future, no dick.
Ok, just turn around and go.
Excuse me sir, I need a hair cut if you ain't too busy.
You old Italian son of a bitch prick barber.
Boy, does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job.
Fuck me.
All set to go through with this, right?
- Yeah, yeah.
Don't yeah, yeah me.
Just say:
Yes sir and I'll do my best.
Yes, I'll do my best.
- Cause when I vouch for somebody that means I am give them my word.
I don't want you making me look bad.
No I am good.
Totally into this.
Don't lay down either.
Just look em straight in the eye.
And a man can tell a lot by your handshake.
Here, put those in your back pocket.
- Cool.
Don't blow this.
Hey, Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon.
How the hell are you?
I am shitty.
But who's gonna listen?
- Not me, that's for sure.
Help yourself there, Walt.
You dumb pollack.
Ok this is the kid, I was telling you about.
Tao, this is Tim Kennedy, he is super on this job.
What we got here, Walt?
Well he knows construction and he is a smart kid.
He'll do anything you need him for.
You sure?
- Yeah.
You speak English?
- Yes, sir.
Were you born here?
- You bet.
I see that Walt drove you here.
You got a vehicle?
Not at the moment.
Taking a bus for now.
- Bus?
Jesus Christ.
You don't have a car?
My head gasket cracked and the goddamned pricks at the shop wants to bend me over for $2100
Oh please.
I just replaced the tranny in my Tahoe and the sons a bitches fucked me hard, just under $3200.
Goddamned thieves.
It ain't right.
- You got that right.
Come on in on Monday and we'll find something for you to do.
Thanks, Mr. Kennedy.
That's Tim, and what's you name again?
- Tao.
T. .., okay.
You owe me one, Walt.
Well I'll buy a fruit cake for Christmas.
Fuck a fruit cake.
How about you just hand over the keys to that Gran Torino.
What the hell does everybody want my car?
- Yeah, I am not surprised.
Yeah, you don't know a half of it.
Alright, come on, zipper head.
Let the Mick stay here and play with himself.
What are we doing?
What do you want to do?
Carry you tools in a rice bag?
Here.
You can use one of these ... and you'll need one of this here.
I can't afford any of this.
I'll cover it.
You can pay me back with your first pay check.
Cool
- Here, we need something like that.
This is what I am looking for here, tool belt.
There you go.
Not to bitch.
But won't I be needing some tools.
Tools I've got but I am not going to lend you my tool belt.
You can pick up tools as you go.
I really appreciate all this.
- Forget it.
No, I really do Thank you.
What's up homeboy, what are you doing?
What up man?
- What you got, punk?
Checking up on my little cousin.
- Yeah, man.
My little cousin ...
What's this?
Where you come from man?
- I am coming
Home from work I know you guys don't know much about that.
So that's true, you got a job.
- You can't just leave me alone?
What?
He is scared, huh?
Who bought this shit for you?
Your dad?
- What you guys want with me?
Your dad bought this shit for you?
- Keep your hands off my stuff.
What's the fuck is that shit?
- What the fuck, you make me look bad?

This massive my job man.
Give me that, that.
- Hey come on, this is my stuff.
You wanna smoke man?
Fuck it.
Let me go.
Give me that, man.
Give me that.
What's the phrase I am looking for?
Oh yeah, 'saving face'
Hey, there.
Hey.
I gotta run.
Haven't seen you for a few days.
Where you've been?
Been busy.
Busy, huh?
What the hell happened to you?
- Don't worry about it.
What do you mean don't worry about it.
Look at your goddamn face.
I said don't worry about it.
Okay, it's not your problem.
When?
Grabbed me a couple of days ago right after I go off work.
Cowards.
I did everything I can possibly do.
But they broke some of your tools.
I will replace them.
Don't worry about the tools.
Where is your cousin lives?
No, Walt.
I'll be ok.
I don't want you to do anything.
- Right,.
You could need extra tools, you just let me know.
Well, I could use a roofing hammer.
-Good, go in my garage and get it.
This should be the last stop.
Here is the deal.
You stay away from Tao, understand?
You tell your friends to stay away from Tao.
You want to fight with us than I could sound don't want to see him anymore.
That's it, got it?
I'll take that as yes.
Cause if I have to come back here it is gonna get fucking ugly.
Get off of my way.
How do you want your dog?
I mean steak?
Funny.
I told you we only eat cats.
I've never seen you like this before.
Well I am feeling good.
I god beautiful women, great food.
And Tao.
And even Tao isn't bugging me.
You are having a good time, I see.
-Yeah.
And it never ends.
What happened to your knuckles anyways?
I slipped in a shower.
No big problem.
Look Yum-Yum if he doesn't ask you out I will ask you out.
Wa Xam, don't listen to him.
He is a white devil.
Yeah, I am.
I am a white devil.
I've loved to Walt, but he beat you to it.
Really?
No kidding!
Dinner and a movie, or what?
Yeah, they are taking a bus.
No, you can't take a bus.
You gonna get you something more stylish that that.
Like what?
Take a limo?
How about that?
The Gran Torino?
- Yeah.
You'd let me take the Gran Torino.
- Yeah, I let you take the Gran Torino.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Is everybody all right?
Tao!
It's all right.
Where's grandma?
Where is Sue?
Where is Sue?
- She went to our aunts.
To her aunts?
Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Get on the phone and call her right now.
Sue ...
I knew, this was gonna happen.
What the hell am I doing here?
Maybe some of her friends called her and she changed her plans.
Yeah.
At the war we just all of us lost a lot of friends but you gotta stand for it.
You can care to it.
Mr. Kowalski?
Are you Ok?
Yeah, I am Ok.
Police finally left, no one is talking.
One thing about Hmong, they keep their mouths shut.
Yeah, I've noticed that.
You know, Tao and Sue will never gonna find peace in this world as long as those gangs around.
Until they go away.
You know forever.
What are you saying?
You know what I am saying.
I took Sue to the hospital.
She is scared.
They are all scared..
Yeah
Tao especially.
He's sitting out there right now staring at your front door.
You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.
What would you do?
What should Tao do?
I know what I would do if I was you.
Or at least what you think you should do.
- Really
If I was Tao I guess I'd wanted vengeance.
I'd wanted to stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys.
And you?
- What would I do?
I'd come over here and talk to you I guess.
I know you are close with these people, but this pisses me off too.
Mr.Kowalski.
Wanna beer?
- I'd love one.
There some in the chest, right over there behind you.
Damn all this.
It just isn't fair.
- Nothing is fair, father.
So what you gonna do, Mr. Kowalski?
Call me Walt.
All right.
What you gonna do, Walt?
I don't know.
But I'll think of something.
Whatever it is, they won't have a chance.
What are you doing?
Thinking.
Thinking.
Thinking time is over.
Now it's time to knock shit out of these pricks.
I know you don't want to hear this, but now it's the time to stay calm.
Calm?
You want me to be calm?
We stay calm or else mistakes will get made.
We have to step back from this thing.
No, don't let me down Walt.
Not you.
This is gonna end today.
Sit down.
I don't want to sit.
I said sit down.
Now, listen to me.
We gotta plan this and plan it very carefully.
Can't make any mistakes.
You know I am the right man for this job.
I want to go home and stay calm, and come back here at 4 this afternoon.
And this to be done will be done.
I say we go now, Right now.
And what?
Kill that cousin of yours and the rest of those zips.
Mr. Tough Guy is out for blood all of the sudden.
I know nothing about it.
Now go home.
You stay calm come back here at 4.
Ok?
Okay.
I know, I know.
Give me a break, please, it's the first time I've ever smoked in the house.
Let a man enjoy himself,would you girl.
All finished. 10 dollars American.
I don't suppose your guinea hands are steady enough to do a straight shave?
- Straight shave?
You've never asked about straight shave ever.
I know but I always wondered about it.
That's unless you are too busy.
No, just let me heat up a towel.
Here is 20.
Keep the change.
It is just in case you hit my jugular.
Yes sir, It gonna take about one hour.
We gonna shorten these sleeves little bit.
Gonna fix at the shoulder.
I never had a suited suit before.
Yes sir, look very good.
Yes, sir.
Look very good.
What can I do for you, Mr. Kowalski?
- I am here for a confession.
Lord Jesus, what have you done?
- Nothing you just take it easy now.
What are you up to?
Are you gonna give a confession or not?
How long has it been since your last confession?
Forever.
Bless me father, for I have sinned.
What are your sins, my son?
In 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski at the factory Christmas party.
Dorothy was in the other room with the other wives.
it just happened.
Yes, go on.
Well, I made 900 dollars profit selling a boat and motor.
I didn't pay the taxes it is the same as stealing.
Yes, fine.
Lastly...
I was never very close with my two sons.
I don't know them.
I didn't know how.
That's it?
- That's it.
It's bothered me most of my life.
Say 10 "Hail Maries" and 5 "Our fathers".
God loves and forgives you and absolves you of all your sins.
In the name of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.
Thank you padre.
Are you going to retaliate for what happened to Sue.
I'm going over to that house today, Mr. Kowalski.
Is that so?
- It is.
And every other day until you see the folly of what you are planning.
Busy day, gotta go.
- Go in peace.
Oh I am at peace.
Jesus Christ.
So which one is mine?
You ever fired a weapon before?
- No
Why don't you put that one down.
I got something more to show you.
What?
In 1952 we were sent to take out a chink machine gun nest.
They trod us up pretty good.
I was the only one who came back out there.
For that they gave me a silver star.
Here it is.
Here I want you to have it.
Why?
Because we all knew the danger that night.
But we went anyway.
That's the way it might be tonight.
There is always a chance you don't come back.
The hell we won't.
We're will roll in there and tear ass.
Yeah, that's foolish.
That's the exact reaction they are waiting for.
Come on and close this up.
How many?
- How many what?
How many men did you kill in Korea?
13, maybe more.
-What was it like to kill a man.
You don't want to know.
Now close it up.
Walt!
Walt!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Relax, you can't get out of there.
You let me out right now !
Let me out.
You fuck let me out, I'll fucking kill you.
Shut the fuck up!
You want to know what is like to kill a man?
Well, that's goddamn awful.
The only thing worse is get a medal of valor for killing some poor kids..
that wanted just to give up that's all
Yeah, some scared little gook just like you.
I shot them right in a face with that rifle you were holding in there a while ago.
So if the day goes by that I don't think about it.
You don't that on your soul.
I got blood on my hands.
I am soiled.
That's why I am going alone tonight.
Walt you take me with you right now, let me out.
Look, you've come a long way.
I am proud to say that you are my friend.
But you got your whole life ahead of you.
But me, I finished things.
That's what I do and I am going alone.
No, wait.
Walt!
Walt!
I need you to watch my dog.
Yeah I love you too.
Yeah, she is old too.
Her name is Daisy.
Hello.
- It is Walt.
The keys to my house are under the ceramic turtle on the from porch.
Let yourself in.
Your brother is in the basement.
I gotta go.
Sorry father, we have to go.
I am telling if we are not here there will be a bloodshed.
We've been here for hours.
We can't afford to anchor a unit down to one location.
I am bagging you to stay.
Just got a word from my sergeant, we're pulling the plug.
I am staying.
No you aren't.
We have specific orders you came with us, you are leaving with us.
Watch your head.
Sue, over here, over here.
Unlock this right now.
He left without me.
He went to Smokie without me.
Tao!
Any swamp rats in there.
I didn't know your ass would came.
-Shut up, gook.
I have nothing to say to you, shrimp dick, lizard like you.
Yeah, yeah.
You go ahead watch out for your boyfriend.
Cause it was either he or you or something who raped one of their own family.
You own blood, for Christ sake.
Now go ahead and pull those pistols, like miniature cowboys.
Go ahead.
So where's Tao at?
That pussy motherfucker not gonna come.
Don't worry about Tao.
Tao's got not one second for you.
Says who?
You?
What the fuck you gonna do, old man?
What are you gonna do?
You bitch.
-
Kind of jumpy, aren't we?
- Shut the fuck up.
You should the fuck up!
Got a light?
- What the fuck?
No
Me..
I've got a light...
'Hail Mary, full of grace..'
Yes, sergeant.
What happened?
- You need to step back.
He is a friend of mine.
- He said step back.
Hey, did you hear him.
Step back.
What happened?
- Hey, step back.
He is my friend.
Officer Chang!
get those people back.
- Hey, step back now, Ok.
Get the fuck out of here!
Walt Kowalski once said to me that I didn't know anything about life or death.
Because I was an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who held the hands of superstitious old women and promised they eternity.
Walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it.
But he was right.
I knew really nothing about life or death, until I got to know Walt.
And boy did I learn.
And I want to leave my house to the church becouse Dorothy would've liked it now which brings to out last item .
And again please excuse the language.
in Mr. Kowalski's will, I'm simply reading it as it was written.
And I'd like to leave my 1972 Gran Torino to ... my friend ...
Tao Vang Lor.
Under the condition that you don't choptop top the roof like one of those beaners don'tpaintanyidioticflameson it like some white-trash hillbilly anddon'tputabiggayspoileron the rear end like you see on all the other zipper heads' cars
It just looks like hell
If you If you can refrain from doing any of that, it's yours
The English subtitles were made by Ilya-42 (also my Skype name)
God, I am sorry for Dorothy, Walt.
She was a real peach.
Thanks for coming, Al.
Spectacles, testicles, wallet and watch.
Look at the Old Man glaring at Ashley.
He can't even tone it down at Mom's funeral?
What do you expect?
Dad's still living in the '50s.
He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly.
Yeah, well your kid's wearing a Timberwolves jersey.
I'm sure Dad appreciates that.
The point I am trying to make is that there's nothing anyone can do that won't disappoint the Old Man.
It's inevitable.
That's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings.
the deal with the boat motor, the broken bird bath,
It's always something.
What are we going to do with him?
Don't you think he'll get in trouble over there all by himself in the old neighborhood?
Why don't you have him move in with you?
Death is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics.
Bitter in the pain.
Sweet in the salvation.
Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased.
... and their families
Sweet to those who know the salvation that awaits.
And some may ask, what is death?
Is it the end?
Or is it the beginning?
And what is life?
What is this thing we call life?
All these questions can frustrate you at times like this.
And that's why you have to turn to the Lord.
- Jesus ...
Because the Lord is the sweetness.
Is that dad?
- No, that's grandpa Walt.
There is a platoon, E-Company, March 2, 1952.
Korea?
- Where's Korea?
Well, people showed up after the service, huh?
Yeah, well, I suppose they heard there'd be a lot of ham.
I'll go down the basement and get some chairs.
Oh, I can do that, Dad..
- No, we need them now not next week.
Cool, I found a medal.
Look at this.
How much longer do we have to stay?
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell and I'm bored.
Ashley, honey.
Why don't you help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?
Me?
- Yes, you.
Grandpa Walt, would you like some help with these four chairs.
No, you probably just painted your nails.
Your dad is driving me crazy.
Why didn't you guys make him a hint we're leaving soon?
Come on, let's go.
Jesus Christ, how many swamp rats can get in one room?
Grandpa, when'd you get the vintage car?
1972.
I never knew you had a cool old car.
Yeah, it's been here since before you were born.
So, what are you going do with it when you like... die?
Then what about that super cool retro couch that you have in the den
Cause I was thinking I'm going to State next year, and I think it would look really good in my dorm room.
And I don't have any furniture at all.
God.
Who are you?
- Hi, I am Tao.
- What do you want?
I live next door.
- Come on, get the shit out of your mouth.
I am ...
- Tell me what you want.
Do you have jumper cables?
My uncle's car is old and.....
- No we don't any jumper cables .
And have some respect, zipper head, we're mourning here..
How you holding up, Walt?
Mr. Kowalski.
Huh?
- Mr. Kowalski, that's my name.
Right, Mr. Kowalski.
Your wife and I became quite close these last few months.
She asked that I watch over you when she passed on.
I told her I watch out for my entire flock.
But she made me promise I'd keep an extra sharp eye on you.
I appreciate your kindness you've shown to my wife.
Now that you've spoken your piece, why don't go and attend some of your other sheep?
OK?
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her desire for you to go to confession.
She said she couldn't remember the last time you went.
Is that so?
- It is.
Well, I confess that I never really cared for church very much.
The only reason I went was because of her.
And I confess that I have no desire to confess to a boy that is just out of the seminary.
Wish I could help dad, but gotta get kids home.
Kids getting restless.
- Yeah, fine, just go.
I'll call in a few, see how you're doing.
- Alright.
Kill you to buy American.
Huh ...
Did you see the way he looked at the truck?
Jesus.
It's always Rice-Burner this or Jap-Burner that.
You know.
Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go.
At least he didn't say anything this time.
-He didn't need to.
Well, what do you expect, Mitch?
The man worked at a Ford plant for a lot of years.
I suppose that's my goddamned fault?
Just give it a rest.
Drive.
OK?
Kids, do you want the radio on?
Yes.
You want to listen to some music?
Good.
Damn, barbarians
Oh, Jesus ...
Polarski would roll over in his grave if he could see his lawn now.
What the hell the chinks had to move in this neighborhood for?
Have you gone completely deaf or something?
Hi there, Walt.
I kind of not a friend of yours.
Why do you insist on calling me Walt?
Sorry , Mr.Kowalski.
What are you peddling today, padre?
- Nothing.
Thought I'd drop by and see how you are doing.
I haven't seen you in church in a while
OKay.
Well now when you tipped on your good deed, now why don't you just take off down the road?
I'd really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.
- Not in this lifetime, sonny.
Why?
Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
- You don't want to know.
No, I do.
Well I think you're an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold the hands of old ladies who are superstitious and promises them eternity.
Is you a boy or is you a girl, I can't tell
Hey, Chicito.
If you was in pink, I would fuck you and your ass would be my bitch.
What you reading, jackass and The rice stalk?
That's right, you keep walking.
Look at me when I am talking to you.
-Fucking slopes everywhere you look, man.
Fucking pigs
Look at that, man.
That's my little cousin, over there.
- You sure that's your cousin, man?
Fuck yes, that's my little cousin.
- He tight with anybody?
No he is flying solo, man.
- Flying solo?
Let's go down and see what the fucking they're doing to him.
I love your jungles too.
Hey, they fucking with you?
They fucking with you?
We can do this right now.

Let's get the fuck out of here.
Let's get this strapped.
Pussy!
Hey, Tao.
Hey what's up?
What's up, Tao?
What are you doing little man?
Why are you doing woman's work?
What do you want?
What?
We can't just come and talk to my little cousin?
He doesn't want to talk to you.
I am here right.
- Hey, Spider, who is that?
What's up?
- Spider?
Is that what he just called you, Fong?
Spider?
- Is there something wrong with Spider?
What are you doing here?
Hey, so how old are you anyways?
Mentally, I am way too old for you.
- What?
You are just stupid.
I am going inside.
Sue!
How your little brother, do this gardening.
Fine, stupid.
Hey, you will roll with us man, come on?
Come on ride with us.
- Chill with us.
You need somebody to protect you, man.
That's what your big cousins are for.
Look, dawg.
I've been there, I've done it and I've seen it.
Back in a day everybody wanted to beat me, dawg.
But now look, nobody wants to fuck with me.
Come on man, let's go.
- We are cousins right?
Come on.
- We are cousins right?
We are a family.
Look, I am brother to Spider, as he is brother to me.
Come on.
Take this shit off.
That's a woman's work man.
- Come get your hands dirty, man.
So what do I have to do?
Spider told that old boy next door had a bad ass whip.
Told you we got him.
Come on.
Nice.
- Ya, my little cousin being little man.
Yo, that's a nice car.
1972 Gran Torino, Fastback.
Cobra jet engine.
- Yo man it can still in mint condition.
Yo man, it's in mint condition man.
I've got one.
A Mexican, a Jew and a colored guy go into the bar.
The bartender looks up and says:
"Get the fuck out of here!"
So, here's where my flock congregates when they're not in church..
Hey Father J.
- Hey, Mel.
Hey, Darrel.
Hey father.
- Hi, Walt.
What brings you in here, father.
Meat raffle?
No, I just came down to talk Walt if that's ok.
Damn, padre.
You are persistent, aren't you?
I promised your wife.
All right, let's get booze.
I'll have Pabst and a shot of Jack.
And whatever he's having.
I'll have a Diet Coke.
- Bullshit.
This is a bar.
You have a drink.
I'll have a gin and tonic.
- Attaboy!
So, what you want?
I promised your wife I'd get you to go to confession.
Now, why would you do that?
- She was very insistent.
She made me.
Well you're kinda found of promising things you can't deliver on, right, father?
Let's talk about something else.
- What?
Life and death.
Life and death.
What the hell do you know about life and death?
I'd like to think I know a lot.
I'm a priest..
Yeah, you get up and preach about life and death.
But all what you know is what you learned in a priest school.
Right out of the rookie Preacher's Handbook
I don't know about that.
I think...
That is bittersweet.
Sort of bitter in its pain.
But sweet in its salvation.
That's what you know of life and death, and that's pathetic.
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?
I know a lot.
I lived there almost three years in Korea.
Thanks.
We shot men.
We stabbed them with bayonets, hacked seventeen-year-olds to death with shovels
Stuff I'll remember till the day I die.
Horrible things, but things I live with.
And what about life?
Well, I ...
I survived the war.
got married... and had a family.
Sounds like you know more about death than you do living.
Maybe so, father.
Maybe so.
Son of a bitch.
Hey, man, get in a car!
- Tao, what the fuck, get in!
Come on Tao.
- Come, let's go,man, get in!
Fuck man, get in!
Hello?
Morning, Dad, it's your number one son, Mitch.
Morning?
It's after one in the afternoon.
It's not morning.
Oh, right.
Afternoon, then.
So what do you want?
- What?
Me?
Nothing.
I mean, what would I want?
Well, I don't know.
Your wife has already gone through all of your mother's jewelry.
No, dad.
I was just calling to see how are you doing?
Well, anything new with the old neighborhood?
No.
- Great.
Smooth sailing then.
Yah.
- OK, good, good, then.
Oh, hey, dead.
- Yeah.
You wouldn't happen to still know that guy from the plant who has Lion season tickets?
Dad?
Ain't she sweet?
Come on.
Hey, what's up?
What are you doing here, man?
- Nothing.
Minding our own business.
- Just hanging out.
What are you guys doing here?
What?
Can I just come here to hang with my little cousin?
We have good new for you.
- Really, and what's that?
Only for guy talk.
- I don't think so.
Why not?
- Come on, man, we are going to give you another shot.
Don't go, Tao.
- Mind your own business girl.
Come on, let's go
- Come.
What the hell is this?
Get up.
- Get off my lawn.
Listen old man, you don't want to fuck with me.
Did you hear me?
I said get off my lawn, now.
Are you fucking crazy?
Go back in a house.
Yeah, I'll blow the hole in your face and then I'll go in a house.
And I'll sleep like a baby You can count on that.
We used to stack fucks like you five feet high in Korea, used you for sandbags.
OK.
You better watch your back...
Thank you.
Get off my lawn.
What the hell is this?
No, no, no, no more.
Stay right there.
Why can't you people just leave me alone?
We brought you some shallots to plant in the garden.
I don't want them.
They're perennials, they come back every year.
Look, why are bringing me all this garbage anyway.
Because
Because you saved, Tao.
I didn't save anybody.
I just.
I kept a bunch of jabbering gooks off of my lawn .
You are a hero to the neighborhood.
I am not a hero.
Too bad, they think you are and that's why they're keep bringing you the gifts.
Please take them.
- All they are wrong.
I just want to be left alone, thank you.
- Wait!
This is my mom, Vu, I'm Sue and that's my brother, Tao.
We live next door.
- So?
Tao wants to say something.
I am sorry.
- Sorry for what?
For trying to steal your car.
Let me tell you something boy.
You step on this property again, you are done...
Good afternoon, Walt.
I told you I'm not going to confession..
- Why didn't you just call the police?
What?
I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I heard there was some trouble in the neighborhood.
Why didn't call the police?
Well ...
You know why, I've prayed that they would show up, but..
.. nobody answered.
- What were you thinking?
Someone could have been killed.
We're talking life and death here.
When things go wrong, you gotta act quickly.
When we were in Korea and a thousand screaming gooks came across our land..
... we didn't call the police.
We reacted.
- We are not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski,
I've been thinking about our conversation on life and death.
About what you said.
About how you carry around all the horrible things you were forced to do
Horrible things that won't leave you.
It seems that it would do you good to unload some of that burden.
Things done during war are terrible.
being ordered to kill ... killing to save yourself, killing to save others.
You're right, those are things I know nothing about.
But I do know about forgiveness.
And I've seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins, admitted their guilt and left their burdens behind them.
Stronger men than you!
Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things... and are now at peace.
Well I got to hand it to you, padre, You came here with your guns loaded this time.
Thank you!
- And you're right about one thing.
About stronger men than me, reaching their salvation.
Well, Hallefuckinlujah.
- But you are wrong about something else.
- What's that, Mr. Kowalski?
The thing that haunts a man the most is what he isn't ordered to do.
There, finally, you look like a human being again. .
You shouldn't wait so long between haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch.
Well I am surprised you are still around.
I was always hoping that you die off and they get somebody in here they knew what the hell they are doing.
Instead you just keep hanging around, like the dump wop dago you are.
- That'll be ten dollars, Walt.
- Ten bucks, Jesus Christ, Martin.
What are you half-Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices all the time.
It's been ten bucks for the last five years and you hard-mellows, Pollack son of a bitch.
Keep the change.
- See you in three weeks, prick.
Not if I see you first, dipshit.
That's cool, you know.
Look at this.
You tight ass over here.
Come here girl.
You can't say hi?
Or are you acting like stuck-up and shit.
What are you supposed to be man?
- Yo, it's cool dog.
The fuck are you doing in my neighborhood, boy?
None, Just going to the corner spot, you know get some CDs, sound good, bro?
He called, you bro!
- Come on sound good, bro?
Sound good.
- Shut the fuck up.
Call me bro again, and I'll bite your motherfucking face off .
Yeah, motherfucker.
- Now what the fuck you come down here for?
You here to bring this little present?
Oriental yummy?
Don't worry, I'll take a real good care with her.
Fuck out of here, .
- Fuck out of here, man!
Oh shit, you have a bitch with you.
Keep your ass right here.
Oh great.
Another asshole who has a fetish for Asian girls.
God, it gets so old.
Oh, shit, what's your name girl?
My name?
Get your ass out of here, okay.
It's 'take your crude, overly obvious come-on to every woman who walks past and cram it.'
That's my name.
Who do you think you are talking to?
Who does it look like?
Man she's tough.
- What?
You gonna hit me now?
That'd pretty much complete the picture.
You need to keep your bitch on a leash.
Put a choke chain on her and yank that motherfucker.
Oh, of course, right to the stereotype thesaurus
- Oh yeah
Call me a whore and a bitch in the same sentence.
-Bitch is crazy.
I like her like that
- Now take that bitch.
You don't know when to quit do you, girl?
- Let me teach you a lesson
Stop!
Let me go!
Take your ass over there.
What the fuck are you looking at old man?
What the hell are you spooks up to?
Spooks?
You'd better get your ass on honkey, while I still let you.
That's you'd better do.
What the fuck he thinks he is?
Have you noticed how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't fucking with?
That's me.
You are fucking crazy, get out of here, man.
Why don't you get your ass out of here before we kicked your wrinkly white ass.
What's wrong with him man?
The motherfucker's crazy!
-What is this thing?
What the hell?
Get in a truck.
Crazy motherfucker.
- What's wrong with him, man.
Hey pops come on now.
- Shut your fucking face!
You don't fucking listen, do you?
Now get in a truck.
- Go get in a truck girl.
Let her go, old man!
Shut up pussy.
What is this 'bro' shit anyway?
You want to be superb page, or something
These guy don't want to be your bro and I don't blame them.
Now get your old faint paddy ass on down the road.
Take care now.
You too.
Oh, yeah.
Why didn't you do nothing?
Man you fucking!
Shit man.
If he had cannon at your fucking face, you would do nothing.
What's the matter with you, for Christ sake?
Trying to get yourself killed?
I thought you Asian girls were supposed to be smart.
Hanging around in the neighborhood like that is the fast way to get you in the obituaries.
I know, I know.
Take it easy.
And what about that goofball guy you were with.
Is that a date or something?
Yeah, kind of.
His name is Trey.
- You should be hanging out with them.
You should be hanging out with your own people.
The other Hummongs.
- You mean, Hmong?
Hmong, not Hummong
- Whatever.
What the hell is Hmong, I mean Mong anyway?
Wow, you so enlighten you know that?
No, Hmong is not a place, it is a people.
My people come from different parts of Laos, Thailand and China.
Well how you ended up in my neighborhood?
Why didn't you stay there?
It's Vietnam thing.
We thought on your side And when American quit the communists started killing all the Hmong.
So we came over here.
Yeah, well I don't know how you ended up in Midwest.
Snow on the ground six months in the year.
What is it?
Jungle people wanted to be on great frozen tundra?
Hill people.
We are hill people.
Not jungle people.
BOO-ga, ga-Boo, BOO-ga!
Yeah, whatever ...
Blame the Lutherans.
They brought us up here.
Everybody blames the Lutherans.
Well, you'd think the cold will keep all the idiots out.
Thanks for the ride.
You know something kid, you are all right.
But what about that dimwit brother of yours?
He is little slow or something?
Tao is actually really smart.
He just doesn't know what direction to go in.
Poor toad.
- It is really common.
Hmong girls over here fit in better.
The girls go to college and the boys go to jail.
That old hag hates my ass.
Your birthday today, Daisy.
This year you have to make a choice between two life paths.
Second chances come your way.
Extraordinary events culminate in what might seem to be an anticlimax.
You lucky numbers are: 84, 23, 11, 78 and 99.
What a load of shit.
Yea.
What the hell is it with kids nowadays?
All right.
Let me help you with those.
- Oh, thank you.
How about that?
How about that, Daisy?
It's too heavy for a bag.
- No problem.
Good, Karen, give it to him.
-Here you go.
Well, what is it?
-It's a Gopher.
So you can reach stuff.
It makes things a lot of easier.
This is from me.
It's a phone.
Oh, I can see that.
I just thought...well, we thought that it would make things easier.
Thank you, Karen.
There's nothing wrong with making things less hard on yourself.
You know Karen's right, Dad.
You've worked hard your whole life.
Maybe it's time you start thinking about taking it a easier?
And some other thing, Dad.
You really should get rid of the coffin nails.
We were thinking about the house.
You know, when Mom's gone, it's got to be a lot to maintain around here.
Let alone clean.
And you are here all alone ...
Yeah, you know, there's these great places now, you know, these communities
Where you don't have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow.
You know, People who are like you, active and alert, but are alone.
And would benefit from being around folks their own age.
Yeah Dad, look.
You got to check it out.
We brought some brochures.
These places are nothing like that you think they would be.
They are great.
- No, they are beautiful.
They are really nice They really are.
These are top-notch like resorts.
It is like staying in a hotel, practically.
- They're beautiful.
They really are.
- Yeah.
They care of everything.
They clean up.
They're really nice.
Oh, there are wonderful stores, where you can buy new shoes.
They are amazing, they really are.
You have a good time, play some golf maybe.
Meet other people.
Son of a bitch.
Kicked us out on his birthday.
I've told you that was a bad idea.
I know, you were right
- He won't let anybody help him.
Well, we tried.
Now can we just drop it?
No one can say we didn't try
What the hell with him, we shouldn't have done it.
We should've stayed home with Josh and Ashley.
At least they were smart enough to not come here.
The goddamn kids have more sense than we do.
We miss mom, don't we Daisy?
Hey, Walt.
What are you up to?
We're having a barbecue.
You want to come over?
What do you think?
- There's tons of food.
Just keep you hands off my dog.
-No worries.
We only eat cats.
Really?
- No I am kidding, you moron.
Come on you can be my special guest.
-No, I am fine right here.
Yeah ...
Son of a bitch.
- okay, so, what have you had to eat today?
I had a piece of cake.
And a little beef jerky.
Come on over and get something to eat.
We've got beer too.
Well ...
I might as well drink with strangers better than drinking alone.
It is my birthday.
Really.
Happy birthday Wally
- Don't call me Wally.
You have no Pabts among the beer.
- As they say, "when in Hmong."
What am I doing wrong?
Every time I look at somebody they always look at the ground.
What is she saying?
- She said welcome to our home.
Oh no, she is not.
- Yes, she didn't.
She hates me.
Yeah, she hates you.
OKay.
What?
!
What are all you fish heads looking at anyway?
I think we should go to other room.
Sorry.
All the people in this house are very traditional.
Number 1.
Never touch a Hmong person on the head, not even a child..
Hmong-people believe that the soul resides on the head.
So, don't do that.
- Sounds dumb, but fine.
And a lot of Hmong people consider looking at someone eye to be very rude.
That's why they look away, when you look at them.
- Anything else?
Yeah, some Hmong people tend to smile or grin when they're yelled at.
It's a cultural thing.
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity, it's not that they're laughing at you, really.
You people are nuts
But the food..
It looks good, smells good too.
-Of course, its Hmong food.
OKay, and I come back in few seconds.
Here you go.
- Thanks.
You mentioned about..
looking at people, he's been staring at me the whole evening.
That's Kor Khue.
He is the Lor's family shaman.
What's that some sort of witch doctor or something.
- Something like that.
Boeki Boo.
- You're funny, Wally.
Kor Khue's interested in you.
He heard what you did.
He would like to read you.
It would be rude not allow him this.
It's a great honor.
Yeah sure.
It's fine by me.
- All right, take a seat.
He says people do not respect you.
They don't even want to look at you.
He says the way you live, your food has no flavor.
You wearied by your life.
You made a mistake.
And you past life is like a mistake what you did.
You are not satisfied with.
He says, you have no happiness in your life.
It's like you are not at peace.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I am fine.
Fine, I am fine.
God, I've got more in common with these gooks than I have with my own spoiled-rotten family.
Jesus Christ ...
Happy Birthday.
Are you ok?
Yeah, I am fine.
You were bleeding.
- No, I bit my tongue.
It's nothing.
Why don't we get down and get some of that good gook food.
I am starving.
OKay.
You ladies are wonderful.
That stuff is really good.
Come on you glutton!
- What's up?
Let's go.
- What for?
To mingle.
- We can mingle right here.
No.
You told me not to leave you alone.
Thank you very much.
I have to go now.
I'll be back.
Don't let me go right of it .
Well, well, look he is over there.
- Yeah, the kid who steal my Gran Torino.
My brother Tao.
- Tried to anyway, yeah, toad.
It was wobby a bit.
But it should fix it.
What's this?
Little rice liquor Here, try it.
All right.
My friends and I were just wondering what you're doing here?
That's a good question.
What am I doing here?
My name is Walt.
- Hey, Walt.
I am Wa Xam.
Wa Yum?
- No Wa Xam.
Wa Xam, OK.
- So what do you do?
I fix things.
Stuff like that.
- Like what?
I've just fixed that dryer over there.
I fixed my wife's friend sink.
I took old aunt Merry to doctor to get a prescription.
Fixed up.
I've even the fixed the door, what had't even broken yet.
You're funny
I've been called a lot of things, but never funny.
Well, I have to take off.
Enjoy yourself.
- okay, Yum Yum.
Later.
Come on.
Relax, zipper headed.
I am not gonna shoot you.
I'd look down too if I was you.
You know, I knew you were a dipshit the first time I ever saw you.
You're worse with women than you are with stealing cars, Toad.
It's Tao.
- What?
It's not toad, it's Tao.
My name is Tao.
You were blowing it with that girl who was there.
Not that I give two shits about a Toad like you.
You don't what you are talking about.
You are wrong egg roll.
I know exactly what I am talking about.
I may not be the most pleasant person to be around.
But I got the best woman who was ever on this planet to marry me.
I had to work at it.
That was the best thing that ever happened to me.
Hangs down.
But you ... you know
You let Click Clack, Ding Dong and Charlie Chan just walk out with what's-her-face.
She likes you, you know.
I don't know why.
Who?
Yum yum!
You know that girl in the purple sweater.
She's been looking at you all day, stupid.
Do you mean, Wa Xam?
- Yeah, Yum Yum.Yeah.
Nice girl, very charming girl.
I talked with her.
But you let her just walk right out.
With the three stooges.
And you know why?
Cause you are big, fat pussy.
Well ...
I gotta go.
Good day.
Puss cake.
No, no more.
OKay, put them over there.
No.
No.
No more No more.
No more.
No more, please ...
Is that chicken dumpling thing you brought before?
Alright.
Better than beef jerky all the time.
What's going on?
What's going on?
-Tao is here to make amends.
He is here to work for you.
-No, he isn't.
He's not gonna work for me.
My mom said dishonored the family.
And now he has to work off his dept.
He starts tomorrow morning.
- Oh not tomorrow, not any time.
I don't even want him on my property I thought we went over all that.
It is very important to my mom that you accept.
And that would be an insult if you refuse.
Why is it being put back on me, all of this?
He is the one who tried to steal my car ... all of the sudden I am a bad guy in this thing.
Look my family is very traditional and would be very much upset if you don't let Tao repay.
If you doesn't want to do it, then let's just go.
Shut up!
Yeah, shut up.
All right, tomorrow, tomorrow.
Thank you.
Jesus, Joseph and Mary.
These Hmong broads are like badgers.
Son of a bitch.
I never thought he'd show.
All right, what are you good at?
Like what?
- That's what I am asking.
You gonna work for me, I gotta know what you are good at.
I gotta know what you can do.
- I don't know.
That's kind of half way what I expected you to say.
See that tree right there?
You just go over there and count the birds.
You want me to count the birds?
- Yeah, you can count?
All you slopes are supposed to be good at math, right?
Yeah, I can count.
- Good.
One, two ...
So, what do you have for me to do?
You want me to watch paint dry or maybe count the clouds that pass by?
Don't get flip with me, boy.
I am not the one who is trying to steal, don't you forget that.
Go ahead.
I don't care if you insult me and say racist things.
Cause you know what?
I'll take it.
- Of cause you'll take it.
Cause you have no teeth, you have no balls, kid.
Look, I am stuck here.
Why don't you find something useful for me to do.
Unlike you, I am not useless.
And I maintain my own property.
These swamp rats, on the other hand, you just can help it.
How long do I have you for?
Toad, how long?
Till next Friday.
All right.
Go get the ladder out of the garage.
When you got finished with that roof there.
You can take that gutter, and nail it back up.
I am tired looking at it for the last three years.
Yeah, you said it, brother.
Hello.
Grandpa says he want to know if you can have Tao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch?
Wasp nest?
That's terrible.
I think we can handle that after the lunch.
Lord All Mighty, knock it off.
It's my last day.
What else do have for me do?
Take a day-off.
You did enough.
Toad!
Nothing.
Nevermind.
Kowski?
Kowski?
Kowski?
Mr. Kowalski?
Good morning.
I looked over your paperwork and I think we should immediately start a full battery of tests
I feel that this would be the best way to go about checking all the issues that you've had.
Excuse me, what happened to Dr.Felmon, my regular doctor?
Dr. Felmon retired three years ago.
I am his replacement Dr. Chang.
It's grandpa Walt.
- Pick it up.
You talk to him!
Mitch.
I'm doing bills here.
- You talk to him, he is yours father.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Mitch.
It's me your dad.
Yeah, I know.
What's up?
Oh, nothing, nothing much really.
How is everything going?
I am fine, fine.
How about Karen and the kids?
Fine, everybody is great.
Doing fine.
Good.
How about work?
Busy.
Yeah, I suppose...
In fact, um, speaking of busy.
I got a lot on my plate right now, so if it is not something pressing.
No, not it all.
Why don't you call me this weekend?
Sure.
OK, It was nice talking to you.
Thanks for talk.
Thanks.
This kid doesn't have a chance.
What do you know about faucets?
I know a lot about them, boy.
Tender side.
Jesus.
For the love of Pete.
- What?
It must be a hundred degrees here.
Just, turn on the fan.
This place is wobbling apart.
Where did you get all the stuff?
What are you talking about?
- All the tools and stuff.
Well, may come as surprise to a thief, but I bought this stuff.
Everything in here with my own money.
Yeah, yeah.
This is not what I meant.
I mean this is so much shit packed in here.
Yeah, well.
Every tool in here has a purpose.
Everything has a job to do.
They are all used when necessary.
- okay, so, what is that?
it is a post hole digger.
- That
Vice-grips.
Wire cutters, you know that's a trowel.
There is shears right there, and that's a saw.
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me kid.
Alright, what's on your mind.
It's just..
I can't afford to buy all this stuff.
Well, I guess, even a bonehead like you, could understand... that a man acquires it over the period of 50 years.
Yeah, but...
All right, look, here.
These three items right here, you can have this.
WD-40, vice grips and some duck tape.
Any man who is worth his salt, can do half of the house chores with just those three things.
Anything else you need you just borrow it, that's all.
OK, cool.
Fuck me.
- What's with that?
Nothing.
What?
Nothing, huh?
I just saw you've coughed out blood.
That's not good.
You should really see a doctor.
Look..
Those guys over here, the other night ... on my lawn, what a bout them?
- Just a gang.
A bunch of Hmong gang bangers.
I assume that.
What they were doing here?
They were going to take me away.
They were kind of pissed, that I blew my first initiation.
Yeah, well you are, you are a pussy.
You wanna hang out with guys like that.
What was your initiation supposed to be?
My Gran Torino?
Toad, you got a minute?
Here it is.
Here is the deal.
I take the top, cause that's the heaviest.
I'll pull on that.
And you stand right back here, and you push.
And help me push it up each step.
like that.
- Then, let me take the top.
No, no, I've got a top.
No, I'll take the top.
It looks pretty heavy.
Look I am not crippled.
I've got the top.
If you don't let me take the top.
I ain't helping.
I will go back home.
Listen to me, zipper head.
No, you listen, old man!
I am here because you need help.
So it is either top of I am out of here.
All right, you take the top and I'll push.
Don't let it slip off you little girl hands and crush me.
Don't give me any ideas.
That thing weighs a ton.
Runs like a clock.
They don't make them like this anymore.
So what are you going to do with it?
- Sell it I guess.
How much?
- 60 bucks.
I am tired of having this sit around down in the basement there.
Why?
You are looking for a freezer?
Our downstairs one kind of died.
- okay, 25 bucks and it's yours.
25?
You've just said 60.
I know, it will save me money putting an ad in the paper.
Come on, let haul it over your place.
Kind of ironic, huh?
- What?
Toad washing a car they tried to steal from you.
Yeah, he misses one spot.
He is doing it all over again too.
It is nice of you to kind look after him like this.
He doesn't have any real role models in his life.
Well, I am not a role model.
But you are a good man, Wally.
I wish our father would have been more like you.
Don't go calling me Wally.
No, I am serious.
He was really hard on us.
Really traditional... and really old school.
Well, I am old school.
yeah, but you an American.
What's that supposed to me?
You like him, don't you?
- Are you kidding?
He tried to steal my car.
And you spend time with him, teaching him how to fix things.
Saved him from a fucked cousin of ours...
- Hey, what you language lady.
And you're a good man
- I am not a good man.
Give me another beer, dragon lady.
This one is empty.
You know, Hmong consider gardening to be a woman's work.
Yeah, that probably why I see in the garden over there all the time.
Besides we ain't in Hu-Mong.
- Funny.
You know you should quit.
That's bad for you.
Yeah?
So it is being in a gang, dipshit.
Didn't you hear what I've just said?
I saw you coughed out blood.
You should quit.
What's that emblem supposed to mean anyway?
Your ancient camp scout emblem?
1'st cavalry.
I've had it since 1951.
So what you wanna do with you life kid.
I was thinking maybe sales.
So you wanna be in sales?
What about going to school, maybe.
But school costs money.
Maybe you should get a job.
You can't just sit there and spread mulch in my garden for the rest of your life.
Maybe you can just pay me.
Yeah, very funny.
What kind of job could I ever get?
- Yeah you're right, nobody would ever hire you.
Look I am just kidding zip...
I mean.
You can get a job.
You can get a job everywhere.
Like what?
How about construction?
- Me?
Yeah.
- Construction?
Yeah.
- Do you have Alzheimer's or something?
.
No, get a job in the construction.
I know people in the trades.
Of course I have to make a little adjustment and man you up a little bit.
Man me up?
- Yeah.
And I think you ought to date Miss Yum Yum too.
Do you little good.
Get carbon off the vaults.
Now you just gonna learn, how guys talk.
You just listen the way Martin and I banter back and forth.
You okay?
You are ready?
- Sure.
Let's go in.
Perfect.
A pollack and a chink.
How are you doing, Martin, you crazy Italian prick.
Walt, you cheap bastard, I should have known you'd come in,
I was having such a pleasant day
- What did you do?
Jew some poor blind guy out of his money.
Giving him a wrong change?
- Who's the nip?
He is a pussy kid from next door.
I am just trying to man him up a little bit.
You see kid?
That's how guys talk to one another .
They do?
-Do you have shit in your ears?
Now go out and come back in and talk to him like a man.
Like a real man.
Come on.
Get your ass out of here.
Come on back now.
Sorry about this.
That's ok.
What's up you old Italian prick?
Get out of my shop before I blow your head off you goddamn dick smoker.
Jesus Christ.
Shit.
Take it easy.
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
That's what you said.
That what you said men say.
You don't just come in and insult a man in his own shop.
What happens if you meet some stranger?
If you get the wrong one he's gonna blow you gook head right off.
What should I've said then?
- Why don't you start with Hi or Hello.
Yeah just come in and say: 'Sir, I'd like a haircut if you have a time'
Yeah, be polite but don't kiss ass.
In fact you can talk about the construction job you just came from.
And bitch about your girl friend in your car.
Son of a bitch, I've just got breaks fixed and those sons of the bitches really nailed me.
They screwed right in the ass.
Yeah, don't swear at the guy.
Just talk about people who are not in the room.
You can bitch about your boss making you work overtime when it is bowling night.
Right, my old lady bitches for two goddamn hours about how..
they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store.
and the minute I turn on a fucking game she starts crying we never talk.
See now go out, come back and talk to him.
And it ain't a rocket science for Christ sake.
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car, or a girlfriend.
Jesus, I should have blown his head off when I had a chance.
Maybe so, I want you to turn around and go outside and come back and don't talk about having no job, no car, no girlfriend, no future, no dick.
OK, just turn around and go.
Excuse me sir, I need a hair cut if you ain't too busy.
You old Italian son of a bitch prick barber.
Boy, does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job.
Fuck me.
All set to go through with this, right?
- Yeah, yeah.
Don't yeah, yeah me.
Just say:
Yes sir and I'll do my best.
Yes, I'll do my best.
- Cause when I vouch for somebody that means I am give them my word.
I don't want you making me look bad.
No I am good.
Totally into this.
Don't lay down either.
Just look em straight in the eye.
And a man can tell a lot by your handshake.
Here, put those in your back pocket.
- Cool.
Don't blow this.
Hey, Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon.
How the hell are you?
I am shitty.
But who's gonna listen?
- Not me, that's for sure.
Help yourself there, Walt.
You dumb pollack.
OK this is the kid, I was telling you about.
Tao, this is Tim Kennedy, he is super on this job.
What we got here, Walt?
Well he knows construction and he is a smart kid.
He'll do anything you need him for.
You sure?
- Yeah.
You speak English?
- Yes, sir.
Were you born here?
- You bet.
I see that Walt drove you here.
You got a vehicle?
Not at the moment.
Taking a bus for now.
- Bus?
Jesus Christ.
You don't have a car?
My head gasket cracked and the goddamned pricks at the shop wants to bend me over for $2100
Oh please.
I just replaced the tranny in my Tahoe and the sons a bitches fucked me hard, just under $3200.
Goddamned thieves.
It ain't right.
- You got that right.
Come on in on Monday and we'll find something for you to do.
Thanks, Mr. Kennedy.
That's Tim, and what's you name again?
- Tao.
T. .., okay.
You owe me one, Walt.
Well I'll buy a fruit cake for Christmas.
Fuck a fruit cake.
How about you just hand over the keys to that Gran Torino.
What the hell does everybody want my car?
- Yeah, I am not surprised.
Yeah, you don't know a half of it.
Alright, come on, zipper head.
Let the Mick stay here and play with himself.
What are we doing?
What do you want to do?
Carry you tools in a rice bag?
Here.
You can use one of these ... and you'll need one of this here.
I can't afford any of this.
I'll cover it.
You can pay me back with your first pay check.
Cool
- Here, we need something like that.
This is what I am looking for here, tool belt.
There you go.
Not to bitch.
But won't I be needing some tools.
Tools I've got but I am not going to lend you my tool belt.
You can pick up tools as you go.
I really appreciate all this.
- Forget it.
No, I really do Thank you.
What's up homeboy, what are you doing?
What up man?
- What you got, punk?
Checking up on my little cousin.
- Yeah, man.
My little cousin ...
What's this?
Where you come from man?
- I am coming
Home from work I know you guys don't know much about that.
So that's true, you got a job.
- You can't just leave me alone?
What?
He is scared, huh?
Who bought this shit for you?
Your dad?
- What you guys want with me?
Your dad bought this shit for you?
- Keep your hands off my stuff.
What's the fuck is that shit?
- What the fuck, you make me look bad?
Keep your hands off my stuff!
This massive my job man.
Give me that, that.
- Hey come on, this is my stuff.
You wanna smoke man?
Fuck it.
Let me go.
Give me that, man.
Give me that.
What's the phrase I am looking for?
Oh yeah, 'saving face'
Hey, there.
Hey.
I gotta run.
Haven't seen you for a few days.
Where you've been?
Been busy.
Busy, huh?
What the hell happened to you?
- Don't worry about it.
What do you mean don't worry about it.
Look at your goddamn face.
I said don't worry about it.
OKay, it's not your problem.
When?
Grabbed me a couple of days ago right after I go off work.
Cowards.
I did everything I can possibly do.
But they broke some of your tools.
I will replace them.
Don't worry about the tools.
Where is your cousin lives?
No, Walt.
I'll be ok.
I don't want you to do anything.
- Right,.
You could need extra tools, you just let me know.
Well, I could use a roofing hammer.
-Good, go in my garage and get it.
This should be the last stop.
Here is the deal.
You stay away from Tao, understand?
You tell your friends to stay away from Tao.
You want to fight with us than I could sound don't want to see him anymore.
That's it, got it?
I'll take that as yes.
Cause if I have to come back here it is gonna get fucking ugly.
Get off of my way.
How do you want your dog?
I mean steak?
Funny.
I told you we only eat cats.
I've never seen you like this before.
Well I am feeling good.
I god beautiful women, great food.
And Tao.
And even Tao isn't bugging me.
You are having a good time, I see.
-Yeah.
And it never ends.
What happened to your knuckles anyways?
I slipped in a shower.
No big problem.
Look Yum-Yum if he doesn't ask you out I will ask you out.
Wa Xam, don't listen to him.
He is a white devil.
Yeah, I am.
I am a white devil.
I've loved to Walt, but he beat you to it.
Really?
No kidding!
Dinner and a movie, or what?
Yeah, they are taking a bus.
No, you can't take a bus.
You gonna get you something more stylish that that.
Like what?
Take a limo?
How about that?
The Gran Torino?
- Yeah.
You'd let me take the Gran Torino.
- Yeah, I let you take the Gran Torino.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Is everybody all right?
Tao!
It's all right.
Where's grandma?
Where is Sue?
Where is Sue?
- She went to our aunts.
To her aunts?
Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Get on the phone and call her right now.
Sue ...
I knew, this was gonna happen.
What the hell am I doing here?
Maybe some of her friends called her and she changed her plans.
Yeah.
At the war we just all of us lost a lot of friends but you gotta stand for it.
You can care to it.
Mr. Kowalski?
Are you OK?
Yeah, I am OK.
Police finally left, no one is talking.
One thing about Hmong, they keep their mouths shut.
Yeah, I've noticed that.
You know, Tao and Sue will never gonna find peace in this world as long as those gangs around.
Until they go away.
You know forever.
What are you saying?
You know what I am saying.
I took Sue to the hospital.
She is scared.
They are all scared..
Yeah
Tao especially.
He's sitting out there right now staring at your front door.
You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.
What would you do?
What should Tao do?
I know what I would do if I was you.
Or at least what you think you should do.
- Really
If I was Tao I guess I'd wanted vengeance.
I'd wanted to stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys.
And you?
- What would I do?
I'd come over here and talk to you I guess.
I know you are close with these people, but this pisses me off too.
Mr.Kowalski.
Wanna beer?
- I'd love one.
There some in the chest, right over there behind you.
Damn all this.
It just isn't fair.
- Nothing is fair, father.
So what you gonna do, Mr. Kowalski?
Call me Walt.
All right.
What you gonna do, Walt?
I don't know.
But I'll think of something.
Whatever it is, they won't have a chance.
What are you doing?
Thinking.
Thinking.
Thinking time is over.
Now it's time to knock shit out of these pricks.
I know you don't want to hear this, but now it's the time to stay calm.
Calm?
You want me to be calm?
We stay calm or else mistakes will get made.
We have to step back from this thing.
No, don't let me down Walt.
Not you.
This is gonna end today.
Sit down.
I don't want to sit.
I said sit down.
Now, listen to me.
We gotta plan this and plan it very carefully.
Can't make any mistakes.
You know I am the right man for this job.
I want to go home and stay calm, and come back here at 4 this afternoon.
And this to be done will be done.
I say we go now, Right now.
And what?
Kill that cousin of yours and the rest of those zips.
Mr. Tough Guy is out for blood all of the sudden.
I know nothing about it.
Now go home.
You stay calm come back here at 4.
OK?
OKay.
I know, I know.
Give me a break, please, it's the first time I've ever smoked in the house.
Let a man enjoy himself,would you girl.
All finished. 10 dollars American.
I don't suppose your guinea hands are steady enough to do a straight shave?
- Straight shave?
You've never asked about straight shave ever.
I know but I always wondered about it.
That's unless you are too busy.
No, just let me heat up a towel.
Here is 20.
Keep the change.
It is just in case you hit my jugular.
Yes sir, It gonna take about one hour.
We gonna shorten these sleeves little bit.
Gonna fix at the shoulder.
I never had a suited suit before.
Yes sir, look very good.
Yes, sir.
Look very good.
What can I do for you, Mr. Kowalski?
- I am here for a confession.
Lord Jesus, what have you done?
- Nothing you just take it easy now.
What are you up to?
Are you gonna give a confession or not?
How long has it been since your last confession?
Forever.
Bless me father, for I have sinned.
What are your sins, my son?
In 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski at the factory Christmas party.
Dorothy was in the other room with the other wives.
it just happened.
Yes, go on.
Well, I made 900 dollars profit selling a boat and motor.
I didn't pay the taxes it is the same as stealing.
Yes, fine.
Lastly...
I was never very close with my two sons.
I don't know them.
I didn't know how.
That's it?
- That's it.
It's bothered me most of my life.
Say 10 "Hail Maries" and 5 "Our fathers".
God loves and forgives you and absolves you of all your sins.
In the name of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.
Thank you padre.
Are you going to retaliate for what happened to Sue.
I'm going over to that house today, Mr. Kowalski.
Is that so?
- It is.
And every other day until you see the folly of what you are planning.
Busy day, gotta go.
- Go in peace.
Oh I am at peace.
Jesus Christ.
So which one is mine?
You ever fired a weapon before?
- No
Why don't you put that one down.
I got something more to show you.
What?
In 1952 we were sent to take out a chink machine gun nest.
They trod us up pretty good.
I was the only one who came back out there.
For that they gave me a silver star.
Here it is.
Here I want you to have it.
Why?
Because we all knew the danger that night.
But we went anyway.
That's the way it might be tonight.
There is always a chance you don't come back.
The hell we won't.
We're will roll in there and tear ass.
Yeah, that's foolish.
That's the exact reaction they are waiting for.
Come on and close this up.
How many?
- How many what?
How many men did you kill in Korea?
13, maybe more.
-What was it like to kill a man.
You don't want to know.
Now close it up.
Walt!
Walt!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Relax, you can't get out of there.
You let me out right now !
Let me out.
You fuck let me out, I'll fucking kill you.
Shut the fuck up!
You want to know what is like to kill a man?
Well, that's goddamn awful.
The only thing worse is get a medal of valor for killing some poor kids..
that wanted just to give up that's all
Yeah, some scared little gook just like you.
I shot them right in a face with that rifle you were holding in there a while ago.
So if the day goes by that I don't think about it.
You don't that on your soul.
I got blood on my hands.
I am soiled.
That's why I am going alone tonight.
Walt you take me with you right now, let me out.
Look, you've come a long way.
I am proud to say that you are my friend.
But you got your whole life ahead of you.
But me, I finished things.
That's what I do and I am going alone.
No, wait.
Walt!
Walt!
I need you to watch my dog.
Yeah I love you too.
Yeah, she is old too.
Her name is Daisy.
Hello.
- It is Walt.
The keys to my house are under the ceramic turtle on the from porch.
Let yourself in.
Your brother is in the basement.
I gotta go.
Sorry father, we have to go.
I am telling if we are not here there will be a bloodshed.
We've been here for hours.
We can't afford to anchor a unit down to one location.
I am bagging you to stay.
Just got a word from my sergeant, we're pulling the plug.
I am staying.
No you aren't.
We have specific orders you came with us, you are leaving with us.
Watch your head.
Sue, over here, over here.
Unlock this right now.
He left without me.
He went to Smokie without me.
Tao!
Any swamp rats in there.
I didn't know your ass would came.
-Shut up, gook.
I have nothing to say to you, shrimp dick, lizard like you.
Yeah, yeah.
You go ahead watch out for your boyfriend.
Cause it was either he or you or something who raped one of their own family.
You own blood, for Christ sake.
Now go ahead and pull those pistols, like miniature cowboys.
Go ahead.
So where's Tao at?
That pussy motherfucker not gonna come.
Don't worry about Tao.
Tao's got not one second for you.
Says who?
You?
What the fuck you gonna do, old man?
What are you gonna do?
You bitch.
-
Kind of jumpy, aren't we?
- Shut the fuck up.
You should the fuck up!
Got a light?
- What the fuck?
No
Me..
I've got a light...
'Hail Mary, full of grace..'
Yes, sergeant.
What happened?
- You need to step back.
He is a friend of mine.
- He said step back.
Hey, did you hear him.
Step back.
What happened?
- Hey, step back.
He is my friend.
Officer Chang!
get those people back.
- Hey, step back now, OK.
Get the fuck out of here!
Walt Kowalski once said to me that I didn't know anything about life or death.
Because I was an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who held the hands of superstitious old women and promised they eternity.
Walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it.
But he was right.
I knew really nothing about life or death, until I got to know Walt.
And boy did I learn.
And I want to leave my house to the church becouse Dorothy would've liked it now which brings to out last item.
And again please excuse the language.
in Mr. Kowalski's will, I'm simply reading it as it was written.
And I'd like to leave my 1972 Gran Torino to ... my friend ...
Tao Vang Lor.
Under the condition that you don't choptop top the roof like one of those beaners don't paint any idiotic flames on it like some white-trash hillbilly anddon'tputabiggayspoileron the rear end like you see on all the other zipper heads' cars
It just looks like hell.
If you can refrain from doing any of that, it's yours.
God, I am sorry for Dorothy, Walt.
She was a real peach.
Thanks for coming, Al.
Spectacles, testicles, wallet and watch.
Look at the Old Man glaring at Ashley.
He can't even tone it down at Mom's funeral?
What do you expect?
Dad's still living in the '50s.
He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly.
Yeah, well your kid's wearing a Timberwolves jersey.
I'm sure Dad appreciates that.
The point I am trying to make is that there's nothing anyone can do that won't disappoint the Old Man.
It's inevitable.
That's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings.
the deal with the boat motor, the broken bird bath,
It's always something.
What are we going to do with him?
Don't you think he'll get in trouble over there all by himself in the old neighborhood?
Why don't you have him move in with you?
Death is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics.
Bitter in the pain.
Sweet in the salvation.
Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased.
... and their families
Sweet to those who know the salvation that awaits.
And some may ask, what is death?
Is it the end?
Or is it the beginning?
And what is life?
What is this thing we call life?
All these questions can frustrate you at times like this.
And that's why you have to turn to the Lord.
- Jesus ...
Because the Lord is the sweetness.
Is that dad?
- No, that's grandpa Walt.
There is a platoon, E-Company, March 2, 1952.
Korea?
- Where's Korea?
Well, people showed up after the service, huh?
Yeah, well, I suppose they heard there'd be a lot of ham.
I'll go down the basement and get some chairs.
Oh, I can do that, Dad..
- No, we need them now not next week.
Cool, I found a medal.
Look at this.
How much longer do we have to stay?
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell and I'm bored.
Ashley, honey.
Why don't you help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?
Me?
- Yes, you.
Grandpa Walt, would you like some help with these four chairs.
No, you probably just painted your nails.
Your dad is driving me crazy.
Why didn't you guys make him a hint we're leaving soon?
Come on, let's go.
Jesus Christ, how many swamp rats can get in one room?
Grandpa, when'd you get the vintage car?
1972.
I never knew you had a cool old car.
Yeah, it's been here since before you were born.
So, what are you going do with it when you like... die?
Then what about that super cool retro couch that you have in the den
Cause I was thinking I'm going to State next year, and I think it would look really good in my dorm room.
And I don't have any furniture at all.
God.
Who are you?
- Hi, I am Tao.
- What do you want?
I live next door.
- Come on, get the shit out of your mouth.
I am ...
- Tell me what you want.
Do you have jumper cables?
My uncle's car is old and.....
- No we don't any jumper cables .
And have some respect, zipper head, we're mourning here..
How you holding up, Walt?
Mr. Kowalski.
Huh?
- Mr. Kowalski, that's my name.
Right, Mr. Kowalski.
Your wife and I became quite close these last few months.
She asked that I watch over you when she passed on.
I told her I watch out for my entire flock.
But she made me promise I'd keep an extra sharp eye on you.
I appreciate your kindness you've shown to my wife.
Now that you've spoken your piece, why don't go and attend some of your other sheep?
Ok?
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her desire for you to go to confession.
She said she couldn't remember the last time you went.
Is that so?
- It is.
Well, I confess that I never really cared for church very much.
The only reason I went was because of her.
And I confess that I have no desire to confess to a boy that is just out of the seminary.
Wish I could help dad, but gotta get kids home.
Kids getting restless.
- Yeah, fine, just go.
I'll call in a few, see how you're doing.
- Alright.
Kill you to buy American.
Huh ...
Did you see the way he looked at the truck?
Jesus.
It's always Rice-Burner this or Jap-Burner that.
You know.
Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go.
At least he didn't say anything this time.
-He didn't need to.
Well, what do you expect, Mitch?
The man worked at a Ford plant for a lot of years.
I suppose that's my goddamned fault?
Just give it a rest.
Drive.
Ok?
Kids, do you want the radio on?
Yes.
You want to listen to some music?
Good.
Damn, barbarians
Oh, Jesus ...
Polarski would roll over in his grave if he could see his lawn now.
What the hell the chinks had to move in this neighborhood for?
Have you gone completely deaf or something?
Hi there, Walt.
I kind of not a friend of yours.
Why do you insist on calling me Walt?
Sorry , Mr.Kowalski.
What are you peddling today, padre?
- Nothing.
Thought I'd drop by and see how you are doing.
I haven't seen you in church in a while
Okay.
Well now when you tipped on your good deed, now why don't you just take off down the road?
I'd really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.
- Not in this lifetime, sonny.
Why?
Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
- You don't want to know.
No, I do.
Well I think you're an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold the hands of old ladies who are superstitious and promises them eternity.
Is you a boy or is you a girl, I can't tell
Hey, Chicito.
If you was in pink, I would fuck you and your ass would be my bitch.
What you reading, jackass and The rice stalk?
That's right, you keep walking.
Look at me when I am talking to you.
-Fucking slopes everywhere you look, man.
Fucking pigs
Look at that, man.
That's my little cousin, over there.
- You sure that's your cousin, man?
Fuck yes, that's my little cousin.
- He tight with anybody?
No he is flying solo, man.
- Flying solo?
Let's go down and see what the fucking they're doing to him.
I love your jungles too.
Hey, they fucking with you?
They fucking with you?
We can do this right now.
You go fucking back here, don't you?
Yeah!
You are fucking rise niggers!
Ok go!
Tao, come on man, get in the car.

- Fuck him, man, let's go.
Come on Spider.
- Fuck it.
Get it man, let's go.

Tomorrow, I have to see your ass.
- Don't be like a little girl!
Tomorrow.
Come let's go, man.
We've got a gun, man.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Let's get this strapped.
Pussy!
Hey, Tao.
Hey what's up?
What's up, Tao?
What are you doing little man?
Why are you doing woman's work?
What do you want?
What?
We can't just come and talk to my little cousin?
He doesn't want to talk to you.
I am here right.
- Hey, Spider, who is that?
What's up?
- Spider?
Is that what he just called you, Fong?
Spider?
- Is there something wrong with Spider?
What are you doing here?
Hey, so how old are you anyways?
Mentally, I am way too old for you.
- What?
You are just stupid.
I am going inside.
Sue!
How your little brother, do this gardening.
Fine, stupid.
Hey, you will roll with us man, come on?
Come on ride with us.
- Chill with us.
You need somebody to protect you, man.
That's what your big cousins are for.
Look, dawg.
I've been there, I've done it and I've seen it.
Back in a day everybody wanted to beat me, dawg.
But now look, nobody wants to fuck with me.
Come on man, let's go.
- We are cousins right?
Come on.
- We are cousins right?
We are a family.
Look, I am brother to Spider, as he is brother to me.
Come on.
Take this shit off.
That's a woman's work man.
- Come get your hands dirty, man.
So what do I have to do?
Spider told that old boy next door had a bad ass whip.
Told you we got him.
Come on.
Nice.
- Ya, my little cousin being little man.
Yo, that's a nice car.
1972 Gran Torino, Fastback.
Cobra jet engine.
- Yo man it can still in mint condition.
Yo man, it's in mint condition man.
I've got one.
A Mexican, a Jew and a colored guy go into the bar.
The bartender looks up and says:
"Get the fuck out of here!"
So, here's where my flock congregates when they're not in church..
Hey Father J.
- Hey, Mel.
Hey, Darrel.
Hey father.
- Hi, Walt.
What brings you in here, father.
Meat raffle?
No, I just came down to talk Walt if that's ok.
Damn, padre.
You are persistent, aren't you?
I promised your wife.
All right, let's get booze.
I'll have Pabst and a shot of Jack.
And whatever he's having.
I'll have a Diet Coke.
- Bullshit.
This is a bar.
You have a drink.
I'll have a gin and tonic.
- Attaboy!
So, what you want?
I promised your wife I'd get you to go to confession.
Now, why would you do that?
- She was very insistent.
She made me.
Well you're kinda found of promising things you can't deliver on, right, father?
Let's talk about something else.
- What?
Life and death.
Life and death.
What the hell do you know about life and death?
I'd like to think I know a lot.
I'm a priest..
Yeah, you get up and preach about life and death.
But all what you know is what you learned in a priest school.
Right out of the rookie Preacher's Handbook
I don't know about that.
I think...
That is bittersweet.
Sort of bitter in its pain.
But sweet in its salvation.
That's what you know of life and death, and that's pathetic.
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?
I know a lot.
I lived there almost three years in Korea.
Thanks.
We shot men.
We stabbed them with bayonets, hacked seventeen-year-olds to death with shovels
Stuff I'll remember till the day I die.
Horrible things, but things I live with.
And what about life?
Well, I ...
I survived the war.
got married... and had a family.
Sounds like you know more about death than you do living.
Maybe so, father.
Maybe so.
Son of a bitch.
Hey, man, get in a car!
- Tao, what the fuck, get in!
Come on Tao.
- Come, let's go,man, get in!
Fuck man, get in!
Hello?
Morning, Dad, it's your number one son, Mitch.
Morning?
It's after one in the afternoon.
It's not morning.
Oh, right.
Afternoon, then.
So what do you want?
- What?
Me?
Nothing.
I mean, what would I want?
Well, I don't know.
Your wife has already gone through all of your mother's jewelry.
No, dad.
I was just calling to see how are you doing?
Well, anything new with the old neighborhood?
No.
- Great.
Smooth sailing then.
Yah.
- Ok, good, good, then.
Oh, hey, dead.
- Yeah.
You wouldn't happen to still know that guy from the plant who has Lion season tickets?
Dad?
Ain't she sweet?
Come on.
Hey, what's up?
What are you doing here, man?
- Nothing.
Minding our own business.
- Just hanging out.
What are you guys doing here?
What?
Can I just come here to hang with my little cousin?
We have good new for you.
- Really, and what's that?
Only for guy talk.
- I don't think so.
Why not?
- Come on, man, we are going to give you another shot.
Don't go, Tao.
- Mind your own business girl.
Come on, let's go
- Come.
What the hell is this?
Get up.
- Gåt off my lawn.
Listen old man, you don't want to fuck with me.
Did you hear me?
I said get off my lawn, now.
Are you fucking crazy?
Go back in a house.
Yeah, I'll blow the hole in your face and then I'll go in a house.
And I'll sleep like a baby You can count on that.
We used to stack fucks like you five feet high in Korea, used you for sandbags.
Ok.
You better watch your back...
Thank you.
Get off my lawn.
What the hell is this?
No, no, no, no more.
Stay right there.
Why can't you people just leave me alone?
We brought you some shallots to plant in the garden.
I don't want them.
They're perennials, they come back every year.
Look, why are bringing me all this garbage anyway.
Because
Because you saved, Tao.
I didn't save anybody.
I just.
I kept a bunch of jabbering gooks off of my lawn .
You are a hero to the neighborhood.
I am not a hero.
Too bad, they think you are and that's why they're keep bringing you the gifts.
Please take them.
- All they are wrong.
I just want to be left alone, thank you.
- Wait!
This is my mom, Vu, I'm Sue and that's my brother, Tao.
We live next door.
- So?
Tao wants to say something.
I am sorry.
- Sorry for what?
For trying to steal your car.
Let me tell you something boy.
You step on this property again, you are done...
Good afternoon, Walt.
I told you I'm not going to confession..
- Why didn't you just call the police?
What?
I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I heard there was some trouble in the neighborhood.
Why didn't call the police?
Well ...
You know why, I've prayed that they would show up, but..
.. nobody answered.
- What were you thinking?
Someone could have been killed.
We're talking life and death here.
When things go wrong, you gotta act quickly.
When we were in Korea and a thousand screaming gooks came across our land..
... we didn't call the police.
We reacted.
- We are not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski,
I've been thinking about our conversation on life and death.
About what you said.
About how you carry around all the horrible things you were forced to do
Horrible things that won't leave you.
It seems that it would do you good to unload some of that burden.
Things done during war are terrible.
being ordered to kill ... killing to save yourself, killing to save others.
You're right, those are things I know nothing about.
But I do know about forgiveness.
And I've seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins, admitted their guilt and left their burdens behind them.
Stronger men than you!
Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things... and are now at peace.
Well I got to hand it to you, padre, You came here with your guns loaded this time.
Thank you!
- And you're right about one thing.
About stronger men than me, reaching their salvation.
Well, Hallefuckinlujah.
- But you are wrong about something else.
- What's that, Mr. Kowalski?
The thing that haunts a man the most is what he isn't ordered to do.
There, finally, you look like a human being again. .
You shouldn't wait so long between haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch.
Well I am surprised you are still around.
I was always hoping that you die off and they get somebody in here they knew what the hell they are doing.
Instead you just keep hanging around, like the dump wop dago you are.
- That'll be ten dollars, Walt.
- Ten bucks, Jesus Christ, Martin.
What are you half-Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices all the time.
It's been ten bucks for the last five years and you hard-mellows, Pollack son of a bitch.
Keep the change.
- See you in three weeks, prick.
Not if I see you first, dipshit.
That's cool, you know.
Look at this.
You tight ass over here.
Come here girl.
You can't say hi?
Or are you acting like stuck-up and shit.
What are you supposed to be man?
- Yo, it's cool dog.
The fuck are you doing in my neighborhood, boy?
None, Just going to the corner spot, you know get some CDs, sound good, bro?
He called, you bro!
- Come on sound good, bro?
Sound good.
- Shut the fuck up.
Call me bro again, and I'll bite your motherfucking face off .
Yeah, motherfucker.
- Now what the fuck you come down here for?
You here to bring this little present?
Oriental yummy?
Don't worry, I'll take a real good care with her.
Fuck out of here, .
- Fuck out of here, man!
Oh shit, you have a bitch with you.
Keep your ass right here.
Oh great.
Another asshole who has a fetish for Asian girls.
God, it gets so old.
Oh, shit, what's your name girl?
My name?
Get your ass out of here, okay.
It's 'take your crude, overly obvious come-on to every woman who walks past and cram it.'
That's my name.
Who do you think you are talking to?
Who does it look like?
Man she's tough.
- What?
You gonna hit me now?
That'd pretty much complete the picture.
You need to keep your bitch on a leash.
Put a choke chain on her and yank that motherfucker.
Oh, of course, right to the stereotype thesaurus
- Oh yeah
Call me a whore and a bitch in the same sentence.
-Bitch is crazy.
I like her like that
- Now take that bitch.
You don't know when to quit do you, girl?
- Let me teach you a lesson
Stop!
Let me go!
Take your ass over there.
What the fuck are you looking at old man?
What the hell are you spooks up to?
Spooks?
You'd better get your ass on honkey, while I still let you.
That's you'd better do.
What the fuck he thinks he is?
Have you noticed how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't fucking with?
That's me.
You are fucking crazy, get out of here, man.
Why don't you get your ass out of here before we kicked your wrinkly white ass.
What's wrong with him man?
The motherfucker's crazy!
-What is this thing?
What the hell?
Get in a truck.
Crazy motherfucker.
- What's wrong with him, man.
Hey pops come on now.
- Shut your fucking face!
You don't fucking listen, do you?
Now get in a truck.
- Go get in a truck girl.
Let her go, old man!
Shut up pussy.
What is this 'bro' shit anyway?
You want to be superb page, or something
These guy don't want to be your bro and I don't blame them.
Now get your old faint paddy ass on down the road.
Take care now.
You too.
Oh, yeah.
Why didn't you do nothing?
Man you fucking!
Shit man.
If he had cannon at your fucking face, you would do nothing.
What's the matter with you, for Christ sake?
Trying to get yourself killed?
I thought you Asian girls were supposed to be smart.
Hanging around in the neighborhood like that is the fast way to get you in the obituaries.
I know, I know.
Take it easy.
And what about that goofball guy you were with.
Is that a date or something?
Yeah, kind of.
His name is Trey.
- You should be hanging out with them.
You should be hanging out with your own people.
The other Hummongs.
- You mean, Hmong?
Hmong, not Hummong
- Whatever.
What the hell is Hmong, I mean Mong anyway?
Wow, you so enlighten you know that?
No, Hmong is not a place, it is a people.
My people come from different parts of Laos, Thailand and China.
Well how you ended up in my neighborhood?
Why didn't you stay there?
It's Vietnam thing.
We thought on your side And when American quit the communists started killing all the Hmong.
So we came over here.
Yeah, well I don't know how you ended up in Midwest.
Snow on the ground six months in the year.
What is it?
Jungle people wanted to be on great frozen tundra?
Hill people.
We are hill people.
Not jungle people.
BOO-ga, ga-Boo, BOO-ga!
Yeah, whatever ...
Blame the Lutherans.
They brought us up here.
Everybody blames the Lutherans.
Well, you'd think the cold will keep all the idiots out.
Thanks for the ride.
You know something kid, you are all right.
But what about that dimwit brother of yours?
He is little slow or something?
Tao is actually really smart.
He just doesn't know what direction to go in.
Poor toad.
- It is really common.
Hmong girls over here fit in better.
The girls go to college and the boys go to jail.
That old hag hates my ass.
Your birthday today, Daisy.
This year you have to make a choice between two life paths.
Second chances come your way.
Extraordinary events culminate in what might seem to be an anticlimax.
You lucky numbers are: 84, 23, 11, 78 and 99.
What a load of shit.
Yea.
What the hell is it with kids nowadays?
All right.
Let me help you with those.
- Oh, thank you.
How about that?
How about that, Daisy?
It's too heavy for a bag.
- No problem.
Good, Karen, give it to him.
-Here you go.
Well, what is it?
-It's a Gopher.
So you can reach stuff.
It makes things a lot of easier.
This is from me.
It's a phone.
Oh, I can see that.
I just thought...well, we thought that it would make things easier.
Thank you, Karen.
There's nothing wrong with making things less hard on yourself.
You know Karen's right, Dad.
You've worked hard your whole life.
Maybe it's time you start thinking about taking it a easier?
And some other thing, Dad.
You really should get rid of the coffin nails.
We were thinking about the house.
You know, when Mom's gone, it's got to be a lot to maintain around here.
Let alone clean.
And you are here all alone ...
Yeah, you know, there's these great places now, you know, these communities
Where you don't have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow.
You know, People who are like you, active and alert, but are alone.
And would benefit from being around folks their own age.
Yeah Dad, look.
You got to check it out.
We brought some brochures.
These places are nothing like that you think they would be.
They are great.
- No, they are beautiful.
They are really nice They really are.
These are top-notch like resorts.
It is like staying in a hotel, practically.
- They're beautiful.
They really are.
- Yeah.
They care of everything.
They clean up.
They're really nice.
Oh, there are wonderful stores, where you can buy new shoes.
They are amazing, they really are.
You have a good time, play some golf maybe.
Meet other people.
Son of a bitch.
Kicked us out on his birthday.
I've told you that was a bad idea.
I know, you were right
- He won't let anybody help him.
Well, we tried.
Now can we just drop it?
No one can say we didn't try
What the hell with him, we shouldn't have done it.
We should've stayed home with Josh and Ashley.
At least they were smart enough to not come here.
The goddamn kids have more sense than we do.
We miss mom, don't we Daisy?
Hey, Walt.
What are you up to?
We're having a barbecue.
You want to come over?
What do you think?
- There's tons of food.
Just keep you hands off my dog.
-No worries.
We only eat cats.
Really?
- No I am kidding, you moron.
Come on you can be my special guest.
-No, I am fine right here.
Yeah ...
Son of a bitch.
- Okay, so, what have you had to eat today?
I had a piece of cake.
And a little beef jerky.
Come on over and get something to eat.
We've got beer too.
Well ...
I might as well drink with strangers better than drinking alone.
It is my birthday.
Really.
Happy birthday Wally
- Don't call me Wally.
You have no Pabts among the beer.
- As they say, "when in Hmong."
What am I doing wrong?
Every time I look at somebody they always look at the ground.
What is she saying?
- She said welcome to our home.
Oh no, she is not.
- Yes, she didn't.
She hates me.
Yeah, she hates you.
Okay.
What?
!
What are all you fish heads looking at anyway?
I think we should go to other room.
Sorry.
All the people in this house are very traditional.
Number 1.
Never touch a Hmong person on the head, not even a child..
Hmong-people believe that the soul resides on the head.
So, don't do that.
- Sounds dumb, but fine.
And a lot of Hmong people consider looking at someone eye to be very rude.
That's why they look away, when you look at them.
- Anything else?
Yeah, some Hmong people tend to smile or grin when they're yelled at.
It's a cultural thing.
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity, it's not that they're laughing at you, really.
You people are nuts
But the food..
It looks good, smells good too.
-Of course, its Hmong food.
Okay, and I come back in few seconds.
Here you go.
- Thanks.
You mentioned about..
looking at people, he's been staring at me the whole evening.
That's Kor Khue.
He is the Lor's family shaman.
What's that some sort of witch doctor or something.
- Something like that.
Boeki Boo.
- You're funny, Wally.
Kor Khue's interested in you.
He heard what you did.
He would like to read you.
It would be rude not allow him this.
It's a great honor.
Yeah sure.
It's fine by me.
- All right, take a seat.
He says people do not respect you.
They don't even want to look at you.
He says the way you live, your food has no flavor.
You wearied by your life.
You made a mistake.
And you past life is like a mistake what you did.
You are not satisfied with.
He says, you have no happiness in your life.
It's like you are not at peace.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I am fine.
Fine, I am fine.
God, I've got more in common with these gooks than I have with my own spoiled-rotten family.
Jesus Christ ...
Happy Birthday.
Are you ok?
Yeah, I am fine.
You were bleeding.
- No, I bit my tongue.
It's nothing.
Why don't we get down and get some of that good gook food.
I am starving.
Okay.
You ladies are wonderful.
That stuff is really good.
Come on you glutton!
- What's up?
Let's go.
- What for?
To mingle.
- We can mingle right here.
No.
You told me not to leave you alone.
Thank you very much.
I have to go now.
I'll be back.
Don't let me go right of it .
Well, well, look he is over there.
- Yeah, the kid who steal my Gran Torino.
My brother Tao.
- Tried to anyway, yeah, toad.
It was wobby a bit.
But it should fix it.
What's this?
Little rice liquor Here, try it.
All right.
My friends and I were just wondering what you're doing here?
That's a good question.
What am I doing here?
My name is Walt.
- Hey, Walt.
I am Wa Xam.
Wa Yum?
- No Wa Xam.
Wa Xam, Ok.
- So what do you do?
I fix things.
Stuff like that.
- Like what?
I've just fixed that dryer over there.
I fixed my wife's friend sink.
I took old aunt Merry to doctor to get a prescription.
Fixed up.
I've even the fixed the door, what had't even broken yet.
You're funny
I've been called a lot of things, but never funny.
Well, I have to take off.
Enjoy yourself.
- Okay, Yum Yum.
Later.
Come on.
Relax, zipper headed.
I am not gonna shoot you.
I'd look down too if I was you.
You know, I knew you were a dipshit the first time I ever saw you.
You're worse with women than you are with stealing cars, Toad.
It's Tao.
- What?
It's not toad, it's Tao.
My name is Tao.
You were blowing it with that girl who was there.
Not that I give two shits about a Toad like you.
You don't what you are talking about.
You are wrong egg roll.
I know exactly what I am talking about.
I may not be the most pleasant person to be around.
But I got the best woman who was ever on this planet to marry me.
I had to work at it.
That was the best thing that ever happened to me.
Hangs down.
But you ... you know
You let Click Clack, Ding Dong and Charlie Chan just walk out with what's-her-face.
She likes you, you know.
I don't know why.
Who?
Yum yum!
You know that girl in the purple sweater.
She's been looking at you all day, stupid.
Do you mean, Wa Xam?
- Yeah, Yum Yum.Yeah.
Nice girl, very charming girl.
I talked with her.
But you let her just walk right out.
With the three stooges.
And you know why?
Cause you are big, fat pussy.
Well ...
I gotta go.
Good day.
Puss cake.
No, no more.
Okay, put them over there.
No.
No.
No more No more.
No more.
No more, please ...
Is that chicken dumpling thing you brought before?
Alright.
Better than beef jerky all the time.
What's going on?
What's going on?
-Tao is here to make amends.
He is here to work for you.
-No, he isn't.
He's not gonna work for me.
My mom said dishonored the family.
And now he has to work off his dept.
He starts tomorrow morning.
- Oh not tomorrow, not any time.
I don't even want him on my property I thought we went over all that.
It is very important to my mom that you accept.
And that would be an insult if you refuse.
Why is it being put back on me, all of this?
He is the one who tried to steal my car ... all of the sudden I am a bad guy in this thing.
Look my family is very traditional and would be very much upset if you don't let Tao repay.
If you doesn't want to do it, then let's just go.
Shut up!
Yeah, shut up.
All right, tomorrow, tomorrow.
Thank you.
Jesus, Joseph and Mary.
These Hmong broads are like badgers.
Son of a bitch.
I never thought he'd show.
All right, what are you good at?
Like what?
- That's what I am asking.
You gonna work for me, I gotta know what you are good at.
I gotta know what you can do.
- I don't know.
That's kind of half way what I expected you to say.
See that tree right there?
You just go over there and count the birds.
You want me to count the birds?
- Yeah, you can count?
All you slopes are supposed to be good at math, right?
Yeah, I can count.
- Good.
One, two ...
So, what do you have for me to do?
You want me to watch paint dry or maybe count the clouds that pass by?
Don't get flip with me, boy.
I am not the one who is trying to steal, don't you forget that.
Go ahead.
I don't care if you insult me and say racist things.
Cause you know what?
I'll take it.
- Of cause you'll take it.
Cause you have no teeth, you have no balls, kid.
Look, I am stuck here.
Why don't you find something useful for me to do.
Unlike you, I am not useless.
And I maintain my own property.
These swamp rats, on the other hand, you just can help it.
How long do I have you for?
Toad, how long?
Till next Friday.
All right.
Go get the ladder out of the garage.
When you got finished with that roof there.
You can take that gutter, and nail it back up.
I am tired looking at it for the last three years.
Yeah, you said it, brother.
Hello.
Grandpa says he want to know if you can have Tao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch?
Wasp nest?
That's terrible.
I think we can handle that after the lunch.
Lord All Mighty, knock it off.
It's my last day.
What else do have for me do?
Take a day-off.
You did enough.
Toad!
Nothing.
Nevermind.
Kowski?
Kowski?
Kowski?
Mr. Kowalski?
Good morning.
I looked over your paperwork and I think we should immediately start a full battery of tests
I feel that this would be the best way to go about checking all the issues that you've had.
Excuse me, what happened to Dr.Felmon, my regular doctor?
Dr. Felmon retired three years ago.
I am his replacement Dr. Chang.
It's grandpa Walt.
- Pick it up.
You talk to him!
Mitch.
I'm doing bills here.
- You talk to him, he is yours father.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Mitch.
It's me your dad.
Yeah, I know.
What's up?
Oh, nothing, nothing much really.
How is everything going?
I am fine, fine.
How about Karen and the kids?
Fine, everybody is great.
Doing fine.
Good.
How about work?
Busy.
Yeah, I suppose...
In fact, um, speaking of busy.
I got a lot on my plate right now, so if it is not something pressing.
No, not it all.
Why don't you call me this weekend?
Sure.
Ok, It was nice talking to you.
Thanks for talk.
Thanks.
This kid doesn't have a chance.
What do you know about faucets?
I know a lot about them, boy.
Tender side.
Jesus.
For the love of Pete.
- What?
It must be a hundred degrees here.
Just, turn on the fan.
This place is wobbling apart.
Where did you get all the stuff?
What are you talking about?
- All the tools and stuff.
Well, may come as surprise to a thief, but I bought this stuff.
Everything in here with my own money.
Yeah, yeah.
This is not what I meant.
I mean this is so much shit packed in here.
Yeah, well.
Every tool in here has a purpose.
Everything has a job to do.
They are all used when necessary.
- Okay, so, what is that?
it is a post hole digger.
- That
Vice-grips.
Wire cutters, you know that's a trowel.
There is shears right there, and that's a saw.
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me kid.
Alright, what's on your mind.
It's just..
I can't afford to buy all this stuff.
Well, I guess, even a bonehead like you, could understand... that a man acquires it over the period of 50 years.
Yeah, but...
All right, look, here.
These three items right here, you can have this.
WD-40, vice grips and some duck tape.
Any man who is worth his salt, can do half of the house chores with just those three things.
Anything else you need you just borrow it, that's all.
Ok, cool.
Fuck me.
- What's with that?
Nothing.
What?
Nothing, huh?
I just saw you've coughed out blood.
That's not good.
You should really see a doctor.
Look..
Those guys over here, the other night ... on my lawn, what a bout them?
- Just a gang.
A bunch of Hmong gang bangers.
I assume that.
What they were doing here?
They were going to take me away.
They were kind of pissed, that I blew my first initiation.
Yeah, well you are, you are a pussy.
You wanna hang out with guys like that.
What was your initiation supposed to be?
My Gran Torino?
Toad, you got a minute?
Here it is.
Here is the deal.
I take the top, cause that's the heaviest.
I'll pull on that.
And you stand right back here, and you push.
And help me push it up each step.
like that.
- Then, let me take the top.
No, no, I've got a top.
No, I'll take the top.
It looks pretty heavy.
Look I am not crippled.
I've got the top.
If you don't let me take the top.
I ain't helping.
I will go back home.
Listen to me, zipper head.
No, you listen, old man!
I am here because you need help.
So it is either top of I am out of here.
All right, you take the top and I'll push.
Don't let it slip off you little girl hands and crush me.
Don't give me any ideas.
That thing weighs a ton.
Runs like a clock.
They don't make them like this anymore.
So what are you going to do with it?
- Sell it I guess.
How much?
- 60 bucks.
I am tired of having this sit around down in the basement there.
Why?
You are looking for a freezer?
Our downstairs one kind of died.
- Okay, 25 bucks and it's yours.
25?
You've just said 60.
I know, it will save me money putting an ad in the paper.
Come on, let haul it over your place.
Kind of ironic, huh?
- What?
Toad washing a car they tried to steal from you.
Yeah, he misses one spot.
He is doing it all over again too.
It is nice of you to kind look after him like this.
He doesn't have any real role models in his life.
Well, I am not a role model.
But you are a good man, Wally.
I wish our father would have been more like you.
Don't go calling me Wally.
No, I am serious.
He was really hard on us.
Really traditional... and really old school.
Well, I am old school.
yeah, but you an American.
What's that supposed to me?
You like him, don't you?
- Are you kidding?
He tried to steal my car.
And you spend time with him, teaching him how to fix things.
Saved him from a fucked cousin of ours...
- Hey, what you language lady.
And you're a good man
- I am not a good man.
Give me another beer, dragon lady.
This one is empty.
You know, Hmong consider gardening to be a woman's work.
Yeah, that probably why I see in the garden over there all the time.
Besides we ain't in Hu-Mong.
- Funny.
You know you should quit.
That's bad for you.
Yeah?
So it is being in a gang, dipshit.
Didn't you hear what I've just said?
I saw you coughed out blood.
You should quit.
What's that emblem supposed to mean anyway?
Your ancient camp scout emblem?
1'st cavalry.
I've had it since 1951.
So what you wanna do with you life kid.
I was thinking maybe sales.
So you wanna be in sales?
What about going to school, maybe.
But school costs money.
Maybe you should get a job.
You can't just sit there and spread mulch in my garden for the rest of your life.
Maybe you can just pay me.
Yeah, very funny.
What kind of job could I ever get?
- Yeah you're right, nobody would ever hire you.
Look I am just kidding zip...
I mean.
You can get a job.
You can get a job everywhere.
Like what?
How about construction?
- Me?
Yeah.
- Construction?
Yeah.
- Do you have Alzheimer's or something?
.
No, get a job in the construction.
I know people in the trades.
Of course I have to make a little adjustment and man you up a little bit.
Man me up?
- Yeah.
And I think you ought to date Miss Yum Yum too.
Do you little good.
Get carbon off the vaults.
Now you just gonna learn, how guys talk.
You just listen the way Martin and I banter back and forth.
You okay?
You are ready?
- Sure.
Let's go in.
Perfect.
A pollack and a chink.
How are you doing, Martin, you crazy Italian prick.
Walt, you cheap bastard, I should have known you'd come in,
I was having such a pleasant day
- What did you do?
Jew some poor blind guy out of his money.
Giving him a wrong change?
- Who's the nip?
He is a pussy kid from next door.
I am just trying to man him up a little bit.
You see kid?
That's how guys talk to one another .
They do?
-Do you have shit in your ears?
Now go out and come back in and talk to him like a man.
Like a real man.
Come on.
Get your ass out of here.
Come on back now.
Sorry about this.
That's ok.
What's up you old Italian prick?
Get out of my shop before I blow your head off you goddamn dick smoker.
Jesus Christ.
Shit.
Take it easy.
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
That's what you said.
That what you said men say.
You don't just come in and insult a man in his own shop.
What happens if you meet some stranger?
If you get the wrong one he's gonna blow you gook head right off.
What should I've said then?
- Why don't you start with Hi or Hello.
Yeah just come in and say: 'Sir, I'd like a haircut if you have a time'
Yeah, be polite but don't kiss ass.
In fact you can talk about the construction job you just came from.
And bitch about your girl friend in your car.
Son of a bitch, I've just got breaks fixed and those sons of the bitches really nailed me.
They screwed right in the ass.
Yeah, don't swear at the guy.
Just talk about people who are not in the room.
You can bitch about your boss making you work overtime when it is bowling night.
Right, my old lady bitches for two goddamn hours about how..
they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store.
and the minute I turn on a fucking game she starts crying we never talk.
See now go out, come back and talk to him.
And it ain't a rocket science for Christ sake.
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car, or a girlfriend.
Jesus, I should have blown his head off when I had a chance.
Maybe so, I want you to turn around and go outside and come back and don't talk about having no job, no car, no girlfriend, no future, no dick.
Ok, just turn around and go.
Excuse me sir, I need a hair cut if you ain't too busy.
You old Italian son of a bitch prick barber.
Boy, does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job.
Fuck me.
All set to go through with this, right?
- Yeah, yeah.
Don't yeah, yeah me.
Just say:
Yes sir and I'll do my best.
Yes, I'll do my best.
- Cause when I vouch for somebody that means I am give them my word.
I don't want you making me look bad.
No I am good.
Totally into this.
Don't lay down either.
Just look em straight in the eye.
And a man can tell a lot by your handshake.
Here, put those in your back pocket.
- Cool.
Don't blow this.
Hey, Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon.
How the hell are you?
I am shitty.
But who's gonna listen?
- Not me, that's for sure.
Help yourself there, Walt.
You dumb pollack.
Ok this is the kid, I was telling you about.
Tao, this is Tim Kennedy, he is super on this job.
What we got here, Walt?
Well he knows construction and he is a smart kid.
He'll do anything you need him for.
You sure?
- Yeah.
You speak English?
- Yes, sir.
Were you born here?
- You bet.
I see that Walt drove you here.
You got a vehicle?
Not at the moment.
Taking a bus for now.
- Bus?
Jesus Christ.
You don't have a car?
My head gasket cracked and the goddamned pricks at the shop wants to bend me over for $2100
Oh please.
I just replaced the tranny in my Tahoe and the sons a bitches fucked me hard, just under $3200.
Goddamned thieves.
It ain't right.
- You got that right.
Come on in on Monday and we'll find something for you to do.
Thanks, Mr. Kennedy.
That's Tim, and what's you name again?
- Tao.
T. .., okay.
You owe me one, Walt.
Well I'll buy a fruit cake for Christmas.
Fuck a fruit cake.
How about you just hand over the keys to that Gran Torino.
What the hell does everybody want my car?
- Yeah, I am not surprised.
Yeah, you don't know a half of it.
Alright, come on, zipper head.
Let the Mick stay here and play with himself.
What are we doing?
What do you want to do?
Carry you tools in a rice bag?
Here.
You can use one of these ... and you'll need one of this here.
I can't afford any of this.
I'll cover it.
You can pay me back with your first pay check.
Cool
- Here, we need something like that.
This is what I am looking for here, tool belt.
There you go.
Not to bitch.
But won't I be needing some tools.
Tools I've got but I am not going to lend you my tool belt.
You can pick up tools as you go.
I really appreciate all this.
- Forget it.
No, I really do Thank you.
What's up homeboy, what are you doing?
What up man?
- What you got, punk?
Checking up on my little cousin.
- Yeah, man.
My little cousin ...
What's this?
Where you come from man?
- I am coming
Home from work I know you guys don't know much about that.
So that's true, you got a job.
- You can't just leave me alone?
What?
He is scared, huh?
Who bought this shit for you?
Your dad?
- What you guys want with me?
Your dad bought this shit for you?

- Hey come on, this is my stuff.
You wanna smoke man?
Fuck it.

What's the phrase I am looking for?
Oh yeah, 'saving face'
Hey, there.
Hey.
I gotta run.
Haven't seen you for a few days.
Where you've been?
Been busy.
Busy, huh?
What the hell happened to you?
- Don't worry about it.
What do you mean don't worry about it.
Look at your goddamn face.
I said don't worry about it.
Okay, it's not your problem.
When?
Grabbed me a couple of days ago right after I go off work.
Cowards.
I did everything I can possibly do.
But they broke some of your tools.
I will replace them.
Don't worry about the tools.
Where is your cousin lives?
No, Walt.
I'll be ok.
I don't want you to do anything.
- Right,.
You could need extra tools, you just let me know.
Well, I could use a roofing hammer.
-Good, go in my garage and get it.
This should be the last stop.
Here is the deal.
You stay away from Tao, understand?
You tell your friends to stay away from Tao.
You want to fight with us than I could sound don't want to see him anymore.
That's it, got it?
I'll take that as yes.
Cause if I have to come back here it is gonna get fucking ugly.
Get off of my way.
How do you want your dog?
I mean steak?
Funny.
I told you we only eat cats.
I've never seen you like this before.
Well I am feeling good.
I god beautiful women, great food.
And Tao.
And even Tao isn't bugging me.
You are having a good time, I see.
-Yeah.
And it never ends.
What happened to your knuckles anyways?
I slipped in a shower.
No big problem.
Look Yum-Yum if he doesn't ask you out I will ask you out.
Wa Xam, don't listen to him.
He is a white devil.
Yeah, I am.
I am a white devil.
I've loved to Walt, but he beat you to it.
Really?
No kidding!
Dinner and a movie, or what?
Yeah, they are taking a bus.
No, you can't take a bus.
You gonna get you something more stylish that that.
Like what?
Take a limo?
How about that?
The Gran Torino?
- Yeah.
You'd let me take the Gran Torino.
- Yeah, I let you take the Gran Torino.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Is everybody all right?
Tao!
It's all right.
Where's grandma?
Where is Sue?
Where is Sue?
- She went to our aunts.
To her aunts?
Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Get on the phone and call her right now.
Sue ...
I knew, this was gonna happen.
What the hell am I doing here?
Maybe some of her friends called her and she changed her plans.
Yeah.
At the war we just all of us lost a lot of friends but you gotta stand for it.
You can care to it.
Mr. Kowalski?
Are you Ok?
Yeah, I am Ok.
Police finally left, no one is talking.
One thing about Hmong, they keep their mouths shut.
Yeah, I've noticed that.
You know, Tao and Sue will never gonna find peace in this world as long as those gangs around.
Until they go away.
You know forever.
What are you saying?
You know what I am saying.
I took Sue to the hospital.
She is scared.
They are all scared..
Yeah
Tao especially.
He's sitting out there right now staring at your front door.
You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.
What would you do?
What should Tao do?
I know what I would do if I was you.
Or at least what you think you should do.
- Really
If I was Tao I guess I'd wanted vengeance.
I'd wanted to stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys.
And you?
- What would I do?
I'd come over here and talk to you I guess.
I know you are close with these people, but this pisses me off too.
Mr.Kowalski.
Wanna beer?
- I'd love one.
There some in the chest, right over there behind you.
Damn all this.
It just isn't fair.
- Nothing is fair, father.
So what you gonna do, Mr. Kowalski?
Call me Walt.
All right.
What you gonna do, Walt?
I don't know.
But I'll think of something.
Whatever it is, they won't have a chance.
What are you doing?
Thinking.
Thinking.
Thinking time is over.
Now it's time to knock shit out of these pricks.
I know you don't want to hear this, but now it's the time to stay calm.
Calm?
You want me to be calm?
We stay calm or else mistakes will get made.
We have to step back from this thing.
No, don't let me down Walt.
Not you.
This is gonna end today.
Sit down.
I don't want to sit.
I said sit down.
Now, listen to me.
We gotta plan this and plan it very carefully.
Can't make any mistakes.
You know I am the right man for this job.
I want to go home and stay calm, and come back here at 4 this afternoon.
And this to be done will be done.
I say we go now, Right now.
And what?
Kill that cousin of yours and the rest of those zips.
Mr. Tough Guy is out for blood all of the sudden.
I know nothing about it.
Now go home.
You stay calm come back here at 4.
Ok?
Okay.
I know, I know.
Give me a break, please, it's the first time I've ever smoked in the house.
Let a man enjoy himself,would you girl.
All finished. 10 dollars American.
I don't suppose your guinea hands are steady enough to do a straight shave?
- Straight shave?
You've never asked about straight shave ever.
I know but I always wondered about it.
That's unless you are too busy.
No, just let me heat up a towel.
Here is 20.
Keep the change.
It is just in case you hit my jugular.
Yes sir, It gonna take about one hour.
We gonna shorten these sleeves little bit.
Gonna fix at the shoulder.
I never had a suited suit before.
Yes sir, look very good.
Yes, sir.
Look very good.
What can I do for you, Mr. Kowalski?
- I am here for a confession.
Lord Jesus, what have you done?
- Nothing you just take it easy now.
What are you up to?
Are you gonna give a confession or not?
How long has it been since your last confession?
Forever.
Bless me father, for I have sinned.
What are your sins, my son?
In 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski at the factory Christmas party.
Dorothy was in the other room with the other wives.
it just happened.
Yes, go on.
Well, I made 900 dollars profit selling a boat and motor.
I didn't pay the taxes it is the same as stealing.
Yes, fine.
Lastly...
I was never very close with my two sons.
I don't know them.
I didn't know how.
That's it?
- That's it.
It's bothered me most of my life.
Say 10 "Hail Maries" and 5 "Our fathers".
God loves and forgives you and absolves you of all your sins.
In the name of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.
Thank you padre.
Are you going to retaliate for what happened to Sue.
I'm going over to that house today, Mr. Kowalski.
Is that so?
- It is.
And every other day until you see the folly of what you are planning.
Busy day, gotta go.
- Go in peace.
Oh I am at peace.
Jesus Christ.
So which one is mine?
You ever fired a weapon before?
- No
Why don't you put that one down.
I got something more to show you.
What?
In 1952 we were sent to take out a chink machine gun nest.
They trod us up pretty good.
I was the only one who came back out there.
For that they gave me a silver star.
Here it is.
Here I want you to have it.
Why?
Because we all knew the danger that night.
But we went anyway.
That's the way it might be tonight.
There is always a chance you don't come back.
The hell we won't.
We're will roll in there and tear ass.
Yeah, that's foolish.
That's the exact reaction they are waiting for.
Come on and close this up.
How many?
- How many what?
How many men did you kill in Korea?
13, maybe more.
-What was it like to kill a man.
You don't want to know.
Now close it up.
Walt!
Walt!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Relax, you can't get out of there.
You let me out right now !
Let me out.
You fuck let me out, I'll fucking kill you.
Shut the fuck up!
You want to know what is like to kill a man?
Well, that's goddamn awful.
The only thing worse is get a medal of valor for killing some poor kids..
that wanted just to give up that's all
Yeah, some scared little gook just like you.
I shot them right in a face with that rifle you were holding in there a while ago.
So if the day goes by that I don't think about it.
You don't that on your soul.
I got blood on my hands.
I am soiled.
That's why I am going alone tonight.
Walt you take me with you right now, let me out.
Look, you've come a long way.
I am proud to say that you are my friend.
But you got your whole life ahead of you.
But me, I finished things.
That's what I do and I am going alone.
No, wait.
Walt!
Walt!
I need you to watch my dog.
Yeah I love you too.
Yeah, she is old too.
Her name is Daisy.
Hello.
- It is Walt.
The keys to my house are under the ceramic turtle on the from porch.
Let yourself in.
Your brother is in the basement.
I gotta go.
Sorry father, we have to go.
I am telling if we are not here there will be a bloodshed.
We've been here for hours.
We can't afford to anchor a unit down to one location.
I am bagging you to stay.
Just got a word from my sergeant, we're pulling the plug.
I am staying.
No you aren't.
We have specific orders you came with us, you are leaving with us.
Watch your head.
Sue, over here, over here.
Unlock this right now.
He left without me.
He went to Smokie without me.
Tao!
Any swamp rats in there.
I didn't know your ass would came.
-Shut up, gook.
I have nothing to say to you, shrimp dick, lizard like you.
Yeah, yeah.
You go ahead watch out for your boyfriend.
Cause it was either he or you or something who raped one of their own family.
You own blood, for Christ sake.
Now go ahead and pull those pistols, like miniature cowboys.
Go ahead.
So where's Tao at?
That pussy motherfucker not gonna come.
Don't worry about Tao.
Tao's got not one second for you.
Says who?
You?
What the fuck you gonna do, old man?
What are you gonna do?
You bitch.
-
Kind of jumpy, aren't we?
- Shut the fuck up.
You should the fuck up!
Got a light?
- What the fuck?
No
Me..
I've got a light...
'Hail Mary, full of grace..'
Yes, sergeant.
What happened?
- You need to step back.
He is a friend of mine.
- He said step back.
Hey, did you hear him.
Step back.
What happened?
- Hey, step back.
He is my friend.
Officer Chang!
get those people back.
- Hey, step back now, Ok.
Get the fuck out of here!
Walt Kowalski once said to me that I didn't know anything about life or death.
Because I was an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who held the hands of superstitious old women and promised they eternity.
Walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it.
But he was right.
I knew really nothing about life or death, until I got to know Walt.
And boy did I learn.
And I want to leave my house to the church becouse Dorothy would've liked it now which brings to out last item .
And again please excuse the language.
in Mr. Kowalski's will, I'm simply reading it as it was written.
And I'd like to leave my 1972 Gran Torino to ... my friend ...
Tao Vang Lor.
Under the condition that you don't choptop top the roof like one of those beaners don'tpaintanyidioticflameson it like some white-trash hillbilly anddon'tputabiggayspoileron the rear end like you see on all the other zipper heads' cars

subtitles by MoCuishle
I'm real sorry about Dorothy Walt.
She was a real peach.
Thanks for coming, Al.
Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
Father.
Spirit.
Uh.
Holy Spirit.
It's okay, I can move down.
Spectacles, testicles, wallet, and watch.
Look at the way the old man glared at Ashley.
Can't even tone it down for Mom's funeral.
What do you expect?
Dad's still living in the '50s.
He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly.
Well, your kid's wearing a Lions jersey.
I'm sure Dad appreciates that.
The point is that there's nothing anyone can do that won't disappoint the old man.
It's inevitable.
You know, that's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings.
You know, that deal with the boat motor, the broken birdbath.
It's always something.
What are we gonna do with him?
Don't you think he's gonna get in trouble, all by himself in the old neighborhood?
Well, why don't you have him move in with you?
Ha, ha, ha.
Hey Shh.
Death is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics.
Bitter in the pain, sweet in the salvation.
Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased and their families.
Sweet to those of us who know the salvation that awaits.
And some may ask, "What is death?
Is it the end?
Or is it the beginning?
And what is life?
What is this thing we call life?"
- All these questions can frustrate you.
- Ashley, stop it.
That's why you have to turn to the Lord.
Jesus.
Because the Lord is the sweetness...
This is so good.
- Did you have a chance to call Martha?
Is that Dad?
- No.
That's Grandpa Walt.
"Third platoon, E company March 2nd, 1952, Korea"?
Where's Korea?
A lot of people showed up after the service.
Well, I suppose they heard there's gonna be a lot of ham.
I'll go down in the basement and get some chairs.
- Oh, I can do that, Dad.
- No, I need them now, not next week.
Cool, I found a medal.
Look at this.
How much longer do we have to stay?
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell, and I'm bored.
Ashley why don't you go help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?
- Me?
- Yes, you.
Go.
Go help him.
Grandpa Walt, would you like some help with this?
With your chairs?
No.
You probably just painted your nails.
Honey come here.
Okay, well, your dad is driving me crazy.
- Why did you make me do that?
- It's okay.
We're leaving soon.
Hey, girl.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come with me.
How many swamp rats can you get in one room?
Wow.
Grandpa, when did you get the vintage car?
1972.
I never knew you had a cool old car.
Yeah.
Well, it's been here since before you were born.
So what are you gonna do with it when you, like, die?
What about that super-cool retro couch you have in the den?
Because I'm going to state next year and it would look really good in my room, and I don't have any furniture at all
Oh, God.
- Who are you?
What do you want?
- Hi.
- I live...
- Get the shit out of your mouth.
- Tell me what you want.
- Do you have jumper cables?
- My uncle's car is old and...
- We don't have any cables.
And have some respect, zipperhead.
We're in mourning here
- How you holding up, Walt?
- Mr. Kowalski.
Huh?
Mr. Kowalski, that's my name.
Right.
Mr. Kowalski.
Your wife and I became quite close these last few months.
She asked that I watch over you when she passed on.
I told her I watch over my flock.
But she made me promise I'd keep an extra-sharp eye on you.
Look, I appreciate the kindness you've shown to my wife.
Now that you've spoken your piece why don't you go tend to some of your other sheep?
Okay
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her desire for you to go to confession.
She said she couldn't remember the last time you went.
- Is that so?
- It is.
Well, I confess that I never really cared for church very much.
The only reason I went was because of her.
And I confess that I have no desire to confess to a boy that's just out of the seminary.
Great to see you.
- Bye, dear.
- So long, Walt.
Walt, can you get it started?
- Yeah, it'll be fine.
I wish I could help, Dad, but I gotta get the kids home.
- Kids are getting restless.
- Yeah, fine.
Just go.
I'll call you, see how you're doing.
All right.
Kill you to buy American?
Jesus.
Did you see the way he looked at the truck?
It's always rice-burner this, Jap-burner that, you know?
- Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go.
- He didn't say anything.
- He didn't need to.
- What do you expect?
The man worked at Ford all those years.
- I suppose that's my goddamn fault.
- Just give it a rest, just drive, okay?
Kids, want the radio on?
Anyone wanna listen to some music?
Good.
Damn barbarians.
I'm just so brokenhearted.
I want my daughter to find another husband.
If she married again there would be a man in the house.
What about Thao?
The man of the house is right there.
Look at him washing dishes.
He does whatever his sister orders him to do.
How could he ever become the man of the house?
Be patient, once he's older, he will be the man of the house.
No way.
Today is a blessed day, for a child is born.
I offer food to nurture this child's body.
I offer clothing to protect this child's flesh.
The child is blessed with a mother and father.
Oh, spirit of this child return home and do not wander anymore.
Come home, spirit and soul, come home.
Live a good life and grow old.
Jesus Polarski would roll over in his grave if he could see his lawn now.
What the hell did Chinks have to move into this neighborhood for?
Why does that old white man stay here?
All the Americans have moved out of this neighborhood.
Why haven't you gone?
Why don't you strut away you dumb rooster?
Are you gone completely deaf or something?
Hi there, Walt.
I'm not a friend of yours, so why do you insist on calling me Walt?
Sorry.
Mr. Kowalski.
- What are you peddling today Padre?
- Nothing I thought I'd drop by and see you.
I haven't seen you in church.
Now that you've done your good deed, why don't you take off down the road?
- I'd really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.
- Not in this lifetime, sonny.
Why Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
- You don't wanna know.
- No, I do
Well, I think you're an over-educated 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold hands of ladies who are superstitious and promises them eternity.
Yo!
Hey!
Is you...?
Is you a boy or is you a girl, man?
I can't tell.
Hey chinito, hey if you was in the pen I'd be fucking you in the ass.
You'd be my bitch.
What are you reading, Jackass and the Rice Stalk?
Yeah, that's right, keep walking!
Keep walking!
Look at me when I talk to you, homes!
Fucking slopes, man, everywhere you look, man.
Slopes everywhere we go, man.
- Go back to your rice paddy.
What you looking at, man?
- That's my little cousin over there.
- You sure that's your cousin, man?
- Fuck, yeah, that's my little cousin.
- He tight with anybody?
No, he flies solo, man.
You wanna do something?
Man, let's go down there and see what the fuck they doing over there.
I like your sandals too.
- Hey Yo, what's up?
What's up?
- Yo, what's up, motherfuckers?
They fucking with you?
Man, fuck you, homeboy!
- What you got?
- Hey, we can do this right now.
- You go fucking back to your country.
- Fuck you, man.
Oh, good, more fucking rice niggers.
Aren't you supposed to cook me some Chinese food, huh?
- How many bullets you got?
- We'll catch you on the rebound, homey.
Thao!
- Come on, man.
Get in the car, man.
Thao.
- Get with us, man.
- Get in the car.
Fuck, man, get in the car, man.

Come on.
Nice.
Yeah, my little cousin being a little man.
Whoa.
Yo, now, that's a nice car.
Hell, yeah. 1972 Gran Torino, fastback.
- Yo.
- Cobra jet engine.
Yo, man, it's still in mint condition.
Yo, man.
It's in mint condition, man.
Oh, I've got one.
There's a Mexican, a Jew, and a colored guy go into a bar.
The bartender looks up and says, "Get the fuck out of here."
So here's where my flock congregates when they're not in church.
Hey, father J.
Hi, Mel.
Hey there, Darrell.
- Hello, Father.
- Hi, Walt.
What brings you in here, Father?
The meat raffle?
No, I just came down to talk to Walt, if that's okay
Damn, Padre, you are persistent, aren't you?
I promised your wife.
All right.
Let's get a booth.
I'll have a Pabst and a shot of Jack and whatever he's having.
- I'll have a Diet Coke.
- Bullshit, this is a bar.
You have a drink.
- Um, I'll have a gin and tonic.
- Attaboy.
So what do you want?
I promised your wife I'd get you to go to confession.
Now, why would you do that?
She was very insistent. she made me.
You're kind of fond of promising things you can't deliver on.
Right, Father?
- Let's talk about something else.
- What?
Life and death.
Life and death.
What the hell do you know about life and death?
I'd like to think I know a lot.
I'm a priest.
Yeah.
You get up and preach about life and death but all you know is what you learned in priest school
Right out of the rookie preacher's handbook
I don't know about that.
I think...
Death is bittersweet.
Sort of bitter in its pain, but sweet in its salvation.
That's what you know about life and death, and it's pathetic
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?
I know a lot.
I lived for almost three years in Korea with it.
Thanks
We shot men stabbed them with bayonets, hacked 17-year-olds to death with shovels.
Stuff I'll remember till the day I die.
Horrible things, but things I'll live with.
And what about life?
Well, I survived the war.
Got married, had a family.
Sounds like you know a lot more about death than you do living.
Maybe so, Father.
Maybe so.
Son of a bitch.
Come on, get in the car!
Thao, what the fuck?
Get in!
- Get in, Thao.
- Come on, let's go Get in.
fuck, man?
Get in!
- Hello?
- Hey Morning, Dad.
It's your number one son, Mitch.
Morning?
It's after 1 in the afternoon, it's not morning.
Oh, right.
Afternoon, then.
So, what do you want?
What?
No.
Nothing.
I mean, what would I want?
Well, I don't know.
Your wife's already gone through all your mother's jewelry.
No, Dad, I'm just calling to see how you're doing.
Just...
Anything new with the old neighborhood?
Yeah.
No.
Great.
Smooth sailing.
Yeah.
- Okay good.
Good, then.
Oh, hey Dad.
- Yeah
You wouldn't happen to still know that guy that has the Lions season tickets?
Oh, you fuck.
Dad...
Ain't she sweet.
Come on, girl.
Yo, what's up?
What are you guys doing out here, man?
Nothing.
- Minding our own business.
Just hanging out.
What are you guys doing here?
- What?
- I told you guys already...
Can't I just come hang out with my little cousin?
Huh?
We have good news for you, man.
Oh, really And what's that?
Only for guy talk.
- I don't think so.
- Why not?
Come on, man.
We gonna give you another shot, man.
- Don't go, Thao.
- Mind your own business, girl.
- Come on, let's go.
- Come
- Yeah, what are you gonna do, huh?
- Come on, dog.
Look You've broken Daddy's gnome.
What the hell is this?
Get up.
- Get off my lawn.
Listen, old man, you don't wanna fuck with me.
Did you hear me?
I said, get off my lawn now.
Are you fucking crazy Go back in the house.
Yeah.
I blow a hole in your face, and then I go in the house.
And I sleep like a baby You can count on that.
We used to stack fucks like you five feet high in Korea use you for sandbags.
Okay
- But you better watch your back.
- Fuck it, man, he's crazy.
We'll get this cracker next time.
Thank you.
Get off my lawn.
What the hell is this?
Christ.
No, no.
No, no, no.
Come on, no more.
No more.
No more What...?
Stay right there. stay right there.
Why can't you just leave me alone?
We brought you some shallots to plant.
- I don't want them.
- They're perennials.
- They come back every year.
- Why are you bringing me all this garbage?
Because...
- Because you saved Thao.
- I didn't save anybody.
I just...
I kept a bunch of jabbering gooks off of my lawn, that's all.
- You're a hero to the neighborhood.
- I'm not a hero.
They think you are.
That's why they keep bringing you gifts.
- Please, take them.
- They're wrong.
Now, I just want to be left alone.
Thank you.
Wait.
This is my mom, Vu, I'm Sue, and that's my brother, Thao.
- We live next door.
- So?
Thao wants to say something.
I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?
- For trying to steal your car.
Let me tell you something, boy.
You step on this property again, you're done.
Good afternoon, Walt.
I told you I'm not going to confession.
- Why didn't you just call the police?
- What?
I do work with some of the Hmong gangs.
...and I heard there was trouble in the neighborhood.
Why didn't you call the police?
Well...
You know, I prayed that they would show up but nobody answered.
What were you thinking?
Someone could have been killed We're talking life and death here.
When things go wrong, you gotta act quickly.
When we were in Korea and a thousand screaming gooks came across our line we didn't call the police, we reacted.
We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski.
I've been thinking about our conversation on life and death.
About what you said.
About how you carry around all the horrible things you were forced to do horrible things that won't leave you.
It seems it would do you good to unload some of that burden.
Things done during war are terrible.
Being ordered to kill.
Killing to save yourself, killing to save others.
You're right.
Those are things I know nothing about but I do know about forgiveness and I've seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins admitted their guilt, and left their burdens behind them.
Stronger men than you.
Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things and are now at peace.
Well, I gotta hand it to you, Padre.
You came here with your guns loaded this time.
Thank you.
And you're right about one thing.
About stronger men than me reaching their salvation.
Well, halle-fucking-lujah.
But you're wrong about something else.
What's that, Mr. Kowalski?
The thing that haunts a man the most is what he isn't ordered to do.
There.
You finally look like a human being again.
You shouldn't wait so long between haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch.
Yeah.
Well, I'm surprised you're still around.
I was always hoping you'd die and they' d get somebody who knew what they were doing.
Instead you just keep hanging around like the doo-wop dago you are.
- That'll be 10 bucks, Walt.
- Ten bucks?
Jesus Christ, Martin.
What are you, half Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices.
It's been 10 bucks for the last five years, you hard-nosed, Polack son of a bitch.
- Yeah, well, keep the change.
- See you in three weeks, prick.
Not if I see you first, dipshit.
Since everything could go downhill after that.
- Yeah, that's true.
- That would suck.
- That's cool, you know?
Yeah.
- Ain't shit going on, man.
Ain't shit going on.
Man, look at this.
Look at this, Monk.
Check this out.
Oooh.
Boy.
- Oh, yeah.
Bring that little tight ass over here.
Come here, girl.
Don't be shy.
What, you can't say hi?
Why you acting all stuck-up and shit?
- What you supposed to be, man?
- Yo, it's cool, dog.
What the fuck you doing in my neighborhood, boy?
Nothing.
Just going down to Corner Spot, you know?
Get some CDs.
It's all good, bro.
See, he called you bro, Duke.
- He called you bro, man.
- It's all good, bro.
It's all good, huh?
- Shut the fuck up.
Call me bro again, man, I'll bite your motherfucking face off.
Yeah, motherfucker.
Now, what the fuck y'all come down here for?
You here to bring me this little present?
Monk?
she bringing it to us?
This little Oriental yummy.
Don't worry.
I'm gonna take real good care of her.
- Fuck out of here, man.
- Fuck out of here, man.
- I told you we're finished here.
- Oh, yeah.
Keep your ass right here.
Oh, great.
Another asshole who has a fetish for Asian girls?
God, that gets so old.
Oh, shit.
- What's your name, girl?
My name?
Get your ass out of here, okay?
It's "Take your crude come-on to every woman who walks past and cram it." That's my name.
Mouthy little bitch.
- Who you think you talking to?
- Who does it look like?
- You think you real funny don't you?
- Oh, shit.
Ain't she tough?
What?
You gonna hit me now?
That would pretty much complete the picture.
You need to keep your bitch on a leash.
Put a chain on that whore and yank that motherfucker.
Of course.
Right to the stereotype thesaurus.
Call me a whore and a bitch in the same sentence.
- This bitch is crazy
- I like them like that.
Man, take this bitch.
Hey.
Get off me.
- You don't know when to quit, do you?
- I'm gonna teach her a lesson.
Stop.
Let go.
Get your ass over there.
What the fuck you looking at, old man?
- What the hell are you spooks up to?
- Spooks?
You better get your ass on, honky while I still let you.
- That's what you better do.
- That's right, bitch.
Fuck you think you at?
Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while that you shouldn't have fucked with?
That's me.
Man, you fucking crazy man.
Get out of here, man.
Why don't you get your ass up out of here before I kick your old, wrinkly, white ass?
Crazy motherfucker, man.
What's wrong with him, man?
What the fuck?
- This motherfucker crazy, man.
- What's wrong with this nigga, man?
What the hell?
Get in the truck.
This crazy motherfucker, man.
What's wrong with him, man?
He put his finger at us.
- Oh, shit.
- Come on, now.
Hey, pops Come on, now.
Shut your fucking face.
You fucking don't listen, do you?
Now, get in the truck.
- Go on, get in the truck now.
Shit.
- Way to go, old man.
Shut up, pussy.
What is all this "bro" shit, anyway?
Want to be Super Spade or something?
These guys don't want to be your bro and I don't blame them.
Now, get your ofay, Paddy ass on down the road.
Take care, now.
Yeah, you too.
Oh, yeah.
fuck, man, why y 'all didn't fucking do nothing?
- Man, kick that nigga's ass.
- Man, you fucking...
Shit, man.
This fucker.
He had that cannon in your fucking face.
- You didn't do nothing.
- Trying to stay out.
What's the matter with you, for chrissake?
Trying to get yourself killed?
I thought you Asian girls were supposed to be smart.
Hanging around a neighborhood like that's a fast way to get you in the obituaries.
I know.
I know.
Take it easy.
And what about that goofball guy you were with?
Is that a date or something?
Yeah.
Kind of.
His name is Trey.
Well, you shouldn't be hanging out with him.
You should be hanging out with your own people, with other Humongs.
You mean Hmong?
We're Hmong, not "Humong."
Whatever.
Where the hell is Humong, I mean Hmong, anyway?
Wow.
You're so enlightened, you know that?
No, Hmong isn't a place.
It's a people.
Hmong people come from different parts of Laos, Thailand, and China
Yeah.
Well, how did you end up in my neighborhood, then?
Why didn't you stay there?
It's a Vietnam thing.
We fought on your side.
And when the Americans quit, the Communists started killing all the Hmong.
So we came over here.
Yeah.
Well, I don't know how you ended up in the Midwest.
There's snow on the ground six months out of the year.
Why does a jungle people want to be in the great frozen tundra?
Hill people.
We were hill people.
Not jungle people.
Booga-booga-booga.
Yeah.
Whatever.
Blame the Lutherans.
They brought us over here.
Everybody blames the Lutherans.
Well, you'd think the cold would keep all the idiots out.
Thanks for the ride.
You know something, kid?
You're all right.
But what about that dimwit brother of yours?
- He a little slow or something?
- Thao is actually really smart.
He just doesn't know which direction to go in.
- Yeah.
Poor Toad.
- It's really common.
Hmong girls over here fit in better.
The girls go to college, and the boys go to jail.
Yeah.
That old hag hates my ass.
Well...
"Your birthday today" Daisy.
"This year, you have to make a choice between two life paths.
Second chances come your way.
Extraordinary events culminate in what might seem to be an anticlimax.
Your lucky numbers are 84, 23 11, 78, and 99."
What a load of shit.
Yeah.
What the hell is it with kids nowadays?
All right.
Hey Mrs. V. Here, let me help you with those.
Oh, thank you.
I just...
- I got it.
How about that?
Here you go.
- How about that, Daisy?
Yeah, I got it.
That was too heavy for the bag.
No problem.
- Thank you.
- Go ahead, Karen, give it to him.
- Here you go.
- Well, what is it?
- It's a Gopher.
So you can reach stuff.
You know, it makes things a lot easier.
This is from me.
It's a phone.
- Oh, I can see that.
- I just thought...
Well, we thought that it would make things easier.
Well, thank you, Karen.
There's nothing wrong with making things less hard on yourself.
Karen's right, Dad.
You've worked hard your whole life.
Maybe it's time you started thinking about, you know, taking it easier.
Jeez.
That's another thing, Dad.
You really should get rid of the coffin nails.
But, I don't know, we were thinking about the house.
You know, what with Mom gone, it's gotta be a lot to maintain around here.
- Mm-hm.
- Let alone clean.
And, I don't know, you're here all alone.
Yeah, and there are these great places now, you know, these communities where you don't have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow where the people are like you, active and alert, but are alone and would benefit from being around folks their own age.
Yeah, Dad, look.
You gotta check it out.
We've brought some brochures.
These places are nothing like what you'd think they'd be.
- They' re great.
- No, no, beautiful.
They' re really nice They really are.
These are top-notch, like, resorts.
- It's like staying in a hotel practically
- They're beautiful.
They really are.
- Yeah.
They take care of everything They'll clean up.
They're really nice.
They have wonderful stores.
You can buy new shoes.
They' re amazing.
They really are.
- You'd have a good time.
- Play some golf, maybe.
- Meet other people.
Son of a bitch.
Kicking us out on his birthday.
- I told you this was a bad idea.
- I know You were right.
- He won't let anybody help him.
- Well, we tried.
Can we just drop it?
No one can say we didn't try.
The hell with him.
You know what we should've done?
We should've stayed home with Josh and Ashley
At least they were smart enough to not come.
Goddamn kids have more sense than we do.
We miss Mama, don't we, Daisy?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, Walt.
What are you up to?
We're having a barbecue.
You wanna come over?
- What do you think?
- There's tons of food.
Yeah.
Just keep your hands off my dog.
- No worries.
We only eat cats.
- Really?
No, I'm kidding, you moron.
Come on, you can be my special guest.
No, I'm fine right here.
Yeah.
- Son of a bitch.
- Okay, so, what have you had to eat today?
Oh, I had a piece of cake and a little beef jerky.
Come on over and get something to eat.
We've got beer too.
Well, I might as well drink with strangers rather than drink alone.
After all, it is my birthday.
- Really Happy birthday Wally.
- Don't call me Wally.
Well, no Pabst, but plenty of beer.
- As they say when in Humong.
- Ha, ha.
Hey, what am I doing wrong?
Every time I look at somebody they look at the ground.
You're fine.
What's she saying?
- She said welcome to her home.
- Oh, no, she's not.
- Yeah, no, she didn't.
- She hates me.
Come on.
- Yeah, she hates you.
Okay Hey.
Hey, what are all you fish heads looking at anyway?
I think we should go into the other room.
Sorry.
A lot of people in this house are very traditional.
Number one, never touch a Hmong person on their head, not even a child.
Hmong people believe that the soul resides on the head, so don't do that.
Well, sounds dumb, but fine.
Yeah, and a lot of Hmong people consider looking someone in the eye to be very rude.
That's why they look away when you look at them.
- Anything else?
- Yeah.
Some Hmong people tend to smile or grin when they're yelled at.
It's a cultural thing.
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity.
It's not that they're laughing at you or anything.
Yeah.
God, you people are nuts.
But the food does look good.
Smells good too.
Well, of course.
It's Hmong food.
Yeah.
Okay.
Can I come back for seconds?
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
You know, you mentioned about looking at people.
- He's been staring at me the whole evening.
- That's Kor Khue.
He's the Lor family shaman.
And what's that, some sort of a witch doctor or something?
- Something like that.
- Yeah Booga-booga.
Ha, ha.
Very funny Wally.
Kor Khue's interested in you.
He heard what you did.
He would like to read you.
It'd be rude not to allow him this.
It's a great honor.
- Yeah, sure, fine by me.
Sure.
- All right.
Take a seat.
Here?
He says that people do not respect you.
They don't even wanna look at you.
He says the way you live, your food has no flavor.
You're worried about your life.
You made a mistake in your past life, like a mistake that you did you're not satisfied with.
He says you have no happiness in your life.
It's like you're not at peace.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm...
Yeah, I'm fine.
Fine.
I'm fine.
God, I've got more in common with these gooks than I do my own spoilt rotten family.
Jesus Christ.
Happy birthday.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
You were bleeding.
No, I bit my tongue.
It's nothing.
Why don't we go and get some of that good gook food?
- You know, I'm starving.
- Okay.
Fantastic.
Well, you ladies are wonderful.
This stuff is really good.
Come on, you glutton.
- What's up?
- Let's go
- What for?
- To mingle.
Mingle?
We're mingling right here.
Come on.
You told me not to leave you alone.
Thank you very much, but I have to go now.
I have to go now.
I'll be back.
Now, don't let anything go away.
Oh, great.
Well, well, well.
Look who's over there.
- Yeah, the kid who stole my Gran Torino.
- My brother, Thao.
Tried to, anyway Yeah.
Yeah, Toad.
It was a little wobbly but that should fix it.
So where are you guys from?
- I'm not far from here.
- I'm from Texas.
- What's this?
- A little rice liquor.
Here, try it.
All right.
My friends and I were just wondering what you're doing here.
Well, that's a good question.
What am I doing here?
- Name's Walt.
- Hi, Walt.
I'm Youa.
- Yuam.
A pleasure.
- No.
Youa.
Youa, okay.
So, what do you do?
- Oh, I fix things, stuff like that.
- Like what?
Well, I just fixed that dryer there, I fixed my wife's friend's sink and I took old Aunt Mary to the doctor's to get her prescription fixed up.
And then I even fixed a door that hadn't even broken yet.
You're funny.
I've been called a lot of things, but never funny.
- Well, I'm gonna take off.
Enjoy yourself.
- Okay Yum Yum.
Pleasure.
Look, she's going, man.
Come on.
Youa, wait up.
Relax, zipperhead.
I'm not gonna shoot you.
I'd look down too, if I was you.
I knew you were a dipshit the first time I ever saw you but I never thought you were worse with women than you are at stealing cars, Toad.
- It's Thao.
- What?
It's not Toad, it's Thao.
My name is Thao.
Yeah, well, you're blowing it with that girl who was there.
Not that I give two shits about a toad like you.
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- You're wrong.
I know exactly what I'm talking about.
I may not be the most pleasant person to be around but I got the best woman that was ever on this planet to marry me.
I worked at it.
It was the best thing that ever happened to me.
But you, you know, you're letting Click Clack, Ding Dong, and Charlie Chan just walk out with Miss What's-Her-Face.
She likes you, you know?
Though I don't know why.
Who?
Yum Yum.
You know, the girl in the purple sweater.
She's been looking at you all day stupid.
You mean Youa.
Yeah, Yum Yum, yeah.
Nice girl.
Nice girl.
A very charming girl.
I talked with her.
Yeah.
But you, you let her just walk right out with the Three Stooges.
And you know why?
Because you're a big, fat pussy.
Well I gotta go.
Good day puss-cake.
No.
No more.
Well, okay put them over there.
Bye-bye.
No, no.
No, no more.
No more.
Come on.
No more, now.
No more, please.
I...
Is this that chicken-dumpling thing you brought the other...?
Oh, all right.
Come on, ladies.
Certainly better than beef jerky I'll tell you.
What's going on?
What's going on?
Thao is here to make amends.
He's here to work for you.
No, he isn't.
He's not gonna work for me.
My mom said he dishonored the family and now he has to work off his debt.
- He'll start tomorrow morning.
- Not tomorrow, not any time.
I don't even want him on my property.
I thought we went over all that.
It's very important that you accept, and it would be an insult if you refuse.
Why is this being put back on me?
He's the one who tried to steal my car.
All of a sudden, I'm the bad guy in this.
Look, my family is very traditional and would be very much upset if you don't let Thao repay.
If he doesn't wanna do it, then let's just go.
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Yeah.
Shut up.
All right.
Tomorrow, come on.
Tomorrow.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thank you.
Jesus, Joseph, and Mary, these Hmong broads are like badgers.
Son of a bitch, I never thought he'd show.
All right.
What are you good at?
Like what?
Well, that's what I'm asking.
If you're gonna work for me, I gotta know what you're good at.
I gotta know what you can do.
I don't know.
Well, that's kind of halfway what I expected you to say.
You see that tree right there?
You just go over there and count the birds.
You want me to count the birds?
Yeah, you can count.
All you slopes are supposed to be good at math, right?
- Yeah, I can count.
- Good.
One, two...
So, what do you have for me today You want me to watch paint dry?
- Maybe even count the clouds that pass by.
- Don't get flip with me, boy.
I'm not the one who tried to steal.
Don't you forget that.
Go ahead.
I don't care if you insult me or say racist things.
Because you know what?
I'll take it.
Yeah, course you'll take it, because you have no teeth, you have no balls, kid.
Look, I'm stuck here so why don't you just find something useful for me to do?
Because unlike you,
I'm not useless, and I maintain my own property.
You swamp rats, on the other hand, you just can't help but...
How long do I have you for?
- Toad?
How long?
- Till next Friday.
Yeah.
All right.
Go get the ladder out of the garage.
When you get finished with that roof there, you can take that gutter and nail it back up.
I'm tired of looking at it the last three years.
Yeah.
Yeah, you said it, brother.
Hello.
Grandpa says he wants to know if you can have Thao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch.
Wasp nest?
Well, that's terrible.
Yeah, well, I think we can handle that after lunch.
Jesus, Lord Almighty, knock it off.
Hey it's my last day So, what else do you have for me to do?
Take the day off.
You've done enough.
Toad.
Nothing, never mind.
The doctor will see you now.
Thank you.
Koski?
Koski?
Koski?
Mr. Kowalski?
Good morning.
I looked over your paperwork and I think we should immediately start a full battery of tests.
I feel that this would be the best way to go about checking out the issues that you've had...
- Excuse me.
What happened to Dr. Feldman, my regular doctor?
Dr. Feldman retired three years ago.
I'm his replacement, Dr Chu.
- It's Grandpa Walt.
- Pick it up.
- You talk to him.
- Mitch.
- I'm doing bills here.
- You talk to him.
He's your father.
Hey, Dad.
Hi, Mitch, it's...
It's me, your dad.
Yeah, I know.
What's up?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing much, really.
- How's everything going?
- I'm fine.
Fine.
Doing fine.
Fine.
Good.
How about Karen and the kids?
Fine, everybody's great.
Doing fine.
- Good.
How about work?
- Busy.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I suppose.
In fact, speaking of busy I got a lot on my plate right now so if there's not something pressing...
No.
No, not at all.
So why don't you call me this weekend?
Sure.
Okay.
It was nice talking to you, Dad.
Thanks for calling.
Thanks Yeah.
This kid doesn't have a chance.
- What do you know about faucets?
- I know a lot about them, boy.
Stand aside.
- Jesus.
For the love of Pete.
- What?
It must be a hundred degrees in here.
Why don't you turn on the fan?
The place is falling apart.
Man, where'd you get all this stuff?
- What are you talking about?
- All the tools and stuff.
Well, it may come as a surprise to a thief but I bought this stuff, everything in here, with my own money.
Yeah, yeah.
That's not what I meant.
I mean, there's just so much shit packed in here.
Yeah.
Well, every tool in here has a purpose.
Everything has a job to do.
They're all to use if necessary.
Okay, so, what's that?
- That's a post-hole digger.
- That?
Vise grips.
- That?
- Wire cutters.
You know it's a trowel, come on.
Those are shears there, and that's a saw.
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me, kid.
All right, what's on your mind?
It's just, I can't afford to buy all this stuff.
Well, I guess even a bonehead like you could understand that a man acquires this over a period of 50 years.
- Yeah, but...
- All right, look, here.
Take these three items, right here.
You can have this.
WD-40, vise grips and some duct tape.
Any man worth his salt can do half of the household chores with just those three things.
Anything else you need, you just borrow it, that's all.
Okay.
Cool.
- Fuck me.
- What's with that?
Nothing.
What?
Nothing, huh?
I just saw you coughed up blood.
That's not good.
You should really see a doctor.
Yeah.
Look those guys who were here the other night, on my lawn.
What about them?
Just a gang, a bunch of Hmong gangbangers.
Yeah, I assumed that, but what were they doing here?
They were gonna take me away.
They were kind of pissed that I blew my first initiation.
Yeah.
Well, you are a pussy you know, you wanna hang out with guys like that.
What was your initiation supposed to be?
My Gran Torino?
Christ all Friday.
Shit.
Toad, you got a minute?
All right.
Okay.
Here it is.
Here's the deal.
I take the top because that's the heaviest.
I pull on that, and you stand right back here and you push and help me push it up each step.
- Just like that.
- Then let me take the top.
No, no, I've got the top.
Really I'll take the top.
It looks heavy.
Look, I'm not crippled.
I've got the top.
If you don't let me take the top, I ain't helping.
- Now, listen to me, zipperhead...
- No, you listen, old man.
I'm here because you needed help.
So it's either top or I'm out of here.
All right.
You take the top, and I'll push.
Just don't let it slip out of your little-girl hands and crush me.
Don't give me any ideas, now.
- That thing weighs a ton.
- Yeah
It runs like a clock, though.
They just don't make them like this anymore.
So, what are you gonna do with it?
Sell it, I guess.
How much?
60 bucks.
They...
I'm tired of having it sit around down in the basement there.
Why?
You looking for a freezer?
The downstairs one kind of died.
Okay 25 bucks and it's yours.
Twenty-five?
But you just said 60.
I know, but this'll save me money putting an ad in the paper.
- Come on, let's wheel it over to your place.
- All right.
Okay.
- Kind of ironic, huh?
- What?
Toad washing the car that he tried to steal from you.
Yeah.
He misses one spot, he's doing it all over again too.
It's nice of you to look after him like this.
He doesn't have any real role models in his life.
Well, I'm not any role model.
But you're a good man, Wally.
I wish our father would've been more like you.
- Don't go calling me Wally
- No, I'm serious.
He was really hard on us, really traditional, and really old-school.
- Yeah, well, I'm old-school.
- Yeah, but you're an American.
What's that supposed to mean?
You like him, don't you?
Are you kidding?
He tried to steal my car.
Uh-huh.
And you spend time with him teach him how to fix things, saved him from that fucked cousin of ours.
- Hey Watch your language, lady.
- And you're a good man.
I'm not a good man.
Get me another beer, dragon lady This one's empty.
You know, the Hmong consider gardening to be women's work.
Yeah.
That's probably why I see you in the garden over there all the time.
Besides, we ain't in Humong.
Funny.
You know, you should quit.
That's bad for you.
Yeah?
So is being in a gang, dipshit.
Didn't you hear what I just said?
I saw you cough up blood.
You should quit.
So, what's that emblem supposed to mean anyway?
Is it your ancient Cub Scout emblem?
First Cavalry.
I've had it since '51.
So, what do you want to do with your life, kid?
Well, I was thinking about maybe sales.
Sales, huh?
My oldest son is in sales.
- Does he do well?
- Oh, yeah.
License to steal.
I work in the Ford factory for 50 years, and he's out selling Japanese cars.
- You made cars?
- Yeah.
I put the steering column in this Gran Torino in 1972, right on the line.
Oh, you are old.
So cool.
Yeah.
So you wanna be in sales.
You thinking about going to school maybe?
- Kind of, but school costs money.
- Well, maybe you should get a job.
You can't just sit there and spread mulch in my garden the rest of your life.
- Well, maybe you could just pay me.
- Yeah.
Very funny.
Well, what kind of job could I ever get?
Yeah.
You're right.
Nobody would ever hire you.
Yeah, I know.
Look, I'm just kidding, zip.
I mean, you could get a job.
- You could get a job anywhere.
- Like what?
- Well, how about construction?
- Me?
- Yeah.
- Construction?
- You have Alzheimer's or something?
- No.
You could get a job in construction.
I know people in the trades.
Course, I have to make a little adjustment and man you up a little bit.
- Man me up?
- Yeah.
And I think you ought to date Miss Yum Yum too.
Do you a little good.
You know, get a little carbon off the valves.
Now you're just gonna learn how guys talk.
You just listen to the way Martin and I batter it back and forth.
- You okay You ready
- Sure.
All right.
Let's go in.
Perfect.
A Polack and a chink.
How you doing, Martin, you crazy Italian prick?
You cheap bastard, I should've known you'd come in.
I was having such a pleasant day.
What'd you do, Jew some poor blind guy out of his money?
- Gave him the wrong change?
- Who's the Nip?
Oh, he's a pussy kid from next door.
I'm just trying to man him up a little bit.
Mm.
You see, kid?
Now, that's how guys talk to one another.
- They do?
- What, you got shit in your ears?
Now go on out and come back in, and talk to him like a man.
Like a real man.
- Come on, Walt.
- Come on.
Get your ass out of here.
And come on back now.
- Sorry about this.
- It's okay.
What's up, you old Italian prick?
Get out of my shop before I blow your head off you goddamn dick-smoking gook!
- Jesus Christ.
Oh, shit.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
But that's what you said.
That what you said men say.
You don't just come in and insult the man in his shop.
You don't do that.
What happens if you meet some stranger and get the wrong one?
- He's gonna blow your gook head right off.
- What should I have said, then?
Yeah, kid, why don't you start with "Hi" or "Hello"?
Yeah, just come in and say:
"Sir, I'd like a haircut, if you have time."
Yeah, be polite, but don't kiss ass.
You could talk about a construction job you just came from and bitch about your girlfriend and your car.
Son of a bitch, I just got my brakes fixed, and those sons of bitches really nailed me.
- I mean, they screwed me right in the ass.
- Don't swear at the guy.
Just talk about people who are not in the room.
You could bitch about your boss making you work overtime when it's bowling night.
Right.
Or my old lady hitches for two goddamn hours about how they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store and the minute I turn on the game, she starts crying how we never talk.
You see?
Now go out, come back and talk to him.
And it ain't rocket science, for chrissake.
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car or a girlfriend.
Jesus.
I should've blown his head off when I had the chance.
Yeah.
Maybe so.
Now, okay, I want you to turn around and go outside and come back, and don't talk about having no job no car, no girlfriend, no future, no dick.
Okay?
Just turn around and go.
Excuse me, sir I need a haircut, if you ain't too busy.
You old Italian son-of-a-bitch prick barber.
Boy does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job.
Fuck me.
Jesus Christ.
- All set to go through with it, right?
- Yeah, yeah.
Don't "Yeah, yeah" me.
Just say "Yes, sir," and, "I'll do my best."
Yes I'll do my best.
Because when I vouch for somebody that means I've given my word.
- And I don't want you making me look bad.
- No, I'm good.
Totally into this.
Don't lay down, either.
Just look them straight in the eye.
And a man can tell a lot by your handshake.
- Here.
Put those in your back pocket.
- Cool.
Don't blow this.
Hey, Kennedy you drunken Irish goon.
How the hell are you?
- I'm shitty, but who's gonna listen?
- Not me, that's for sure.
Help yourself, there, Walt.
You dumb Polack.
Okay this is the kid I was telling you about.
Thao, this is Tim Kennedy.
He's the super on this job.
So, what do we got here, Walt?
Well, he knows construction, and he's a smart kid.
He'll do anything you need him for.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
- You speak English?
- Yes, sir.
- Were you born here?
- You bet.
I see that Walt drove you here.
You got a vehicle?
Not at the moment.
Taking the bus for now.
The bus.
Jesus Christ, you don't have a car?
My head gasket cracked.
And the goddamn prick at the shop wants to bend me over for 2100.
Oh, please.
I replaced the tranny in my Tahoe, and the sons of bitches fucked me hard.
- Just under 3200.
- Goddamn thieves.
It ain't right.
You got that right.
Okay come on in on Monday and we'll find something for you to do.
- Thanks, Mr. Kennedy
- It's Tim And what's your name again?
- Thao.
- "Tuh," okay.
You owe me one, Walt.
Yeah.
Well, I'll buy you a fruitcake for Christmas.
Fuck the fruitcake.
How about you just hand over them keys to that Gran Torino?
- Why the hell does everybody want my car?
- Well, I'm not surprised.
Yeah, you don't know the half of it.
All right, come on, zipperhead.
We'll let the mick stay here and play with himself.
What are we doing?
What do you wanna do?
Carry your tools in a rice bag?
Here we are.
You can use one of these.
And you'll need one of these.
Here.
I can't afford any of this.
- I'll cover it.
You can pay me back on your first paycheck.
Cool.
- Here.
You'll need something like that.
Now, this is what I'm looking for.
Here, tool belt.
- There you go.
- Not to bitch but won't I be needing some tools?
Tools I've got, but I'm not gonna lend my tool belt.
You can pick up tools as you go.
- I really appreciate all this.
- Forget it.
No.
I really do.
Thank you.
What's up, homeboy?
What you doing?
What up, man?
- What you got, punk?
- Just checking up on my little cousin.
- Yeah, man.
- Our little cousin.
What's this?
- Where you coming from, man?
I'm coming home from work.
Not that you guys would know much about that.
So it's true.
You got a job.
You can't just leave me alone?
- What?
Hey, dog, check this out.
You scared, huh?
Who bought this shit for you?
Your dad?
- What do you want?
- Your dad bought this?
Keep your hands off my stuff.
- Give me the fucking hat.
- Why the fuck you gotta make me look bad?
- Keep your hands off my stuff!
Smashing's my job, man.
- Yo, give me that.
- Hey, come on That's my stuff.
Throw it over the fence, man, fuck it.
Let me go.
Let me go.
- Hey, you little bitch.
Give me that, man.
Give me that.
- What's the phrase I'm looking for?
- Fuck him up.
Oh, yeah. saving face.
- Hey there.
- Hey I gotta run.
Haven't seen you in a few days.
Where you been?
- Been busy.
- Yeah.
Busy huh?
Hey.
- What the hell happened to you?
- Don't worry about it
What do you mean, don't worry about it?
Look at your face.
I said, don't worry about it.
Okay?
It's not your problem.
When?
Grabbed me a couple days ago, right after I got off work.
Cowards.
I did everything I could possibly do, but they broke some of your tools.
- I'll replace them.
- Don't worry about the tools.
Where does your cousin live?
No, Walt.
I'll be okay.
- I don't want you to do anything.
- All right.
If you need any extra tools, you just let me know.
Well, I could use a roofing hammer.
Good.
Go in my garage and get it.
That should be the last of them.
Hey.
All right.
Here's the deal.
You stay away from Thao, understand?
You tell your friends to stay away from Thao.
If they don't listen, tell them you don't wanna see them anymore.
That's it.
Got it?
I'll take that as a yes.
If I have to come back here it's gonna get fucking ugly.
Get out of my way.
How do you want your dog?
I mean, steak?
Funny
- I told you, we only eat cats.
Yeah.
Well.
Whoa.
I've never seen you like this before.
I'm feeling good.
You know, I got beautiful women, great food.
And Thao.
- And even Thao isn't bugging me.
- Having a good time, I see.
- Yeah.
And it never ends.
- What happened to your knuckles anyways?
I slipped in the shower.
No big problem.
Look, now, Yum Yum, if he doesn't ask you out I'm gonna ask you out.
Youa, don't listen to him, Youa.
He's a white devil.
Yeah, I am.
I'm the white devil.
I'd love to, Walt, but he beat you to it.
Really.
No kidding.
Dinner and a movie or what?
Yeah.
They're taking the bus.
No, you can't take the bus.
We gotta get you something more stylish than that.
Like what?
Take a limo?
How about that?
- The Gran Torino?
- Yeah.
- You'd let me take the Gran Torino?
- Yeah, I'd let you take the Gran Torino.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Here's the pitch.
And a strike.
Is everybody all right?
You're all right.
You're okay.
You've got a cut.
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
Where's grandma?
Where is Sue?
Where is Sue?
- She went to our aunt's.
- Your aunt's?
You sure?
- Yeah.
- Get on the phone and call right now.
I knew this was gonna happen.
Tried to...
What the hell am I doing here?
Well, maybe some of her friends called and they changed plans.
Yeah.
In the war, we just lost a lot of friends, but you're kind of set for it.
You're geared to it.
No, no, no.
You fuck!
You rotten fuck!
Mr. Kowalski?
- You okay?
- Yeah I'm okay.
The police finally left.
No one's talking.
One thing about the Hmong, they keep their mouths shut.
Yeah, I've noticed that.
You know, Thao and Sue are never gonna find peace in this world as long as that gang's around.
Until they go away you know, forever.
What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.
I took Sue to the hospital.
She's scared.
They' re all scared.
Yeah.
Thao, especially.
He's sitting out there right now, staring at your front door.
You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.
What would you do?
- What should Thao do?
- I know what I would do if I was you.
- Or at least what you think you should do.
- Really?
If I was Thao, I guess I'd want vengeance.
I'd wanna stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys.
And you?
What would I do?
I'd come over here and talk to you, I guess.
I know you're close with these people, but this pisses me off too, Mr. Kowalski.
Want a beer?
I'd love one.
There's some in the chest right over there behind you.
Damn all this.
- Just isn't fair.
- Nothing's fair, Father.
So, what are you gonna do, Mr. Kowalski?
Call me Walt.
All right.
What are you gonna do, Walt?
I don't know but I'll think of something.
Whatever it is, they won't have a chance.
What are you doing?
- Thinking.
- Thinking?
Thinking time is over.
Now it's time to knock the shit out of those pricks.
I know you don't wanna hear this, but now's the time to stay calm.
Calm?
You want me to be calm?
We stay calm or else mistakes get made.
We have to step back from this thing.
No.
Don't let me down, Walt.
Not you.
This is gonna end today.
Sit down.
- I don't wanna sit.
- I said, sit down.
Now, listen to me We gotta plan this, and plan it very carefully
We can't make any mistakes.
Now, you know I'm the right man for this job.
So I want you to go home and stay calm and come back here at 4 this afternoon.
- And what needs to be done will be done.
- I say we go now.
Right now.
And what?
Kill that cousin of yours and the rest of those zips?
Mr. Tough Guy out for blood all of a sudden?
You know nothing about it.
Now go home and you stay calm.
Come back here at 4.
All right?
Okay
Okay
Yeah I know, I know.
Give me a break, will you?
It's the first time I've ever smoked in the house.
Let a man enjoy himself, would you, girl?
All finished.
Ten dollars American.
I don't suppose your Guinea hands are steady enough to do a straight shave?
Straight shave?
You've never asked for a straight shave.
I know, but I've always wondered about it.
That's unless you're too busy.
- No, just let me heat up a towel.
- Yeah And here, here's a 20.
Keep the change.
That's just in case you hit my jugular.
It's gonna take about one hour.
We gonna shorten the sleeves a little bit.
Gonna fix the shoulder.
- Yeah.
I never had a fitted suit before.
- Yes, sir
- Mm-hm.
- You look very good.
- What can I do for you, Mr Kowalski?
- I'm here for a confession.
Oh, Lord Jesus.
What have you done?
- Nothing.
You just take it easy, now.
- What are you up to?
Are you gonna give me a confession or not?
How long has it been since your last confession?
Oh, forever.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
What are your sins, my son?
Well, in 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski at the factory Christmas party.
Dorothy was in the other room with the other wives.
It just happened.
Yes, go on.
Well, I made a 900-dollar profit selling a boat and a motor.
I didn't pay the taxes.
It's the same as stealing.
Yes, fine.
Oh, lastly I was never very close with my two sons.
I don't know them.
I didn't know how.
That's it?
That's it?
It's bothered me most of my life.
Say 10 "Hail Marys" and five "Our Fathers."
God loves you and forgives you, and I absolve you of all your sins.
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Thank you, Padre.
Are you going to retaliate for what happened to Sue?
I'm going over to that house today Mr. Kowalski.
Is that so?
It is.
And every other day until you see the folly in what you're planning.
- Busy day Gotta go.
- Go in peace.
Oh, I am at peace.
Jesus Christ.
So which one's mine?
You ever fired a weapon before?
No.
Well, why don't you put that one down?
And I got something I wanna show you.
Come on.
What?
1952, we were sent up to take out a chink machine-gun nest.
Been shredding us up pretty good.
I was the only one that came back that day.
for that, they gave me a Silver Star.
Here it is.
Here.
I want you to have it.
Why?
Why?
Because we all knew the dangers that night, but we went anyway.
That's the way it might be tonight.
There's always a chance you don't come back.
The hell we won't.
We're gonna roll up in there and tear some ass.
That's foolish.
That's the exact reaction they're waiting for.
Go ahead and close this up.
- How many?
- How many what?
How many men did you kill in Korea?
- Thirteen.
Maybe more.
- What was it like to kill a man?
You don't wanna know.
Now close it up.
Walt.
Walt.
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Relax.
You can't get out of there.
You let me out right now.
Let me out.
- Fucking let me out or I'll fucking kill you.
- Shut the fuck up.
You wanna know what it's like to kill a man?
Well, it's goddamn awful, that's what it is.
The only thing worse is getting a medal for killing some poor kid that wanted to just give up, that's all.
Yeah, some scared little gook just like you.
I shot him in the face with that rifle you were holding in there a while ago.
Not a day goes by that I don't think about it, and you don't want that on your soul.
Now, I got blood on my hands.
I'm soiled.
That's why I'm going it alone tonight.
Walt.
You take me with you right now.
Let me out!
Look, you've come a long way I'm proud to say that you're my friend but you got your whole life ahead of you.
But me, I finish things.
That's what I do.
And I'm going it alone.
No Wait!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
Look, I need you to watch my dog.
Yeah, I love you too.
Yeah, she's old too.
Bye -bye, sweetheart.
Take it easy Her name is Daisy.
- Hello?
- It's Walt.
The keys to my house are under the ceramic turtle on the porch.
Let yourself in.
Your brother's in the basement.
I gotta go.
Sorry, Father, we have to go.
I'm telling you, if we're not here, there will be bloodshed.
We've been here for hours.
We can't afford to anchor a unit to one location.
I'm begging you to stay.
Just got word from my Sergeant.
We're pulling the plug.
- I'm staying.
- No, you aren't.
We have specific orders.
You came with us, you're leaving with us.
Watch your head.
Sue.
Over here.
Over here.
- Come unlock this.
- What's going on?
He left without me.
He went to Smokie's without me.
Thao!
What the fuck, man?
Any swamp rats in there?
- I didn't think your ass would've came.
- Shut up, gook.
I got nothing to say to you, shrimp-dick midget like you.
Yeah, yeah.
You go ahead, watch out for your boyfriend.
Because it was either he or you or someone who raped one of their own family.
Your own blood, for chrissake.
Now, go ahead and pull those pistols like miniature cowboys.
- Go ahead.
- So where's Thao at?
- That pussy motherfucker couldn't come?
- Don't worry about Thao.
Thao's got not one second for you.
Says who?
You?
What the fuck you gonna do, old man?
What you gonna do punk ass old man?
- Bitch.
- Kind of jumpy aren't we?
- Shut the fuck up.
You shut the fuck up.
- Got a light?
- What the fuck?
No.
Me.
I've got a light.
Hail Mary, full of grace.
- Yes, Sergeant.
- What happened?
- You need to step back.
- He's a friend of mine.
I said, step back.
Hey, did you hear him?
Step back.
- What happened?
- Hey, step back.
He's my friend.
Please, it's important.
He went for his lighter and they shot him.
He didn't even have a gun on him.
This time we have witnesses.
These guys will be locked up for a long time.
Officer Chang!
Get those people back.
You have to step back now, okay?
Get them the fuck out of here.
Get them out of here.
Walt Kowalski once said to me that I didn't know anything about life or death because I was an over-educated, 27-year-old virgin who held the hands of superstitious old women and promised them eternity.
Walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it but he was right.
I knew really nothing about life or death until I got to know Walt.
And, boy did I learn.
"And I wanna leave my house to the church because Dorothy would've liked it."
Now, which brings us to our last item, and again please excuse the language in Mr. Kowalski's will.
I'm simply reading it the way it was written.
"And I'd like to leave my 1972 Gran Torino to my friend Thao Vang Lor on the condition that you don't chop-top the roof like one of those beaners don't paint any idiotic flames on it like some white-trash hillbilly and don't put a big, gay spoiler on the rear end like you see on all the other zipperheads' cars.
It just looks like hell.
If you can refrain from doing any of that, it's yours."
I'm real sorry about Dorothy, Walt.
She was a real peach.
Thanks for coming, Al.
Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
Father.
Spirit.
Uh.
Holy Spirit.
It's okay, I can move down.
Spectacles, testicles, wallet, and watch.
Look at the way the old man glared at Ashley.
Can't even tone it down for Mom's funeral.
What do you expect?
Dad's still living in the '50s.
He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly.
Well, your kid's wearing a Lions jersey.
I'm sure Dad appreciates that.
The point is that there's nothing anyone can do that won't disappoint the old man.
It's inevitable.
You know, that's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings.
You know, that deal with the boat motor, the broken birdbath.
It's always something.
What are we gonna do with him?
Don't you think he's gonna get in trouble, all by himself in the old neighborhood?
Well, why don't you have him move in with you?
Ha, ha, ha.
Hey.
Shh.
Death is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics.
Bitter in the pain, sweet in the salvation.
Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased and their families.
Sweet to those of us who know the salvation that awaits.
And some may ask, "What is death?"
Is it the end?
Or is it the beginning?
And what is life?
What is this thing we call life?
- All these questions can frustrate you.
- Ashley, stop it.
That's why you have to turn to the Lord.
Jesus.
Because the Lord is the sweetness...
This is so good.
Did you have a chance to call Martha?
Is that Dad?
No.
That's Grandpa Walt.
"Third platoon, E company, March 2nd, 1952, Korea?"
Where's Korea?
A lot of people showed up after the service.
Well, I suppose they heard there's gonna be a lot of ham.
I'll go down in the basement and get some chairs.
- Oh, I can do that, Dad.
- No, I need them now, not next week.
Cool, I found a medal.
Look at this.
How much longer do we have to stay?
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell, and I'm bored.
Ashley, why don't you go help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?
- Me?
- Yes, you.
Go.
Go help him.
Grandpa Walt, would you like some help with this?
With your chairs?
No.
You probably just painted your nails.
Honey, come here.
Okay, well, your dad is driving me crazy.
- Why did you make me do that?
It's okay.
We're leaving soon.
Hey, girl.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come with me.
How many swamp rats can you get in one room?
Wow.
Grandpa, when did you get the vintage car?
1972.
I never knew you had a cool old car.
Yeah.
Well, it's been here since before you were born.
So what are you gonna do with it when you, like, die?
What about that super-cool retro couch you have in the den?
Because I'm going to state next year and it would look really good in my room, and I don't have any furniture at all.
Oh, God.
- Who are you?
What do you want?
- Hi.
- I live-
- Get the shit out of your mouth.
- Tell me what you want.
- Do you have jumper cables?
- My uncle's car is old and-
- We don't have any cables.
And have some respect, zipperhead.
We're in mourning here.
- How you holding up, Walt?
- Mr. Kowalski.
Huh?
Mr. Kowalski, that's my name.
Right.
Mr. Kowalski.
Your wife and I became quite close these last few months.
She asked that I watch over you when she passed on.
I told her I watch over my flock.
But she made me promise I'd keep an extra-sharp eye on you.
Look, I appreciate the kindness you've shown to my wife.
Now that you've spoken your piece why don't you go tend to some of your other sheep?
Okay?
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her desire for you to go to confession.
She said she couldn't remember the last time you went.
- Is that so?
- It is.
Well, I confess that I never really cared for church very much.
The only reason I went was because of her.
And I confess that I have no desire to confess to a boy that's just out of the seminary.
Great to see you.
- Bye, dear.
- So long, Walt.
Walt, can you get it started?
Yeah, it'll be fine.
I wish I could help, Dad, but I gotta get the kids home.
- Kids are getting restless.
- Yeah, fine.
Just go.
I'll call you, see how you're doing.
All right.
Kill you to buy American?
Jesus.
Did you see the way he looked at the truck?
It's always rice-burner this, Jap-burner that, you know?
- Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go.
- He didn't say anything.
- He didn't need to.
- What do you expect?
The man worked at Ford all those years.
- I suppose that's my goddamn fault.
- Just give it a rest, just drive, okay?
Kids, want the radio on?
Anyone wanna listen to some music?
Good.
Damn barbarians.
I'm just so brokenhearted.
I want my daughter to find another husband.
If she married again there would be a man in the house.
What about Thao?
The man of the house is right there.
grandma:
Look at him washing dishes.
He does whatever his sister orders him to do.
How could he ever become the man of the house?
Be patient, once he's older, he will be the man of the house.
No way.
Today is a blessed day, for a child is born.
I offer food to nurture this child's body.
I offer clothing to protect this child's flesh.
The child is blessed with a mother and father.
Oh, spirit of this child return home and do not wander anymore.
Come home, spirit and soul, come home.
Live a good life and grow old.
Jesus.
Polarski would roll over in his grave if he could see his lawn now.
What the hell did Chinks have to move into this neighborhood for?
Why does that old white man stay here?
All the Americans have moved out of this neighborhood.
Why haven't you gone?
Why don't you strut away, you dumb rooster?
Are you gone completely deaf or something?
Hi there, Walt.
I'm not a friend of yours, so why do you insist on calling me Walt?
Sorry.
Mr. Kowalski.
What are you peddling today, Padre?
Nothing.
I thought I'd drop by and see you.
I haven't seen you in church.
Now that you've done your good deed, why don't you take off down the road?
- I'd really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.
- Not in this lifetime, sonny.
Why?
Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
- You don't wanna know.
- No, I do.
Well, I think you're an over-educated 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold hands of ladies who are superstitious and promises them eternity.
Yo!
Hey!
Is you-?
Is you a boy or is you a girl, man?
I can't tell.
Hey, chinito, hey, if you was in the pen I'd be fucking you in the ass.
You'd be my bitch.
What are you reading, Jackass and the Rice Stalk?
Yeah, that's right, keep walking!
Keep walking!
Look at me when I talk to you, homes!
Fucking slopes, man, everywhere you look, man.
Slopes everywhere we go, man.
Go back to your rice paddy.
What you looking at, man?
- That's my little cousin over there.
- You sure that's your cousin, man?
- Fuck, yeah, that's my little cousin.
- He tight with anybody?
No, he flies solo, man.
You wanna do something?
Man, let's go down there and see what the fuck they doing over there.
I like your sandals too.
- Hey.
Yo, what's up?
What's up?
- Yo, what's up, motherfuckers?
They fucking with you?
Man, fuck you, homeboy!
- What you got?
Hey, we can do this right now.
- You go fucking back to your country.
- Fuck you, man.
Oh, good, more fucking rice niggers.
Aren't you supposed to cook me some Chinese food, huh?
- How many bullets you got?
- We'll catch you on the rebound, homey.
Thao!
Come on, man.
Get in the car, man.
Thao.
- Get with us, man.
- Get in the car.
Fuck, man, get in the car, man.
Thao!
Those punk-ass Mexicans messing with you?
Dog, we just bailed your ass out, dog.
Come on, dog, get the fuck in here.
What you doing, man?
Get in the car, man, come on.
Chill with us, man.
Come on, man.
We just bailed your ass out, dog!
Come on.
Come on, Thao, man.
You need a big coz to take care of you, man.
Man, fuck it.
Hey.
Forget it, man.
Let's go, dude.
Fuck his ass.
- Tomorrow, I'll see your ass.
Why you gotta be a little girl?
Tomorrow.
Come on, man, let's go.
We got the gun, man.
Fuck you.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
- We've got the strap.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
- Fuck that pussy.
Pussy.
Hey, Thao.
Hey, what's up?
What's up, Thao?
What are you doing, little man?
- Why you doing women's work?
- What do you want?
What?
I can't just come and talk to my little cousin?
- He doesn't wanna talk to you.
- Well, I'm here, right?
Hey, Spider, who that?
What's up?
Spider?
Is that what he just called you, Fong?
Spider.
- Is there something wrong with Spider?
- What are you doing here?
Hey, so how old is you anyways?
- Mentally, I'm way too old for you.
- What?
You guys are stupid.
I'm going inside.
- What?
- Sue.
Help your little bro do this gardening.
Bite it, stupid.
Hey.
You wanna roll with us, man?
Come on.
- Dude.
- Come on, ride with us.
Come on.
Come on, chill with us.
You need somebody to protect you.
That's what your big coz is for.
Look, dog, I been there, done it, and I seen it, man.
Back in the day, everybody used to wanna beat me up.
But now, nobody wanna fuck with me.
- Come on, man, let's go.
- We're coz, right?
Come on.
- We're coz, right?
We're family.
Look, a brother to Spider is a brother to me.
Come on.
Dude, man, take this shit off.
Come on.
Come on, roll with us.
Come on.
That's woman's work, man.
Don't get your hands dirty, man.
So, what do I have to do?
Spider told me that our boy next door got a bad-ass whip.
Come on.
Nice.
Yeah, my little cousin being a little man.
Whoa.
Yo, now, that's a nice car.
Hell, yeah. 1972 Gran Torino, fastback.
- Yo.
- Cobra jet engine.
Yo, man, it's still in mint condition.
Yo, man.
It's in mint condition, man.
Oh, I've got one.
There's a Mexican, a Jew, and a colored guy go into a bar.
The bartender looks up and says, "Get the fuck out of here".
So here's where my flock congregates when they're not in church.
Hey, Father J.
Hi, Mel.
Hey there, Darrell.
- Hello, Father.
- Hi, Walt.
What brings you in here, Father?
The meat raffle?
No, I just came down to talk to Walt, if that's okay.
Damn, Padre, you are persistent, aren't you?
I promised your wife.
All right.
Let's get a booth.
I'll have a Pabst and a shot of Jack and whatever he's having.
- I'll have a Diet Coke.
- Bullshit, this is a bar.
You have a drink.
- Um, I'll have a gin and tonic.
Attaboy.
So what do you want?
I promised your wife I'd get you to go to confession.
Now, why would you do that?
She was very insistent.
She made me.
You're kind of fond of promising things you can't deliver on.
Right, Father?
- Let's talk about something else.
- What?
Life and death.
Life and death.
What the hell do you know about life and death?
I'd like to think I know a lot.
I'm a priest.
Yeah.
You get up and preach about life and death but all you know is what you learned in priest school.
Right out of the rookie preacher's handbook.
I don't know about that.
I think...
Death is bittersweet.
Sort of bitter in its pain, but sweet in its salvation.
That's what you know about life and death, and it's pathetic.
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?
I know a lot.
I lived for almost three years in Korea with it.
Thanks.
We shot men stabbed them with bayonets, hacked 17-year-olds to death with shovels.
Stuff I'll remember till the day I die.
Horrible things, but things I'll live with.
And what about life?
Well, I survived the war.
Got married, had a family.
Sounds like you know a lot more about death than you do living.
Maybe so, Father.
Maybe so.
Son of a bitch.
Come on, get in the car!
Thao, what the fuck?
Get in!
- Get in, Thao.
- Come on, let's go.
Get in.
Fuck, man?
Get in!
- Hello?
- Hey.
Morning, Dad.
It's your number one son, Mitch.
Morning?
It's after 1 in the afternoon, it's not morning.
Oh, right.
Afternoon, then.
So, what do you want?
What?
No.
Nothing.
I mean, what would I want?
Well, I don't know.
Your wife's already gone through all your mother's jewelry.
No, Dad, I'm just calling to see how you're doing.
Just...
Anything new with the old neighborhood?
Yeah.
No.
Great.
Smooth sailing.
Yeah.
- Okay, good.
Good, then.
Oh, hey, Dad.
- Yeah.
You wouldn't happen to still know that guy that has the Lions season tickets?
Oh, you fuck.
Dad...
Ain't she sweet.
Come on, girl.
Yo, what's up?
What are you guys doing out here, man?
Nothing.
Minding our own business.
Just hanging out.
What are you guys doing here?
- What?
I told you guys already...
Can't I just come hang out with my little cousin?
Huh?
We have good news for you, man.
Oh, really?
And what's that?
Only for guy talk.
- I don't think so.
- Why not?
Come on, man.
We gonna give you another shot, man.
- Don't go, Thao.
Mind your own business, girl.
- Come on, let's go.
Come.
- Yeah, what are you gonna do, huh?
Come on, dog.
Look.
You've broken Daddy's gnome.
What the hell is this?
Get up.
- Get off my lawn.
Listen, old man, you don't wanna fuck with me.
Did you hear me?
I said, get off my lawn now.
Are you fucking crazy?
Go back in the house.
Yeah.
I blow a hole in your face, and then I go in the house.
And I sleep like a baby.
You can count on that.
We used to stack fucks like you five feet high in Korea use you for sandbags.
Okay.
- But you better watch your back.
- Fuck it, man, he's crazy.
We'll get this cracker next time.
Thank you.
Get off my lawn.
What the hell is this?
Christ.
No, no.
No, no, no.
Come on, no more.
No more.
No more.
What-?
Stay right there.
Stay right there.
Why can't you just leave me alone?
We brought you some shallots to plant.
- I don't want them.
- They're perennials.
- They come back every year.
- Why are you bringing me all this garbage?
Because...
- Because you saved Thao.
- I didn't save anybody.
I just
- I kept a bunch of jabbering gooks off of my lawn, that's all.
- You're a hero to the neighborhood.
- I'm not a hero.
They think you are.
That's why they keep bringing you gifts.
- Please, take them.
- They're wrong.
Now, I just want to be left alone.
Thank you.
Wait.
This is my mom, Vu, I'm Sue, and that's my brother, Thao.
- We live next door.
- So?
Thao wants to say something.
I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?
- For trying to steal your car.
Let me tell you something, boy.
You step on this property again, you're done.
Good afternoon, Walt.
I told you I'm not going to confession.
- Why didn't you just call the police?
- What?
I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I heard there was trouble in the neighborhood.
Why didn't you call the police?
Well...
You know, I prayed that they would show up but nobody answered.
What were you thinking?
Someone could have been killed.
We're talking life and death here.
When things go wrong, you gotta act quickly.
When we were in Korea and a thousand screaming gooks came across our line we didn't call the police, we reacted.
We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski.
I've been thinking about our conversation on life and death.
About what you said.
About how you carry around all the horrible things you were forced to do horrible things that won't leave you.
It seems it would do you good to unload some of that burden.
Things done during war are terrible.
Being ordered to kill.
Killing to save yourself, killing to save others.
You're right.
Those are things I know nothing about but I do know about forgiveness and I've seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins admitted their guilt, and left their burdens behind them.
Stronger men than you.
Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things and are now at peace.
Well, I gotta hand it to you, Padre.
You came here with your guns loaded this time.
Thank you.
And you're right about one thing.
About stronger men than me reaching their salvation.
Well, halle-fucking-lujah.
But you're wrong about something else.
What's that, Mr. Kowalski?
The thing that haunts a man the most is what he isn't ordered to do.
There.
You finally look like a human being again.
You shouldn't wait so long between haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch.
Yeah.
Well, I'm surprised you're still around.
I was always hoping you'd die and they'd get somebody who knew what they were doing.
Instead you just keep hanging around like the doo-wop dago you are.
- That'll be 10 bucks, Walt.
- Ten bucks?
Jesus Christ, Martin.
What are you, half Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices.
It's been 10 bucks for the last five years, you hard-nosed, Polack son of a bitch.
- Yeah, well, keep the change.
- See you in three weeks, prick.
Not if I see you first, dipshit.
Since everything could go downhill after that.
- Yeah, that's true.
- That would suck.
- That's cool, you know?
Yeah.
Ain't shit going on, man.
Ain't shit going on.
Man, look at this.
Look at this, Monk.
Check this out.
Oooh.
Boy.
Oh, yeah.
Bring that little tight ass over here.
Come here, girl.
Don't be shy.
What, you can't say hi?
Why you acting all stuck-up and shit?
- What you supposed to be, man?
- Yo, it's cool, dog.
What the fuck you doing in my neighborhood, boy?
Nothing.
Just going down to Corner Spot, you know?
Get some CDs.
It's all good, bro.
See, he called you bro, Duke.
- He called you bro, man.
- It's all good, bro.
It's all good, huh?
Shut the fuck up.
Call me bro again, man, I'll bite your motherfucking face off.
Yeah, motherfucker.
Now, what the fuck y'all come down here for?
You here to bring me this little present?
Monk?
She bringing it to us?
This little Oriental yummy.
Don't worry.
I'm gonna take real good care of her.
- Fuck out of here, man.
- Fuck out of here, man.
- I told you we're finished here.
Oh, yeah.
Keep your ass right here.
Oh, great.
Another asshole who has a fetish for Asian girls?
God, that gets so old.
Oh, shit.
- What's your name, girl?
My name?
Get your ass out of here, okay?
It's "Take your crude come-on to every woman who walks past... "
"... and cram It.
That's my name. "
Mouthy little bitch.
- Who you think you talking to?
- Who does it look like?
- You think you real funny, don't you?
- Oh, shit.
Ain't she tough?
What?
You gonna hit me now?
That would pretty much complete the picture.
You need to keep your bitch on a leash.
Put a chain on that whore and yank that motherfucker.
Of course.
Right to the stereotype thesaurus.
Call me a whore and a bitch in the same sentence.
- This bitch is crazy.
I like them like that.
Man, take this bitch.
Hey.
Get off me.
- You don't know when to quit, do you?
I'm gonna teach her a lesson.
Stop.
Let go.
Get your ass over there.
What the fuck you looking at, old man?
- What the hell are you spooks up to?
- Spooks?
You better get your ass on, honky, while I still let you.
- That's what you better do.
- That's right, bitch.
Fuck you think you at?
Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while that you shouldn't have fucked with?
That's me.
Man, you fucking crazy, man.
Get out of here, man.
Why don't you get your ass up out of here before I kick your old, wrinkly, white ass?
Crazy motherfucker, man.
What's wrong with him, man?
What the fuck?
- This motherfucker crazy, man.
- What's wrong with this nigga, man?
What the hell?
Get in the truck.
This crazy motherfucker, man.
What's wrong with him, man?
He put his finger at us.
- Oh, shit.
- Come on, now.
Hey, pops.
Come on, now.
Shut your fucking face.
You fucking don't listen, do you?
Now, get in the truck.
- Go on, get in the truck now.
Shit.
Way to go, old man.
Shut up, pussy.
What is all this "bro" shit, anyway?
Want to be Super Spade or something?
These guys don't want to be your bro and I don't blame them.
Now, get your ofay, Paddy ass on down the road.
Take care, now.
Yeah, you too.
Oh, yeah.
Fuck, man, why y'all didn't fucking do nothing?
- Man, kick that nigga's ass.
- Man, you fucking...
Shit, man.
This fucker.
He had that cannon in your fucking face.
- You didn't do nothing.
- Trying to stay out.
What's the matter with you, for chrissake?
Trying to get yourself killed?
I thought you Asian girls were supposed to be smart.
Hanging around a neighborhood like that's a fast way to get you in the obituaries.
I know.
I know.
Take it easy.
And what about that goofball guy you were with?
Is that a date or something?
Yeah.
Kind of.
His name is Trey.
Well, you shouldn't be hanging out with him.
You should be hanging out with your own people, with other Humongs.
You mean Hmong?
We're Hmong, not "Humong".
Whatever.
Where the hell is Humong, I mean Hmong, anyway?
Wow.
You're so enlightened, you know that?
No, Hmong isn't a place.
It's a people.
Hmong people come from different parts of Laos, Thailand, and China.
Yeah.
Well, how did you end up in my neighborhood, then?
Why didn't you stay there?
It's a Vietnam thing.
We fought on your side.
And when the Americans quit, the Communists started killing all the Hmong.
So we came over here.
Yeah.
Well, I don't know how you ended up in the Midwest.
There's snow on the ground six months out of the year.
Why does a jungle people want to be in the great frozen tundra?
Hill people.
We were hill people.
Not jungle people.
Booga-booga-booga.
Yeah.
Whatever.
Blame the Lutherans.
They brought us over here.
Everybody blames the Lutherans.
Well, you'd think the cold would keep all the idiots out.
Thanks for the ride.
You know something, kid?
You're all right.
But what about that dimwit brother of yours?
- He a little slow or something?
- Thao is actually really smart.
He just doesn't know which direction to go in.
- Yeah.
Poor Toad.
- It's really common.
Hmong girls over here fit in better.
The girls go to college, and the boys go to jail.
Yeah.
That old hag hates my ass.
Well...
"Your birthday today".
Daisy.
"This year, you have to make a choice between two life paths.
Second chances come your way.
Extraordinary events culminate in what might seem to be an anticlimax.
Your lucky numbers are 84, 23 11, 78, and 99.
What a load of shit.
Yeah.
What the hell is it with kids nowadays?
All right.
Hey, Mrs. V. Here, let me help you with those.
Oh, thank you.
I just- I got it.
How about that?
Here you go.
- How about that, Daisy?
Yeah, I got it.
That was too heavy for the bag.
No problem.
- Thank you.
- Go ahead, Karen, give it to him.
- Here you go.
- Well, what is it?
- It's a Gopher.
So you can reach stuff.
You know, it makes things a lot easier.
This is from me.
It's a phone.
- Oh, I can see that.
- I just thought...
Well, we thought that it would make things easier.
Well, thank you, Karen.
There's nothing wrong with making things less hard on yourself.
Karen's right, Dad.
You've worked hard your whole life.
Maybe it's time you started thinking about, you know, taking it easier.
Jeez.
That's another thing, Dad.
You really should get rid of the coffin nails.
But, I don't know, we were thinking about the house.
You know, what with Mom gone, it's gotta be a lot to maintain around here.
- Mm-hm.
- Let alone clean.
And, I don't know, you're here all alone.
Yeah, and there are these great places now, you know, these communities where you don't have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow where the people are like you, active and alert, but are alone and would benefit from being around folks their own age.
Yeah, Dad, look.
You gotta check it out.
We've brought some brochures.
These places are nothing like what you'd think they'd be.
- They're great.
- No, no, beautiful.
They're really nice.
They really are.
These are top-notch, like, resorts.
- It's like staying in a hotel practically.
- They're beautiful.
They really are.
- Yeah.
They take care of everything.
They'll clean up.
They're really nice.
They have wonderful stores.
You can buy new shoes.
They're amazing.
They really are.
You'd have a good time.
- Play some golf, maybe.
Meet other people.
Son of a bitch.
Kicking us out on his birthday.
- I told you this was a bad idea.
- I know.
You were right.
- He won't let anybody help him.
- Well, we tried.
Can we just drop it?
No one can say we didn't try.
The hell with him.
You know what we should've done?
We should've stayed home with Josh and Ashley.
At least they were smart enough to not come.
Goddamn kids have more sense than we do.
We miss Mama, don't we, Daisy?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, Walt.
What are you up to?
We're having a barbecue.
You wanna come over?
- What do you think?
- There's tons of food.
Yeah.
Just keep your hands off my dog.
- No worries.
We only eat cats.
- Really?
No, I'm kidding, you moron.
Come on, you can be my special guest.
No, I'm fine right here.
Yeah.
- Son of a bitch.
- Okay, so, what have you had to eat today?
Oh, I had a piece of cake and a little beef jerky.
Come on over and get something to eat.
We've got beer too.
Well, I might as well drink with strangers rather than drink alone.
After all, it is my birthday.
- Really?
Happy birthday, Wally.
- Don't call me Wally.
Well, no Pabst, but plenty of beer.
- As they say, when in Humong.
- Ha, ha.
Hey, what am I doing wrong?
Every time I look at somebody, they look at the ground.
You're fine.
What's she saying?
- She said welcome to her home.
- Oh, no, she's not.
- Yeah, no, she didn't.
- She hates me.
Come on.
- Yeah, she hates you.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey, what are all you fish heads looking at anyway?
I think we should go into the other room.
Sorry.
A lot of people in this house are very traditional.
Number one, never touch a Hmong person on their head, not even a child.
Hmong people believe that the soul resides on the head, so don't do that.
Well, sounds dumb, but fine.
Yeah, and a lot of Hmong people consider looking someone in the eye to be very rude.
That's why they look away when you look at them.
- Anything else?
- Yeah.
Some Hmong people tend to smile or grin when they're yelled at.
It's a cultural thing.
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity.
It's not that they're laughing at you or anything.
Yeah.
God, you people are nuts.
But the food does look good.
Smells good too.
Well, of course.
It's Hmong food.
Yeah.
Okay.
Can I come back for seconds?
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
You know, you mentioned about looking at people.
- He's been staring at me the whole evening.
- That's Kor Khue.
He's the Lor family shaman.
And what's that, some sort of a witch doctor or something?
- Something like that.
- Yeah.
Booga-booga.
Ha, ha.
Very funny, Wally.
Kor Khue's interested in you.
He heard what you did.
He would like to read you.
It'd be rude not to allow him this.
It's a great honor.
- Yeah, sure, fine by me.
Sure.
- All right.
Take a seat.
Here?
He says that people do not respect you.
They don't even wanna look at you.
He says the way you live, your food has no flavor.
You're worried about your life.
You made a mistake in your past life, like a mistake that you did you're not satisfied with.
He says you have no happiness in your life.
It's like you're not at peace.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm...
Yeah, I'm fine.
Fine.
I'm fine.
God, I've got more in common with these gooks than I do my own spoilt rotten family.
Jesus Christ.
Happy birthday.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
You were bleeding.
No, I bit my tongue.
It's nothing.
Why don't we go and get some of that good gook food?
- You know, I'm starving.
- Okay.
Fantastic.
Well, you ladies are wonderful.
This stuff is really good.
Come on, you glutton.
- What's up?
- Let's go.
- What for?
To mingle.
Mingle?
We're mingling right here.
Come on.
You told me not to leave you alone.
Thank you very much, but I have to go now.
I have to go now.
I'll be back.
Now, don't let anything go away.
Oh, great.
Well, well, well.
Look who's over there.
- Yeah, the kid who stole my Gran Torino.
- My brother, Thao.
Tried to, anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah, Toad.
It was a little wobbly, but that should fix it.
So where are you guys from?
- I'm not far from here.
- I'm from Texas.
- What's this?
- A little rice liquor.
Here, try it.
All right.
My friends and I were just wondering what you're doing here.
Well, that's a good question.
What am I doing here?
- Name's Walt.
- Hi, Walt.
I'm Youa.
- Yuam.
A pleasure.
- No.
Youa.
Youa, okay.
So, what do you do?
- Oh, I fix things, stuff like that.
- Like what?
Well, I just fixed that dryer there, I fixed my wife's friend's sink and I took old Aunt Mary to the doctor's to get her prescription fixed up.
And then I even fixed a door that hadn't even broken yet.
You're funny.
I've been called a lot of things, but never funny.
- Well, I'm gonna take off.
Enjoy yourself.
- Okay.
Yum Yum.
Pleasure.
Look, she's going, man.
Come on.
Youa, wait up.
Relax, zipperhead.
I'm not gonna shoot you.
I'd look down too, if I was you.
I knew you were a dipshit the first time I ever saw you but I never thought you were worse with women than you are at stealing cars, Toad.
- It's Thao.
- What?
It's not Toad, it's Thao.
My name is Thao.
Yeah, well, you're blowing it with that girl who was there.
Not that I give two shits about a toad like you.
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- You're wrong.
I know exactly what I'm talking about.
I may not be the most pleasant person to be around but I got the best woman that was ever on this planet to marry me.
I worked at it.
It was the best thing that ever happened to me.
But you, you know, you're letting Click Clack, Ding Dong, and Charlie Chan just walk out with Miss What's-Her-Face.
She likes you, you know?
Though I don't know why.
Who?
Yum Yum.
You know, the girl in the purple sweater.
She's been looking at you all day, stupid.
You mean Youa.
Yeah, Yum Yum, yeah.
Nice girl.
Nice girl.
A very charming girl.
I talked with her.
Yeah.
But you, you let her just walk right out with the Three Stooges.
And you know why?
Because you're a big, fat pussy.
Well I gotta go.
Good day, puss-cake.
No.
No more.
Well, okay, put them over there.
Bye-bye.
No, no.
No, no more.
No more.
Come on.
No more, now.
No more, please.
I-
Is this that chicken-dumpling thing you brought the other-?
Oh, all right.
Come on, ladies.
Certainly better than beef jerky, I'll tell you.
What's going on?
Thao is here to make amends.
He's here to work for you.
No, he isn't.
He's not gonna work for me.
My mom said he dishonored the family and now he has to work off his debt.
- He'll start tomorrow morning.
- Not tomorrow, not any time.
I don't even want him on my property.
I thought we went over all that.
It's very important that you accept, and it would be an insult if you refuse.
Why is this being put back on me?
He's the one who tried to steal my car.
All of a sudden, I'm the bad guy in this.
Look, my family is very traditional and would be very much upset if you don't let Thao repay.
If he doesn't wanna do it, then let's just go.
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Yeah.
Shut up.
All right.
Tomorrow, come on.
Tomorrow.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thank you.
Jesus, Joseph, and Mary, these Hmong broads are like badgers.
Son of a bitch, I never thought he'd show.
All right.
What are you good at?
Like what?
Well, that's what I'm asking.
If you're gonna work for me, I gotta know what you're good at.
I gotta know what you can do.
I don't know.
Well, that's kind of halfway what I expected you to say.
You see that tree right there?
You just go over there and count the birds.
You want me to count the birds?
Yeah, you can count.
All you slopes are supposed to be good at math, right?
- Yeah, I can count.
- Good.
One, two...
So, what do you have for me today?
You want me to watch paint dry?
- Maybe even count the clouds that pass by?
- Don't get flip with me, boy.
I'm not the one who tried to steal.
Don't you forget that.
Go ahead.
I don't care if you insult me or say racist things.
Because you know what?
I'll take it.
Yeah, course you'll take it, because you have no teeth, you have no balls, kid.
Look, I'm stuck here so why don't you just find something useful for me to do?
Because unlike you, I'm not useless, and I maintain my own property.
You swamp rats, on the other hand, you just can't help but...
How long do I have you for?
- Toad?
How long?
- Till next Friday.
Yeah.
All right.
Go get the ladder out of the garage.
When you get finished with that roof you can take that gutter and nail it back up.
I'm tired of looking at it the last three years.
Yeah.
Yeah, you said it, brother.
Hello.
Grandpa says he wants to know if you can have Thao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch.
Wasp nest?
Well, that's terrible.
Yeah, well, I think we can handle that after lunch.
Jesus, Lord Almighty, knock it off.
Hey, it's my last day.
So, what else do you have for me to do?
Take the day off.
You've done enough.
Toad.
Nothing, never mind.
The doctor will see you now.
Thank you.
Koski?
Mr. Kowalski?
Good morning.
I looked over your paperwork and I think we should immediately start a full battery of tests.
I feel that this would be the best way to go about...
- ... checking out the issues that you've had...
- Excuse me.
What happened to Dr. Feldman, my regular doctor?
Dr. Feldman retired three years ago.
I'm his replacement, Dr. Chu.
- It's Grandpa Walt.
- Pick it up.
- You talk to him.
- Mitch.
- I'm doing bills here.
You talk to him.
He's your father.
Hey, Dad.
Hi, Mitch, it's
- It's me, your dad.
Yeah, I know.
What's up?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing much, really.
- How's everything going?
- I'm fine.
Fine.
Doing fine.
Fine.
Good.
How about Karen and the kids?
Fine, everybody's great.
Doing fine.
- Good.
How about work?
- Busy.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I suppose.
In fact, speaking of busy, I got a lot on my plate right now so if there's not something pressing...
No.
No, not at all.
So why don't you call me this weekend?
Sure.
Okay.
It was nice talking to you, Dad.
Thanks for calling.
Thanks.
Yeah.
This kid doesn't have a chance.
- What do you know about faucets?
- I know a lot about them, boy.
Stand aside.
- Jesus.
For the love of Pete.
- What?
It must be a hundred degrees in here.
Why don't you turn on the fan?
The place is falling apart.
Man, where'd you get all this stuff?
- What are you talking about?
- All the tools and stuff.
Well, it may come as a surprise to a thief but I bought this stuff, everything in here, with my own money.
Yeah, yeah.
That's not what I meant.
I mean, there's just so much shit packed in here.
Yeah.
Well, every tool in here has a purpose.
Everything has a job to do.
They're all to use if necessary.
Okay, so, what's that?
- That's a post-hole digger.
- That?
Vise grips.
- That?
- Wire cutters.
You know it's a trowel, come on.
Those are shears there, and that's a saw.
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me, kid.
All right, what's on your mind?
It's just, I can't afford to buy all this stuff.
Well, I guess even a bonehead like you could understand that a man acquires this over a period of 50 years.
- Yeah, but...
- All right, look, here.
Take these three items, right here.
You can have this.
WD-40, vise grips and some duct tape.
Any man worth his salt can do half of the household chores with just those three things.
Anything else you need, you just borrow it, that's all.
Okay.
Cool.
- Fuck me.
- What's with that?
Nothing.
What?
Nothing, huh?
I just saw you coughed up blood.
That's not good.
You should really see a doctor.
Yeah.
Look those guys who were here the other night, on my lawn.
What about them?
Just a gang, a bunch of Hmong gangbangers.
Yeah, I assumed that, but what were they doing here?
They were gonna take me away.
They were kind of pissed that I blew my first initiation.
Yeah.
Well, you are a pussy, you know, you wanna hang out with guys like that.
What was your initiation supposed to be?
My Gran Torino?
Christ all Friday.
Shit.
Toad, you got a minute?
All right.
Okay.
Here it is.
Here's the deal.
I take the top because that's the heaviest.
I pull on that, and you stand right back here and you push and help me push it up each step.
- Just like that.
- Then let me take the top.
No, no, I've got the top.
Really, I'll take the top.
It looks heavy.
Look, I'm not crippled.
I've got the top.
If you don't let me take the top, I ain't helping.
- Now, listen to me, zipperhead-
- No, you listen, old man.
I'm here because you needed help.
So it's either top or I'm out of here.
All right.
You take the top, and I'll push.
Just don't let it slip out of your little-girl hands and crush me.
Don't give me any ideas, now.
- That thing weighs a ton.
- Yeah.
It runs like a clock, though.
They just don't make them like this anymore.
So, what are you gonna do with it?
Sell it, I guess.
How much?
60 bucks.
They...
I'm tired of having it sit around down in the basement there.
Why?
You looking for a freezer?
The downstairs one kind of died.
Okay. 25 bucks and it's yours.
Twenty-five?
But you just said 60.
I know, but this'll save me money putting an ad in the paper.
- Come on, let's wheel it over to your place.
- All right.
Okay.
- Kind of ironic, huh?
What?
Toad washing the car that he tried to steal from you.
Yeah.
He misses one spot, he's doing it all over again too.
It's nice of you to look after him like this.
He doesn't have any real role models in his life.
Well, I'm not any role model.
But you're a good man, Wally.
I wish our father would've been more like you.
- Don't go calling me Wally.
- No, I'm serious.
He was really hard on us, really traditional, and really old-school.
- Yeah, well, I'm old-school.
- Yeah, but you're an American.
What's that supposed to mean?
You like him, don't you?
Are you kidding?
He tried to steal my car.
Uh-huh.
And you spend time with him teach him how to fix things, saved him from that fucked cousin of ours.
- Hey.
Watch your language, lady.
- And you're a good man.
I'm not a good man.
Get me another beer, dragon lady.
This one's empty.
You know, the Hmong consider gardening to be women's work.
Yeah.
That's probably why I see you in the garden over there all the time.
Besides, we ain't in Humong.
Funny.
You know, you should quit.
That's bad for you.
Yeah?
So is being in a gang, dipshit.
Didn't you hear what I just said?
I saw you cough up blood.
You should quit.
So, what's that emblem supposed to mean anyway?
Is it your ancient Cub Scout emblem?
First Cavalry.
I've had it since '51.
So, what do you want to do with your life, kid?
Well, I was thinking about maybe sales.
Sales, huh?
My oldest son is in sales.
- Does he do well?
- Oh, yeah.
License to steal.
I work in the Ford factory for 50 years, and he's out selling Japanese cars.
- You made cars?
- Yeah.
I put the steering column in this Gran Torino in 1972, right on the line.
Oh, you are old.
So cool.
Yeah.
So you wanna be in sales.
You thinking about going to school maybe?
- Kind of, but school costs money.
- Well, maybe you should get a job.
You can't just sit there and spread mulch in my garden the rest of your life.
- Well, maybe you could just pay me.
- Yeah.
Very funny.
Well, what kind of job could I ever get?
Yeah.
You're right.
Nobody would ever hire you.
Yeah, I know.
Look, I'm just kidding, zip.
I mean, you could get a job.
- You could get a job anywhere.
- Like what?
- Well, how about construction?
- Me?
- Yeah.
- Construction?
- You have Alzheimer's or something?
- No.
You could get a job in construction.
I know people in the trades.
Course, I have to make a little adjustment and man you up a little bit.
- Man me up?
- Yeah.
And I think you ought to date Miss Yum Yum too.
Do you a little good.
You know, get a little carbon off the valves.
Now you're just gonna learn how guys talk.
You just listen to the way Martin and I batter it back and forth.
- You okay?
You ready?
- Sure.
All right.
Let's go in.
Perfect.
A Polack and a chink.
How you doing, Martin, you crazy Italian prick?
You cheap bastard, I should've known you'd come in.
I was having such a pleasant day.
What'd you do, Jew some poor blind guy out of his money?
- Gave him the wrong change?
- Who's the Nip?
Oh, he's a pussy kid from next door.
I'm just trying to man him up a little bit.
Mm.
You see, kid?
Now, that's how guys talk to one another.
- They do?
- What, you got shit in your ears?
Now go on out and come back in, and talk to him like a man.
Like a real man.
- Come on, Walt.
- Come on.
Get your ass out of here.
And come on back now.
- Sorry about this.
- It's okay.
What's up, you old Italian prick?
Get out of my shop before I blow your head off...
- ... you goddamn dick-smoking gook!
- Jesus Christ.
Oh, shit.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
But that's what you said.
That what you said men say.
You don't just come in and insult the man in his shop.
You don't do that.
What happens if you meet some stranger and get the wrong one?
- He's gonna blow your gook head right off.
- What should I have said, then?
Yeah, kid, why don't you start with "Hi" or "Hello"?
Yeah, just come in and say:
"Sir, I'd like a haircut, if you have time".
Yeah, be polite, but don't kiss ass.
You could talk about a construction job you just came from and bitch about your girlfriend and your car.
Son of a bitch, I just got my brakes fixed, and those sons of bitches really nailed me.
- I mean, they screwed me right in the ass.
Don't swear at the guy.
Just talk about people who are not in the room.
You could bitch about your boss making you work overtime when it's bowling night.
Right.
Or my old lady bitches for two goddamn hours about how they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store and the minute I turn on the game, she starts crying how we never talk.
You see?
Now go out, come back and talk to him.
And it ain't rocket science, for chrissake.
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car or a girlfriend.
Jesus.
I should've blown his head off when I had the chance.
Yeah.
Maybe so.
Now, okay, I want you to turn around and go outside and come back, and don't talk about having no job no car, no girlfriend, no future, no dick.
Okay?
Just turn around and go.
Excuse me, sir.
I need a haircut, if you ain't too busy.
You old Italian son-of-a-bitch prick barber.
Boy, does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job.
Fuck me.
Jesus Christ.
- All set to go through with it, right?
- Yeah, yeah.
Don't "Yeah, yeah" me.
Just say, "Yes, sir," and, "I'll do my best".
Yes.
I'll do my best.
Because when I vouch for somebody, that means I've given my word.
- And I don't want you making me look bad.
- No, I'm good.
Totally into this.
Don't lay down, either.
Just look them straight in the eye.
And a man can tell a lot by your handshake.
- Here.
Put those in your back pocket.
- Cool.
Don't blow this.
Hey, Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon.
How the hell are you?
- I'm shitty, but who's gonna listen?
Not me, that's for sure.
Help yourself, there, Walt.
You dumb Polack.
Okay, this is the kid I was telling you about.
Thao, this is Tim Kennedy.
He's the super on this job.
So, what do we got here, Walt?
Well, he knows construction, and he's a smart kid.
He'll do anything you need him for.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
- You speak English?
- Yes, sir.
- Were you born here?
- You bet.
I see that Walt drove you here.
You got a vehicle?
Not at the moment.
Taking the bus for now.
The bus.
Jesus Christ, you don't have a car?
My head gasket cracked.
And the goddamn prick at the shop wants to bend me over for 2100.
Oh, please.
I replaced the tranny in my Tahoe, and the sons of bitches fucked me hard.
- Just under 3200.
- Goddamn thieves.
It ain't right.
You got that right.
Okay, come on in on Monday, and we'll find something for you to do.
- Thanks, Mr. Kennedy.
- It's Tim.
And what's your name again?
- Thao.
- "Tuh," okay.
You owe me one, Walt.
Yeah.
Well, I'll buy you a fruitcake for Christmas.
Fuck the fruitcake.
How about you just hand over them keys to that Gran Torino?
- Why the hell does everybody want my car?
- Well, I'm not surprised.
Yeah, you don't know the half of it.
All right, come on, zipperhead.
We'll let the mick stay here and play with himself.
What are we doing?
What do you wanna do?
Carry your tools in a rice bag?
Here we are.
You can use one of these.
And you'll need one of these.
Here.
I can't afford any of this.
I'll cover it.
You can pay me back on your first paycheck.
Cool.
- Here.
You'll need something like that.
Now, this is what I'm looking for.
Here, tool belt.
- There you go.
- Not to bitch but won't I be needing some tools?
Tools I've got, but I'm not gonna lend my tool belt.
You can pick up tools as you go.
- I really appreciate all this.
- Forget it.
No.
I really do.
Thank you.
What's up, homeboy?
What you doing?
What up, man?
What you got, punk?
- Just checking up on my little cousin.
Yeah, man.
- Our little cousin.
What's this?
Where you coming from, man?
I'm coming home from work.
Not that you guys would know much about that.
So it's true.
You got a job.
You can't just leave me alone?
- What?
Hey, dog, check this out.
You scared, huh?
Who bought this shit for you?
Your dad?
- What do you want?
- Your dad bought this?
Keep your hands off my stuff.
Give me the fucking hat.
- Why the fuck you gotta make me look bad?
Keep your hands off my stuff!
Smashing's my job, man.
- Yo, give me that.
Hey, come on.
That's my stuff.
Throw it over the fence, man, fuck it.
Let me go.
Let me go.
Hey, you little bitch.
Give me that, man.
Give me that.
- What's the phrase I'm looking for?
Fuck him up.
Oh, yeah.
Saving face.
- Hey there.
- Hey.
I gotta run.
Haven't seen you in a few days.
Where you been?
- Been busy.
- Yeah.
Busy, huh?
Hey.
- What the hell happened to you?
- Don't worry about it.
What do you mean, don't worry about it?
Look at your face.
I said, don't worry about it.
Okay?
It's not your problem.
When?
Grabbed me a couple days ago, right after I got off work.
Cowards.
I did everything I could possibly do, but they broke some of your tools.
- I'll replace them.
- Don't worry about the tools.
Where does your cousin live?
No, Walt.
I'll be okay.
- I don't want you to do anything.
- All right.
If you need any extra tools, you just let me know.
Well, I could use a roofing hammer.
Good.
Go in my garage and get it.
That should be the last of them.
Hey.
All right.
Here's the deal.
You stay away from Thao, understand?
You tell your friends to stay away from Thao.
If they don't listen, tell them you don't wanna see them anymore.
That's it.
Got it?
I'll take that as a yes.
If I have to come back here it's gonna get fucking ugly.
Get out of my way.
How do you want your dog?
I mean, steak?
Funny.
- I told you, we only eat cats.
Yeah.
Well.
Whoa.
I've never seen you like this before.
I'm feeling good.
You know, I got beautiful women, great food.
And Thao.
- And even Thao isn't bugging me.
- Having a good time, I see.
- Yeah.
And it never ends.
- What happened to your knuckles anyways?
I slipped in the shower.
No big problem.
Look, now, Yum Yum, if he doesn't ask you out I'm gonna ask you out.
Youa, don't listen to him, Youa.
He's a white devil.
Yeah, I am.
I'm the white devil.
I'd love to, Walt, but he beat you to it.
Really?
No kidding.
Dinner and a movie or what?
Yeah.
They're taking the bus.
No, you can't take the bus.
We gotta get you something more stylish than that.
Like what?
Take a limo?
How about that?
- The Gran Torino?
- Yeah.
- You'd let me take the Gran Torino?
- Yeah, I'd let you take the Gran Torino.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Here's the pitch.
And a strike.
Is everybody all right?
You're all right.
You're okay.
You've got a cut.
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
Where's grandma?
Where is Sue?
Where is Sue?
- She went to our aunt's.
- Your aunt's?
You sure?
- Yeah.
- Get on the phone and call right now.
I knew this was gonna happen.
Tried to
- What the hell am I doing here?
Well, maybe some of her friends called and they changed plans.
Yeah.
In the war, we just lost a lot of friends, but you're kind of set for it.
You're geared to it.
No, no, no.
You fuck!
You rotten fuck!
Mr. Kowalski?
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I'm okay.
The police finally left.
No one's talking.
One thing about the Hmong, they keep their mouths shut.
Yeah, I've noticed that.
You know, Thao and Sue are never gonna find peace in this world as long as that gang's around.
Until they go away, you know, forever.
What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.
I took Sue to the hospital.
She's scared.
They're all scared.
Yeah.
Thao, especially.
He's sitting out there right now, staring at your front door.
You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.
What would you do?
- What should Thao do?
- I know what I would do if I was you.
- Or at least what you think you should do.
- Really?
If I was Thao, I guess I'd want vengeance.
I'd wanna stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys.
And you?
What would I do?
I'd come over here and talk to you, I guess.
I know you're close with these people, but this pisses me off too, Mr. Kowalski.
Want a beer?
I'd love one.
There's some in the chest right over there behind you.
Damn all this.
- Just isn't fair.
- Nothing's fair, Father.
So, what are you gonna do, Mr. Kowalski?
Call me Walt.
All right.
What are you gonna do, Walt?
I don't know but I'll think of something.
Whatever it is, they won't have a chance.
What are you doing?
- Thinking.
- Thinking?
Thinking time is over.
Now it's time to knock the shit out of those pricks.
I know you don't wanna hear this, but now's the time to stay calm.
Calm?
You want me to be calm?
We stay calm or else mistakes get made.
We have to step back from this thing.
No.
Don't let me down, Walt.
Not you.
This is gonna end today.
Sit down.
- I don't wanna sit.
- I said, sit down.
Now, listen to me.
We gotta plan this, and plan it very carefully.
We can't make any mistakes.
Now, you know I'm the right man for this job.
So I want you to go home and stay calm and come back here at 4 this afternoon.
- And what needs to be done will be done.
- I say we go now.
Right now.
And what?
Kill that cousin of yours and the rest of those zips?
Mr. Tough Guy out for blood all of a sudden?
You know nothing about it.
Now go home and you stay calm.
Come back here at 4.
All right?
Okay?
Okay.
Yeah.
I know, I know.
Give me a break, will you?
It's the first time I've ever smoked in the house.
Let a man enjoy himself, would you, girl?
All finished.
Ten dollars American.
I don't suppose your Guinea hands are steady enough to do a straight shave?
Straight shave?
You've never asked for a straight shave.
I know, but I've always wondered about it.
That's unless you're too busy.
- No, just let me heat up a towel.
- Yeah.
And here, here's a 20.
Keep the change.
That's just in case you hit my jugular.
It's gonna take about one hour.
We gonna shorten the sleeves a little bit.
Gonna fix the shoulder.
- Yeah.
I never had a fitted suit before.
- Yes, sir.
- Mm-hm.
- You look very good.
- What can I do for you, Mr. Kowalski?
- I'm here for a confession.
Oh, Lord Jesus.
What have you done?
- Nothing.
You just take it easy, now.
- What are you up to?
Are you gonna give me a confession or not?
How long has it been since your last confession?
Oh, forever.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
What are your sins, my son?
Well, in 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski at the factory Christmas party.
Dorothy was in the other room with the other wives.
It just happened.
Yes, go on.
Well, I made a 900-dollar profit selling a boat and a motor.
I didn't pay the taxes.
It's the same as stealing.
Yes, fine.
Oh, lastly I was never very close with my two sons.
I don't know them.
I didn't know how.
That's it?
That's it?
It's bothered me most of my life.
Say 10 "Hail Marys" and five "Our Fathers".
God loves you and forgives you, and I absolve you of all your sins.
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Thank you, Padre.
Are you going to retaliate for what happened to Sue?
I'm going over to that house today, Mr. Kowalski.
Is that so?
It is.
And every other day until you see the folly in what you're planning.
- Busy day.
Gotta go.
- Go in peace.
Oh, I am at peace.
Jesus Christ.
So which one's mine?
You ever fired a weapon before?
No.
Well, why don't you put that one down?
And I got something I wanna show you.
Come on.
What?
1952, we were sent up to take out a chink machine-gun nest.
Been shredding us up pretty good.
I was the only one that came back that day.
For that, they gave me a Silver Star.
Here it is.
Here.
I want you to have it.
Why?
Why?
Because we all knew the dangers that night, but we went anyway.
That's the way it might be tonight.
There's always a chance you don't come back.
The hell we won't.
We're gonna roll up in there and tear some ass.
That's foolish.
That's the exact reaction they're waiting for.
Go ahead and close this up.
- How many?
- How many what?
How many men did you kill in Korea?
- Thirteen.
Maybe more.
- What was it like to kill a man?
You don't wanna know.
Now close it up.
Walt.
Walt.
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Relax.
You can't get out of there.
You let me out right now.
Let me out.
- Fucking let me out or I'll fucking kill you.
- Shut the fuck up.
You wanna know what it's like to kill a man?
Well, it's goddamn awful, that's what it is.
The only thing worse is getting a medal for killing some poor kid that wanted to just give up, that's all.
Yeah, some scared little gook just like you.
I shot him in the face with that rifle you were holding in there a while ago.
Not a day goes by that I don't think about it and you don't want that on your soul.
Now, I got blood on my hands.
I'm soiled.
That's why I'm going it alone tonight.
Walt.
You take me with you right now.
Let me out!
Look, you've come a long way.
I'm proud to say that you're my friend but you got your whole life ahead of you.
But me, I finish things.
That's what I do.
And I'm going it alone.
No.
Wait!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
Look, I need you to watch my dog.
Yeah, I love you too.
Yeah, she's old too.
Bye-bye, sweetheart.
Take it easy.
Her name is Daisy.
- Hello?
It's Walt.
The keys to my house are under the ceramic turtle on the porch.
Let yourself in.
Your brother's in the basement.
I gotta go.
Sorry, Father, we have to go.
I'm telling you, if we're not here, there will be bloodshed.
We've been here for hours.
We can't afford to anchor a unit to one location.
I'm begging you to stay.
Just got word from my sergeant.
We're pulling the plug.
- I'm staying.
- No, you aren't.
We have specific orders.
You came with us, you're leaving with us.
Watch your head.
Sue.
Over here.
Over here.
- Come unlock this.
What's going on?
He left without me.
He went to Smokie's without me.
Thao!
What the fuck, man?
Any swamp rats in there?
- I didn't think your ass would've came.
- Shut up, gook.
I got nothing to say to you, shrimp-dick midget like you.
Yeah, yeah.
You go ahead, watch out for your boyfriend.
Because it was either he or you or someone who raped one of their own family.
Your own blood, for chrissake.
Now, go ahead and pull those pistols like miniature cowboys.
- Go ahead.
- So where's Thao at?
- That pussy motherfucker couldn't come?
- Don't worry about Thao.
Thao's got not one second for you.
Says who?
You?
What the fuck you gonna do, old man?
What you gonna do...
- ... punk ass old man?
Bitch.
- Kind of jumpy, aren't we?
- Shut the fuck up.
You shut the fuck up.
- Got a light?
What the fuck?
No.
Me.
I've got a light.
Hail Mary, full of grace.
- Yes, Sergeant.
What happened?
- You need to step back.
- He's a friend of mine.
I said, step back.
Hey, did you hear him?
Step back.
- What happened?
- Hey, step back.
He's my friend.
Please, it's important.
He went for his lighter and they shot him.
He didn't even have a gun on him.
This time we have witnesses.
These guys will be locked up for a long time.
Officer Chang!
Get those people back.
You have to step back now, okay?
Get them the fuck out of here.
Get them out of here.
Walt Kowalski once said to me that I didn't know anything about life or death because I was an over-educated, 27-year-old virgin who held the hands of superstitious old women and promised them eternity.
Walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it but he was right.
I knew really nothing about life or death until I got to know Walt.
And, boy, did I learn.
"And I wanna leave my house to the church because Dorothy would've liked it".
Now, which brings us to our last item, and again please excuse the language in Mr. Kowalski's will.
I'm simply reading it the way it was written.
"And I'd like to leave my 1972 Gran Torino to my friend Thao Vang Lor on the condition that you don't chop-top the roof like one of those beaners don't paint any idiotic flames on it like some white-trash hillbilly and don't put a big, gay spoiler on the rear end like you see on all the other zipperheads' cars.
It just looks like hell.
If you can refrain from doing any of that, it's yours.
I'm just so brokenhearted.
I want my daughter to find another husband.
If she married again there would be a man in the house.
What about Thao?
The man of the house is right there.
Look at him washing dishes.
He does whatever his sister orders him to do.
How could he ever become the man of the house?
Be patient, once he's older, he will be the man of the house.
No way.
Today is a blessed day, for a child is born.
I offer food to nurture this child's body.
I offer clothing to protect this child's flesh.
The child is blessed with a mother and father.
Oh, spirit of this child return home and do not wander anymore.
Come home, spirit and soul, come home.
Live a good life and grow old.
Why does that old white man stay here?
All the Americans have moved out of this neighborhood.
Why haven't you gone?
Why don't you strut away you dumb rooster?
I'm real sorry about Dorothy Walt.
She was a real peach.
Thanks for coming, Al.
Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
Father.
Spirit.
Uh.
Holy Spirit.
WOMAN:
It's okay, I can move down.
Spectacles, testicles, wallet, and watch.
[CHILDREN LAUGH]
Look at the way the old man glared at Ashley.
Can't even tone it down for Mom's funeral.
What do you expect?
Dad's still living in the '50s.
He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly.
Well, your kid's wearing a Lions jersey.
I'm sure Dad appreciates that.
The point is that there's nothing anyone can do that won't disappoint the old man.
It's inevitable.
You know, that's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings.
You know, that deal with the boat motor, the broken birdbath.
It's always something.
What are we gonna do with him?
Don't you think he's gonna get in trouble, all by himself in the old neighborhood?
Well, why don't you have him move in with you?
[CHUCKLES]
Ha, ha, ha.
Hey Shh.
Death is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics.
Bitter in the pain, sweet in the salvation.
Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased and their families.
Sweet to those of us who know the salvation that awaits.
And some may ask, "What is death?
Is it the end?
Or is it the beginning?
And what is life?
What is this thing we call life?"
[BEEPS]
- All these questions can frustrate you.
KAREN:
Ashley, stop it.
JANOVICH:
That's why you have to turn to the Lord.
Jesus.
JANOVICH:
Because the Lord is the sweetness...
WOMAN:
This is so good.
MAN:
Did you have a chance to call Martha?
DAVID:
Is that Dad?
DANIEL:
No.
That's Grandpa Walt.
"Third platoon, E company March 2nd, 1952, Korea"?
Where's Korea?
A lot of people showed up after the service.
Well, I suppose they heard there's gonna be a lot of ham.
I'll go down in the basement and get some chairs.
- Oh, I can do that, Dad.
- No, I need them now, not next week.
Cool, I found a medal.
Look at this.
How much longer do we have to stay?
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell, and I'm bored.
Ashley why don't you go help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?
- Me?
- Yes, you.
Go.
Go help him.
Grandpa Walt, would you like some help with this?
With your chairs?
No.
You probably just painted your nails.
KAREN:
Honey come here.
Okay, well, your dad is driving me crazy.
- Why did you make me do that?
KAREN:
It's okay.
We're leaving soon.
WALT:
Hey, girl.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come with me.
[PEOPLE SPEAKING IN HMONG]
How many swamp rats can you get in one room?
[SPITS]
[SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE]
Wow.
Grandpa, when did you get the vintage car?
1972.
I never knew you had a cool old car.
Yeah.
Well, it's been here since before you were born.
So what are you gonna do with it when you, like, die?
What about that super-cool retro couch you have in the den?
Because I'm going to state next year and it would look really good in my room, and I don't have any furniture at all
Oh, God.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
- Who are you?
What do you want?
- Hi.
- I live...
- Get the shit out of your mouth.
- Tell me what you want.
- Do you have jumper cables?
- My uncle's car is old and...
- We don't have any cables.
And have some respect, zipperhead.
We're in mourning here
- How you holding up, Walt?
- Mr. Kowalski.
Huh?
Mr. Kowalski, that's my name.
Right.
Mr. Kowalski.
Your wife and I became quite close these last few months.
She asked that I watch over you when she passed on.
I told her I watch over my flock.
But she made me promise I'd keep an extra-sharp eye on you.
Look, I appreciate the kindness you've shown to my wife.
Now that you've spoken your piece why don't you go tend to some of your other sheep?
Okay
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her desire for you to go to confession.
She said she couldn't remember the last time you went.
- Is that so?
- It is.
Well, I confess that I never really cared for church very much.
The only reason I went was because of her.
And I confess that I have no desire to confess to a boy that's just out of the seminary.
[CHATTERING IN HMONG]
MAN:
Great to see you.
- Bye, dear.
- So long, Walt.
WOMAN:
Walt, can you get it started?
WALT:
Yeah, it'll be fine.
I wish I could help, Dad, but I gotta get the kids home.
- Kids are getting restless.
- Yeah, fine.
Just go.
I'll call you, see how you're doing.
All right.
Kill you to buy American?
Jesus.
Did you see the way he looked at the truck?
It's always rice-burner this, Jap-burner that, you know?
- Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go.
- He didn't say anything.
- He didn't need to.
- What do you expect?
The man worked at Ford all those years.
- I suppose that's my goddamn fault.
- Just give it a rest, just drive, okay?
Kids, want the radio on?
Anyone wanna listen to some music?
Good.

Jesus Polarski would roll over in his grave if he could see his lawn now.
What the hell did Chinks have to move into this neighborhood for?
[IN HMONG] Why does that old white man stay here?
All the Americans have moved out of this neighborhood.
Why haven't you gone?
Why don't you strut away you dumb rooster?
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Are you gone completely deaf or something?
Hi there, Walt.
I'm not a friend of yours, so why do you insist on calling me Walt?
Sorry.
Mr. Kowalski.
- What are you peddling today Padre?
- Nothing I thought I'd drop by and see you.
I haven't seen you in church.
Now that you've done your good deed, why don't you take off down the road?
- I'd really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.
- Not in this lifetime, sonny.
Why Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
- You don't wanna know.
- No, I do
Well, I think you're an over-educated 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold hands of ladies who are superstitious and promises them eternity.

It's in mint condition, man.
Oh, I've got one.
There's a Mexican, a Jew, and a colored guy go into a bar.
The bartender looks up and says, "Get the fuck out of here."
So here's where my flock congregates when they're not in church.
Hey, father J.
Hi, Mel.
Hey there, Darrell.
- Hello, Father.
- Hi, Walt.
What brings you in here, Father?
The meat raffle?
No, I just came down to talk to Walt, if that's okay
Damn, Padre, you are persistent, aren't you?
I promised your wife.
All right.
Let's get a booth.
I'll have a Pabst and a shot of Jack and whatever he's having.
- I'll have a Diet Coke.
- Bullshit, this is a bar.
You have a drink.
- Um, I'll have a gin and tonic.
WALT:
Attaboy.
So what do you want?
I promised your wife I'd get you to go to confession.
Now, why would you do that?
She was very insistent. she made me.
You're kind of fond of promising things you can't deliver on.
Right, Father?
- Let's talk about something else.
- What?
Life and death.
Life and death.
What the hell do you know about life and death?
I'd like to think I know a lot.
I'm a priest.
Yeah.
You get up and preach about life and death but all you know is what you learned in priest school
Right out of the rookie preacher's handbook
I don't know about that.
I think...
Death is bittersweet.
Sort of bitter in its pain, but sweet in its salvation.
That's what you know about life and death, and it's pathetic
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?
I know a lot.
I lived for almost three years in Korea with it.
Thanks
We shot men stabbed them with bayonets, hacked 17-year-olds to death with shovels.
Stuff I'll remember till the day I die.
Horrible things, but things I'll live with.
And what about life?
Well, I survived the war.
Got married, had a family.
Sounds like you know a lot more about death than you do living.
Maybe so, Father.
Maybe so.

Can't I just come hang out with my little cousin?

WALT:
What the hell is this?
MAN 1:
Get up.
- Get off my lawn.
Listen, old man, you don't wanna fuck with me.
Did you hear me?
I said, get off my lawn now.
Are you fucking crazy Go back in the house.
Yeah.
I blow a hole in your face, and then I go in the house.
And I sleep like a baby You can count on that.
We used to stack fucks like you five feet high in Korea use you for sandbags.
Okay
- But you better watch your back.
- Fuck it, man, he's crazy.
MAN 2:
We'll get this cracker next time.
Thank you.
Get off my lawn.
[THUDDING]
What the hell is this?
Christ.
No, no.
No, no, no.
Come on, no more.
No more.
No more What...?
Stay right there. stay right there.
Why can't you just leave me alone?
We brought you some shallots to plant.
- I don't want them.
- They're perennials.
- They come back every year.
- Why are you bringing me all this garbage?
Because...
- Because you saved Thao.
- I didn't save anybody.
I just...
I kept a bunch of jabbering gooks off of my lawn, that's all.
- You're a hero to the neighborhood.
- I'm not a hero.
They think you are.
That's why they keep bringing you gifts.
- Please, take them.
- They're wrong.
Now, I just want to be left alone.
Thank you.
[SPEAKS IN HMONG]
SUE:
Wait.
This is my mom, Vu, I'm Sue, and that's my brother, Thao.
- We live next door.
- So?
Thao wants to say something.
I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?
- For trying to steal your car.
Let me tell you something, boy.
You step on this property again, you're done.
Good afternoon, Walt.
I told you I'm not going to confession.
- Why didn't you just call the police?
- What?
I do work with some of the Hmong gangs.
...and I heard there was trouble in the neighborhood.
Why didn't you call the police?
Well...
You know, I prayed that they would show up but nobody answered.
What were you thinking?
Someone could have been killed We're talking life and death here.
When things go wrong, you gotta act quickly.
When we were in Korea and a thousand screaming gooks came across our line we didn't call the police, we reacted.
We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski.
I've been thinking about our conversation on life and death.
About what you said.
About how you carry around all the horrible things you were forced to do horrible things that won't leave you.
It seems it would do you good to unload some of that burden.
Things done during war are terrible.
Being ordered to kill.
Killing to save yourself, killing to save others.
You're right.
Those are things I know nothing about but I do know about forgiveness and I've seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins admitted their guilt, and left their burdens behind them.
Stronger men than you.
Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things and are now at peace.
Well, I gotta hand it to you, Padre.
You came here with your guns loaded this time.
Thank you.
And you're right about one thing.
About stronger men than me reaching their salvation.
Well, halle-fucking-lujah.
But you're wrong about something else.
What's that, Mr. Kowalski?
The thing that haunts a man the most is what he isn't ordered to do.
There.
You finally look like a human being again.
You shouldn't wait so long between haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch.
Yeah.
Well, I'm surprised you're still around.
I was always hoping you'd die and they' d get somebody who knew what they were doing.
Instead you just keep hanging around like the doo-wop dago you are.
- That'll be 10 bucks, Walt.
- Ten bucks?
Jesus Christ, Martin.
What are you, half Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices.
It's been 10 bucks for the last five years, you hard-nosed, Polack son of a bitch.
- Yeah, well, keep the change.
- See you in three weeks, prick.
Not if I see you first, dipshit.
Since everything could go downhill after that.
- Yeah, that's true.
- That would suck.
- That's cool, you know?
Yeah.
MAN:
Ain't shit going on, man.

[MEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

MONK:

Keep your ass right here.
Oh, great.
Another asshole who has a fetish for Asian girls?
God, that gets so old.
MONK:
Oh, shit.

It's "Take your crude come-on to every woman who walks past and cram it." That's my name.

- You think you real funny don't you?
- Oh, shit.
Ain't she tough?
What?
You gonna hit me now?
That would pretty much complete the picture.
You need to keep your bitch on a leash.
Put a chain on that whore and yank that motherfucker.
Of course.
Right to the stereotype thesaurus.
Call me a whore and a bitch in the same sentence.
- This bitch is crazy DUKE:
I like them like that.
Man, take this bitch.
SUE:
Hey.

- Spooks?
You better get your ass on, honky while I still let you.
- That's what you better do.
- That's right, bitch.
Fuck you think you at?
Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while that you shouldn't have fucked with?
That's me.
Man, you fucking crazy man.
Get out of here, man.
Why don't you get your ass up out of here before I kick your old, wrinkly, white ass?
Crazy motherfucker, man.
What's wrong with him, man?
What the fuck?
- This motherfucker crazy, man.
- What's wrong with this nigga, man?
What the hell?
Get in the truck.
This crazy motherfucker, man.
What's wrong with him, man?
MONK:
He put his finger at us.
- Oh, shit.

Now, get in the truck.
- Go on, get in the truck now.
Shit.
TREY:
Way to go, old man.
Shut up, pussy.
What is all this "bro" shit, anyway?
Want to be Super Spade or something?
These guys don't want to be your bro and I don't blame them.
Now, get your ofay, Paddy ass on down the road.
Take care, now.
Yeah, you too.
Oh, yeah.
fuck, man, why y 'all didn't fucking do nothing?
- Man, kick that nigga's ass.
- Man, you fucking...
Shit, man.
This fucker.
He had that cannon in your fucking face.
- You didn't do nothing.
- Trying to stay out.
What's the matter with you, for chrissake?
Trying to get yourself killed?
I thought you Asian girls were supposed to be smart.
Hanging around a neighborhood like that's a fast way to get you in the obituaries.
I know.
I know.
Take it easy.
And what about that goofball guy you were with?
Is that a date or something?
Yeah.
Kind of.
His name is Trey.
Well, you shouldn't be hanging out with him.
You should be hanging out with your own people, with other Humongs.
You mean Hmong?
We're Hmong, not "Humong."
Whatever.
Where the hell is Humong, I mean Hmong, anyway?
[SUE LAUGHS]
Wow.
You're so enlightened, you know that?
No, Hmong isn't a place.
It's a people.
Hmong people come from different parts of Laos, Thailand, and China
Yeah.
Well, how did you end up in my neighborhood, then?
Why didn't you stay there?
It's a Vietnam thing.
We fought on your side.
And when the Americans quit, the Communists started killing all the Hmong.
So we came over here.
Yeah.
Well, I don't know how you ended up in the Midwest.
There's snow on the ground six months out of the year.
Why does a jungle people want to be in the great frozen tundra?
Hill people.
We were hill people.
Not jungle people.
Booga-booga-booga.
Yeah.
Whatever.
Blame the Lutherans.
They brought us over here.
Everybody blames the Lutherans.
[CHUCKLES]
Well, you'd think the cold would keep all the idiots out.
Thanks for the ride.
You know something, kid?
You're all right.
But what about that dimwit brother of yours?
- He a little slow or something?
- Thao is actually really smart.
He just doesn't know which direction to go in.
- Yeah.
Poor Toad.
- It's really common.
Hmong girls over here fit in better.
The girls go to college, and the boys go to jail.
Yeah.
That old hag hates my ass.
Well...
"Your birthday today" Daisy.
"This year, you have to make a choice between two life paths.
Second chances come your way.
Extraordinary events culminate in what might seem to be an anticlimax.
Your lucky numbers are 84, 23 11, 78, and 99."

Yeah.

How about that?
THAO:

THAO:
Yeah, I got it.
MRS. V:
That was too heavy for the bag.
THAO:
No problem.
- Thank you.
- Go ahead, Karen, give it to him.
- Here you go.
- Well, what is it?
- It's a Gopher.
So you can reach stuff.
You know, it makes things a lot easier.
This is from me.
It's a phone.
- Oh, I can see that.
- I just thought...
Well, we thought that it would make things easier.
Well, thank you, Karen.
There's nothing wrong with making things less hard on yourself.
Karen's right, Dad.
You've worked hard your whole life.
Maybe it's time you started thinking about, you know, taking it easier.
Jeez.
That's another thing, Dad.
You really should get rid of the coffin nails.
But, I don't know, we were thinking about the house.
You know, what with Mom gone, it's gotta be a lot to maintain around here.
- Mm-hm.
- Let alone clean.
And, I don't know, you're here all alone.
Yeah, and there are these great places now, you know, these communities where you don't have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow where the people are like you, active and alert, but are alone and would benefit from being around folks their own age.
Yeah, Dad, look.
You gotta check it out.
We've brought some brochures.
These places are nothing like what you'd think they'd be.
- They' re great.
- No, no, beautiful.
They' re really nice They really are.
These are top-notch, like, resorts.
- It's like staying in a hotel practically
- They're beautiful.
MITCH:
They really are.
- Yeah.
They take care of everything They'll clean up.
They're really nice.
They have wonderful stores.
You can buy new shoes.
MITCH:
They' re amazing.
They really are.
KAREN:
You'd have a good time.
- Play some golf, maybe.
MITCH:
Meet other people.
Son of a bitch.
Kicking us out on his birthday.
- I told you this was a bad idea.
- I know You were right.
- He won't let anybody help him.
- Well, we tried.
Can we just drop it?
No one can say we didn't try.
The hell with him.
You know what we should've done?
We should've stayed home with Josh and Ashley
At least they were smart enough to not come.
Goddamn kids have more sense than we do.
WALT:
We miss Mama, don't we, Daisy?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKING IN HMONG]
SUE:
Hey, Walt.
What are you up to?
We're having a barbecue.
You wanna come over?
- What do you think?
- There's tons of food.
Yeah.
Just keep your hands off my dog.
- No worries.
We only eat cats.
- Really?
No, I'm kidding, you moron.
Come on, you can be my special guest.
No, I'm fine right here.
Yeah.
[GROANS]
- Son of a bitch.
- Okay, so, what have you had to eat today?
Oh, I had a piece of cake and a little beef jerky.
Come on over and get something to eat.
We've got beer too.
Well, I might as well drink with strangers rather than drink alone.
After all, it is my birthday.
- Really Happy birthday Wally.
- Don't call me Wally.
WALT:
Well, no Pabst, but plenty of beer.
- As they say when in Humong.
- Ha, ha.
Hey, what am I doing wrong?
Every time I look at somebody they look at the ground.
You're fine.
[SPEAKING IN HMONG]
WALT:
What's she saying?
- She said welcome to her home.
- Oh, no, she's not.
- Yeah, no, she didn't.
- She hates me.
Come on.
- Yeah, she hates you.
Okay Hey.
[PEOPLE MURMURING]
Hey, what are all you fish heads looking at anyway?
I think we should go into the other room.
Sorry.
SUE:
A lot of people in this house are very traditional.
Number one, never touch a Hmong person on their head, not even a child.
Hmong people believe that the soul resides on the head, so don't do that.
Well, sounds dumb, but fine.
Yeah, and a lot of Hmong people consider looking someone in the eye to be very rude.
That's why they look away when you look at them.
- Anything else?
- Yeah.
Some Hmong people tend to smile or grin when they're yelled at.
It's a cultural thing.
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity.
It's not that they're laughing at you or anything.
Yeah.
God, you people are nuts.
But the food does look good.
Smells good too.
Well, of course.
It's Hmong food.
Yeah.
Okay.
Can I come back for seconds?
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
You know, you mentioned about looking at people.
- He's been staring at me the whole evening.
- That's Kor Khue.
He's the Lor family shaman.
And what's that, some sort of a witch doctor or something?
- Something like that.
- Yeah Booga-booga.
Ha, ha.
Very funny Wally.
[BOTH SPEAKING IN HMONG]
Kor Khue's interested in you.
He heard what you did.
He would like to read you.
It'd be rude not to allow him this.
It's a great honor.
- Yeah, sure, fine by me.
Sure.
- All right.
Take a seat.
WALT:
Here?
He says that people do not respect you.
They don't even wanna look at you.
He says the way you live, your food has no flavor.
You're worried about your life.
You made a mistake in your past life, like a mistake that you did you're not satisfied with.
He says you have no happiness in your life.
It's like you're not at peace.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm...
Yeah, I'm fine.
Fine.
I'm fine.
God, I've got more in common with these gooks than I do my own spoilt rotten family.
Jesus Christ.
Happy birthday.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
You were bleeding.
No, I bit my tongue.
It's nothing.
Why don't we go and get some of that good gook food?
- You know, I'm starving.
- Okay.
Fantastic.
Well, you ladies are wonderful.
This stuff is really good.
Come on, you glutton.
- What's up?
- Let's go
- What for?
SUE:
To mingle.
Mingle?
We're mingling right here.
Come on.
You told me not to leave you alone.
Thank you very much, but I have to go now.
I have to go now.
I'll be back.
Now, don't let anything go away.
[MUSIC PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]
Oh, great.
Well, well, well.
Look who's over there.
- Yeah, the kid who stole my Gran Torino.
- My brother, Thao.
Tried to, anyway Yeah.
Yeah, Toad.
It was a little wobbly but that should fix it.
YOUA:
So where are you guys from?
- I'm not far from here.
- I'm from Texas.
- What's this?
- A little rice liquor.
Here, try it.
All right.
My friends and I were just wondering what you're doing here.
Well, that's a good question.
What am I doing here?
- Name's Walt.
- Hi, Walt.
I'm Youa.
- Yuam.
A pleasure.
- No.
Youa.
Youa, okay.
So, what do you do?
- Oh, I fix things, stuff like that.
- Like what?
Well, I just fixed that dryer there, I fixed my wife's friend's sink and I took old Aunt Mary to the doctor's to get her prescription fixed up.
And then I even fixed a door that hadn't even broken yet.
You're funny.
I've been called a lot of things, but never funny.
- Well, I'm gonna take off.
Enjoy yourself.
- Okay Yum Yum.
Pleasure.
Look, she's going, man.
Come on.
MAN:
Youa, wait up.
Relax, zipperhead.
I'm not gonna shoot you.
I'd look down too, if I was you.
I knew you were a dipshit the first time I ever saw you but I never thought you were worse with women than you are at stealing cars, Toad.
- It's Thao.
- What?
It's not Toad, it's Thao.
My name is Thao.
Yeah, well, you're blowing it with that girl who was there.
Not that I give two shits about a toad like you.
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- You're wrong.
I know exactly what I'm talking about.
I may not be the most pleasant person to be around but I got the best woman that was ever on this planet to marry me.
I worked at it.
It was the best thing that ever happened to me.
But you, you know, you're letting Click Clack, Ding Dong, and Charlie Chan just walk out with Miss What's-Her-Face.
She likes you, you know?
Though I don't know why.
Who?
Yum Yum.
You know, the girl in the purple sweater.
She's been looking at you all day stupid.
You mean Youa.
Yeah, Yum Yum, yeah.
Nice girl.
Nice girl.
A very charming girl.
I talked with her.
Yeah.
But you, you let her just walk right out with the Three Stooges.
And you know why?
Because you're a big, fat pussy.
Well I gotta go.
Good day puss-cake.
[WOMEN SPEAKING IN HMONG]
No.
No more.
Well, okay put them over there.
Bye-bye.
No, no.
No, no more.
No more.
Come on.
No more, now.
No more, please.
I...
Is this that chicken-dumpling thing you brought the other...?
Oh, all right.
Come on, ladies.
Certainly better than beef jerky I'll tell you.
What's going on?
What's going on?
Thao is here to make amends.
He's here to work for you.
[VU SPEAKING IN HMONG]
No, he isn't.
He's not gonna work for me.
My mom said he dishonored the family and now he has to work off his debt.
- He'll start tomorrow morning.
- Not tomorrow, not any time.
I don't even want him on my property.
I thought we went over all that.
It's very important that you accept, and it would be an insult if you refuse.
Why is this being put back on me?
He's the one who tried to steal my car.
All of a sudden, I'm the bad guy in this.
Look, my family is very traditional and would be very much upset if you don't let Thao repay.
If he doesn't wanna do it, then let's just go.
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Yeah.
Shut up.
All right.
Tomorrow, come on.
Tomorrow.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thank you.
Jesus, Joseph, and Mary, these Hmong broads are like badgers.
Son of a bitch, I never thought he'd show.
All right.
What are you good at?
Like what?
Well, that's what I'm asking.
If you're gonna work for me, I gotta know what you're good at.
I gotta know what you can do.
I don't know.
Well, that's kind of halfway what I expected you to say.
You see that tree right there?
You just go over there and count the birds.
You want me to count the birds?
Yeah, you can count.
All you slopes are supposed to be good at math, right?
- Yeah, I can count.
- Good.
One, two...
So, what do you have for me today You want me to watch paint dry?
- Maybe even count the clouds that pass by.
- Don't get flip with me, boy.
I'm not the one who tried to steal.
Don't you forget that.
Go ahead.
I don't care if you insult me or say racist things.
Because you know what?
I'll take it.
Yeah, course you'll take it, because you have no teeth, you have no balls, kid.
Look, I'm stuck here so why don't you just find something useful for me to do?
Because unlike you,
I'm not useless, and I maintain my own property.
You swamp rats, on the other hand, you just can't help but...
How long do I have you for?
- Toad?
How long?
- Till next Friday.
Yeah.
[CHUCKLES]
All right.
Go get the ladder out of the garage.
When you get finished with that roof there, you can take that gutter and nail it back up.
I'm tired of looking at it the last three years.
[MAN SPEAKING IN HMONG]
Yeah.
Yeah, you said it, brother.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]

Mr. Kowalski?
Good morning.
I looked over your paperwork and I think we should immediately start a full battery of tests.
I feel that this would be the best way to go about checking out the issues that you've had...
- Excuse me.
What happened to Dr. Feldman, my regular doctor?
Dr. Feldman retired three years ago.
I'm his replacement, Dr Chu.
[PHONE RINGING]

In fact, speaking of busy I got a lot on my plate right now so if there's not something pressing...
No.
No, not at all.
So why don't you call me this weekend?
Sure.
Okay.
It was nice talking to you, Dad.
Thanks for calling.
Thanks Yeah.
[L.P., BUDDAH, CUZZ L.B.'s "APPRECIATION" PLAYS ON CAR STEREO]
This kid doesn't have a chance.
- What do you know about faucets?
- I know a lot about them, boy.
Stand aside.
- Jesus.
For the love of Pete.
- What?
It must be a hundred degrees in here.
Why don't you turn on the fan?
The place is falling apart.
THAO:
Man, where'd you get all this stuff?
- What are you talking about?
- All the tools and stuff.
Well, it may come as a surprise to a thief but I bought this stuff, everything in here, with my own money.
Yeah, yeah.
That's not what I meant.
I mean, there's just so much shit packed in here.
Yeah.
Well, every tool in here has a purpose.
Everything has a job to do.
They're all to use if necessary.
Okay, so, what's that?
- That's a post-hole digger.
- That?
Vise grips.
- That?
- Wire cutters.
You know it's a trowel, come on.
Those are shears there, and that's a saw.
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me, kid.
All right, what's on your mind?
It's just, I can't afford to buy all this stuff.
Well, I guess even a bonehead like you could understand that a man acquires this over a period of 50 years.
- Yeah, but...
- All right, look, here.
Take these three items, right here.
You can have this.
WD-40, vise grips and some duct tape.
Any man worth his salt can do half of the household chores with just those three things.
Anything else you need, you just borrow it, that's all.
Okay.
Cool.
[COUGHING]
- Fuck me.
- What's with that?
Nothing.
What?
Nothing, huh?
I just saw you coughed up blood.
That's not good.
You should really see a doctor.
Yeah.
Look those guys who were here the other night, on my lawn.
What about them?
Just a gang, a bunch of Hmong gangbangers.
Yeah, I assumed that, but what were they doing here?
They were gonna take me away.
They were kind of pissed that I blew my first initiation.
Yeah.
Well, you are a pussy you know, you wanna hang out with guys like that.
What was your initiation supposed to be?
My Gran Torino?
Christ all Friday.
Shit.
Toad, you got a minute?
All right.
Okay.
Here it is.
Here's the deal.
I take the top because that's the heaviest.
I pull on that, and you stand right back here and you push and help me push it up each step.
- Just like that.
- Then let me take the top.
No, no, I've got the top.
Really I'll take the top.
It looks heavy.
Look, I'm not crippled.
I've got the top.
If you don't let me take the top, I ain't helping.
- Now, listen to me, zipperhead...
- No, you listen, old man.
I'm here because you needed help.
So it's either top or I'm out of here.
[GROWLS]
All right.
You take the top, and I'll push.
Just don't let it slip out of your little-girl hands and crush me.
Don't give me any ideas, now.
- That thing weighs a ton.
- Yeah
It runs like a clock, though.
They just don't make them like this anymore.
So, what are you gonna do with it?
Sell it, I guess.
How much?
60 bucks.
They...
I'm tired of having it sit around down in the basement there.
Why?
You looking for a freezer?
The downstairs one kind of died.
Okay 25 bucks and it's yours.
Twenty-five?
But you just said 60.
I know, but this'll save me money putting an ad in the paper.
- Come on, let's wheel it over to your place.
- All right.
Okay.
- Kind of ironic, huh?
WALT:
What?
Toad washing the car that he tried to steal from you.
Yeah.
He misses one spot, he's doing it all over again too.
It's nice of you to look after him like this.
He doesn't have any real role models in his life.
Well, I'm not any role model.
But you're a good man, Wally.
I wish our father would've been more like you.
- Don't go calling me Wally
- No, I'm serious.
He was really hard on us, really traditional, and really old-school.
- Yeah, well, I'm old-school.
- Yeah, but you're an American.
What's that supposed to mean?
You like him, don't you?
Are you kidding?
He tried to steal my car.
Uh-huh.
And you spend time with him teach him how to fix things, saved him from that fucked cousin of ours.
- Hey Watch your language, lady.
- And you're a good man.
I'm not a good man.
Get me another beer, dragon lady This one's empty.
You know, the Hmong consider gardening to be women's work.
Yeah.
That's probably why I see you in the garden over there all the time.
Besides, we ain't in Humong.
Funny.
You know, you should quit.
That's bad for you.
Yeah?
So is being in a gang, dipshit.
Didn't you hear what I just said?
I saw you cough up blood.
You should quit.
So, what's that emblem supposed to mean anyway?
Is it your ancient Cub Scout emblem?
First Cavalry.
I've had it since '51.
So, what do you want to do with your life, kid?
Well, I was thinking about maybe sales.
Sales, huh?
My oldest son is in sales.
- Does he do well?
- Oh, yeah.
License to steal.
I work in the Ford factory for 50 years, and he's out selling Japanese cars.
- You made cars?
- Yeah.
I put the steering column in this Gran Torino in 1972, right on the line.
Oh, you are old.
So cool.
Yeah.
So you wanna be in sales.
You thinking about going to school maybe?
- Kind of, but school costs money.
- Well, maybe you should get a job.
You can't just sit there and spread mulch in my garden the rest of your life.
- Well, maybe you could just pay me.
- Yeah.
Very funny.
Well, what kind of job could I ever get?
Yeah.
You're right.
Nobody would ever hire you.
Yeah, I know.
Look, I'm just kidding, zip.
I mean, you could get a job.
- You could get a job anywhere.
- Like what?
- Well, how about construction?
- Me?
- Yeah.
- Construction?
- You have Alzheimer's or something?
- No.
You could get a job in construction.
I know people in the trades.
Course, I have to make a little adjustment and man you up a little bit.
- Man me up?
- Yeah.
And I think you ought to date Miss Yum Yum too.
Do you a little good.
You know, get a little carbon off the valves.
Now you're just gonna learn how guys talk.
You just listen to the way Martin and I batter it back and forth.
- You okay You ready
- Sure.
WALT:
All right.
Let's go in.
Perfect.
A Polack and a chink.
How you doing, Martin, you crazy Italian prick?
You cheap bastard, I should've known you'd come in.
I was having such a pleasant day.
What'd you do, Jew some poor blind guy out of his money?
- Gave him the wrong change?
- Who's the Nip?
Oh, he's a pussy kid from next door.
I'm just trying to man him up a little bit.
Mm.
You see, kid?
Now, that's how guys talk to one another.
- They do?
- What, you got shit in your ears?
Now go on out and come back in, and talk to him like a man.
Like a real man.
- Come on, Walt.
- Come on.
Get your ass out of here.
And come on back now.
- Sorry about this.
- It's okay.
What's up, you old Italian prick?
Get out of my shop before I blow your head off you goddamn dick-smoking gook!
- Jesus Christ.
Oh, shit.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
But that's what you said.
That what you said men say.
You don't just come in and insult the man in his shop.
You don't do that.
What happens if you meet some stranger and get the wrong one?
- He's gonna blow your gook head right off.
- What should I have said, then?
Yeah, kid, why don't you start with "Hi" or "Hello"?
Yeah, just come in and say:
"Sir, I'd like a haircut, if you have time."
Yeah, be polite, but don't kiss ass.
WALT:
You could talk about a construction job you just came from and bitch about your girlfriend and your car.
Son of a bitch, I just got my brakes fixed, and those sons of bitches really nailed me.
- I mean, they screwed me right in the ass.
WALT:
Don't swear at the guy.
Just talk about people who are not in the room.
You could bitch about your boss making you work overtime when it's bowling night.
Right.
Or my old lady hitches for two goddamn hours about how they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store and the minute I turn on the game, she starts crying how we never talk.
You see?
Now go out, come back and talk to him.
And it ain't rocket science, for chrissake.
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car or a girlfriend.
Jesus.
I should've blown his head off when I had the chance.
Yeah.
Maybe so.
Now, okay, I want you to turn around and go outside and come back, and don't talk about having no job no car, no girlfriend, no future, no dick.
Okay?
Just turn around and go.
Excuse me, sir I need a haircut, if you ain't too busy.
You old Italian son-of-a-bitch prick barber.
Boy does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job.
Fuck me.
Jesus Christ.
- All set to go through with it, right?
- Yeah, yeah.
Don't "Yeah, yeah" me.
Just say "Yes, sir," and, "I'll do my best."
THAO:
Yes I'll do my best.
Because when I vouch for somebody that means I've given my word.
- And I don't want you making me look bad.
- No, I'm good.
Totally into this.
Don't lay down, either.
Just look them straight in the eye.
And a man can tell a lot by your handshake.
- Here.
Put those in your back pocket.
- Cool.
Don't blow this.
Hey, Kennedy you drunken Irish goon.
How the hell are you?
- I'm shitty, but who's gonna listen?
WALT:
Not me, that's for sure.
Help yourself, there, Walt.
You dumb Polack.
Okay this is the kid I was telling you about.
Thao, this is Tim Kennedy.
He's the super on this job.
TIM:
So, what do we got here, Walt?
Well, he knows construction, and he's a smart kid.
He'll do anything you need him for.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
- You speak English?
- Yes, sir.
- Were you born here?
- You bet.
I see that Walt drove you here.
You got a vehicle?
Not at the moment.
Taking the bus for now.
The bus.
Jesus Christ, you don't have a car?
My head gasket cracked.
And the goddamn prick at the shop wants to bend me over for 2100.
Oh, please.
I replaced the tranny in my Tahoe, and the sons of bitches fucked me hard.
- Just under 3200.
- Goddamn thieves.
It ain't right.
You got that right.
Okay come on in on Monday and we'll find something for you to do.
- Thanks, Mr. Kennedy
- It's Tim And what's your name again?
- Thao.
- "Tuh," okay.
You owe me one, Walt.
Yeah.
Well, I'll buy you a fruitcake for Christmas.
Fuck the fruitcake.
How about you just hand over them keys to that Gran Torino?
- Why the hell does everybody want my car?
- Well, I'm not surprised.
Yeah, you don't know the half of it.
All right, come on, zipperhead.
We'll let the mick stay here and play with himself.
What are we doing?
What do you wanna do?
Carry your tools in a rice bag?
Here we are.
You can use one of these.
And you'll need one of these.
Here.
THAO:
I can't afford any of this.
WALT:
I'll cover it.
You can pay me back on your first paycheck.
THAO:
Cool.
- Here.
You'll need something like that.
Now, this is what I'm looking for.
Here, tool belt.
- There you go.
- Not to bitch but won't I be needing some tools?
Tools I've got, but I'm not gonna lend my tool belt.
You can pick up tools as you go.
- I really appreciate all this.
- Forget it.
No.
I really do.
Thank you.

Busy huh?
Hey.

- Don't worry about it
What do you mean, don't worry about it?
Look at your face.
I said, don't worry about it.
Okay?
It's not your problem.
When?
Grabbed me a couple days ago, right after I got off work.
Cowards.
I did everything I could possibly do, but they broke some of your tools.
- I'll replace them.
- Don't worry about the tools.
Where does your cousin live?
No, Walt.
I'll be okay.
- I don't want you to do anything.
- All right.
If you need any extra tools, you just let me know.
Well, I could use a roofing hammer.
Good.
Go in my garage and get it.
That should be the last of them.
Hey.
All right.
Here's the deal.
You stay away from Thao, understand?
You tell your friends to stay away from Thao.
If they don't listen, tell them you don't wanna see them anymore.
That's it.
Got it?
I'll take that as a yes.
If I have to come back here it's gonna get fucking ugly.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
Get out of my way.

He's a white devil.
Yeah, I am.
I'm the white devil.

Really.
No kidding.
Dinner and a movie or what?
Yeah.
They're taking the bus.
No, you can't take the bus.
We gotta get you something more stylish than that.
Like what?
Take a limo?
How about that?

MAN [ON TV]:
Here's the pitch.
And a strike.
[WOMEN SCREAMING]
WALT:
Is everybody all right?
[VU SPEAKING IN HMONG]
You're all right.
You're okay.
You've got a cut.
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
Where's grandma?
Where is Sue?
Where is Sue?
- She went to our aunt's.
- Your aunt's?
You sure?
- Yeah.
- Get on the phone and call right now.
[SPEAKING IN HMONG]
I knew this was gonna happen.
Tried to...
What the hell am I doing here?
Well, maybe some of her friends called and they changed plans.
Yeah.
In the war, we just lost a lot of friends, but you're kind of set for it.
You're geared to it.
[SPEAKING IN HMONG]
No, no, no.
You fuck!
You rotten fuck!
Mr. Kowalski?
- You okay?
- Yeah I'm okay.
The police finally left.
No one's talking.
One thing about the Hmong, they keep their mouths shut.
Yeah, I've noticed that.
You know, Thao and Sue are never gonna find peace in this world as long as that gang's around.
Until they go away you know, forever.
What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.
I took Sue to the hospital.
She's scared.
They' re all scared.
Yeah.
Thao, especially.
He's sitting out there right now, staring at your front door.
You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.
What would you do?
- What should Thao do?
- I know what I would do if I was you.
- Or at least what you think you should do.
- Really?
If I was Thao, I guess I'd want vengeance.
I'd wanna stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys.
And you?
What would I do?
I'd come over here and talk to you, I guess.
I know you're close with these people, but this pisses me off too, Mr. Kowalski.
Want a beer?
I'd love one.
There's some in the chest right over there behind you.
Damn all this.
- Just isn't fair.
- Nothing's fair, Father.
So, what are you gonna do, Mr. Kowalski?
Call me Walt.
All right.
What are you gonna do, Walt?
I don't know but I'll think of something.
Whatever it is, they won't have a chance.
What are you doing?
- Thinking.
- Thinking?
Thinking time is over.
Now it's time to knock the shit out of those pricks.
I know you don't wanna hear this, but now's the time to stay calm.
Calm?
You want me to be calm?
We stay calm or else mistakes get made.
We have to step back from this thing.
No.
Don't let me down, Walt.
Not you.
This is gonna end today.
Sit down.
- I don't wanna sit.
- I said, sit down.
Now, listen to me We gotta plan this, and plan it very carefully
We can't make any mistakes.
Now, you know I'm the right man for this job.
So I want you to go home and stay calm and come back here at 4 this afternoon.
- And what needs to be done will be done.
- I say we go now.
Right now.
And what?
Kill that cousin of yours and the rest of those zips?
Mr. Tough Guy out for blood all of a sudden?
You know nothing about it.
Now go home and you stay calm.
Come back here at 4.
All right?
Okay
Okay
Yeah I know, I know.
Give me a break, will you?
It's the first time I've ever smoked in the house.
Let a man enjoy himself, would you, girl?
All finished.
Ten dollars American.
I don't suppose your Guinea hands are steady enough to do a straight shave?
Straight shave?
You've never asked for a straight shave.
I know, but I've always wondered about it.
That's unless you're too busy.
- No, just let me heat up a towel.
- Yeah And here, here's a 20.
Keep the change.
That's just in case you hit my jugular.
It's gonna take about one hour.
We gonna shorten the sleeves a little bit.
Gonna fix the shoulder.
- Yeah.
I never had a fitted suit before.
- Yes, sir
- Mm-hm.
- You look very good.
- What can I do for you, Mr Kowalski?
- I'm here for a confession.
Oh, Lord Jesus.
What have you done?
- Nothing.
You just take it easy, now.
- What are you up to?
Are you gonna give me a confession or not?
How long has it been since your last confession?
WALT:
Oh, forever.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
What are your sins, my son?
Well, in 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski at the factory Christmas party.
Dorothy was in the other room with the other wives.
It just happened.
Yes, go on.
Well, I made a 900-dollar profit selling a boat and a motor.
I didn't pay the taxes.
It's the same as stealing.
Yes, fine.
Oh, lastly I was never very close with my two sons.
I don't know them.
I didn't know how.
That's it?
That's it?
It's bothered me most of my life.
Say 10 "Hail Marys" and five "Our Fathers."
God loves you and forgives you, and I absolve you of all your sins.
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Thank you, Padre.
Are you going to retaliate for what happened to Sue?
I'm going over to that house today Mr. Kowalski.
WALT:
Is that so?
It is.
And every other day until you see the folly in what you're planning.
- Busy day Gotta go.
- Go in peace.
Oh, I am at peace.
Jesus Christ.
So which one's mine?
You ever fired a weapon before?
No.
Well, why don't you put that one down?
And I got something I wanna show you.
Come on.
THAO:
What?
1952, we were sent up to take out a chink machine-gun nest.
Been shredding us up pretty good.
I was the only one that came back that day.
for that, they gave me a Silver Star.
Here it is.
Here.
I want you to have it.
Why?
Why?
Because we all knew the dangers that night, but we went anyway.
That's the way it might be tonight.
There's always a chance you don't come back.
The hell we won't.
We're gonna roll up in there and tear some ass.
That's foolish.
That's the exact reaction they're waiting for.
Go ahead and close this up.
- How many?
- How many what?
How many men did you kill in Korea?
- Thirteen.
Maybe more.
- What was it like to kill a man?
You don't wanna know.
Now close it up.
[DOOR SLAMS]
[LOCK CLICKS]
Walt.
Walt.
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Relax.
You can't get out of there.
You let me out right now.
Let me out.
- Fucking let me out or I'll fucking kill you.
- Shut the fuck up.
You wanna know what it's like to kill a man?
Well, it's goddamn awful, that's what it is.
The only thing worse is getting a medal for killing some poor kid that wanted to just give up, that's all.
Yeah, some scared little gook just like you.
I shot him in the face with that rifle you were holding in there a while ago.
Not a day goes by that I don't think about it, and you don't want that on your soul.
Now, I got blood on my hands.
I'm soiled.
That's why I'm going it alone tonight.
Walt.
You take me with you right now.
Let me out!
Look, you've come a long way I'm proud to say that you're my friend but you got your whole life ahead of you.
But me, I finish things.
That's what I do.
And I'm going it alone.
No Wait!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!
Walt!

Sorry, Father, we have to go.

We've been here for hours.
We can't afford to anchor a unit to one location.
I'm begging you to stay.
Just got word from my Sergeant.
We're pulling the plug.

We have specific orders.
You came with us, you're leaving with us.

Yeah, yeah.
You go ahead, watch out for your boyfriend.
Because it was either he or you or someone who raped one of their own family.
Your own blood, for chrissake.
Now, go ahead and pull those pistols like miniature cowboys.
- Go ahead.
- So where's Thao at?

Me.
I've got a light.
Hail Mary, full of grace.
- Yes, Sergeant.
THAO:
What happened?
- You need to step back.
- He's a friend of mine.
I said, step back.
Hey, did you hear him?
Step back.
- What happened?
- Hey, step back.
He's my friend.
[IN HMONG] Please, it's important.
[IN HMONG] He went for his lighter and they shot him.
He didn't even have a gun on him.
This time we have witnesses.
These guys will be locked up for a long time.
Officer Chang!
Get those people back.
[IN ENGLISH] You have to step back now, okay?
Get them the fuck out of here.
Get them out of here.
Walt Kowalski once said to me that I didn't know anything about life or death because I was an over-educated, 27-year-old virgin who held the hands of superstitious old women and promised them eternity.
[PEOPLE CHUCKLE]
Walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it but he was right.
I knew really nothing about life or death until I got to know Walt.
And, boy did I learn.
"And I wanna leave my house to the church because Dorothy would've liked it."
Now, which brings us to our last item, and again please excuse the language in Mr. Kowalski's will.
I'm simply reading it the way it was written.
"And I'd like to leave my 1972 Gran Torino to my friend Thao Vang Lor on the condition that you don't chop-top the roof like one of those beaners don't paint any idiotic flames on it like some white-trash hillbilly and don't put a big, gay spoiler on the rear end like you see on all the other zipperheads' cars.
It just looks like hell.
If you can refrain from doing any of that, it's yours."

God, I am sorry for Dorothy, Walt.
She was a real peach.
Thanks for coming, Al.
Spectacles, testicles, wallet and watch.
Look at the Old Man glaring at Ashley.
He can?

What do you expect?
Dad?
s still living in the ?
50s.
He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly.
Yeah, well your kid?

I?
m sure Dad appreciates that.
The point I am trying to make is that there?
s nothing anyone can do that won?
t disappoint the Old Man.
It?
s inevitable.
That?
s why we stopped doing Thanksgivings.
the deal with the boat motor, the broken bird bath,
It?
s always something.
What are we going to do with him?
Don?
t you think he?
ll get in trouble over there all by himself in the old neighborhood?
Why don?
t you have him move in with you?
Death is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics.
Bitter in the pain.
Sweet in the salvation.
Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased.
... and their families
Sweet to those who know the salvation that awaits.
And some may ask, what is death?
Is it the end?
Or is it the beginning?
And what is life?
What is this thing we call life?
All these questions can frustrate you at times like this.
And that's why you have to turn to the Lord.
- Jesus ...
Because the Lord is the sweetness.
Is that dad?
- No, that's grandpa Walt.
There is a platoon, E-Company, March 2, 1952.
Korea?
- Where's Korea?
Well, people showed up after the service, huh?
Yeah, well, I suppose they heard there?

Oh, I can do that, Dad..
- No, we need them now not next week.
Cool, I found a medal.
Look at this.
How much longer do we have to stay?
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell and I?
m bored.
Ashley, honey.
Why don?
t you help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?
Me?
- Yes, you.
Grandpa Walt, would you like some help with these four chairs.
No, you probably just painted your nails.
Your dad is driving me crazy.
Why didn't you guys make him a hint we're leaving soon?
Come on, let's go.
Jesus Christ, how many swamp rats can get in one room?
Grandpa, when?
d you get the vintage car?
1972.
I never knew you had a cool old car.
Yeah, it's been here since before you were born.
So, what are you going do with it when you like... die?
Then what about that super cool retro couch that you have in the den
Cause I was thinking I?
m going to State next year, and I think it would look really good in my dorm room.
And I don't have any furniture at all.
God.
Who are you?
- Hi, I am Tao.
- What do you want?
I live next door.
- Come on, get the shit out of your mouth.
I am ...

And have some respect, zipper head, we?
re mourning here..
How you holding up, Walt?
Mr. Kowalski.
Huh?
- Mr. Kowalski, that's my name.
Right, Mr. Kowalski.
Your wife and I became quite close these last few months.
She asked that I watch over you when she passed on.
I told her I watch out for my entire flock.
But she made me promise I?
d keep an extra sharp eye on you.
I appreciate your kindness you've shown to my wife.
Now that you?
ve spoken your piece, why don?
t go and attend some of your other sheep?
Ok?
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her desire for you to go to confession.
She said she couldn?
t remember the last time you went.
Is that so?
- It is.
Well, I confess that I never really cared for church very much.
The only reason I went was because of her.
And I confess that I have no desire to confess to a boy that is just out of the seminary.
Wish I could help dad, but gotta get kids home.
Kids getting restless.
- Yeah, fine, just go.
I?
ll call in a few, see how you?
re doing.
- Alright.
Kill you to buy American.
Huh ...
Did you see the way he looked at the truck?
Jesus.
It?
s always Rice-Burner this or Jap-Burner that.
You know.
Even at Mom?
s funeral, he can?
t let it go.
At least he didn?
t say anything this time.
-He didn?
t need to.
Well, what do you expect, Mitch?
The man worked at a Ford plant for a lot of years.
I suppose that?
s my goddamned fault?
Just give it a rest.
Drive.
Ok?
Kids, do you want the radio on?
Yes.
You want to listen to some music?
Good.
Damn, barbarians
Oh, Jesus ...
Polarski would roll over in his grave if he could see his lawn now.
What the hell the chinks had to move in this neighborhood for?
Have you gone completely deaf or something?
Hi there, Walt.
I kind of not a friend of yours.
Why do you insist on calling me Walt?
Sorry , Mr.Kowalski.
What are you peddling today, padre?
- Nothing.
Thought I?

I haven?
t seen you in church in a while
Okay.
Well now when you tipped on your good deed, now why don?
t you just take off down the road?
I?
d really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.
- Not in this lifetime, sonny.
Why?
Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
- You don't want to know.
No, I do.
Well I think you?
re an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold the hands of old ladies who are superstitious and promises them eternity.
Is you a boy or is you a girl, I can?

A Mexican, a Jew and a colored guy go into the bar.
The bartender looks up and says:
"Get the fuck out of here!"
So, here?
s where my flock congregates when they?
re not in church..
Hey Father J.
- Hey, Mel.
Hey, Darrel.
Hey father.
- Hi, Walt.
What brings you in here, father.
Meat raffle?
No, I just came down to talk Walt if that's ok.
Damn, padre.
You are persistent, aren't you?
I promised your wife.
All right, let's get booze.
I'll have Pabst and a shot of Jack.
And whatever he's having.
I'll have a Diet Coke.
- Bullshit.
This is a bar.
You have a drink.
I'll have a gin and tonic.
- Attaboy!
So, what you want?
I promised your wife I?
d get you to go to confession.
Now, why would you do that?
- She was very insistent.
She made me.
Well you're kinda found of promising things you can?
t deliver on, right, father?
Let?
s talk about something else.
- What?
Life and death.
Life and death.
What the hell do you know about life and death?
I?
d like to think I know a lot.
I?
m a priest..
Yeah, you get up and preach about life and death.
But all what you know is what you learned in a priest school.
Right out of the rookie Preacher's Handbook
I don't know about that.
I think...
That is bittersweet.
Sort of bitter in its pain.
But sweet in its salvation.
That's what you know of life and death, and that's pathetic.
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?
I know a lot.
I lived there almost three years in Korea.
Thanks.
We shot men.
We stabbed them with bayonets, hacked seventeen-year-olds to death with shovels
Stuff I'll remember till the day I die.
Horrible things, but things I live with.
And what about life?
Well, I ...
I survived the war.
got married... and had a family.
Sounds like you know more about death than you do living.
Maybe so, father.
Maybe so.
Son of a bitch.
Hey, man, get in a car!
- Tao, what the fuck, get in!
Come on Tao.
- Come, let's go,man, get in!
Fuck man, get in!
Hello?
Morning, Dad, it?

Morning?
It's after one in the afternoon.
It's not morning.
Oh, right.
Afternoon, then.
So what do you want?
- What?
Me?
Nothing.
I mean, what would I want?
Well, I don?
t know.
Your wife has already gone through all of your mother?
s jewelry.
No, dad.
I was just calling to see how are you doing?
Well, anything new with the old neighborhood?
No.
- Great.
Smooth sailing then.
Yah.
- Ok, good, good, then.
Oh, hey, dead.
- Yeah.
You wouldn't happen to still know that guy from the plant who has Lion season tickets?
Dad?
Ain't she sweet?
Come on.
Hey, what's up?
What are you doing here, man?
- Nothing.
Minding our own business.
- Just hanging out.
What are you guys doing here?
What?
Can I just come here to hang with my little cousin?
We have good new for you.
- Really, and what's that?
Only for guy talk.
- I don't think so.
Why not?
- Come on, man, we are going to give you another shot.
Don't go, Tao.
- Mind your own business girl.
Come on, let's go
- Come.
What the hell is this?
Get up.
- G?
t off my lawn.
Listen old man, you don't want to fuck with me.
Did you hear me?
I said get off my lawn, now.
Are you fucking crazy?
Go back in a house.
Yeah, I'll blow the hole in your face and then I'll go in a house.
And I'll sleep like a baby You can count on that.
We used to stack fucks like you five feet high in Korea, used you for sandbags.
Ok.
You better watch your back...
Thank you.
Get off my lawn.
What the hell is this?
No, no, no, no more.
Stay right there.
Why can't you people just leave me alone?
We brought you some shallots to plant in the garden.
I don't want them.
They?
re perennials, they come back every year.
Look, why are bringing me all this garbage anyway.
Because
Because you saved, Tao.
I didn't save anybody.
I just.
I kept a bunch of jabbering gooks off of my lawn .
You are a hero to the neighborhood.
I am not a hero.
Too bad, they think you are and that?
s why they're keep bringing you the gifts.
Please take them.
- All they are wrong.
I just want to be left alone, thank you.
- Wait!
This is my mom, Vu, I?
m Sue and that's my brother, Tao.
We live next door.
- So?
Tao wants to say something.
I am sorry.
- Sorry for what?
For trying to steal your car.
Let me tell you something boy.
You step on this property again, you are done...
Good afternoon, Walt.
I told you I?
m not going to confession..
- Why didn't you just call the police?
What?
I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I heard there was some trouble in the neighborhood.
Why didn't call the police?
Well ...
You know why, I've prayed that they would show up, but..
.. nobody answered.
- What were you thinking?
Someone could have been killed.
We?
re talking life and death here.
When things go wrong, you gotta act quickly.
When we were in Korea and a thousand screaming gooks came across our land..
... we didn't call the police.
We reacted.
- We are not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski,
I?
ve been thinking about our conversation on life and death.
About what you said.
About how you carry around all the horrible things you were forced to do
Horrible things that won?
t leave you.
It seems that it would do you good to unload some of that burden.
Things done during war are terrible.
being ordered to kill ... killing to save yourself, killing to save others.
You?
re right, those are things I know nothing about.
But I do know about forgiveness.
And I?
ve seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins, admitted their guilt and left their burdens behind them.
Stronger men than you!
Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things... and are now at peace.
Well I got to hand it to you, padre, You came here with your guns loaded this time.
Thank you!
- And you're right about one thing.
About stronger men than me, reaching their salvation.
Well, Hallefuckinlujah.
- But you are wrong about something else.
- What's that, Mr. Kowalski?
The thing that haunts a man the most is what he isn?
t ordered to do.
There, finally, you look like a human being again. .
You shouldn?
t wait so long between haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch.
Well I am surprised you are still around.
I was always hoping that you die off and they get somebody in here they knew what the hell they are doing.
Instead you just keep hanging around, like the dump wop dago you are.
- That?
ll be ten dollars, Walt.
- Ten bucks, Jesus Christ, Martin.
What are you half-Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices all the time.
It?
s been ten bucks for the last five years and you hard-mellows,
Pollack son of a bitch.
Keep the change.
- See you in three weeks, prick.
Not if I see you first, dipshit.
That's cool, you know.
Look at this.
You tight ass over here.
Come here girl.
You can't say hi?
Or are you acting like stuck-up and shit.
What are you supposed to be man?
- Yo, it's cool dog.
The fuck are you doing in my neighborhood, boy?
None, Just going to the corner spot, you know get some CDs, sound good, bro?
He called, you bro!
- Come on sound good, bro?

Don't worry, I'll take a real good care with her.
Fuck out of here, .
- Fuck out of here, man!
Oh shit, you have a bitch with you.
Keep your ass right here.
Oh great.
Another asshole who has a fetish for Asian girls.
God, it gets so old.
Oh, shit, what's your name girl?
My name?
Get your ass out of here, okay.
It?
s 'take your crude, overly obvious come-on to every woman who walks past and cram it.'
That?
s my name.
Who do you think you are talking to?
Who does it look like?
Man she's tough.
- What?
You gonna hit me now?
That'd pretty much complete the picture.
You need to keep your bitch on a leash.
Put a choke chain on her and yank that motherfucker.
Oh, of course, right to the stereotype thesaurus
- Oh yeah
Call me a whore and a bitch in the same sentence.
-Bitch is crazy.
I like her like that
- Now take that bitch.
You don't know when to quit do you, girl?
- Let me teach you a lesson
Stop!
Let me go!
Take your ass over there.
What the fuck are you looking at old man?
What the hell are you spooks up to?
Spooks?
You'd better get your ass on honkey, while I still let you.
That's you'd better do.
What the fuck he thinks he is?
Have you noticed how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't fucking with?
That's me.
You are fucking crazy, get out of here, man.
Why don't you get your ass out of here before we kicked your wrinkly white ass.
What's wrong with him man?
The motherfucker's crazy!
-What is this thing?
What the hell?
Get in a truck.
Crazy motherfucker.
- What's wrong with him, man.
Hey pops come on now.
- Shut your fucking face!
You don't fucking listen, do you?
Now get in a truck.
- Go get in a truck girl.
Let her go, old man!
Shut up pussy.
What is this 'bro' shit anyway?
You want to be superb page, or something
These guy don't want to be your bro and I don't blame them.
Now get your old faint paddy ass on down the road.
Take care now.
You too.
Oh, yeah.
Why didn't you do nothing?
Man you fucking!
Shit man.
If he had cannon at your fucking face, you would do nothing.
What's the matter with you, for Christ sake?
Trying to get yourself killed?
I thought you Asian girls were supposed to be smart.
Hanging around in the neighborhood like that is the fast way to get you in the obituaries.
I know, I know.
Take it easy.
And what about that goofball guy you were with.
Is that a date or something?
Yeah, kind of.
His name is Trey.
- You should be hanging out with them.
You should be hanging out with your own people.
The other Hummongs.
- You mean, Hmong?
Hmong, not Hummong
- Whatever.
What the hell is Hmong, I mean Mong anyway?
Wow, you so enlighten you know that?
No, Hmong is not a place, it is a people.
My people come from different parts of Laos, Thailand and China.
Well how you ended up in my neighborhood?
Why didn't you stay there?
It's Vietnam thing.
We thought on your side And when American quit the communists started killing all the Hmong.
So we came over here.
Yeah, well I don't know how you ended up in Midwest.
Snow on the ground six months in the year.
What is it?
Jungle people wanted to be on great frozen tundra?
Hill people.
We are hill people.
Not jungle people.
BOO-ga, ga-Boo, BOO-ga!
Yeah, whatever ...
Blame the Lutherans.
They brought us up here.
Everybody blames the Lutherans.
Well, you'd think the cold will keep all the idiots out.
Thanks for the ride.
You know something kid, you are all right.
But what about that dimwit brother of yours?
He is little slow or something?
Tao is actually really smart.
He just doesn't know what direction to go in.
Poor toad.
- It is really common.
Hmong girls over here fit in better.
The girls go to college and the boys go to jail.
That old hag hates my ass.
Your birthday today, Daisy.
This year you have to make a choice between two life paths.
Second chances come your way.
Extraordinary events culminate in what might seem to be an anticlimax.
You lucky numbers are: 84, 23, 11, 78 and 99.
What a load of shit.
Yea.
What the hell is it with kids nowadays?
All right.
Let me help you with those.
- Oh, thank you.
How about that?
How about that, Daisy?
It's too heavy for a bag.
- No problem.
Good, Karen, give it to him.
-Here you go.
Well, what is it?
-It's a Gopher.
So you can reach stuff.
It makes things a lot of easier.
This is from me.
It's a phone.
Oh, I can see that.
I just thought...well, we thought that it would make things easier.
Thank you, Karen.
There?
s nothing wrong with making things less hard on yourself.
You know Karen?
s right, Dad.
You?
ve worked hard your whole life.
Maybe it's time you start thinking about taking it a easier?
And some other thing, Dad.
You really should get rid of the coffin nails.
We were thinking about the house.
You know, when Mom?
s gone, it?
s got to be a lot to maintain around here.
Let alone clean.
And you are here all alone ...
Yeah, you know, there?
s these great places now, you know, these communities
Where you don?
t have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow.
You know, People who are like you, active and alert, but are alone.
And would benefit from being around folks their own age.
Yeah Dad, look.
You got to check it out.
We brought some brochures.
These places are nothing like that you think they would be.
They are great.
- No, they are beautiful.
They are really nice They really are.
These are top-notch like resorts.
It is like staying in a hotel, practically.
- They're beautiful.
They really are.
- Yeah.
They care of everything.
They clean up.
They're really nice.
Oh, there are wonderful stores, where you can buy new shoes.
They are amazing, they really are.
You have a good time, play some golf maybe.
Meet other people.
Son of a bitch.
Kicked us out on his birthday.
I've told you that was a bad idea.
I know, you were right
- He won?
t let anybody help him.
Well, we tried.
Now can we just drop it?
No one can say we didn?
t try
What the hell with him, we shouldn't have done it.
We should?
ve stayed home with Josh and Ashley.
At least they were smart enough to not come here.
The goddamn kids have more sense than we do.
We miss mom, don't we Daisy?
Hey, Walt.
What are you up to?
We?
re having a barbecue.
You want to come over?
What do you think?
- There's tons of food.
Just keep you hands off my dog.
-No worries.
We only eat cats.
Really?
- No I am kidding, you moron.
Come on you can be my special guest.
-No, I am fine right here.
Yeah ...
Son of a bitch.
- Okay, so, what have you had to eat today?
I had a piece of cake.
And a little beef jerky.
Come on over and get something to eat.
We've got beer too.
Well ...
I might as well drink with strangers better than drinking alone.
It is my birthday.
Really.
Happy birthday Wally
- Don't call me Wally.
You have no Pabts among the beer.
- As they say, "when in Hmong."
What am I doing wrong?
Every time I look at somebody they always look at the ground.
What is she saying?
- She said welcome to our home.
Oh no, she is not.
- Yes, she didn't.
She hates me.
Yeah, she hates you.
Okay.
What?
!
What are all you fish heads looking at anyway?
I think we should go to other room.
Sorry.
All the people in this house are very traditional.
Number 1.
Never touch a Hmong person on the head, not even a child..
Hmong-people believe that the soul resides on the head.
So, don't do that.
- Sounds dumb, but fine.
And a lot of Hmong people consider looking at someone eye to be very rude.
That's why they look away, when you look at them.
- Anything else?
Yeah, some Hmong people tend to smile or grin when they?
re yelled at.
It's a cultural thing.
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity, it's not that they?
re laughing at you, really.
You people are nuts
But the food..
It looks good, smells good too.
-Of course, its Hmong food.
Okay, and I come back in few seconds.
Here you go.
- Thanks.
You mentioned about..
looking at people, he's been staring at me the whole evening.
That's Kor Khue.
He is the Lor's family shaman.
What's that some sort of witch doctor or something.
- Something like that.
Boeki Boo.
- You're funny, Wally.
Kor Khue's interested in you.
He heard what you did.
He would like to read you.
It would be rude not allow him this.
It's a great honor.
Yeah sure.
It's fine by me.
- All right, take a seat.
He says people do not respect you.
They don't even want to look at you.
He says the way you live, your food has no flavor.
You wearied by your life.
You made a mistake.
And you past life is like a mistake what you did.
You are not satisfied with.
He says, you have no happiness in your life.
It's like you are not at peace.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I am fine.
Fine, I am fine.
God, I?
ve got more in common with these gooks than I have with my own spoiled-rotten family.
Jesus Christ ...
Happy Birthday.
Are you ok?
Yeah, I am fine.
You were bleeding.
- No, I bit my tongue.
It's nothing.
Why don't we get down and get some of that good gook food.
I am starving.
Okay.
You ladies are wonderful.
That stuff is really good.
Come on you glutton!
- What's up?
Let's go.
- What for?
To mingle.
- We can mingle right here.
No.
You told me not to leave you alone.
Thank you very much.
I have to go now.
I'll be back.
Don't let me go right of it .
Well, well, look he is over there.
- Yeah, the kid who steal my Gran Torino.
My brother Tao.
- Tried to anyway, yeah, toad.
It was wobby a bit.
But it should fix it.
What's this?
Little rice liquor Here, try it.
All right.
My friends and I were just wondering what you?
re doing here?
That's a good question.
What am I doing here?
My name is Walt.
- Hey, Walt.
I am Wa Xam.
Wa Yum?
- No Wa Xam.
Wa Xam, Ok.
- So what do you do?
I fix things.
Stuff like that.
- Like what?
I've just fixed that dryer over there.
I fixed my wife's friend sink.
I took old aunt Merry to doctor to get a prescription.
Fixed up.
I've even the fixed the door, what had't even broken yet.
You're funny
I've been called a lot of things, but never funny.
Well, I have to take off.
Enjoy yourself.
- Okay, Yum Yum.
Later.
Come on.
Relax, zipper headed.
I am not gonna shoot you.
I'd look down too if I was you.
You know, I knew you were a dipshit the first time I ever saw you.
You?
re worse with women than you are with stealing cars, Toad.
It's Tao.
- What?
It's not toad, it's Tao.
My name is Tao.
You were blowing it with that girl who was there.
Not that I give two shits about a Toad like you.
You don't what you are talking about.
You are wrong egg roll.
I know exactly what I am talking about.
I may not be the most pleasant person to be around.
But I got the best woman who was ever on this planet to marry me.
I had to work at it.
That was the best thing that ever happened to me.
Hangs down.
But you ... you know
You let Click Clack, Ding Dong and Charlie Chan just walk out with what?
s-her-face.
She likes you, you know.
I don't know why.
Who?
Yum yum!
You know that girl in the purple sweater.
She's been looking at you all day, stupid.
Do you mean, Wa Xam?
- Yeah, Yum Yum.Yeah.
Nice girl, very charming girl.
I talked with her.
But you let her just walk right out.
With the three stooges.
And you know why?
Cause you are big, fat pussy.
Well ...
I gotta go.
Good day.
Puss cake.
No, no more.
Okay, put them over there.
No.
No.
No more No more.
No more.
No more, please ...
Is that chicken dumpling thing you brought before?
Alright.
Better than beef jerky all the time.
What's going on?
What's going on?
-Tao is here to make amends.
He is here to work for you.
-No, he isn't.
He's not gonna work for me.
My mom said dishonored the family.
And now he has to work off his dept.
He starts tomorrow morning.
- Oh not tomorrow, not any time.
I don't even want him on my property I thought we went over all that.
It is very important to my mom that you accept.
And that would be an insult if you refuse.
Why is it being put back on me, all of this?
He is the one who tried to steal my car ... all of the sudden I am a bad guy in this thing.
Look my family is very traditional and would be very much upset if you don't let Tao repay.
If you doesn't want to do it, then let's just go.
Shut up!
Yeah, shut up.
All right, tomorrow, tomorrow.
Thank you.
Jesus, Joseph and Mary.
These Hmong broads are like badgers.
Son of a bitch.
I never thought he'd show.
All right, what are you good at?
Like what?
- That's what I am asking.
You gonna work for me, I gotta know what you are good at.
I gotta know what you can do.
- I don't know.
That's kind of half way what I expected you to say.
See that tree right there?
You just go over there and count the birds.
You want me to count the birds?
- Yeah, you can count?
All you slopes are supposed to be good at math, right?
Yeah, I can count.
- Good.
One, two ...
So, what do you have for me to do?
You want me to watch paint dry or maybe count the clouds that pass by?
Don't get flip with me, boy.
I am not the one who is trying to steal, don't you forget that.
Go ahead.
I don?
t care if you insult me and say racist things.
Cause you know what?
I'll take it.
- Of cause you'll take it.
Cause you have no teeth, you have no balls, kid.
Look, I am stuck here.
Why don't you find something useful for me to do.
Unlike you, I am not useless.
And I maintain my own property.
These swamp rats, on the other hand, you just can help it.
How long do I have you for?
Toad, how long?
Till next Friday.
All right.
Go get the ladder out of the garage.
When you got finished with that roof there.
You can take that gutter, and nail it back up.
I am tired looking at it for the last three years.
Yeah, you said it, brother.
Hello.
Grandpa says he want to know if you can have Tao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch?
Wasp nest?
That's terrible.
I think we can handle that after the lunch.
Lord All Mighty, knock it off.
It's my last day.
What else do have for me do?
Take a day-off.
You did enough.
Toad!
Nothing.
Nevermind.
Kowski?
Kowski?
Kowski?
Mr. Kowalski?
Good morning.
I looked over your paperwork and I think we should immediately start a full battery of tests
I feel that this would be the best way to go about checking all the issues that you've had.
Excuse me, what happened to Dr.Felmon, my regular doctor?
Dr. Felmon retired three years ago.
I am his replacement Dr. Chang.
It's grandpa Walt.
- Pick it up.
You talk to him!
Mitch.
I'm doing bills here.
- You talk to him, he is yours father.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Mitch.
It's me your dad.
Yeah, I know.
What's up?
Oh, nothing, nothing much really.
How is everything going?
I am fine, fine.
How about Karen and the kids?
Fine, everybody is great.
Doing fine.
Good.
How about work?
Busy.
Yeah, I suppose...
In fact, um, speaking of busy.
I got a lot on my plate right now, so if it is not something pressing.
No, not it all.
Why don't you call me this weekend?
Sure.
Ok, It was nice talking to you.
Thanks for talk.
Thanks.
This kid doesn't have a chance.
What do you know about faucets?
I know a lot about them, boy.
Tender side.
Jesus.
For the love of Pete.
- What?
It must be a hundred degrees here.
Just, turn on the fan.
This place is wobbling apart.
Where did you get all the stuff?
What are you talking about?
- All the tools and stuff.
Well, may come as surprise to a thief, but I bought this stuff.
Everything in here with my own money.
Yeah, yeah.
This is not what I meant.
I mean this is so much shit packed in here.
Yeah, well.
Every tool in here has a purpose.
Everything has a job to do.
They are all used when necessary.
- Okay, so, what is that?
it is a post hole digger.
- That
Vice-grips.
Wire cutters, you know that's a trowel.
There is shears right there, and that's a saw.
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me kid.
Alright, what's on your mind.
It's just..
I can't afford to buy all this stuff.
Well, I guess, even a bonehead like you, could understand... that a man acquires it over the period of 50 years.
Yeah, but...
All right, look, here.
These three items right here, you can have this.
WD-40, vice grips and some duck tape.
Any man who is worth his salt, can do half of the house chores with just those three things.
Anything else you need you just borrow it, that's all.
Ok, cool.
Fuck me.
- What's with that?
Nothing.
What?
Nothing, huh?
I just saw you've coughed out blood.
That's not good.
You should really see a doctor.
Look..
Those guys over here, the other night ... on my lawn, what a bout them?
- Just a gang.
A bunch of Hmong gang bangers.
I assume that.
What they were doing here?
They were going to take me away.
They were kind of pissed, that I blew my first initiation.
Yeah, well you are, you are a pussy.
You wanna hang out with guys like that.
What was your initiation supposed to be?
My Gran Torino?
Toad, you got a minute?
Here it is.
Here is the deal.
I take the top, cause that's the heaviest.
I'll pull on that.
And you stand right back here, and you push.
And help me push it up each step.
like that.
- Then, let me take the top.
No, no, I've got a top.
No, I'll take the top.
It looks pretty heavy.
Look I am not crippled.
I've got the top.
If you don't let me take the top.
I ain't helping.
I will go back home.
Listen to me, zipper head.
No, you listen, old man!
I am here because you need help.
So it is either top of I am out of here.
All right, you take the top and I'll push.
Don't let it slip off you little girl hands and crush me.
Don't give me any ideas.
That thing weighs a ton.
Runs like a clock.
They don't make them like this anymore.
So what are you going to do with it?
- Sell it I guess.
How much?
- 60 bucks.
I am tired of having this sit around down in the basement there.
Why?
You are looking for a freezer?
Our downstairs one kind of died.
- Okay, 25 bucks and it's yours.
25?
You've just said 60.
I know, it will save me money putting an ad in the paper.
Come on, let haul it over your place.
Kind of ironic, huh?
- What?
Toad washing a car they tried to steal from you.
Yeah, he misses one spot.
He is doing it all over again too.
It is nice of you to kind look after him like this.
He doesn't have any real role models in his life.
Well, I am not a role model.
But you are a good man, Wally.
I wish our father would have been more like you.
Don't go calling me Wally.
No, I am serious.
He was really hard on us.
Really traditional... and really old school.
Well, I am old school.
yeah, but you an American.
What's that supposed to me?
You like him, don't you?
- Are you kidding?
He tried to steal my car.
And you spend time with him, teaching him how to fix things.
Saved him from a fucked cousin of ours...
- Hey, what you language lady.
And you're a good man
- I am not a good man.
Give me another beer, dragon lady.
This one is empty.
You know, Hmong consider gardening to be a woman's work.
Yeah, that probably why I see in the garden over there all the time.
Besides we ain't in Hu-Mong.
- Funny.
You know you should quit.
That's bad for you.
Yeah?
So it is being in a gang, dipshit.
Didn't you hear what I've just said?
I saw you coughed out blood.
You should quit.
What's that emblem supposed to mean anyway?
Your ancient camp scout emblem?
1'st cavalry.
I've had it since 1951.
So what you wanna do with you life kid.
I was thinking maybe sales.
So you wanna be in sales?
What about going to school, maybe.
But school costs money.
Maybe you should get a job.
You can't just sit there and spread mulch in my garden for the rest of your life.
Maybe you can just pay me.
Yeah, very funny.
What kind of job could I ever get?
- Yeah you're right, nobody would ever hire you.
Look I am just kidding zip...
I mean.
You can get a job.
You can get a job everywhere.
Like what?
How about construction?
- Me?
Yeah.
- Construction?
Yeah.
- Do you have Alzheimer?
s or something?
.
No, get a job in the construction.
I know people in the trades.
Of course I have to make a little adjustment and man you up a little bit.
Man me up?
- Yeah.
And I think you ought to date Miss Yum Yum too.
Do you little good.
Get carbon off the vaults.
Now you just gonna learn, how guys talk.
You just listen the way Martin and I banter back and forth.
You okay?
You are ready?
- Sure.
Let's go in.
Perfect.
A pollack and a chink.
How are you doing, Martin, you crazy Italian prick.
Walt, you cheap bastard, I should have known you?
d come in,
I was having such a pleasant day
- What did you do?
Jew some poor blind guy out of his money.
Giving him a wrong change?
- Who's the nip?
He is a pussy kid from next door.
I am just trying to man him up a little bit.
You see kid?
That's how guys talk to one another .
They do?
-Do you have shit in your ears?
Now go out and come back in and talk to him like a man.
Like a real man.
Come on.
Get your ass out of here.
Come on back now.
Sorry about this.
That's ok.
What's up you old Italian prick?
Get out of my shop before I blow your head off you goddamn dick smoker.
Jesus Christ.
Shit.
Take it easy.
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
That's what you said.
That what you said men say.
You don't just come in and insult a man in his own shop.
What happens if you meet some stranger?
If you get the wrong one he's gonna blow you gook head right off.
What should I've said then?
- Why don't you start with Hi or Hello.
Yeah just come in and say: 'Sir, I'd like a haircut if you have a time'
Yeah, be polite but don't kiss ass.
In fact you can talk about the construction job you just came from.
And bitch about your girl friend in your car.
Son of a bitch, I've just got breaks fixed and those sons of the bitches really nailed me.
They screwed right in the ass.
Yeah, don't swear at the guy.
Just talk about people who are not in the room.
You can bitch about your boss making you work overtime when it is bowling night.
Right, my old lady bitches for two goddamn hours about how..
they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store.
and the minute I turn on a fucking game she starts crying we never talk.
See now go out, come back and talk to him.
And it ain't a rocket science for Christ sake.
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car, or a girlfriend.
Jesus, I should have blown his head off when I had a chance.
Maybe so, I want you to turn around and go outside and come back and don't talk about having no job, no car, no girlfriend, no future, no dick.
Ok, just turn around and go.
Excuse me sir, I need a hair cut if you ain't too busy.
You old Italian son of a bitch prick barber.
Boy, does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job.
Fuck me.
All set to go through with this, right?
- Yeah, yeah.
Don't yeah, yeah me.
Just say:
Yes sir and I'll do my best.
Yes, I'll do my best.
- Cause when I vouch for somebody that means I am give them my word.
I don't want you making me look bad.
No I am good.
Totally into this.
Don't lay down either.
Just look em straight in the eye.
And a man can tell a lot by your handshake.
Here, put those in your back pocket.
- Cool.
Don't blow this.
Hey, Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon.
How the hell are you?
I am shitty.
But who's gonna listen?
- Not me, that's for sure.
Help yourself there, Walt.
You dumb pollack.
Ok this is the kid, I was telling you about.
Tao, this is Tim Kennedy, he is super on this job.
What we got here, Walt?
Well he knows construction and he is a smart kid.
He'll do anything you need him for.
You sure?
- Yeah.
You speak English?
- Yes, sir.
Were you born here?
- You bet.
I see that Walt drove you here.
You got a vehicle?
Not at the moment.
Taking a bus for now.
- Bus?
Jesus Christ.
You don't have a car?
My head gasket cracked and the goddamned pricks at the shop wants to bend me over for $2100
Oh please.
I just replaced the tranny in my Tahoe and the sons a bitches fucked me hard, just under $3200.
Goddamned thieves.

Thanks, Mr. Kennedy.
That's Tim, and what's you name again?
- Tao.
T. .., okay.
You owe me one, Walt.
Well I'll buy a fruit cake for Christmas.
Fuck a fruit cake.
How about you just hand over the keys to that Gran Torino.
What the hell does everybody want my car?
- Yeah, I am not surprised.
Yeah, you don't know a half of it.
Alright, come on, zipper head.
Let the Mick stay here and play with himself.
What are we doing?
What do you want to do?
Carry you tools in a rice bag?
Here.
You can use one of these ... and you'll need one of this here.
I can't afford any of this.
I'll cover it.
You can pay me back with your first pay check.
Cool
- Here, we need something like that.
This is what I am looking for here, tool belt.
There you go.
Not to bitch.
But won't I be needing some tools.
Tools I've got but I am not going to lend you my tool belt.
You can pick up tools as you go.
I really appreciate all this.
- Forget it.
No, I really do Thank you.
What's up homeboy, what are you doing?
What up man?
- What you got, punk?
Checking up on my little cousin.
- Yeah, man.
My little cousin ...
What's this?
Where you come from man?
- I am coming
Home from work I know you guys don't know much about that.
So that's true, you got a job.

What?
He is scared, huh?
Who bought this shit for you?
Your dad?
- What you guys want with me?
Your dad bought this shit for you?

- Hey come on, this is my stuff.
You wanna smoke man?
Fuck it.

Give me that, man.
Give me that.
What's the phrase I am looking for?
Oh yeah, 'saving face'
Hey, there.
Hey.
I gotta run.
Haven't seen you for a few days.
Where you've been?
Been busy.
Busy, huh?
What the hell happened to you?
- Don't worry about it.
What do you mean don't worry about it.
Look at your goddamn face.
I said don't worry about it.
Okay, it's not your problem.
When?
Grabbed me a couple of days ago right after I go off work.
Cowards.
I did everything I can possibly do.
But they broke some of your tools.
I will replace them.
Don't worry about the tools.
Where is your cousin lives?
No, Walt.
I'll be ok.
I don't want you to do anything.
- Right,.
You could need extra tools, you just let me know.
Well, I could use a roofing hammer.
-Good, go in my garage and get it.
This should be the last stop.
Here is the deal.
You stay away from Tao, understand?
You tell your friends to stay away from Tao.
You want to fight with us than I could sound don't want to see him anymore.
That's it, got it?
I'll take that as yes.
Cause if I have to come back here it is gonna get fucking ugly.
Get off of my way.
How do you want your dog?
I mean steak?
Funny.
I told you we only eat cats.
I've never seen you like this before.
Well I am feeling good.
I god beautiful women, great food.
And Tao.
And even Tao isn't bugging me.
You are having a good time, I see.
-Yeah.
And it never ends.
What happened to your knuckles anyways?
I slipped in a shower.
No big problem.
Look Yum-Yum if he doesn't ask you out I will ask you out.
Wa Xam, don't listen to him.
He is a white devil.
Yeah, I am.
I am a white devil.
I've loved to Walt, but he beat you to it.
Really?
No kidding!
Dinner and a movie, or what?
Yeah, they are taking a bus.
No, you can't take a bus.
You gonna get you something more stylish that that.
Like what?
Take a limo?
How about that?
The Gran Torino?
- Yeah.
You'd let me take the Gran Torino.
- Yeah, I let you take the Gran Torino.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Is everybody all right?
Tao!
It's all right.
Where's grandma?
Where is Sue?
Where is Sue?
- She went to our aunts.
To her aunts?
Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Get on the phone and call her right now.
Sue ...
I knew, this was gonna happen.
What the hell am I doing here?
Maybe some of her friends called her and she changed her plans.
Yeah.
At the war we just all of us lost a lot of friends but you gotta stand for it.
You can care to it.
Mr. Kowalski?
Are you Ok?
Yeah, I am Ok.
Police finally left, no one is talking.
One thing about Hmong, they keep their mouths shut.
Yeah, I've noticed that.
You know, Tao and Sue will never gonna find peace in this world as long as those gangs around.
Until they go away.
You know forever.
What are you saying?
You know what I am saying.
I took Sue to the hospital.
She is scared.
They are all scared..
Yeah
Tao especially.
He?
s sitting out there right now staring at your front door.
You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.
What would you do?
What should Tao do?
I know what I would do if I was you.
Or at least what you think you should do.
- Really
If I was Tao I guess I'd wanted vengeance.
I'd wanted to stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys.
And you?
- What would I do?
I'd come over here and talk to you I guess.
I know you are close with these people, but this pisses me off too.
Mr.Kowalski.
Wanna beer?
- I'd love one.
There some in the chest, right over there behind you.
Damn all this.
It just isn't fair.
- Nothing is fair, father.
So what you gonna do, Mr. Kowalski?
Call me Walt.
All right.
What you gonna do, Walt?
I don't know.
But I'll think of something.
Whatever it is, they won't have a chance.
What are you doing?
Thinking.
Thinking.
Thinking time is over.
Now it's time to knock shit out of these pricks.
I know you don't want to hear this, but now it's the time to stay calm.
Calm?
You want me to be calm?
We stay calm or else mistakes will get made.
We have to step back from this thing.
No, don't let me down Walt.
Not you.
This is gonna end today.
Sit down.
I don't want to sit.
I said sit down.
Now, listen to me.
We gotta plan this and plan it very carefully.
Can't make any mistakes.
You know I am the right man for this job.
I want to go home and stay calm, and come back here at 4 this afternoon.
And this to be done will be done.
I say we go now, Right now.
And what?
Kill that cousin of yours and the rest of those zips.
Mr. Tough Guy is out for blood all of the sudden.
I know nothing about it.
Now go home.
You stay calm come back here at 4.
Ok?
Okay.
I know, I know.
Give me a break, please, it?
s the first time I?
ve ever smoked in the house.
Let a man enjoy himself,would you girl.
All finished. 10 dollars American.
I don?
t suppose your guinea hands are steady enough to do a straight shave?
- Straight shave?
You've never asked about straight shave ever.
I know but I always wondered about it.
That's unless you are too busy.
No, just let me heat up a towel.
Here is 20.
Keep the change.
It is just in case you hit my jugular.
Yes sir, It gonna take about one hour.
We gonna shorten these sleeves little bit.
Gonna fix at the shoulder.
I never had a suited suit before.
Yes sir, look very good.
Yes, sir.
Look very good.
What can I do for you, Mr. Kowalski?
- I am here for a confession.
Lord Jesus, what have you done?
- Nothing you just take it easy now.
What are you up to?
Are you gonna give a confession or not?
How long has it been since your last confession?
Forever.
Bless me father, for I have sinned.
What are your sins, my son?
In 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski at the factory Christmas party.
Dorothy was in the other room with the other wives.
it just happened.
Yes, go on.
Well, I made 900 dollars profit selling a boat and motor.
I didn't pay the taxes it is the same as stealing.
Yes, fine.
Lastly...
I was never very close with my two sons.
I don't know them.
I didn't know how.
That's it?
- That's it.
It's bothered me most of my life.
Say 10 "Hail Maries" and 5 "Our fathers".
God loves and forgives you and absolves you of all your sins.
In the name of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.
Thank you padre.
Are you going to retaliate for what happened to Sue.
I?
m going over to that house today, Mr. Kowalski.
Is that so?
- It is.
And every other day until you see the folly of what you are planning.
Busy day, gotta go.
- Go in peace.
Oh I am at peace.
Jesus Christ.
So which one is mine?
You ever fired a weapon before?
- No
Why don't you put that one down.
I got something more to show you.
What?
In 1952 we were sent to take out a chink machine gun nest.
They trod us up pretty good.
I was the only one who came back out there.
For that they gave me a silver star.
Here it is.
Here I want you to have it.
Why?
Because we all knew the danger that night.
But we went anyway.
That's the way it might be tonight.
There is always a chance you don't come back.
The hell we won?
t.
We?
re will roll in there and tear ass.
Yeah, that's foolish.
That's the exact reaction they are waiting for.
Come on and close this up.
How many?
- How many what?
How many men did you kill in Korea?
13, maybe more.
-What was it like to kill a man.
You don't want to know.
Now close it up.
Walt!
Walt!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Relax, you can't get out of there.
You let me out right now !
Let me out.
You fuck let me out, I'll fucking kill you.
Shut the fuck up!
You want to know what is like to kill a man?
Well, that's goddamn awful.
The only thing worse is get a medal of valor for killing some poor kids..
that wanted just to give up that's all
Yeah, some scared little gook just like you.
I shot them right in a face with that rifle you were holding in there a while ago.
So if the day goes by that I don't think about it.
You don't that on your soul.
I got blood on my hands.
I am soiled.
That's why I am going alone tonight.
Walt you take me with you right now, let me out.
Look, you've come a long way.
I am proud to say that you are my friend.
But you got your whole life ahead of you.
But me, I finished things.
That's what I do and I am going alone.
No, wait.
Walt!
Walt!
I need you to watch my dog.
Yeah I love you too.
Yeah, she is old too.
Her name is Daisy.
Hello.

The keys to my house are under the ceramic turtle on the from porch.
Let yourself in.
Your brother is in the basement.
I gotta go.
Sorry father, we have to go.
I am telling if we are not here there will be a bloodshed.
We've been here for hours.
We can't afford to anchor a unit down to one location.
I am bagging you to stay.
Just got a word from my sergeant, we're pulling the plug.
I am staying.
No you aren't.
We have specific orders you came with us, you are leaving with us.
Watch your head.

Officer Chang!

- Hey, step back now, Ok.
Get the fuck out of here!
Walt Kowalski once said to me that I didn't know anything about life or death.
Because I was an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who held the hands of superstitious old women and promised they eternity.
Walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it.
But he was right.
I knew really nothing about life or death, until I got to know Walt.
And boy did I learn.
And I want to leave my house to the church becouse Dorothy would've liked it now which brings to out last item .
And again please excuse the language.
in Mr. Kowalski's will, I?
m simply reading it as it was written.
And I'd like to leave my 1972 Gran Torino to ... my friend ...
Tao Vang Lor.
Under the condition that you don?
t choptop top the roof like one of those beaners don?
tpaintanyidioticflameson it like some white-trash hillbilly anddon?

cars
It just looks like hell
If you If you can refrain from doing any of that, it?
s yours
I'm just so brokenhearted.
I want my daughter to find another husband.
If she married again there would be a man in the house.
What about Thao?
The man of the house is right there.
Look at him washing dishes.
He does whatever his sister orders him to do.
How could he ever become the man of the house?
Be patient, once he's older, he will be the man of the house.
No way.
Today is a blessed day, for a child is born.
I offer food to nurture this child's body.
I offer clothing to protect this child's flesh.
The child is blessed with a mother and father.
Oh, spirit of this child return home and do not wander anymore.
Come home, spirit and soul, come home.
Live a good life and grow old.
Why does that old white man stay here?
All the Americans have moved out of this neighborhood.
Why haven't you gone?
Why don't you strut away you dumb rooster?
Those punk-ass Mexicans messing with you?
Please, it's important.
He went for his lighter and they shot him.
He didn't even have a gun on him.
This time we have witnesses.
These guys will be locked up for a long time.
God, I am sorry for Dorothy, Walt.
She was a real peach.
Thanks for coming, Al.
Spectacles, testicles, wallet and watch.
Look at the Old Man glaring at Ashley.
He can?
t even tone it down at Mom?
s funeral?
What do you expect?
Dad?
s still living in the ?
50s.
He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly.
Yeah, well your kid?
s wearing a Timberwolves jersey.
I?
m sure Dad appreciates that.
The point I am trying to make is that there?
s nothing anyone can do that won?
t disappoint the Old Man.
It?
s inevitable.
That?
s why we stopped doing Thanksgivings.
the deal with the boat motor, the broken bird bath,
It?
s always something.
What are we going to do with him?
Don?
t you think he?
ll get in trouble over there all by himself in the old neighborhood?
Why don?
t you have him move in with you?
Death is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics.
Bitter in the pain.
Sweet in the salvation.
Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased.
... and their families
Sweet to those who know the salvation that awaits.
And some may ask, what is death?
Is it the end?
Or is it the beginning?
And what is life?
What is this thing we call life?
All these questions can frustrate you at times like this.
And that's why you have to turn to the Lord.
- Jesus ...
Because the Lord is the sweetness.
Is that dad?
- No, that's grandpa Walt.
There is a platoon, E-Company, March 2, 1952.
Korea?
- Where's Korea?
Well, people showed up after the service, huh?
Yeah, well, I suppose they heard there?
d be a lot of ham.
I?
ll go down the basement and get some chairs.
Oh, I can do that, Dad..
- No, we need them now not next week.
Cool, I found a medal.
Look at this.
How much longer do we have to stay?
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell and I?
m bored.
Ashley, honey.
Why don?
t you help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?
Me?
- Yes, you.
Grandpa Walt, would you like some help with these four chairs.
No, you probably just painted your nails.
Your dad is driving me crazy.
Why didn't you guys make him a hint we're leaving soon?
Come on, let's go.
Jesus Christ, how many swamp rats can get in one room?
Grandpa, when?
d you get the vintage car?
1972.
I never knew you had a cool old car.
Yeah, it's been here since before you were born.
So, what are you going do with it when you like... die?
Then what about that super cool retro couch that you have in the den
Cause I was thinking I?
m going to State next year, and I think it would look really good in my dorm room.
And I don't have any furniture at all.
God.
Who are you?
- Hi, I am Tao.
- What do you want?
I live next door.
- Come on, get the shit out of your mouth.
I am ...
- Tell me what you want.
Do you have jumper cables?
My uncle?
s car is old and.....
- No we don't any jumper cables .
And have some respect, zipper head, we?
re mourning here..
How you holding up, Walt?
Mr. Kowalski.
Huh?
- Mr. Kowalski, that's my name.
Right, Mr. Kowalski.
Your wife and I became quite close these last few months.
She asked that I watch over you when she passed on.
I told her I watch out for my entire flock.
But she made me promise I?
d keep an extra sharp eye on you.
I appreciate your kindness you've shown to my wife.
Now that you?
ve spoken your piece, why don?
t go and attend some of your other sheep?
Ok?
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her desire for you to go to confession.
She said she couldn?
t remember the last time you went.
Is that so?
- It is.
Well, I confess that I never really cared for church very much.
The only reason I went was because of her.
And I confess that I have no desire to confess to a boy that is just out of the seminary.
Wish I could help dad, but gotta get kids home.
Kids getting restless.
- Yeah, fine, just go.
I?
ll call in a few, see how you?
re doing.
- Alright.
Kill you to buy American.
Huh ...
Did you see the way he looked at the truck?
Jesus.
It?
s always Rice-Burner this or Jap-Burner that.
You know.
Even at Mom?
s funeral, he can?
t let it go.
At least he didn?
t say anything this time.
-He didn?
t need to.
Well, what do you expect, Mitch?
The man worked at a Ford plant for a lot of years.
I suppose that?
s my goddamned fault?
Just give it a rest.
Drive.
Ok?
Kids, do you want the radio on?
Yes.
You want to listen to some music?
Good.
Damn, barbarians
Oh, Jesus ...
Polarski would roll over in his grave if he could see his lawn now.
What the hell the chinks had to move in this neighborhood for?
Have you gone completely deaf or something?
Hi there, Walt.
I kind of not a friend of yours.
Why do you insist on calling me Walt?
Sorry , Mr.Kowalski.
What are you peddling today, padre?
- Nothing.
Thought I?
d drop by and see how you are doing.
I haven?
t seen you in church in a while
Okay.
Well now when you tipped on your good deed, now why don?
t you just take off down the road?
I?
d really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.
- Not in this lifetime, sonny.
Why?
Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
- You don't want to know.
No, I do.
Well I think you?
re an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold the hands of old ladies who are superstitious and promises them eternity.
Is you a boy or is you a girl, I can?
t tell
Hey, Chicito.
If you was in pink, I would fuck you and your ass would be my bitch.

Fuck yes, that's my little cousin.

What are you doing little man?
Why are you doing woman's work?
What do you want?
What?
We can't just come and talk to my little cousin?
He doesn't want to talk to you.
I am here right.
- Hey, Spider, who is that?
What's up?
- Spider?
Is that what he just called you, Fong?
Spider?
- Is there something wrong with Spider?
What are you doing here?
Hey, so how old are you anyways?
Mentally, I am way too old for you.

You are just stupid.
I am going inside.
Sue!
How your little brother, do this gardening.
Fine, stupid.
Hey, you will roll with us man, come on?
Come on ride with us.
- Chill with us.
You need somebody to protect you, man.
That's what your big cousins are for.
Look, dawg.
I've been there, I've done it and I've seen it.
Back in a day everybody wanted to beat me, dawg.
But now look, nobody wants to fuck with me.
Come on man, let's go.
- We are cousins right?
Come on.
- We are cousins right?
We are a family.
Look, I am brother to Spider, as he is brother to me.
Come on.
Take this shit off.
That's a woman's work man.
- Come get your hands dirty, man.
So what do I have to do?
Spider told that old boy next door had a bad ass whip.
Told you we got him.
Come on.
Nice.
- Ya, my little cousin being little man.
Yo, that's a nice car.
1972 Gran Torino, Fastback.
Cobra jet engine.
- Yo man it can still in mint condition.
Yo man, it's in mint condition man.
I've got one.
A Mexican, a Jew and a colored guy go into the bar.
The bartender looks up and says:
"Get the fuck out of here!"
So, here?
s where my flock congregates when they?
re not in church..
Hey Father J.
- Hey, Mel.
Hey, Darrel.
Hey father.
- Hi, Walt.
What brings you in here, father.
Meat raffle?
No, I just came down to talk Walt if that's ok.
Damn, padre.
You are persistent, aren't you?
I promised your wife.
All right, let's get booze.
I'll have Pabst and a shot of Jack.
And whatever he's having.
I'll have a Diet Coke.
- Bullshit.
This is a bar.
You have a drink.
I'll have a gin and tonic.
- Attaboy!
So, what you want?
I promised your wife I?
d get you to go to confession.
Now, why would you do that?
- She was very insistent.
She made me.
Well you're kinda found of promising things you can?
t deliver on, right, father?
Let?
s talk about something else.
- What?
Life and death.
Life and death.
What the hell do you know about life and death?
I?
d like to think I know a lot.
I?
m a priest..
Yeah, you get up and preach about life and death.
But all what you know is what you learned in a priest school.
Right out of the rookie Preacher's Handbook
I don't know about that.
I think...
That is bittersweet.
Sort of bitter in its pain.
But sweet in its salvation.
That's what you know of life and death, and that's pathetic.
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?
I know a lot.
I lived there almost three years in Korea.
Thanks.
We shot men.
We stabbed them with bayonets, hacked seventeen-year-olds to death with shovels
Stuff I'll remember till the day I die.
Horrible things, but things I live with.
And what about life?
Well, I ...
I survived the war.
got married... and had a family.
Sounds like you know more about death than you do living.
Maybe so, father.
Maybe so.
Son of a bitch.
Hey, man, get in a car!
- Tao, what the fuck, get in!
Come on Tao.
- Come, let's go,man, get in!
Fuck man, get in!
Hello?
Morning, Dad, it?
s your number one son, Mitch.
Morning?
It's after one in the afternoon.
It's not morning.
Oh, right.
Afternoon, then.
So what do you want?
- What?
Me?
Nothing.
I mean, what would I want?
Well, I don?
t know.
Your wife has already gone through all of your mother?
s jewelry.
No, dad.
I was just calling to see how are you doing?
Well, anything new with the old neighborhood?
No.
- Great.
Smooth sailing then.
Yah.
- Ok, good, good, then.
Oh, hey, dead.
- Yeah.
You wouldn't happen to still know that guy from the plant who has Lion season tickets?
Dad?
Ain't she sweet?
Come on.
Hey, what's up?
What are you doing here, man?
- Nothing.
Minding our own business.
- Just hanging out.
What are you guys doing here?
What?
Can I just come here to hang with my little cousin?
We have good new for you.
- Really, and what's that?
Only for guy talk.
- I don't think so.
Why not?
- Come on, man, we are going to give you another shot.
Don't go, Tao.
- Mind your own business girl.
Come on, let's go
- Come.
What the hell is this?
Get up.
- G?
t off my lawn.
Listen old man, you don't want to fuck with me.
Did you hear me?
I said get off my lawn, now.
Are you fucking crazy?
Go back in a house.
Yeah, I'll blow the hole in your face and then I'll go in a house.
And I'll sleep like a baby You can count on that.
We used to stack fucks like you five feet high in Korea, used you for sandbags.
Ok.
You better watch your back...
Thank you.
Get off my lawn.
What the hell is this?
No, no, no, no more.
Stay right there.
Why can't you people just leave me alone?
We brought you some shallots to plant in the garden.
I don't want them.
They?
re perennials, they come back every year.
Look, why are bringing me all this garbage anyway.
Because
Because you saved, Tao.
I didn't save anybody.
I just.
I kept a bunch of jabbering gooks off of my lawn .
You are a hero to the neighborhood.
I am not a hero.
Too bad, they think you are and that?
s why they're keep bringing you the gifts.
Please take them.
- All they are wrong.
I just want to be left alone, thank you.
- Wait!
This is my mom, Vu, I?
m Sue and that's my brother, Tao.
We live next door.
- So?
Tao wants to say something.
I am sorry.
- Sorry for what?
For trying to steal your car.
Let me tell you something boy.
You step on this property again, you are done...
Good afternoon, Walt.
I told you I?
m not going to confession..
- Why didn't you just call the police?
What?
I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I heard there was some trouble in the neighborhood.
Why didn't call the police?
Well ...
You know why, I've prayed that they would show up, but..
.. nobody answered.
- What were you thinking?
Someone could have been killed.
We?
re talking life and death here.
When things go wrong, you gotta act quickly.
When we were in Korea and a thousand screaming gooks came across our land..
... we didn't call the police.
We reacted.
- We are not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski,
I?
ve been thinking about our conversation on life and death.
About what you said.
About how you carry around all the horrible things you were forced to do
Horrible things that won?
t leave you.
It seems that it would do you good to unload some of that burden.
Things done during war are terrible.
being ordered to kill ... killing to save yourself, killing to save others.
You?
re right, those are things I know nothing about.
But I do know about forgiveness.
And I?
ve seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins, admitted their guilt and left their burdens behind them.
Stronger men than you!
Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things... and are now at peace.
Well I got to hand it to you, padre, You came here with your guns loaded this time.
Thank you!
- And you're right about one thing.
About stronger men than me, reaching their salvation.
Well, Hallefuckinlujah.
- But you are wrong about something else.
- What's that, Mr. Kowalski?
The thing that haunts a man the most is what he isn?
t ordered to do.
There, finally, you look like a human being again. .
You shouldn?
t wait so long between haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch.
Well I am surprised you are still around.
I was always hoping that you die off and they get somebody in here they knew what the hell they are doing.
Instead you just keep hanging around, like the dump wop dago you are.
- That?
ll be ten dollars, Walt.
- Ten bucks, Jesus Christ, Martin.
What are you half-Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices all the time.
It?
s been ten bucks for the last five years and you hard-mellows,
Pollack son of a bitch.
Keep the change.
- See you in three weeks, prick.
Not if I see you first, dipshit.
That's cool, you know.
Look at this.
You tight ass over here.
Come here girl.
You can't say hi?
Or are you acting like stuck-up and shit.
What are you supposed to be man?
- Yo, it's cool dog.
The fuck are you doing in my neighborhood, boy?
None, Just going to the corner spot, you know get some CDs, sound good, bro?
He called, you bro!
- Come on sound good, bro?
Sound good.
- Shut the fuck up.
Call me bro again, and I'll bite your motherfucking face off .
Yeah, motherfucker.
- Now what the fuck you come down here for?
You here to bring this little present?
Oriental yummy?
Don't worry, I'll take a real good care with her.
Fuck out of here, .
- Fuck out of here, man!
Oh shit, you have a bitch with you.
Keep your ass right here.
Oh great.
Another asshole who has a fetish for Asian girls.
God, it gets so old.
Oh, shit, what's your name girl?
My name?
Get your ass out of here, okay.
It?
s 'take your crude, overly obvious come-on to every woman who walks past and cram it.'
That?
s my name.
Who do you think you are talking to?
Who does it look like?
Man she's tough.
- What?
You gonna hit me now?
That'd pretty much complete the picture.
You need to keep your bitch on a leash.
Put a choke chain on her and yank that motherfucker.
Oh, of course, right to the stereotype thesaurus
- Oh yeah
Call me a whore and a bitch in the same sentence.
-Bitch is crazy.
I like her like that
- Now take that bitch.
You don't know when to quit do you, girl?
- Let me teach you a lesson
Stop!
Let me go!
Take your ass over there.
What the fuck are you looking at old man?
What the hell are you spooks up to?
Spooks?
You'd better get your ass on honkey, while I still let you.
That's you'd better do.
What the fuck he thinks he is?
Have you noticed how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't fucking with?
That's me.
You are fucking crazy, get out of here, man.
Why don't you get your ass out of here before we kicked your wrinkly white ass.
What's wrong with him man?
The motherfucker's crazy!
-What is this thing?
What the hell?
Get in a truck.
Crazy motherfucker.
- What's wrong with him, man.
Hey pops come on now.
- Shut your fucking face!
You don't fucking listen, do you?
Now get in a truck.
- Go get in a truck girl.
Let her go, old man!
Shut up pussy.
What is this 'bro' shit anyway?
You want to be superb page, or something
These guy don't want to be your bro and I don't blame them.
Now get your old faint paddy ass on down the road.
Take care now.
You too.
Oh, yeah.
Why didn't you do nothing?
Man you fucking!
Shit man.
If he had cannon at your fucking face, you would do nothing.
What's the matter with you, for Christ sake?
Trying to get yourself killed?
I thought you Asian girls were supposed to be smart.
Hanging around in the neighborhood like that is the fast way to get you in the obituaries.
I know, I know.
Take it easy.
And what about that goofball guy you were with.
Is that a date or something?
Yeah, kind of.
His name is Trey.
- You should be hanging out with them.
You should be hanging out with your own people.
The other Hummongs.
- You mean, Hmong?
Hmong, not Hummong
- Whatever.
What the hell is Hmong, I mean Mong anyway?
Wow, you so enlighten you know that?
No, Hmong is not a place, it is a people.
My people come from different parts of Laos, Thailand and China.
Well how you ended up in my neighborhood?
Why didn't you stay there?
It's Vietnam thing.
We thought on your side And when American quit the communists started killing all the Hmong.
So we came over here.
Yeah, well I don't know how you ended up in Midwest.
Snow on the ground six months in the year.
What is it?
Jungle people wanted to be on great frozen tundra?
Hill people.
We are hill people.
Not jungle people.
BOO-ga, ga-Boo, BOO-ga!
Yeah, whatever ...
Blame the Lutherans.
They brought us up here.
Everybody blames the Lutherans.
Well, you'd think the cold will keep all the idiots out.
Thanks for the ride.
You know something kid, you are all right.
But what about that dimwit brother of yours?
He is little slow or something?
Tao is actually really smart.
He just doesn't know what direction to go in.
Poor toad.
- It is really common.
Hmong girls over here fit in better.
The girls go to college and the boys go to jail.
That old hag hates my ass.
Your birthday today, Daisy.
This year you have to make a choice between two life paths.
Second chances come your way.
Extraordinary events culminate in what might seem to be an anticlimax.
You lucky numbers are: 84, 23, 11, 78 and 99.
What a load of shit.
Yea.
What the hell is it with kids nowadays?
All right.
Let me help you with those.
- Oh, thank you.
How about that?
How about that, Daisy?
It's too heavy for a bag.
- No problem.
Good, Karen, give it to him.
-Here you go.
Well, what is it?
-It's a Gopher.
So you can reach stuff.
It makes things a lot of easier.
This is from me.
It's a phone.
Oh, I can see that.
I just thought...well, we thought that it would make things easier.
Thank you, Karen.
There?
s nothing wrong with making things less hard on yourself.
You know Karen?
s right, Dad.
You?
ve worked hard your whole life.
Maybe it's time you start thinking about taking it a easier?
And some other thing, Dad.
You really should get rid of the coffin nails.
We were thinking about the house.
You know, when Mom?
s gone, it?
s got to be a lot to maintain around here.
Let alone clean.
And you are here all alone ...
Yeah, you know, there?
s these great places now, you know, these communities
Where you don?
t have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow.
You know, People who are like you, active and alert, but are alone.
And would benefit from being around folks their own age.
Yeah Dad, look.
You got to check it out.
We brought some brochures.
These places are nothing like that you think they would be.
They are great.
- No, they are beautiful.
They are really nice They really are.
These are top-notch like resorts.
It is like staying in a hotel, practically.
- They're beautiful.
They really are.
- Yeah.
They care of everything.
They clean up.
They're really nice.
Oh, there are wonderful stores, where you can buy new shoes.
They are amazing, they really are.
You have a good time, play some golf maybe.
Meet other people.
Son of a bitch.
Kicked us out on his birthday.
I've told you that was a bad idea.
I know, you were right
- He won?
t let anybody help him.
Well, we tried.
Now can we just drop it?
No one can say we didn?
t try
What the hell with him, we shouldn't have done it.
We should?
ve stayed home with Josh and Ashley.
At least they were smart enough to not come here.
The goddamn kids have more sense than we do.
We miss mom, don't we Daisy?
Hey, Walt.
What are you up to?
We?
re having a barbecue.
You want to come over?
What do you think?
- There's tons of food.
Just keep you hands off my dog.
-No worries.
We only eat cats.
Really?
- No I am kidding, you moron.
Come on you can be my special guest.
-No, I am fine right here.
Yeah ...
Son of a bitch.
- Okay, so, what have you had to eat today?
I had a piece of cake.
And a little beef jerky.
Come on over and get something to eat.
We've got beer too.
Well ...
I might as well drink with strangers better than drinking alone.
It is my birthday.
Really.
Happy birthday Wally
- Don't call me Wally.
You have no Pabts among the beer.
- As they say, "when in Hmong."
What am I doing wrong?
Every time I look at somebody they always look at the ground.
What is she saying?
- She said welcome to our home.
Oh no, she is not.
- Yes, she didn't.
She hates me.
Yeah, she hates you.
Okay.
What?
!
What are all you fish heads looking at anyway?
I think we should go to other room.
Sorry.
All the people in this house are very traditional.
Number 1.
Never touch a Hmong person on the head, not even a child..
Hmong-people believe that the soul resides on the head.
So, don't do that.
- Sounds dumb, but fine.
And a lot of Hmong people consider looking at someone eye to be very rude.
That's why they look away, when you look at them.
- Anything else?
Yeah, some Hmong people tend to smile or grin when they?
re yelled at.
It's a cultural thing.
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity, it's not that they?
re laughing at you, really.
You people are nuts
But the food..
It looks good, smells good too.
-Of course, its Hmong food.
Okay, and I come back in few seconds.
Here you go.
- Thanks.
You mentioned about..
looking at people, he's been staring at me the whole evening.
That's Kor Khue.
He is the Lor's family shaman.
What's that some sort of witch doctor or something.
- Something like that.
Boeki Boo.
- You're funny, Wally.
Kor Khue's interested in you.
He heard what you did.
He would like to read you.
It would be rude not allow him this.
It's a great honor.
Yeah sure.
It's fine by me.
- All right, take a seat.
He says people do not respect you.
They don't even want to look at you.
He says the way you live, your food has no flavor.
You wearied by your life.
You made a mistake.
And you past life is like a mistake what you did.
You are not satisfied with.
He says, you have no happiness in your life.
It's like you are not at peace.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I am fine.
Fine, I am fine.
God, I?
ve got more in common with these gooks than I have with my own spoiled-rotten family.
Jesus Christ ...
Happy Birthday.
Are you ok?
Yeah, I am fine.
You were bleeding.
- No, I bit my tongue.
It's nothing.
Why don't we get down and get some of that good gook food.
I am starving.
Okay.
You ladies are wonderful.
That stuff is really good.
Come on you glutton!
- What's up?
Let's go.
- What for?
To mingle.
- We can mingle right here.
No.
You told me not to leave you alone.
Thank you very much.
I have to go now.
I'll be back.
Don't let me go right of it .
Well, well, look he is over there.
- Yeah, the kid who steal my Gran Torino.
My brother Tao.
- Tried to anyway, yeah, toad.
It was wobby a bit.
But it should fix it.
What's this?
Little rice liquor Here, try it.
All right.
My friends and I were just wondering what you?
re doing here?
That's a good question.
What am I doing here?
My name is Walt.
- Hey, Walt.
I am Wa Xam.
Wa Yum?
- No Wa Xam.
Wa Xam, Ok.
- So what do you do?
I fix things.
Stuff like that.
- Like what?
I've just fixed that dryer over there.
I fixed my wife's friend sink.
I took old aunt Merry to doctor to get a prescription.
Fixed up.
I've even the fixed the door, what had't even broken yet.
You're funny
I've been called a lot of things, but never funny.
Well, I have to take off.
Enjoy yourself.
- Okay, Yum Yum.
Later.
Come on.
Relax, zipper headed.
I am not gonna shoot you.
I'd look down too if I was you.
You know, I knew you were a dipshit the first time I ever saw you.
You?
re worse with women than you are with stealing cars, Toad.
It's Tao.
- What?
It's not toad, it's Tao.
My name is Tao.
You were blowing it with that girl who was there.
Not that I give two shits about a Toad like you.
You don't what you are talking about.
You are wrong egg roll.
I know exactly what I am talking about.
I may not be the most pleasant person to be around.
But I got the best woman who was ever on this planet to marry me.
I had to work at it.
That was the best thing that ever happened to me.
Hangs down.
But you ... you know
You let Click Clack, Ding Dong and Charlie Chan just walk out with what?
s-her-face.
She likes you, you know.
I don't know why.
Who?
Yum yum!
You know that girl in the purple sweater.
She's been looking at you all day, stupid.
Do you mean, Wa Xam?
- Yeah, Yum Yum.Yeah.
Nice girl, very charming girl.
I talked with her.
But you let her just walk right out.
With the three stooges.
And you know why?
Cause you are big, fat pussy.
Well ...
I gotta go.
Good day.
Puss cake.
No, no more.
Okay, put them over there.
No.
No.
No more No more.
No more.
No more, please ...
Is that chicken dumpling thing you brought before?
Alright.
Better than beef jerky all the time.
What's going on?
What's going on?
-Tao is here to make amends.
He is here to work for you.
-No, he isn't.
He's not gonna work for me.
My mom said dishonored the family.
And now he has to work off his dept.
He starts tomorrow morning.
- Oh not tomorrow, not any time.
I don't even want him on my property I thought we went over all that.
It is very important to my mom that you accept.
And that would be an insult if you refuse.
Why is it being put back on me, all of this?
He is the one who tried to steal my car ... all of the sudden I am a bad guy in this thing.
Look my family is very traditional and would be very much upset if you don't let Tao repay.
If you doesn't want to do it, then let's just go.
Shut up!
Yeah, shut up.
All right, tomorrow, tomorrow.
Thank you.
Jesus, Joseph and Mary.
These Hmong broads are like badgers.
Son of a bitch.
I never thought he'd show.
All right, what are you good at?
Like what?
- That's what I am asking.
You gonna work for me, I gotta know what you are good at.
I gotta know what you can do.
- I don't know.
That's kind of half way what I expected you to say.
See that tree right there?
You just go over there and count the birds.
You want me to count the birds?
- Yeah, you can count?
All you slopes are supposed to be good at math, right?
Yeah, I can count.
- Good.
One, two ...
So, what do you have for me to do?
You want me to watch paint dry or maybe count the clouds that pass by?
Don't get flip with me, boy.
I am not the one who is trying to steal, don't you forget that.
Go ahead.
I don?
t care if you insult me and say racist things.
Cause you know what?
I'll take it.
- Of cause you'll take it.
Cause you have no teeth, you have no balls, kid.
Look, I am stuck here.
Why don't you find something useful for me to do.
Unlike you, I am not useless.
And I maintain my own property.
These swamp rats, on the other hand, you just can help it.
How long do I have you for?
Toad, how long?
Till next Friday.
All right.
Go get the ladder out of the garage.
When you got finished with that roof there.
You can take that gutter, and nail it back up.
I am tired looking at it for the last three years.
Yeah, you said it, brother.
Hello.
Grandpa says he want to know if you can have Tao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch?
Wasp nest?
That's terrible.
I think we can handle that after the lunch.
Lord All Mighty, knock it off.
It's my last day.
What else do have for me do?
Take a day-off.
You did enough.
Toad!
Nothing.
Nevermind.
Kowski?
Kowski?
Kowski?
Mr. Kowalski?
Good morning.
I looked over your paperwork and I think we should immediately start a full battery of tests
I feel that this would be the best way to go about checking all the issues that you've had.
Excuse me, what happened to Dr.Felmon, my regular doctor?
Dr. Felmon retired three years ago.
I am his replacement Dr. Chang.
It's grandpa Walt.
- Pick it up.
You talk to him!
Mitch.
I'm doing bills here.
- You talk to him, he is yours father.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Mitch.
It's me your dad.
Yeah, I know.
What's up?
Oh, nothing, nothing much really.
How is everything going?
I am fine, fine.
How about Karen and the kids?
Fine, everybody is great.
Doing fine.
Good.
How about work?
Busy.
Yeah, I suppose...
In fact, um, speaking of busy.
I got a lot on my plate right now, so if it is not something pressing.
No, not it all.
Why don't you call me this weekend?
Sure.
Ok, It was nice talking to you.
Thanks for talk.
Thanks.
This kid doesn't have a chance.
What do you know about faucets?
I know a lot about them, boy.
Tender side.
Jesus.
For the love of Pete.
- What?
It must be a hundred degrees here.
Just, turn on the fan.
This place is wobbling apart.
Where did you get all the stuff?
What are you talking about?
- All the tools and stuff.
Well, may come as surprise to a thief, but I bought this stuff.
Everything in here with my own money.
Yeah, yeah.
This is not what I meant.
I mean this is so much shit packed in here.
Yeah, well.
Every tool in here has a purpose.
Everything has a job to do.
They are all used when necessary.
- Okay, so, what is that?
it is a post hole digger.
- That
Vice-grips.
Wire cutters, you know that's a trowel.
There is shears right there, and that's a saw.
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me kid.
Alright, what's on your mind.
It's just..
I can't afford to buy all this stuff.
Well, I guess, even a bonehead like you, could understand... that a man acquires it over the period of 50 years.
Yeah, but...
All right, look, here.
These three items right here, you can have this.
WD-40, vice grips and some duck tape.
Any man who is worth his salt, can do half of the house chores with just those three things.
Anything else you need you just borrow it, that's all.
Ok, cool.
Fuck me.
- What's with that?
Nothing.
What?
Nothing, huh?
I just saw you've coughed out blood.
That's not good.
You should really see a doctor.
Look..
Those guys over here, the other night ... on my lawn, what a bout them?
- Just a gang.
A bunch of Hmong gang bangers.
I assume that.
What they were doing here?
They were going to take me away.
They were kind of pissed, that I blew my first initiation.
Yeah, well you are, you are a pussy.
You wanna hang out with guys like that.
What was your initiation supposed to be?
My Gran Torino?
Toad, you got a minute?
Here it is.
Here is the deal.
I take the top, cause that's the heaviest.
I'll pull on that.
And you stand right back here, and you push.
And help me push it up each step.
like that.
- Then, let me take the top.
No, no, I've got a top.
No, I'll take the top.
It looks pretty heavy.
Look I am not crippled.
I've got the top.
If you don't let me take the top.
I ain't helping.
I will go back home.
Listen to me, zipper head.
No, you listen, old man!
I am here because you need help.
So it is either top of I am out of here.
All right, you take the top and I'll push.
Don't let it slip off you little girl hands and crush me.
Don't give me any ideas.
That thing weighs a ton.
Runs like a clock.
They don't make them like this anymore.
So what are you going to do with it?
- Sell it I guess.
How much?
- 60 bucks.
I am tired of having this sit around down in the basement there.
Why?
You are looking for a freezer?
Our downstairs one kind of died.
- Okay, 25 bucks and it's yours.
25?
You've just said 60.
I know, it will save me money putting an ad in the paper.
Come on, let haul it over your place.
Kind of ironic, huh?
- What?
Toad washing a car they tried to steal from you.
Yeah, he misses one spot.
He is doing it all over again too.
It is nice of you to kind look after him like this.
He doesn't have any real role models in his life.
Well, I am not a role model.
But you are a good man, Wally.
I wish our father would have been more like you.
Don't go calling me Wally.
No, I am serious.
He was really hard on us.
Really traditional... and really old school.
Well, I am old school.
yeah, but you an American.
What's that supposed to me?
You like him, don't you?
- Are you kidding?
He tried to steal my car.
And you spend time with him, teaching him how to fix things.
Saved him from a fucked cousin of ours...
- Hey, what you language lady.
And you're a good man
- I am not a good man.
Give me another beer, dragon lady.
This one is empty.
You know, Hmong consider gardening to be a woman's work.
Yeah, that probably why I see in the garden over there all the time.
Besides we ain't in Hu-Mong.
- Funny.
You know you should quit.
That's bad for you.
Yeah?
So it is being in a gang, dipshit.
Didn't you hear what I've just said?
I saw you coughed out blood.
You should quit.
What's that emblem supposed to mean anyway?
Your ancient camp scout emblem?
1'st cavalry.
I've had it since 1951.
So what you wanna do with you life kid.
I was thinking maybe sales.
So you wanna be in sales?
What about going to school, maybe.
But school costs money.
Maybe you should get a job.
You can't just sit there and spread mulch in my garden for the rest of your life.
Maybe you can just pay me.
Yeah, very funny.
What kind of job could I ever get?
- Yeah you're right, nobody would ever hire you.
Look I am just kidding zip...
I mean.
You can get a job.
You can get a job everywhere.
Like what?
How about construction?
- Me?
Yeah.
- Construction?
Yeah.
- Do you have Alzheimer?
s or something?
.
No, get a job in the construction.
I know people in the trades.
Of course I have to make a little adjustment and man you up a little bit.
Man me up?
- Yeah.
And I think you ought to date Miss Yum Yum too.
Do you little good.
Get carbon off the vaults.
Now you just gonna learn, how guys talk.
You just listen the way Martin and I banter back and forth.
You okay?
You are ready?
- Sure.
Let's go in.
Perfect.
A pollack and a chink.
How are you doing, Martin, you crazy Italian prick.
Walt, you cheap bastard, I should have known you?
d come in,
I was having such a pleasant day
- What did you do?
Jew some poor blind guy out of his money.
Giving him a wrong change?
- Who's the nip?
He is a pussy kid from next door.
I am just trying to man him up a little bit.
You see kid?
That's how guys talk to one another .
They do?
-Do you have shit in your ears?
Now go out and come back in and talk to him like a man.
Like a real man.
Come on.
Get your ass out of here.
Come on back now.
Sorry about this.
That's ok.
What's up you old Italian prick?
Get out of my shop before I blow your head off you goddamn dick smoker.
Jesus Christ.
Shit.
Take it easy.
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
That's what you said.
That what you said men say.
You don't just come in and insult a man in his own shop.
What happens if you meet some stranger?
If you get the wrong one he's gonna blow you gook head right off.
What should I've said then?
- Why don't you start with Hi or Hello.
Yeah just come in and say: 'Sir, I'd like a haircut if you have a time'
Yeah, be polite but don't kiss ass.
In fact you can talk about the construction job you just came from.
And bitch about your girl friend in your car.
Son of a bitch, I've just got breaks fixed and those sons of the bitches really nailed me.
They screwed right in the ass.
Yeah, don't swear at the guy.
Just talk about people who are not in the room.
You can bitch about your boss making you work overtime when it is bowling night.
Right, my old lady bitches for two goddamn hours about how..
they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store.
and the minute I turn on a fucking game she starts crying we never talk.
See now go out, come back and talk to him.
And it ain't a rocket science for Christ sake.
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car, or a girlfriend.
Jesus, I should have blown his head off when I had a chance.
Maybe so, I want you to turn around and go outside and come back and don't talk about having no job, no car, no girlfriend, no future, no dick.
Ok, just turn around and go.
Excuse me sir, I need a hair cut if you ain't too busy.
You old Italian son of a bitch prick barber.
Boy, does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job.
Fuck me.
All set to go through with this, right?
- Yeah, yeah.
Don't yeah, yeah me.
Just say:
Yes sir and I'll do my best.
Yes, I'll do my best.
- Cause when I vouch for somebody that means I am give them my word.
I don't want you making me look bad.
No I am good.
Totally into this.
Don't lay down either.
Just look em straight in the eye.
And a man can tell a lot by your handshake.
Here, put those in your back pocket.
- Cool.
Don't blow this.
Hey, Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon.
How the hell are you?
I am shitty.
But who's gonna listen?
- Not me, that's for sure.
Help yourself there, Walt.
You dumb pollack.
Ok this is the kid, I was telling you about.
Tao, this is Tim Kennedy, he is super on this job.
What we got here, Walt?
Well he knows construction and he is a smart kid.
He'll do anything you need him for.
You sure?
- Yeah.
You speak English?
- Yes, sir.
Were you born here?
- You bet.
I see that Walt drove you here.
You got a vehicle?
Not at the moment.
Taking a bus for now.
- Bus?
Jesus Christ.
You don't have a car?
My head gasket cracked and the goddamned pricks at the shop wants to bend me over for $2100
Oh please.
I just replaced the tranny in my Tahoe and the sons a bitches fucked me hard, just under $3200.
Goddamned thieves.

- Tao.
T. .., okay.
You owe me one, Walt.
Well I'll buy a fruit cake for Christmas.
Fuck a fruit cake.
How about you just hand over the keys to that Gran Torino.
What the hell does everybody want my car?
- Yeah, I am not surprised.
Yeah, you don't know a half of it.
Alright, come on, zipper head.
Let the Mick stay here and play with himself.
What are we doing?
What do you want to do?
Carry you tools in a rice bag?
Here.
You can use one of these ... and you'll need one of this here.
I can't afford any of this.
I'll cover it.
You can pay me back with your first pay check.
Cool
- Here, we need something like that.
This is what I am looking for here, tool belt.
There you go.
Not to bitch.
But won't I be needing some tools.
Tools I've got but I am not going to lend you my tool belt.
You can pick up tools as you go.
I really appreciate all this.
- Forget it.
No, I really do Thank you.
What's up homeboy, what are you doing?

Checking up on my little cousin.
- Yeah, man.
My little cousin ...
What's this?
Where you come from man?
- I am coming
Home from work I know you guys don't know much about that.
So that's true, you got a job.

He is scared, huh?
Who bought this shit for you?
Your dad?
- What you guys want with me?
Your dad bought this shit for you?

Oh yeah, 'saving face'
Hey, there.
Hey.
I gotta run.
Haven't seen you for a few days.
Where you've been?
Been busy.
Busy, huh?
What the hell happened to you?
- Don't worry about it.
What do you mean don't worry about it.
Look at your goddamn face.
I said don't worry about it.
Okay, it's not your problem.
When?
Grabbed me a couple of days ago right after I go off work.
Cowards.
I did everything I can possibly do.
But they broke some of your tools.
I will replace them.
Don't worry about the tools.
Where is your cousin lives?
No, Walt.
I'll be ok.
I don't want you to do anything.
- Right,.
You could need extra tools, you just let me know.
Well, I could use a roofing hammer.
-Good, go in my garage and get it.
This should be the last stop.
Here is the deal.
You stay away from Tao, understand?
You tell your friends to stay away from Tao.
You want to fight with us than I could sound don't want to see him anymore.
That's it, got it?
I'll take that as yes.
Cause if I have to come back here it is gonna get fucking ugly.
Get off of my way.
How do you want your dog?
I mean steak?
Funny.
I told you we only eat cats.
I've never seen you like this before.
Well I am feeling good.
I god beautiful women, great food.
And Tao.
And even Tao isn't bugging me.
You are having a good time, I see.
-Yeah.
And it never ends.
What happened to your knuckles anyways?
I slipped in a shower.
No big problem.
Look Yum-Yum if he doesn't ask you out I will ask you out.
Wa Xam, don't listen to him.
He is a white devil.
Yeah, I am.
I am a white devil.
I've loved to Walt, but he beat you to it.
Really?
No kidding!
Dinner and a movie, or what?
Yeah, they are taking a bus.
No, you can't take a bus.
You gonna get you something more stylish that that.
Like what?
Take a limo?
How about that?
The Gran Torino?
- Yeah.
You'd let me take the Gran Torino.
- Yeah, I let you take the Gran Torino.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Is everybody all right?
Tao!
It's all right.
Where's grandma?
Where is Sue?
Where is Sue?
- She went to our aunts.
To her aunts?
Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Get on the phone and call her right now.
Sue ...
I knew, this was gonna happen.
What the hell am I doing here?
Maybe some of her friends called her and she changed her plans.
Yeah.
At the war we just all of us lost a lot of friends but you gotta stand for it.
You can care to it.
Mr. Kowalski?
Are you Ok?
Yeah, I am Ok.
Police finally left, no one is talking.
One thing about Hmong, they keep their mouths shut.
Yeah, I've noticed that.
You know, Tao and Sue will never gonna find peace in this world as long as those gangs around.
Until they go away.
You know forever.
What are you saying?
You know what I am saying.
I took Sue to the hospital.
She is scared.
They are all scared..
Yeah
Tao especially.
He?
s sitting out there right now staring at your front door.
You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.
What would you do?
What should Tao do?
I know what I would do if I was you.
Or at least what you think you should do.
- Really
If I was Tao I guess I'd wanted vengeance.
I'd wanted to stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys.
And you?
- What would I do?
I'd come over here and talk to you I guess.
I know you are close with these people, but this pisses me off too.
Mr.Kowalski.
Wanna beer?
- I'd love one.
There some in the chest, right over there behind you.
Damn all this.
It just isn't fair.
- Nothing is fair, father.
So what you gonna do, Mr. Kowalski?
Call me Walt.
All right.
What you gonna do, Walt?
I don't know.
But I'll think of something.
Whatever it is, they won't have a chance.
What are you doing?
Thinking.
Thinking.
Thinking time is over.
Now it's time to knock shit out of these pricks.
I know you don't want to hear this, but now it's the time to stay calm.
Calm?
You want me to be calm?
We stay calm or else mistakes will get made.
We have to step back from this thing.
No, don't let me down Walt.
Not you.
This is gonna end today.
Sit down.
I don't want to sit.
I said sit down.
Now, listen to me.
We gotta plan this and plan it very carefully.
Can't make any mistakes.
You know I am the right man for this job.
I want to go home and stay calm, and come back here at 4 this afternoon.
And this to be done will be done.
I say we go now, Right now.
And what?
Kill that cousin of yours and the rest of those zips.
Mr. Tough Guy is out for blood all of the sudden.
I know nothing about it.
Now go home.
You stay calm come back here at 4.
Ok?
Okay.
I know, I know.
Give me a break, please, it?
s the first time I?
ve ever smoked in the house.
Let a man enjoy himself,would you girl.
All finished. 10 dollars American.
I don?
t suppose your guinea hands are steady enough to do a straight shave?
- Straight shave?
You've never asked about straight shave ever.
I know but I always wondered about it.
That's unless you are too busy.
No, just let me heat up a towel.
Here is 20.
Keep the change.
It is just in case you hit my jugular.
Yes sir, It gonna take about one hour.
We gonna shorten these sleeves little bit.
Gonna fix at the shoulder.
I never had a suited suit before.
Yes sir, look very good.
Yes, sir.
Look very good.
What can I do for you, Mr. Kowalski?
- I am here for a confession.
Lord Jesus, what have you done?
- Nothing you just take it easy now.
What are you up to?
Are you gonna give a confession or not?
How long has it been since your last confession?
Forever.
Bless me father, for I have sinned.
What are your sins, my son?
In 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski at the factory Christmas party.
Dorothy was in the other room with the other wives.
it just happened.
Yes, go on.
Well, I made 900 dollars profit selling a boat and motor.
I didn't pay the taxes it is the same as stealing.
Yes, fine.
Lastly...
I was never very close with my two sons.
I don't know them.
I didn't know how.
That's it?
- That's it.
It's bothered me most of my life.
Say 10 "Hail Maries" and 5 "Our fathers".
God loves and forgives you and absolves you of all your sins.
In the name of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.
Thank you padre.
Are you going to retaliate for what happened to Sue.
I?
m going over to that house today, Mr. Kowalski.
Is that so?
- It is.
And every other day until you see the folly of what you are planning.
Busy day, gotta go.
- Go in peace.
Oh I am at peace.
Jesus Christ.
So which one is mine?
You ever fired a weapon before?
- No
Why don't you put that one down.
I got something more to show you.
What?
In 1952 we were sent to take out a chink machine gun nest.
They trod us up pretty good.
I was the only one who came back out there.
For that they gave me a silver star.
Here it is.
Here I want you to have it.
Why?
Because we all knew the danger that night.
But we went anyway.
That's the way it might be tonight.
There is always a chance you don't come back.
The hell we won?
t.
We?
re will roll in there and tear ass.
Yeah, that's foolish.
That's the exact reaction they are waiting for.
Come on and close this up.
How many?
- How many what?
How many men did you kill in Korea?
13, maybe more.
-What was it like to kill a man.
You don't want to know.
Now close it up.
Walt!
Walt!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Relax, you can't get out of there.
You let me out right now !
Let me out.
You fuck let me out, I'll fucking kill you.
Shut the fuck up!
You want to know what is like to kill a man?
Well, that's goddamn awful.
The only thing worse is get a medal of valor for killing some poor kids..
that wanted just to give up that's all
Yeah, some scared little gook just like you.
I shot them right in a face with that rifle you were holding in there a while ago.
So if the day goes by that I don't think about it.
You don't that on your soul.
I got blood on my hands.
I am soiled.
That's why I am going alone tonight.
Walt you take me with you right now, let me out.
Look, you've come a long way.
I am proud to say that you are my friend.
But you got your whole life ahead of you.
But me, I finished things.
That's what I do and I am going alone.
No, wait.
Walt!
Walt!
I need you to watch my dog.
Yeah I love you too.
Yeah, she is old too.
Her name is Daisy.
Hello.
- It is Walt.
The keys to my house are under the ceramic turtle on the from porch.
Let yourself in.
Your brother is in the basement.
I gotta go.
Sorry father, we have to go.
I am telling if we are not here there will be a bloodshed.
We've been here for hours.
We can't afford to anchor a unit down to one location.
I am bagging you to stay.
Just got a word from my sergeant, we're pulling the plug.
I am staying.
No you aren't.
We have specific orders you came with us, you are leaving with us.
Watch your head.
Sue, over here, over here.
Unlock this right now.
He left without me.
He went to Smokie without me.
Tao!
Any swamp rats in there.
I didn't know your ass would came.
-Shut up, gook.
I have nothing to say to you, shrimp dick, lizard like you.
Yeah, yeah.
You go ahead watch out for your boyfriend.
Cause it was either he or you or something who raped one of their own family.
You own blood, for Christ sake.
Now go ahead and pull those pistols, like miniature cowboys.
Go ahead.
So where's Tao at?
That pussy motherfucker not gonna come.
Don't worry about Tao.
Tao's got not one second for you.
Says who?
You?
What the fuck you gonna do, old man?
What are you gonna do?
You bitch.
-
Kind of jumpy, aren't we?
- Shut the fuck up.
You should the fuck up!
Got a light?
- What the fuck?
No
Me..
I've got a light...
'Hail Mary, full of grace..'
Yes, sergeant.
What happened?
- You need to step back.
He is a friend of mine.
- He said step back.
Hey, did you hear him.
Step back.
What happened?
- Hey, step back.
He is my friend.
Officer Chang!
get those people back.
- Hey, step back now, Ok.
Get the fuck out of here!
Walt Kowalski once said to me that I didn't know anything about life or death.
Because I was an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who held the hands of superstitious old women and promised they eternity.
Walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it.
But he was right.
I knew really nothing about life or death, until I got to know Walt.
And boy did I learn.
And I want to leave my house to the church becouse Dorothy would've liked it now which brings to out last item .
And again please excuse the language.
in Mr. Kowalski's will, I?
m simply reading it as it was written.
And I'd like to leave my 1972 Gran Torino to ... my friend ...
Tao Vang Lor.
Under the condition that you don?
t choptop top the roof like one of those beaners don?
tpaintanyidioticflameson it like some white-trash hillbilly anddon?
tputabiggay spoiler on the rear end like you see on all the other zipper heads?
cars
It just looks like hell
If you If you can refrain from doing any of that, it?
s yours
God, I am sorry for Dorothy, Walt.
She was a real peach.
Thanks for coming, Al.
Spectacles, testicles, wallet and watch.
Look at the Old Man glaring at Ashley.
He can't even tone it down at Mom's funeral?
What do you expect?
Dad's still living in the '50s.
He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly.
Yeah, well your kid's wearing a Timberwolves jersey.
I'm sure Dad appreciates that.
The point I am trying to make is that there's nothing anyone can do that won't disappoint the Old Man.
It's inevitable.
That's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings.
the deal with the boat motor, the broken bird bath,
It's always something.
What are we going to do with him?
Don't you think he'll get in trouble over there all by himself in the old neighborhood?
Why don't you have him move in with you?
Death is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics.
Bitter in the pain.
Sweet in the salvation.
Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased.
... and their families
Sweet to those who know the salvation that awaits.
And some may ask, what is death?
Is it the end?
Or is it the beginning?
And what is life?
What is this thing we call life?
All these questions can frustrate you at times like this.
And that's why you have to turn to the Lord.
- Jesus ...
Because the Lord is the sweetness.
Is that dad?
- No, that's grandpa Walt.
There is a platoon, E-Company, March 2, 1952.
Korea?
- Where's Korea?
Well, people showed up after the service, huh?
Yeah, well, I suppose they heard there'd be a lot of ham.
I'll go down the basement and get some chairs.
Oh, I can do that, Dad..
- No, we need them now not next week.
Cool, I found a medal.
Look at this.
How much longer do we have to stay?
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell and I'm bored.
Ashley, honey.
Why don't you help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?
Me?
- Yes, you.
Grandpa Walt, would you like some help with these four chairs.
No, you probably just painted your nails.
Your dad is driving me crazy.
Why didn't you guys make him a hint we're leaving soon?
Come on, let's go.
Jesus Christ, how many swamp rats can get in one room?
Grandpa, when'd you get the vintage car?
1972.
I never knew you had a cool old car.
Yeah, it's been here since before you were born.
So, what are you going do with it when you like... die?
Then what about that super cool retro couch that you have in the den
Cause I was thinking I'm going to State next year, and I think it would look really good in my dorm room.
And I don't have any furniture at all.
God.
Who are you?
- Hi, I am Tao.
- What do you want?
I live next door.
- Come on, get the shit out of your mouth.
I am ...
- Tell me what you want.
Do you have jumper cables?
My uncle's car is old and.....
- No we don't any jumper cables .
And have some respect, zipper head, we're mourning here..
How you holding up, Walt?
Mr. Kowalski.
Huh?
- Mr. Kowalski, that's my name.
Right, Mr. Kowalski.
Your wife and I became quite close these last few months.
She asked that I watch over you when she passed on.
I told her I watch out for my entire flock.
But she made me promise I'd keep an extra sharp eye on you.
I appreciate your kindness you've shown to my wife.
Now that you've spoken your piece, why don't go and attend some of your other sheep?
Ok?
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her desire for you to go to confession.
She said she couldn't remember the last time you went.
Is that so?
- It is.
Well, I confess that I never really cared for church very much.
The only reason I went was because of her.
And I confess that I have no desire to confess to a boy that is just out of the seminary.
Wish I could help dad, but gotta get kids home.
Kids getting restless.
- Yeah, fine, just go.
I'll call in a few, see how you're doing.
- Alright.
Kill you to buy American.
Huh ...
Did you see the way he looked at the truck?
Jesus.
It's always Rice-Burner this or Jap-Burner that.
You know.
Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go.
At least he didn't say anything this time.
-He didn't need to.
Well, what do you expect, Mitch?
The man worked at a Ford plant for a lot of years.
I suppose that's my goddamned fault?
Just give it a rest.
Drive.
Ok?
Kids, do you want the radio on?
Yes.
You want to listen to some music?
Good.
Damn, barbarians
Oh, Jesus ...
Polarski would roll over in his grave if he could see his lawn now.
What the hell the chinks had to move in this neighborhood for?
Have you gone completely deaf or something?
Hi there, Walt.
I kind of not a friend of yours.
Why do you insist on calling me Walt?
Sorry , Mr.Kowalski.
What are you peddling today, padre?
- Nothing.
Thought I'd drop by and see how you are doing.
I haven't seen you in church in a while
Okay.
Well now when you tipped on your good deed, now why don't you just take off down the road?
I'd really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.
- Not in this lifetime, sonny.
Why?
Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
- You don't want to know.
No, I do.
Well I think you're an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold the hands of old ladies who are superstitious and promises them eternity.
Is you a boy or is you a girl, I can't tell
Hey, Chicito.
If you was in pink, I would fuck you and your ass would be my bitch.
What you reading, jackass and The rice stalk?
That's right, you keep walking.
Look at me when I am talking to you.
-Fucking slopes everywhere you look, man.
Fucking pigs
Look at that, man.
That's my little cousin, over there.
- You sure that's your cousin, man?
Fuck yes, that's my little cousin.
- He tight with anybody?
No he is flying solo, man.
- Flying solo?
Let's go down and see what the fucking they're doing to him.
I love your jungles too.
Hey, they fucking with you?
They fucking with you?

Let's get the fuck out of here.
Let's get this strapped.
Pussy!
Hey, Tao.
Hey what's up?
What's up, Tao?
What are you doing little man?
Why are you doing woman's work?
What do you want?
What?
We can't just come and talk to my little cousin?
He doesn't want to talk to you.
I am here right.
- Hey, Spider, who is that?
What's up?
- Spider?
Is that what he just called you, Fong?
Spider?
- Is there something wrong with Spider?
What are you doing here?
Hey, so how old are you anyways?
Mentally, I am way too old for you.
- What?
You are just stupid.
I am going inside.
Sue!
How your little brother, do this gardening.
Fine, stupid.
Hey, you will roll with us man, come on?
Come on ride with us.
- Chill with us.
You need somebody to protect you, man.
That's what your big cousins are for.
Look, dawg.
I've been there, I've done it and I've seen it.
Back in a day everybody wanted to beat me, dawg.
But now look, nobody wants to fuck with me.
Come on man, let's go.
- We are cousins right?
Come on.
- We are cousins right?
We are a family.
Look, I am brother to Spider, as he is brother to me.
Come on.
Take this shit off.
That's a woman's work man.
- Come get your hands dirty, man.
So what do I have to do?
Spider told that old boy next door had a bad ass whip.
Told you we got him.
Come on.
Nice.
- Ya, my little cousin being little man.
Yo, that's a nice car.
1972 Gran Torino, Fastback.
Cobra jet engine.
- Yo man it can still in mint condition.
Yo man, it's in mint condition man.
I've got one.
A Mexican, a Jew and a colored guy go into the bar.
The bartender looks up and says:
"Get the fuck out of here!"
So, here's where my flock congregates when they're not in church..
Hey Father J.
- Hey, Mel.
Hey, Darrel.
Hey father.
- Hi, Walt.
What brings you in here, father.
Meat raffle?
No, I just came down to talk Walt if that's ok.
Damn, padre.
You are persistent, aren't you?
I promised your wife.
All right, let's get booze.
I'll have Pabst and a shot of Jack.
And whatever he's having.
I'll have a Diet Coke.
- Bullshit.
This is a bar.
You have a drink.
I'll have a gin and tonic.
- Attaboy!
So, what you want?
I promised your wife I'd get you to go to confession.
Now, why would you do that?
- She was very insistent.
She made me.
Well you're kinda found of promising things you can't deliver on, right, father?
Let's talk about something else.
- What?
Life and death.
Life and death.
What the hell do you know about life and death?
I'd like to think I know a lot.
I'm a priest..
Yeah, you get up and preach about life and death.
But all what you know is what you learned in a priest school.
Right out of the rookie Preacher's Handbook
I don't know about that.
I think...
That is bittersweet.
Sort of bitter in its pain.
But sweet in its salvation.
That's what you know of life and death, and that's pathetic.
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?
I know a lot.
I lived there almost three years in Korea.
Thanks.
We shot men.
We stabbed them with bayonets, hacked seventeen-year-olds to death with shovels
Stuff I'll remember till the day I die.
Horrible things, but things I live with.
And what about life?
Well, I ...
I survived the war.
got married... and had a family.
Sounds like you know more about death than you do living.
Maybe so, father.
Maybe so.
Son of a bitch.
Hey, man, get in a car!
- Tao, what the fuck, get in!
Come on Tao.
- Come, let's go,man, get in!
Fuck man, get in!
Hello?
Morning, Dad, it's your number one son, Mitch.
Morning?
It's after one in the afternoon.
It's not morning.
Oh, right.
Afternoon, then.
So what do you want?
- What?
Me?
Nothing.
I mean, what would I want?
Well, I don't know.
Your wife has already gone through all of your mother's jewelry.
No, dad.
I was just calling to see how are you doing?
Well, anything new with the old neighborhood?
No.
- Great.
Smooth sailing then.
Yah.
- Ok, good, good, then.
Oh, hey, dead.
- Yeah.
You wouldn't happen to still know that guy from the plant who has Lion season tickets?
Dad?
Ain't she sweet?
Come on.
Hey, what's up?
What are you doing here, man?
- Nothing.
Minding our own business.
- Just hanging out.
What are you guys doing here?
What?
Can I just come here to hang with my little cousin?
We have good new for you.
- Really, and what's that?
Only for guy talk.
- I don't think so.
Why not?
- Come on, man, we are going to give you another shot.
Don't go, Tao.
- Mind your own business girl.
Come on, let's go
- Come.
What the hell is this?
Get up.
- Gåt off my lawn.
Listen old man, you don't want to fuck with me.
Did you hear me?
I said get off my lawn, now.
Are you fucking crazy?
Go back in a house.
Yeah, I'll blow the hole in your face and then I'll go in a house.
And I'll sleep like a baby You can count on that.
We used to stack fucks like you five feet high in Korea, used you for sandbags.
Ok.
You better watch your back...
Thank you.
Get off my lawn.
What the hell is this?
No, no, no, no more.
Stay right there.
Why can't you people just leave me alone?
We brought you some shallots to plant in the garden.
I don't want them.
They're perennials, they come back every year.
Look, why are bringing me all this garbage anyway.
Because
Because you saved, Tao.
I didn't save anybody.
I just.
I kept a bunch of jabbering gooks off of my lawn .
You are a hero to the neighborhood.
I am not a hero.
Too bad, they think you are and that's why they're keep bringing you the gifts.
Please take them.
- All they are wrong.
I just want to be left alone, thank you.
- Wait!
This is my mom, Vu, I'm Sue and that's my brother, Tao.
We live next door.
- So?
Tao wants to say something.
I am sorry.
- Sorry for what?
For trying to steal your car.
Let me tell you something boy.
You step on this property again, you are done...
Good afternoon, Walt.
I told you I'm not going to confession..
- Why didn't you just call the police?
What?
I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I heard there was some trouble in the neighborhood.
Why didn't call the police?
Well ...
You know why, I've prayed that they would show up, but..
.. nobody answered.
- What were you thinking?
Someone could have been killed.
We're talking life and death here.
When things go wrong, you gotta act quickly.
When we were in Korea and a thousand screaming gooks came across our land..
... we didn't call the police.
We reacted.
- We are not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski,
I've been thinking about our conversation on life and death.
About what you said.
About how you carry around all the horrible things you were forced to do
Horrible things that won't leave you.
It seems that it would do you good to unload some of that burden.
Things done during war are terrible.
being ordered to kill ... killing to save yourself, killing to save others.
You're right, those are things I know nothing about.
But I do know about forgiveness.
And I've seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins, admitted their guilt and left their burdens behind them.
Stronger men than you!
Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things... and are now at peace.
Well I got to hand it to you, padre, You came here with your guns loaded this time.
Thank you!
- And you're right about one thing.
About stronger men than me, reaching their salvation.
Well, Hallefuckinlujah.
- But you are wrong about something else.
- What's that, Mr. Kowalski?
The thing that haunts a man the most is what he isn't ordered to do.
There, finally, you look like a human being again. .
You shouldn't wait so long between haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch.
Well I am surprised you are still around.
I was always hoping that you die off and they get somebody in here they knew what the hell they are doing.
Instead you just keep hanging around, like the dump wop dago you are.
- That'll be ten dollars, Walt.
- Ten bucks, Jesus Christ, Martin.
What are you half-Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices all the time.
It's been ten bucks for the last five years and you hard-mellows, Pollack son of a bitch.
Keep the change.
- See you in three weeks, prick.
Not if I see you first, dipshit.
That's cool, you know.
Look at this.
You tight ass over here.
Come here girl.
You can't say hi?
Or are you acting like stuck-up and shit.
What are you supposed to be man?
- Yo, it's cool dog.
The fuck are you doing in my neighborhood, boy?
None, Just going to the corner spot, you know get some CDs, sound good, bro?
He called, you bro!
- Come on sound good, bro?
Sound good.
- Shut the fuck up.
Call me bro again, and I'll bite your motherfucking face off .
Yeah, motherfucker.
- Now what the fuck you come down here for?
You here to bring this little present?
Oriental yummy?
Don't worry, I'll take a real good care with her.
Fuck out of here, .
- Fuck out of here, man!
Oh shit, you have a bitch with you.
Keep your ass right here.
Oh great.
Another asshole who has a fetish for Asian girls.
God, it gets so old.
Oh, shit, what's your name girl?
My name?
Get your ass out of here, okay.
It's 'take your crude, overly obvious come-on to every woman who walks past and cram it.'
That's my name.
Who do you think you are talking to?
Who does it look like?
Man she's tough.
- What?
You gonna hit me now?
That'd pretty much complete the picture.
You need to keep your bitch on a leash.
Put a choke chain on her and yank that motherfucker.
Oh, of course, right to the stereotype thesaurus
- Oh yeah
Call me a whore and a bitch in the same sentence.
-Bitch is crazy.
I like her like that
- Now take that bitch.
You don't know when to quit do you, girl?
- Let me teach you a lesson
Stop!
Let me go!
Take your ass over there.
What the fuck are you looking at old man?
What the hell are you spooks up to?
Spooks?
You'd better get your ass on honkey, while I still let you.
That's you'd better do.
What the fuck he thinks he is?
Have you noticed how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't fucking with?
That's me.
You are fucking crazy, get out of here, man.
Why don't you get your ass out of here before we kicked your wrinkly white ass.
What's wrong with him man?
The motherfucker's crazy!
-What is this thing?
What the hell?
Get in a truck.
Crazy motherfucker.
- What's wrong with him, man.
Hey pops come on now.
- Shut your fucking face!
You don't fucking listen, do you?
Now get in a truck.
- Go get in a truck girl.
Let her go, old man!
Shut up pussy.
What is this 'bro' shit anyway?
You want to be superb page, or something
These guy don't want to be your bro and I don't blame them.
Now get your old faint paddy ass on down the road.
Take care now.
You too.
Oh, yeah.
Why didn't you do nothing?
Man you fucking!
Shit man.
If he had cannon at your fucking face, you would do nothing.
What's the matter with you, for Christ sake?
Trying to get yourself killed?
I thought you Asian girls were supposed to be smart.
Hanging around in the neighborhood like that is the fast way to get you in the obituaries.
I know, I know.
Take it easy.
And what about that goofball guy you were with.
Is that a date or something?
Yeah, kind of.
His name is Trey.
- You should be hanging out with them.
You should be hanging out with your own people.
The other Hummongs.
- You mean, Hmong?
Hmong, not Hummong
- Whatever.
What the hell is Hmong, I mean Mong anyway?
Wow, you so enlighten you know that?
No, Hmong is not a place, it is a people.
My people come from different parts of Laos, Thailand and China.
Well how you ended up in my neighborhood?
Why didn't you stay there?
It's Vietnam thing.
We thought on your side And when American quit the communists started killing all the Hmong.
So we came over here.
Yeah, well I don't know how you ended up in Midwest.
Snow on the ground six months in the year.
What is it?
Jungle people wanted to be on great frozen tundra?
Hill people.
We are hill people.
Not jungle people.
BOO-ga, ga-Boo, BOO-ga!
Yeah, whatever ...
Blame the Lutherans.
They brought us up here.
Everybody blames the Lutherans.
Well, you'd think the cold will keep all the idiots out.
Thanks for the ride.
You know something kid, you are all right.
But what about that dimwit brother of yours?
He is little slow or something?
Tao is actually really smart.
He just doesn't know what direction to go in.
Poor toad.
- It is really common.
Hmong girls over here fit in better.
The girls go to college and the boys go to jail.
That old hag hates my ass.
Your birthday today, Daisy.
This year you have to make a choice between two life paths.
Second chances come your way.
Extraordinary events culminate in what might seem to be an anticlimax.
You lucky numbers are: 84, 23, 11, 78 and 99.
What a load of shit.
Yea.
What the hell is it with kids nowadays?
All right.
Let me help you with those.
- Oh, thank you.
How about that?
How about that, Daisy?
It's too heavy for a bag.
- No problem.
Good, Karen, give it to him.
-Here you go.
Well, what is it?
-It's a Gopher.
So you can reach stuff.
It makes things a lot of easier.
This is from me.
It's a phone.
Oh, I can see that.
I just thought...well, we thought that it would make things easier.
Thank you, Karen.
There's nothing wrong with making things less hard on yourself.
You know Karen's right, Dad.
You've worked hard your whole life.
Maybe it's time you start thinking about taking it a easier?
And some other thing, Dad.
You really should get rid of the coffin nails.
We were thinking about the house.
You know, when Mom's gone, it's got to be a lot to maintain around here.
Let alone clean.
And you are here all alone ...
Yeah, you know, there's these great places now, you know, these communities
Where you don't have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow.
You know, People who are like you, active and alert, but are alone.
And would benefit from being around folks their own age.
Yeah Dad, look.
You got to check it out.
We brought some brochures.
These places are nothing like that you think they would be.
They are great.
- No, they are beautiful.
They are really nice They really are.
These are top-notch like resorts.
It is like staying in a hotel, practically.
- They're beautiful.
They really are.
- Yeah.
They care of everything.
They clean up.
They're really nice.
Oh, there are wonderful stores, where you can buy new shoes.
They are amazing, they really are.
You have a good time, play some golf maybe.
Meet other people.
Son of a bitch.
Kicked us out on his birthday.
I've told you that was a bad idea.
I know, you were right
- He won't let anybody help him.
Well, we tried.
Now can we just drop it?
No one can say we didn't try
What the hell with him, we shouldn't have done it.
We should've stayed home with Josh and Ashley.
At least they were smart enough to not come here.
The goddamn kids have more sense than we do.
We miss mom, don't we Daisy?
Hey, Walt.
What are you up to?
We're having a barbecue.
You want to come over?
What do you think?
- There's tons of food.
Just keep you hands off my dog.
-No worries.
We only eat cats.
Really?
- No I am kidding, you moron.
Come on you can be my special guest.
-No, I am fine right here.
Yeah ...
Son of a bitch.
- Okay, so, what have you had to eat today?
I had a piece of cake.
And a little beef jerky.
Come on over and get something to eat.
We've got beer too.
Well ...
I might as well drink with strangers better than drinking alone.
It is my birthday.
Really.
Happy birthday Wally
- Don't call me Wally.
You have no Pabts among the beer.
- As they say, "when in Hmong."
What am I doing wrong?
Every time I look at somebody they always look at the ground.
What is she saying?
- She said welcome to our home.
Oh no, she is not.
- Yes, she didn't.
She hates me.
Yeah, she hates you.
Okay.
What?
!
What are all you fish heads looking at anyway?
I think we should go to other room.
Sorry.
All the people in this house are very traditional.
Number 1.
Never touch a Hmong person on the head, not even a child..
Hmong-people believe that the soul resides on the head.
So, don't do that.
- Sounds dumb, but fine.
And a lot of Hmong people consider looking at someone eye to be very rude.
That's why they look away, when you look at them.
- Anything else?
Yeah, some Hmong people tend to smile or grin when they're yelled at.
It's a cultural thing.
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity, it's not that they're laughing at you, really.
You people are nuts
But the food..
It looks good, smells good too.
-Of course, its Hmong food.
Okay, and I come back in few seconds.
Here you go.
- Thanks.
You mentioned about..
looking at people, he's been staring at me the whole evening.
That's Kor Khue.
He is the Lor's family shaman.
What's that some sort of witch doctor or something.
- Something like that.
Boeki Boo.
- You're funny, Wally.
Kor Khue's interested in you.
He heard what you did.
He would like to read you.
It would be rude not allow him this.
It's a great honor.
Yeah sure.
It's fine by me.
- All right, take a seat.
He says people do not respect you.
They don't even want to look at you.
He says the way you live, your food has no flavor.
You wearied by your life.
You made a mistake.
And you past life is like a mistake what you did.
You are not satisfied with.
He says, you have no happiness in your life.
It's like you are not at peace.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I am fine.
Fine, I am fine.
God, I've got more in common with these gooks than I have with my own spoiled-rotten family.
Jesus Christ ...
Happy Birthday.
Are you ok?
Yeah, I am fine.
You were bleeding.
- No, I bit my tongue.
It's nothing.
Why don't we get down and get some of that good gook food.
I am starving.
Okay.
You ladies are wonderful.
That stuff is really good.
Come on you glutton!
- What's up?
Let's go.
- What for?
To mingle.
- We can mingle right here.
No.
You told me not to leave you alone.
Thank you very much.
I have to go now.
I'll be back.
Don't let me go right of it .
Well, well, look he is over there.
- Yeah, the kid who steal my Gran Torino.
My brother Tao.
- Tried to anyway, yeah, toad.
It was wobby a bit.
But it should fix it.
What's this?
Little rice liquor Here, try it.
All right.
My friends and I were just wondering what you're doing here?
That's a good question.
What am I doing here?
My name is Walt.
- Hey, Walt.
I am Wa Xam.
Wa Yum?
- No Wa Xam.
Wa Xam, Ok.
- So what do you do?
I fix things.
Stuff like that.
- Like what?
I've just fixed that dryer over there.
I fixed my wife's friend sink.
I took old aunt Merry to doctor to get a prescription.
Fixed up.
I've even the fixed the door, what had't even broken yet.
You're funny
I've been called a lot of things, but never funny.
Well, I have to take off.
Enjoy yourself.
- Okay, Yum Yum.
Later.
Come on.
Relax, zipper headed.
I am not gonna shoot you.
I'd look down too if I was you.
You know, I knew you were a dipshit the first time I ever saw you.
You're worse with women than you are with stealing cars, Toad.
It's Tao.
- What?
It's not toad, it's Tao.
My name is Tao.
You were blowing it with that girl who was there.
Not that I give two shits about a Toad like you.
You don't what you are talking about.
You are wrong egg roll.
I know exactly what I am talking about.
I may not be the most pleasant person to be around.
But I got the best woman who was ever on this planet to marry me.
I had to work at it.
That was the best thing that ever happened to me.
Hangs down.
But you ... you know
You let Click Clack, Ding Dong and Charlie Chan just walk out with what's-her-face.
She likes you, you know.
I don't know why.
Who?
Yum yum!
You know that girl in the purple sweater.
She's been looking at you all day, stupid.
Do you mean, Wa Xam?
- Yeah, Yum Yum.Yeah.
Nice girl, very charming girl.
I talked with her.
But you let her just walk right out.
With the three stooges.
And you know why?
Cause you are big, fat pussy.
Well ...
I gotta go.
Good day.
Puss cake.
No, no more.
Okay, put them over there.
No.
No.
No more No more.
No more.
No more, please ...
Is that chicken dumpling thing you brought before?
Alright.
Better than beef jerky all the time.
What's going on?
What's going on?
-Tao is here to make amends.
He is here to work for you.
-No, he isn't.
He's not gonna work for me.
My mom said dishonored the family.
And now he has to work off his dept.
He starts tomorrow morning.
- Oh not tomorrow, not any time.
I don't even want him on my property I thought we went over all that.
It is very important to my mom that you accept.
And that would be an insult if you refuse.
Why is it being put back on me, all of this?
He is the one who tried to steal my car ... all of the sudden I am a bad guy in this thing.
Look my family is very traditional and would be very much upset if you don't let Tao repay.
If you doesn't want to do it, then let's just go.
Shut up!
Yeah, shut up.
All right, tomorrow, tomorrow.
Thank you.
Jesus, Joseph and Mary.
These Hmong broads are like badgers.
Son of a bitch.
I never thought he'd show.
All right, what are you good at?
Like what?
- That's what I am asking.
You gonna work for me, I gotta know what you are good at.
I gotta know what you can do.
- I don't know.
That's kind of half way what I expected you to say.
See that tree right there?
You just go over there and count the birds.
You want me to count the birds?
- Yeah, you can count?
All you slopes are supposed to be good at math, right?
Yeah, I can count.
- Good.
One, two ...
So, what do you have for me to do?
You want me to watch paint dry or maybe count the clouds that pass by?
Don't get flip with me, boy.
I am not the one who is trying to steal, don't you forget that.
Go ahead.
I don't care if you insult me and say racist things.
Cause you know what?
I'll take it.
- Of cause you'll take it.
Cause you have no teeth, you have no balls, kid.
Look, I am stuck here.
Why don't you find something useful for me to do.
Unlike you, I am not useless.
And I maintain my own property.
These swamp rats, on the other hand, you just can help it.
How long do I have you for?
Toad, how long?
Till next Friday.
All right.
Go get the ladder out of the garage.
When you got finished with that roof there.
You can take that gutter, and nail it back up.
I am tired looking at it for the last three years.
Yeah, you said it, brother.
Hello.
Grandpa says he want to know if you can have Tao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch?
Wasp nest?
That's terrible.
I think we can handle that after the lunch.
Lord All Mighty, knock it off.
It's my last day.
What else do have for me do?
Take a day-off.
You did enough.
Toad!
Nothing.
Nevermind.
Kowski?
Kowski?
Kowski?
Mr. Kowalski?
Good morning.
I looked over your paperwork and I think we should immediately start a full battery of tests
I feel that this would be the best way to go about checking all the issues that you've had.
Excuse me, what happened to Dr.Felmon, my regular doctor?
Dr. Felmon retired three years ago.
I am his replacement Dr. Chang.
It's grandpa Walt.
- Pick it up.
You talk to him!
Mitch.
I'm doing bills here.
- You talk to him, he is yours father.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Mitch.
It's me your dad.
Yeah, I know.
What's up?
Oh, nothing, nothing much really.
How is everything going?
I am fine, fine.
How about Karen and the kids?
Fine, everybody is great.
Doing fine.
Good.
How about work?
Busy.
Yeah, I suppose...
In fact, um, speaking of busy.
I got a lot on my plate right now, so if it is not something pressing.
No, not it all.
Why don't you call me this weekend?
Sure.
Ok, It was nice talking to you.
Thanks for talk.
Thanks.
This kid doesn't have a chance.
What do you know about faucets?
I know a lot about them, boy.
Tender side.
Jesus.
For the love of Pete.
- What?
It must be a hundred degrees here.
Just, turn on the fan.
This place is wobbling apart.
Where did you get all the stuff?
What are you talking about?
- All the tools and stuff.
Well, may come as surprise to a thief, but I bought this stuff.
Everything in here with my own money.
Yeah, yeah.
This is not what I meant.
I mean this is so much shit packed in here.
Yeah, well.
Every tool in here has a purpose.
Everything has a job to do.
They are all used when necessary.
- Okay, so, what is that?
it is a post hole digger.
- That
Vice-grips.
Wire cutters, you know that's a trowel.
There is shears right there, and that's a saw.
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me kid.
Alright, what's on your mind.
It's just..
I can't afford to buy all this stuff.
Well, I guess, even a bonehead like you, could understand... that a man acquires it over the period of 50 years.
Yeah, but...
All right, look, here.
These three items right here, you can have this.
WD-40, vice grips and some duck tape.
Any man who is worth his salt, can do half of the house chores with just those three things.
Anything else you need you just borrow it, that's all.
Ok, cool.
Fuck me.
- What's with that?
Nothing.
What?
Nothing, huh?
I just saw you've coughed out blood.
That's not good.
You should really see a doctor.
Look..
Those guys over here, the other night ... on my lawn, what a bout them?
- Just a gang.
A bunch of Hmong gang bangers.
I assume that.
What they were doing here?
They were going to take me away.
They were kind of pissed, that I blew my first initiation.
Yeah, well you are, you are a pussy.
You wanna hang out with guys like that.
What was your initiation supposed to be?
My Gran Torino?
Toad, you got a minute?
Here it is.
Here is the deal.
I take the top, cause that's the heaviest.
I'll pull on that.
And you stand right back here, and you push.
And help me push it up each step.
like that.
- Then, let me take the top.
No, no, I've got a top.
No, I'll take the top.
It looks pretty heavy.
Look I am not crippled.
I've got the top.
If you don't let me take the top.
I ain't helping.
I will go back home.
Listen to me, zipper head.
No, you listen, old man!
I am here because you need help.
So it is either top of I am out of here.
All right, you take the top and I'll push.
Don't let it slip off you little girl hands and crush me.
Don't give me any ideas.
That thing weighs a ton.
Runs like a clock.
They don't make them like this anymore.
So what are you going to do with it?
- Sell it I guess.
How much?
- 60 bucks.
I am tired of having this sit around down in the basement there.
Why?
You are looking for a freezer?
Our downstairs one kind of died.
- Okay, 25 bucks and it's yours.
25?
You've just said 60.
I know, it will save me money putting an ad in the paper.
Come on, let haul it over your place.
Kind of ironic, huh?
- What?
Toad washing a car they tried to steal from you.
Yeah, he misses one spot.
He is doing it all over again too.
It is nice of you to kind look after him like this.
He doesn't have any real role models in his life.
Well, I am not a role model.
But you are a good man, Wally.
I wish our father would have been more like you.
Don't go calling me Wally.
No, I am serious.
He was really hard on us.
Really traditional... and really old school.
Well, I am old school.
yeah, but you an American.
What's that supposed to me?
You like him, don't you?
- Are you kidding?
He tried to steal my car.
And you spend time with him, teaching him how to fix things.
Saved him from a fucked cousin of ours...
- Hey, what you language lady.
And you're a good man
- I am not a good man.
Give me another beer, dragon lady.
This one is empty.
You know, Hmong consider gardening to be a woman's work.
Yeah, that probably why I see in the garden over there all the time.
Besides we ain't in Hu-Mong.
- Funny.
You know you should quit.
That's bad for you.
Yeah?
So it is being in a gang, dipshit.
Didn't you hear what I've just said?
I saw you coughed out blood.
You should quit.
What's that emblem supposed to mean anyway?
Your ancient camp scout emblem?
1'st cavalry.
I've had it since 1951.
So what you wanna do with you life kid.
I was thinking maybe sales.
So you wanna be in sales?
What about going to school, maybe.
But school costs money.
Maybe you should get a job.
You can't just sit there and spread mulch in my garden for the rest of your life.
Maybe you can just pay me.
Yeah, very funny.
What kind of job could I ever get?
- Yeah you're right, nobody would ever hire you.
Look I am just kidding zip...
I mean.
You can get a job.
You can get a job everywhere.
Like what?
How about construction?
- Me?
Yeah.
- Construction?
Yeah.
- Do you have Alzheimer's or something?
.
No, get a job in the construction.
I know people in the trades.
Of course I have to make a little adjustment and man you up a little bit.
Man me up?
- Yeah.
And I think you ought to date Miss Yum Yum too.
Do you little good.
Get carbon off the vaults.
Now you just gonna learn, how guys talk.
You just listen the way Martin and I banter back and forth.
You okay?
You are ready?
- Sure.
Let's go in.
Perfect.
A pollack and a chink.
How are you doing, Martin, you crazy Italian prick.
Walt, you cheap bastard, I should have known you'd come in,
I was having such a pleasant day
- What did you do?
Jew some poor blind guy out of his money.
Giving him a wrong change?
- Who's the nip?
He is a pussy kid from next door.
I am just trying to man him up a little bit.
You see kid?
That's how guys talk to one another .
They do?
-Do you have shit in your ears?
Now go out and come back in and talk to him like a man.
Like a real man.
Come on.
Get your ass out of here.
Come on back now.
Sorry about this.
That's ok.
What's up you old Italian prick?
Get out of my shop before I blow your head off you goddamn dick smoker.
Jesus Christ.
Shit.
Take it easy.
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
That's what you said.
That what you said men say.
You don't just come in and insult a man in his own shop.
What happens if you meet some stranger?
If you get the wrong one he's gonna blow you gook head right off.
What should I've said then?
- Why don't you start with Hi or Hello.
Yeah just come in and say: 'Sir, I'd like a haircut if you have a time'
Yeah, be polite but don't kiss ass.
In fact you can talk about the construction job you just came from.
And bitch about your girl friend in your car.
Son of a bitch, I've just got breaks fixed and those sons of the bitches really nailed me.
They screwed right in the ass.
Yeah, don't swear at the guy.
Just talk about people who are not in the room.
You can bitch about your boss making you work overtime when it is bowling night.
Right, my old lady bitches for two goddamn hours about how..
they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store.
and the minute I turn on a fucking game she starts crying we never talk.
See now go out, come back and talk to him.
And it ain't a rocket science for Christ sake.
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car, or a girlfriend.
Jesus, I should have blown his head off when I had a chance.
Maybe so, I want you to turn around and go outside and come back and don't talk about having no job, no car, no girlfriend, no future, no dick.
Ok, just turn around and go.
Excuse me sir, I need a hair cut if you ain't too busy.
You old Italian son of a bitch prick barber.
Boy, does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job.
Fuck me.
All set to go through with this, right?
- Yeah, yeah.
Don't yeah, yeah me.
Just say:
Yes sir and I'll do my best.
Yes, I'll do my best.
- Cause when I vouch for somebody that means I am give them my word.
I don't want you making me look bad.
No I am good.
Totally into this.
Don't lay down either.
Just look em straight in the eye.
And a man can tell a lot by your handshake.
Here, put those in your back pocket.
- Cool.
Don't blow this.
Hey, Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon.
How the hell are you?
I am shitty.
But who's gonna listen?
- Not me, that's for sure.
Help yourself there, Walt.
You dumb pollack.
Ok this is the kid, I was telling you about.
Tao, this is Tim Kennedy, he is super on this job.
What we got here, Walt?
Well he knows construction and he is a smart kid.
He'll do anything you need him for.
You sure?
- Yeah.
You speak English?
- Yes, sir.
Were you born here?
- You bet.
I see that Walt drove you here.
You got a vehicle?
Not at the moment.
Taking a bus for now.
- Bus?
Jesus Christ.
You don't have a car?
My head gasket cracked and the goddamned pricks at the shop wants to bend me over for $2100
Oh please.
I just replaced the tranny in my Tahoe and the sons a bitches fucked me hard, just under $3200.
Goddamned thieves.
It ain't right.
- You got that right.
Come on in on Monday and we'll find something for you to do.
Thanks, Mr. Kennedy.
That's Tim, and what's you name again?
- Tao.
T. .., okay.
You owe me one, Walt.
Well I'll buy a fruit cake for Christmas.
Fuck a fruit cake.
How about you just hand over the keys to that Gran Torino.
What the hell does everybody want my car?
- Yeah, I am not surprised.
Yeah, you don't know a half of it.
Alright, come on, zipper head.
Let the Mick stay here and play with himself.
What are we doing?
What do you want to do?
Carry you tools in a rice bag?
Here.
You can use one of these ... and you'll need one of this here.
I can't afford any of this.
I'll cover it.
You can pay me back with your first pay check.
Cool
- Here, we need something like that.
This is what I am looking for here, tool belt.
There you go.
Not to bitch.
But won't I be needing some tools.
Tools I've got but I am not going to lend you my tool belt.
You can pick up tools as you go.
I really appreciate all this.
- Forget it.
No, I really do Thank you.
What's up homeboy, what are you doing?
What up man?
- What you got, punk?
Checking up on my little cousin.
- Yeah, man.
My little cousin ...
What's this?
Where you come from man?
- I am coming
Home from work I know you guys don't know much about that.
So that's true, you got a job.

He is scared, huh?
Who bought this shit for you?
Your dad?
- What you guys want with me?
Your dad bought this shit for you?

What's the phrase I am looking for?
Oh yeah, 'saving face'
Hey, there.
Hey.
I gotta run.
Haven't seen you for a few days.
Where you've been?
Been busy.
Busy, huh?
What the hell happened to you?
- Don't worry about it.
What do you mean don't worry about it.
Look at your goddamn face.
I said don't worry about it.
Okay, it's not your problem.
When?
Grabbed me a couple of days ago right after I go off work.
Cowards.
I did everything I can possibly do.
But they broke some of your tools.
I will replace them.
Don't worry about the tools.
Where is your cousin lives?
No, Walt.
I'll be ok.
I don't want you to do anything.
- Right,.
You could need extra tools, you just let me know.
Well, I could use a roofing hammer.
-Good, go in my garage and get it.
This should be the last stop.
Here is the deal.
You stay away from Tao, understand?
You tell your friends to stay away from Tao.
You want to fight with us than I could sound don't want to see him anymore.
That's it, got it?
I'll take that as yes.
Cause if I have to come back here it is gonna get fucking ugly.
Get off of my way.
How do you want your dog?
I mean steak?
Funny.
I told you we only eat cats.
I've never seen you like this before.
Well I am feeling good.
I god beautiful women, great food.
And Tao.
And even Tao isn't bugging me.
You are having a good time, I see.
-Yeah.
And it never ends.
What happened to your knuckles anyways?
I slipped in a shower.
No big problem.
Look Yum-Yum if he doesn't ask you out I will ask you out.
Wa Xam, don't listen to him.
He is a white devil.
Yeah, I am.
I am a white devil.
I've loved to Walt, but he beat you to it.
Really?
No kidding!
Dinner and a movie, or what?
Yeah, they are taking a bus.
No, you can't take a bus.
You gonna get you something more stylish that that.
Like what?
Take a limo?
How about that?
The Gran Torino?
- Yeah.
You'd let me take the Gran Torino.
- Yeah, I let you take the Gran Torino.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Is everybody all right?
Tao!
It's all right.
Where's grandma?
Where is Sue?
Where is Sue?
- She went to our aunts.
To her aunts?
Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Get on the phone and call her right now.
Sue ...
I knew, this was gonna happen.
What the hell am I doing here?
Maybe some of her friends called her and she changed her plans.
Yeah.
At the war we just all of us lost a lot of friends but you gotta stand for it.
You can care to it.
Mr. Kowalski?
Are you Ok?
Yeah, I am Ok.
Police finally left, no one is talking.
One thing about Hmong, they keep their mouths shut.
Yeah, I've noticed that.
You know, Tao and Sue will never gonna find peace in this world as long as those gangs around.
Until they go away.
You know forever.
What are you saying?
You know what I am saying.
I took Sue to the hospital.
She is scared.
They are all scared..
Yeah
Tao especially.
He's sitting out there right now staring at your front door.
You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.
What would you do?
What should Tao do?
I know what I would do if I was you.
Or at least what you think you should do.
- Really
If I was Tao I guess I'd wanted vengeance.
I'd wanted to stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys.
And you?
- What would I do?
I'd come over here and talk to you I guess.
I know you are close with these people, but this pisses me off too.
Mr.Kowalski.
Wanna beer?
- I'd love one.
There some in the chest, right over there behind you.
Damn all this.
It just isn't fair.
- Nothing is fair, father.
So what you gonna do, Mr. Kowalski?
Call me Walt.
All right.
What you gonna do, Walt?
I don't know.
But I'll think of something.
Whatever it is, they won't have a chance.
What are you doing?
Thinking.
Thinking.
Thinking time is over.
Now it's time to knock shit out of these pricks.
I know you don't want to hear this, but now it's the time to stay calm.
Calm?
You want me to be calm?
We stay calm or else mistakes will get made.
We have to step back from this thing.
No, don't let me down Walt.
Not you.
This is gonna end today.
Sit down.
I don't want to sit.
I said sit down.
Now, listen to me.
We gotta plan this and plan it very carefully.
Can't make any mistakes.
You know I am the right man for this job.
I want to go home and stay calm, and come back here at 4 this afternoon.
And this to be done will be done.
I say we go now, Right now.
And what?
Kill that cousin of yours and the rest of those zips.
Mr. Tough Guy is out for blood all of the sudden.
I know nothing about it.
Now go home.
You stay calm come back here at 4.
Ok?
Okay.
I know, I know.
Give me a break, please, it's the first time I've ever smoked in the house.
Let a man enjoy himself,would you girl.
All finished. 10 dollars American.
I don't suppose your guinea hands are steady enough to do a straight shave?
- Straight shave?
You've never asked about straight shave ever.
I know but I always wondered about it.
That's unless you are too busy.
No, just let me heat up a towel.
Here is 20.
Keep the change.
It is just in case you hit my jugular.
Yes sir, It gonna take about one hour.
We gonna shorten these sleeves little bit.
Gonna fix at the shoulder.
I never had a suited suit before.
Yes sir, look very good.
Yes, sir.
Look very good.
What can I do for you, Mr. Kowalski?
- I am here for a confession.
Lord Jesus, what have you done?
- Nothing you just take it easy now.
What are you up to?
Are you gonna give a confession or not?
How long has it been since your last confession?
Forever.
Bless me father, for I have sinned.
What are your sins, my son?
In 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski at the factory Christmas party.
Dorothy was in the other room with the other wives.
it just happened.
Yes, go on.
Well, I made 900 dollars profit selling a boat and motor.
I didn't pay the taxes it is the same as stealing.
Yes, fine.
Lastly...
I was never very close with my two sons.
I don't know them.
I didn't know how.
That's it?
- That's it.
It's bothered me most of my life.
Say 10 "Hail Maries" and 5 "Our fathers".
God loves and forgives you and absolves you of all your sins.
In the name of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.
Thank you padre.
Are you going to retaliate for what happened to Sue.
I'm going over to that house today, Mr. Kowalski.
Is that so?
- It is.
And every other day until you see the folly of what you are planning.
Busy day, gotta go.
- Go in peace.
Oh I am at peace.
Jesus Christ.
So which one is mine?
You ever fired a weapon before?
- No
Why don't you put that one down.
I got something more to show you.
What?
In 1952 we were sent to take out a chink machine gun nest.
They trod us up pretty good.
I was the only one who came back out there.
For that they gave me a silver star.
Here it is.
Here I want you to have it.
Why?
Because we all knew the danger that night.
But we went anyway.
That's the way it might be tonight.
There is always a chance you don't come back.
The hell we won't.
We're will roll in there and tear ass.
Yeah, that's foolish.
That's the exact reaction they are waiting for.
Come on and close this up.
How many?
- How many what?
How many men did you kill in Korea?
13, maybe more.
-What was it like to kill a man.
You don't want to know.
Now close it up.
Walt!
Walt!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Relax, you can't get out of there.
You let me out right now !
Let me out.
You fuck let me out, I'll fucking kill you.
Shut the fuck up!
You want to know what is like to kill a man?
Well, that's goddamn awful.
The only thing worse is get a medal of valor for killing some poor kids..
that wanted just to give up that's all
Yeah, some scared little gook just like you.
I shot them right in a face with that rifle you were holding in there a while ago.
So if the day goes by that I don't think about it.
You don't that on your soul.
I got blood on my hands.
I am soiled.
That's why I am going alone tonight.
Walt you take me with you right now, let me out.
Look, you've come a long way.
I am proud to say that you are my friend.
But you got your whole life ahead of you.
But me, I finished things.
That's what I do and I am going alone.
No, wait.
Walt!
Walt!
I need you to watch my dog.
Yeah I love you too.
Yeah, she is old too.
Her name is Daisy.
Hello.
- It is Walt.
The keys to my house are under the ceramic turtle on the from porch.
Let yourself in.
Your brother is in the basement.
I gotta go.
Sorry father, we have to go.
I am telling if we are not here there will be a bloodshed.
We've been here for hours.
We can't afford to anchor a unit down to one location.
I am bagging you to stay.
Just got a word from my sergeant, we're pulling the plug.
I am staying.
No you aren't.
We have specific orders you came with us, you are leaving with us.
Watch your head.
Sue, over here, over here.
Unlock this right now.
He left without me.
He went to Smokie without me.
Tao!
Any swamp rats in there.
I didn't know your ass would came.
-Shut up, gook.
I have nothing to say to you, shrimp dick, lizard like you.
Yeah, yeah.
You go ahead watch out for your boyfriend.
Cause it was either he or you or something who raped one of their own family.
You own blood, for Christ sake.
Now go ahead and pull those pistols, like miniature cowboys.
Go ahead.
So where's Tao at?
That pussy motherfucker not gonna come.
Don't worry about Tao.
Tao's got not one second for you.
Says who?
You?
What the fuck you gonna do, old man?
What are you gonna do?
You bitch.
-
Kind of jumpy, aren't we?
- Shut the fuck up.
You should the fuck up!
Got a light?
- What the fuck?
No
Me..
I've got a light...
'Hail Mary, full of grace..'
Yes, sergeant.
What happened?
- You need to step back.
He is a friend of mine.
- He said step back.
Hey, did you hear him.
Step back.
What happened?
- Hey, step back.
He is my friend.
Officer Chang!
get those people back.
- Hey, step back now, Ok.
Get the fuck out of here!
Walt Kowalski once said to me that I didn't know anything about life or death.
Because I was an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who held the hands of superstitious old women and promised they eternity.
Walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it.
But he was right.
I knew really nothing about life or death, until I got to know Walt.
And boy did I learn.
And I want to leave my house to the church becouse Dorothy would've liked it now which brings to out last item .
And again please excuse the language.
in Mr. Kowalski's will, I'm simply reading it as it was written.
And I'd like to leave my 1972 Gran Torino to ... my friend ...
Tao Vang Lor.
Under the condition that you don't choptop top the roof like one of those beaners don'tpaintanyidioticflameson it like some white-trash hillbilly anddon'tputabiggayspoileron the rear end like you see on all the other zipper heads' cars
It just looks like hell
If you If you can refrain from doing any of that, it's yours
The English subtitles were made by Ilya-42 (also my Skype name)
I was the one who seduced him.
A blindfold's all you need.
It'll be just as if your beloved Takahiro were here in your arms...
That was my high-handed naivete.
Your cool hands felt so good on my skin
I love you so much...
Ta...
Takahiro...
All that's left is my memory of his touch.
My love will never be returned.
I thought that my feelings would get through to him if we had sex.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Kusama Nowaki.
let go of me!
What's up with you?
Hey!
Wacchan!
Did you find the rocket?
a newcomer?
come on over!
a little something for our new friend.
Cheers!
I'm jusL..
It's okay.
Wacchan!
Come over here a second!
This launch is going to be perfect!
Coming!
The feel of his hands just now... crazy?
There's no way!
So your name is Kamijou Hiroki-kun?
then you're Hirotan!
Hirotan...?
so Wacchan {vt organized this little rocket-launching party for us.
We all got to know each other through Wacchan.
Here's my business card.
Dispose of it however you want.
mine too!
too!
Bet they're just a couple of old guys on the verge of getting laid off...
Kusama Nowaki...
What manner of man are you?
!
Wacchan's childhood was a little complicated.
He was abandoned as a newborn on the steps of an orphanage.
they named him "Nowaki" because there was a typhoon on the day he was found.
e started working straight out of middle schoo but he always makes sure to donate to the orphanage every month.
Says he'd like to take the place over some day.
He's a good kid.
A boy like that deserves to find happiness.
huh...
I wouldn't mind a little of that myself.
Do you need something?
I'm just worried.
You were crying so much before...
It's none of your business!
I heard you're a Teito student.
Would you be my tutor?
Why me?
so I need to take the high school proficiency exam.
I've got a senior thesis to write.
I'm too busy for that!
then.
I'm not going to do it!
Go ask someone else.
Hiro-san.
Huh?
Let go already!
Please!
Quit pestering me!
I really want to learn!
Get lost!
I'm getting really angry!
Go right ahead.
What the hell is up with that guy...
The key!
I got jacked!
This is the worst day of my life!
and then some random kid takes my house key!
Screw this!
I'm going to sleep!
Warm...
Why do your hands feel different from usual...?
What the hell?
!
What are you doing here?
!
Good morning.
What the hell?
!
What are you doing here?
!
I finished my paper route so 1 thought I'd stop by.
What the hell?
!
What are you doing here?
!
I finished my paper route so I thought I'd stop by.
Get out!
Leave my key and get the hell out!
I made breakfast.
if you'd like.
So remind me why you're going to such I lengths to get me to be your tutor?
You don't know?
Not a clue.
Why indeed... you moron
But I can't bring myself to kick him out it feels just like...
I need to get over this!
he's never going to feel the same.
All that's left is my memory of his touch.
Areyou okay?
Looks like you owe me one now.
kid!
Geez...
Fine!
I'll do it!
and you better prepare yourself for a Spartan education!
you grateful?
Yes!
This guy is way too candid... you're so cute!
Don't look down at me like that!
anyway?
!
You're huge!
186 centimeters.
He's here.
juggling six jobs but he always finds the time to study.
Are... they alike?
not at all.
His hands are the only thing that's similar... welcome home.
Go wash your face while I check this.
Okay.
He got them all right!
Damn it..
Is your thesis coming along okay?
though.
Why?
I think I'm going to stay in school.
Are you being held back a year?
You idiot!
I'll have you know I'm at the top of the literature department!
I'm saying I want to go to graduate school!
wow!
That's amazing!
after all.
it's nothing really...
I was just trying to explain.
um...
Why not brag?
You're an amazing person.
Being around Nowaki always makes everything weird.
That book... excuse me.
I kind of helped myself to it
I don't mind.
don't you?
Why do you say that?
You have three copies of each of his books.
I hear he's also a student at Teito University.
Have you ever met him?
Hiro-san?
I have.
He's a childhood friend of mine.
The one I love.
the one I loved
I see.
I see.
A childhood friend.
I took advantage of it
Ta...
Takahiro...
At that moment I realized how deeply he regretted it he had somehow sullied Takahiro.
and that only hurt him all the more.
out of love.
for fear of destroying everything.
A love with no hope of requital...
I understand your feelings painfully well... and... thank you for letting me use your shower.
you should go to bed...
Akihiko...
What are you doing?
!
Is "Akihiko" that childhood friend you were talking about?
Eh?
You said his name in your sleep.
N-None of your business!
It seems you're never going to notice until I just come out and say it.
I...
Yes!
Coming!
Akihiko?
You're still alive?
What the hell?
and I could never get a hold of you at school.
I assumed you were dying in some alleyway.
excuse me for being alive!
I don't have time to play around with the great lord novelist.
I haven't even settled my feelings yet.
Don't make a joke of it I was really worried about you.
Are you eating properly?
Your face is so pale!
You're so kind so kind I can't bear it
Don't touch me!
Hiroki?
Don't call my name in that voice!
Don't be kind when you don't actually feel a thing for me!
but..
I'll be taking Hiro-san.
You stupid bastard!
What the hell was that about just now?
!
He totally misunderstood...
I love you.
I asked you to be my tutor because...
I fell in love with you the moment I saw you.
What are you so that I'd have more time.
I mean more time to study.
I just want every extra minute together with you that-1 can'get wasn't it?
It had nothing to do with him...
I won't ask what happened.
But I'd never make you cry like that
You were crying when I fell in love at first sight... but I want to see you smiling!
Can I replace Usami-san?
G-Get out!
and don't ever come back again!
Hiro-san.
he really just up and left..
Maybe I was a little too harsh?
anyway?
He goes and confesses when I'm still recovering from a broken heart and then he asks if he can be Akihiko's replacement-what the hell is that? Nowaki really might not come back here again.
anyway.
It was never any of my concern.
it's nothing I should worry about.
Excuse me.
I'd like to
What the hell am I doing ?
Why am I dressed up in this stupid disguise spying on Nowaki from a cafe window?
For all my insistence that it doesn't matter I can't get him out of my mind...?
oh no!
That is absolutely impossible!
There is no ivay!
It just so happened that this cafe I entered was across from the flower shop Nowaki works at WhaJ Wha...
What the hell?
!
Quit flirting with those high school girls!
aren't you?
!
how dare you be enamored of women?
!
)
Wait What am I doing?
Hiro-san...
What do you want?
I wanted to see you.
it was a real wake-up call.
I blurted out how I felt without considering the time and place.
For that I'm sorry.
But giving you up is one thing I just can't do.
Wha-What the hell is your problem?
!
Everything you say is just crazy!
Quit fucking around!
didn't you?
1 was incredibly happy.
I'm going to tell you again.
I love you.
You're way too direct.
Do you hate direct people?
I'm just not used to it...
Then allow me to get you used to it.
it's your turn to be loved by me.
and yet now...
I love you.
Hiro-san.
It's all your fault.
Your hands are just so warm...
Hiro-san.
too.
He pisses me off.
Nowaki" means typhoon.
I had already been swept away.
I was already falling.
she's all done!
that's really gorgeous!
I put everything I've got into this one!
no extra charge.
Is it a delivery?
I can take it no need.
then?
from the Bunkyo district.
too.
et cetera.
Et cetera...?
Is he a friend of yours?
but..
that's all.
and you see him or her smile what a wonderful feeling it is... your flowers!
I got your flowers!
exam student!
Don't let it get to your head.
You just managed to qualify yourself to take the real exam; you haven't passed it yet!
It's only going to get tougher from here on...
I'm so happy I think I might die.
Dumbass... if that someone is the one you love.
Nowaki disappeared.
Returning to Japan?
New York"...?
!
IT'S NOT ME, I SWEAR!
The Bible says:
"In the beginning was the Word."
I dunno, but for me, in the beginning there was nothing.
I was sleeping 20,000 leagues under the sea.
That was before the Word.
One day, God ruined everything.
The seawater drained out, and life appeared at the end of the tunnel.
The doctor said everything's fine, that I was a normal boy.
Me, Leon Dore, a normal boy?
Some doctors should be suicided by a firing squad.
Leon!
Leon, hold on!
Mom!
Leon hanged himself!
Breathe!
Breathe!
Jerome, hurry!
Stay with me, baby!
Undo the rope!
Jerome!
Leon!
It's forbidden to hang yourself.
It's forbidden.
Don't move, my puppy.
Stay right here.
Just sit still.
Mom will come right back.
Jerome hates my deadly accidents, because afterwards Mom won't let us hide in the freezer or play Lego in the middle of the street.
Jerome just wants a normal brother in a normal family.
He never questions anything.
I don't know how he does it.
Nothing seems normal to me.
The Mariniers will laugh at us again.
Anyway, I don't want to play in the tree.
To hang yourself, you mean.
I'm used to dying from time to time.
Like that time I slept in the pool.
Under the water, it's quiet, like before I was born.
Mom disagreed.
She saved me, then killed the pool with a knife.
I think if I'd died that day, maybe Jerome would be happy.
And Mom and Dad wouldn't have separated.
Show Dad your neck.
Keep your scarf on.
This isn't the Boy Scouts.
Eat your tomato soup, Leon.
Right, hide your scar so your mom doesn't feel guilty.
I was baking.
I can't be everywhere.
Watching your cakes or your kids, tough choice!
The cakes are for your government pals.
Your goddamn contacts!
Politicians visit us a lot.
Dad's what they call a celebrity, a national hero.
A human rights activist.
He never lies.
He's perfect.
He's a lawyer.
When Dad gets angry, he seems almost normal.
Dad, stop!
Our family looks crazy.
Our family is crazy, Jerome.
Go to bed.
You guys going camping, Leon?
Camping's dumb, Mr. Marinier.
Think so?
You fight in the car.
It takes hours.
It always rains.
It's windy, you freeze.
Mom wants to go to a motel.
Everyone catches a cold.
Gosh, that's true!
Last year it wasn't windy.
No, but the tent leaked.
Told you!
Like to come with us?
Our family doesn't fight all the time.
Don't want to leave your mom?
You know, Leon, at your age...
Great scarf.
Keep an eye on the house while we're at the ocean, OK?
We'll see dolphins!
Want some shells?
My mom says divorce is a sin.
We're camping for three weeks!
Francois!
Hi, Leon.
What are you up to?
You threw those eggs at my garage!
Don't lie, I saw you.
This winter, in early February?
- You know when.
- Impossible.
I had the Hong Kong flu.
Throwing eggs is bad, but lying is worse!
Want to discuss it with my mom?
You could have tea together.
Throwing an egg is like breaking a leg.
Is anything wrong?
Someone broke her leg, but it wasn't me.
- Not a leg, an egg.
- Not the eggs again?
Leon had scarlet fever.
He said the Hong Kong flu.
He's not the only boy around here.
Come, Leon.
Goodbye, Mrs. Brisebois.
Sure.
Sweetie, I told you.
If you lie, keep your story straight.
I forget which disease.
Now she knows you're lying.
Is that bad?
It's better not to lie, but it's worse to lie badly.
Leave me alone!
The town has rejected metal bins for our clothing drive.
There's never been a child asphyxiated in one.
You don't know Leon.
People can drop their clothes off here.
Madeleine will deliver them.
In your car?
I'll deliver them.
I had an accident in the last car.
But at least I'm alive.
Tell him about the light.
The light!
And the tunnel too, no doubt.
When I crashed I saw a blinding white light.
I saw my life flashing by, like in a movie.
Simple things that I'd forgotten.
Beautiful things.
They made me realize how my life had changed.
Jerome's going to Vancouver.
For an English program.
I saw a white light too when I suicided by accident.
Leon hanged himself...
accidentally.
Go on, Leon.
A light like a train at the end of a sewer pipe.
The Lord touched my forehead with his finger.
Then I heard music.
- What kind of music?
- Banjo.
I see.
Was God telling me to be good?
What do you think?
It was a telegram saying Choose good or evil.
But you're the expert.
Telegrams aren't really God's thing.
I've never got one.
You do good deeds, Leon.
He visits the old people's home on Sundays, right?
Sundays we used to picnic.
He'd read, I'd paint.
Did you paint that?
Of course not, that's a Fortin!
Mom painted that on a picnic.
That's me reading Ginsberg.
It was just before Jerome was born.
I wanted Father Charlebois to touch my forehead to illuminate me.
I wanted a servant of God as a friend.
Useful in case of miracles.
Or to purge my thoughts of atomic destruction.
Run!
Your threats don't scare me anymore!
Madeleine, not the bust!
Mom threw the Beethoven!
Dad blocked it with the table!
Not the Fortin!
- You're dangerous.
- Hypocrite!
Stop it!
Happy now?
Feel better about being a failed painter?
Why are you two so unnormal?
- Unnormal!
- The word is abnormal, Jerome!
Abnormal!
Go to bed!
What now?
"Keep an eye on the house while we're gone,
OK, Leon?"
Fudge, Dad'll kill me.
I saw you, Leon.
What are you doing?
I saw a fox.
What do you have there?
A screwdriver.
My bike chain's broken.
Nothing else?
You don't have any eggs?
If I did, they'd be broken.
They're fragile.
Not like a leg.
Bye, Mrs. Brisebois.
I won't go to court.
The judges are your pals.
I'm not a glorified waitress.
Who's on the phone?
I know, you've been warning me for a year.
I'll start a new life.
Where were you?
At the old folks' home.
All morning?
I played in the field too.
You have a migraine?
Going to take a nap?
What's going on?
My puppies, Mom's suffocating.
She's not well.
You want to start a new life?
I'm leaving for Greece tomorrow.
Where's Greece?
For how long?
I knew it!
All the neighbours say you're not normal.
Fine, leave.
And don't come back!
What's in Greece, Mom?
Why Greece?
Answer me!
Play with your brother.
I told you, don't stand there.
The players can't see us.
Mr. Pouchonnaud, you're from far away, right?
Argenton-sur-Creuse.
- That's not in Canada?
- No, France.
Is it near Greece?
A bit nearer than here.
Where is Greece exactly?
Southeast Europe, exactly.
Is that far?
Across the Atlantic.
If you walked on water, it'd take seven months!
Seven months?
Are you crazy?
No way I'd walk.
Flying's easier.
You're going to Greece?
Yes.
I know where it is.
You have to fly across the ocean.
It's where Ulysses was born.
But you weren't born there.
That's true.
Why do you want to go?
It's beautiful.
The sky's always blue, with a sort of thin bride's veil over it.
I don't understand.
There's dust in the air.
It makes the light glow.
You're leaving us for dust?
I'm going to work.
When you lie, keep your story straight.
Let go!
Go see your dad.
This place is a pigsty!
He never lies.
But we can't go on picnics every day!
You'll come back, but the door will be locked!
With no contacts or skills...
Or a drunk to preach at me!
Without your children!
You had one chance and you got drunk!
- What chance?
- To save your family.
I'm not abandoning my kids.
As a mother, you set a precedent.
People will talk about this in 40 years in the best homes in Montreal!
Screw your pals at the Beaver Club!
I'd rather be crazy than be like you!
You're an awful wife, and a worse woman!
I want to live, not rot away in the suburbs.
Go lie in the sand with those Greek colonels!
What crap is that?
Fire!
What is it now?
I'm not finished with you!
Fire!
Get out!
Sometimes I start a fire in a strategic spot.
An old Indian trick for ending fights.
I'd never tried a polyester bedspread.
Dad, Mom and Jerome all put it out together.
They looked almost like a normal family.
I pretended to be scared, but I knew my plan was working.
Tomorrow we'd hold a family council, like at the UN.
Mom'd keep looking after me and nothing would change.
Stop it.
Leon, stop it!
Stop it!
Get a hold of yourself.
Stop it.
Nice kite.
- Did Jerome make it?
- Stop looking at my kite!
Beat it!
Go play Barbie!
That's for babies.
Go see your mom!
She's working.
Go see your dad!
I mean, your uncle!
He's drunk.
If you want to stay, gimme your undies.
If you want your undies, find a four-leaf clover.
Where you going?
It's that weird girl's fault.
You always break everything.
You're in love with Lea.
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.
You're lucky.
I never tell anyone anything.
Make me a kite shaped like a fox.
No such thing.
I'm sure there is.
- Where's Lea's dad?
- I dunno.
Maybe he got divorced.
You don't say divorced.
It's a bad word.
Like vagina.
You don't say those words!
I never say vagina.
When can we call Mom?
Phones in Greece are archaic.
What's her number?
Your mom decided to live under a dictatorship.
So?
The Greeks invented democracy, but men there aren't free.
What about the women?
Don't get smart with me.
Your naive act won't work.
What are you doing here, Lea?
This is my hideout.
I saw you outside the Mariniers'.
Me?
What would I do there?
- You loomed up.
- I what?
Suddenly appeared.
My brother taught me that.
He should teach you not to be nosy.
Take it easy, my god!
I have a secret hideout too.
I don't believe you.
Where?
That's where crazies hide out.
If you say so.
Lea, I've had enough of you.
I've got other stuff to do.
Like what?
Like buy a ticket to Greece.
How?
Breaking the Mariniers' piggy bank?
Lea, you're such a pain.
Is that where your mom went?
To Greece?
And your dad?
Where's he?
Away on business.
For two years?
My brother's a travel agent.
I can help you find the money.
I know where to find money.
There's a safe at the Mariniers'.
That's it, go camping!
I'll keep an eye on your safe.
Money, jewels, pools, rules, and I go to Greece.
I'm going mad.
What have I done?
Who left the lights on?
I don't have the second key.
- How can you have just one?
- Just give me the...
Mom, come see the kitchen!
- My harpsichord!
My god!
Mom, come see!
Stay calm, everybody.
And stop shouting!
Holy Christ!
My train set, shit!
Whoever did it was sick.
Who hates us that much?
Professionals.
Professionals who play Lego?
My fur coats!
How'd they come in?
My locomotive!
My mink coat!
Thank god!
Nothing's gone?
It stinks of pee.
Everybody upstairs.
Come on, kids.
Fifi, go pee!
C'mon, Fifi!
What now?
Do we unpack the car?
Forget the phone.
You can call your four sisters tomorrow.
We have to clean the whole house.
I want the Lego gone tomorrow or I'll throw'em out.
Our insurance is useless, nothing's stolen.
And the mess?
And my harpsichord?
Clean the place up and we'll see.
- My harpsichord's an antique!
- I know!
I'll read the policy tomorrow.
It's me, Lea!
Over here!
They're looking for you in the woods.
The cops came.
Your dad called my mom.
I said you were looking for my cat.
What time is it?
It's 1 a.m.
What's wrong, Leon?
Get me a knife, OK?
What for?
The sharpest you can find.
- What are you going to do?
- Nothing.
Go home.
Thanks.
If you say so.
You are sick, Leon Dore!
This way Dad won't kill me.
Jesus Mary Joseph!
Leave Jesus out of it!
I don't know how to say this...
But that's it.
Now go home.
They sometimes play in the cornfield out back... or go bowling next door at Mr Pouchonnaud's.
But he always comes home for supper.
I don't understand.
You see, since his mom left,
I've been working at home.
If I have to leave,
I make something for them to eat, or they have supper with Mrs. Samson.
Do you know what time it is?
What happened?
- He's bleeding.
- I fell from a tree.
A maple.
A red maple.
In the woods behind the Clements'.
I'd climbed it to look for Lea's cat.
I slipped, and when I hit the ground,
I fainted into a coma.
We'll go to the hospital.
A very clean cut for a branch.
After you fell, you were in a coma until 1 a.m.?
I couldn't find my way home.
I was seeing blurry.
That's serious!
No, it's not.
It was blurry before I fell.
For how long?
Two years and three months.
Two years?
Mom wanted to take me to the optometrist.
She never told me.
That's why at school
I can't read sentences on the board like,
"Lea has a tutu."
That explains your terrible marks.
L...
W...
T...
R...
That's all I can see.
E, C, B
D, L, N
P, T, E, R
C, L, N, B, P...
Sorry!
It's nice, huh?
It's adjustable.
You can raise the seat.
As you grow, the bike grows too.
Ecological.
Remember that word!
- Where are you going?
- To break my fib bone.
Don't be jealous.
And the word is fibia!
Want to try it?
More to the right!
To the right of the line!
That's it, go work.
Go save the country!
Hi.
OK, that's it!
I need to do something exciting.
Like what?
Aren't you bored waiting for your mom?
I'm not waiting for her.
Aren't you going to Greece?
I don't have her phone number.
Forget the phone.
What you need is a plan.
I have a plan.
You have a plan?
It's dangerous.
Desperate times, desperate measures.
Desperate times, desperate measures.
Did you make that yourself?
I know, it's not very good.
Lea, it's amazing!
I don't know how to say it, but it's...
What?
Well, for a girl you're...
Tell me!
Better than a tractor.
What exactly does that mean?
Are you teasing me?
If you don't like my map...
It's the greatest pirate map I ever saw.
It's a psychological way of saying...
Spit it out, Leon!
That I love you.
And...
Well, that's it.
I love myself too.
Stop interrupting and listen.
We need money.
The Moreaus are gone on vacation.
He's an accountant, he's loaded.
How'll we get in?
You're the expert, I trust you.
We take Moreau's money and go to the travel agency.
My brother's in on it.
We meet at the old folks' home.
That's our alibi.
What's that red house?
Nothing, it's just decoration.
Forget it.
This is the river where...
At St Charles?
It's too far.
Not if we take the Portage Street ferry.
Are you crazy?
Portage Street?
Weirdos live there!
And the ferryman's a cyclops.
Are you scared?
But he's a cyclops.
You pee in your pants, you sissy!
Do you still need your mommy with you?
My uncle hits me too.
Your slap is just a gust of wind.
I'm sorry.
It happened by itself.
You don't always have to act like an adult.
What's an alibi?
Proof we're somewhere we're not.
I'm a specialist in alibis.
Tomorrow we're going to sing at the old folks' home.
Starting Monday you'll eat lunch at Mrs. Samson's.
Would you prefer Mrs. Brisebois?
She makes good omelettes.
- The Mariniers were broken up.
- You mean broken in.
Francois told me they found the thief's left footprint.
- A one-legged thief?
- A small foot.
A handicapped dwarf.
These came.
Did she give her phone number?
No, nor her address.
Good!
Your turn to wash up.
"Dear Leon, the light here is magical.
"Beautiful, like in a dream.
"Sometimes I sit by the sea and wait for Ulysses' ship."
What did she say in yours?
Lies.
Like your glasses.
Can I see it?
She's been gone 26 days.
You won't have room.
She's never coming back.
Come on, the house is right there!
What are you doing?
Hands off!
It's adjusted for patio doors.
Sorry!
It looks like a compass.
It's way more complicated.
The glass is 1 1/2".
So the pressure has to be cubed.
What's wrong?
Must be laminated polysodium bicarbonate.
You're crazy!
Often happens with polysodium.
Cut the crap!
JESUIT RELATIONS
I found some money!
Lea, where are you?
What are you doing?
It's no time to play Barbie.
I don't know how to play Barbie.
That's OK, neither do I.
- Come on.
- Don't touch me!
Stop it.
OK!
That's not how you play.
Lea, say something.
What other games do you play?
Lots of stuff.
What?
Kites.
You see, we're not normal kids.
Thank god!
We have to get out of here.
Stop!
We're not alone.
Did you hear?
Probably a squirrel.
I want to go.
If we run, he'll attack us.
I'm scared.
Me too.
But we can't show it.
Get off.
Are you crazy?
Sit down and play tic-tac-toe.
C'mon, play!
18 to 2 for me.
You suck at tic-tac-toe.
It's true, I suck at tic-tac-toe, but I saved your life.
Love gives you courage.
On Portage Street I was scared.
But I showed Lea that, together, anything was possible.
I'd fight the cyclops and cross all the rivers in the world.
We'd fulfil our mission and buy a ticket for Greece.
Without the help of adults or the help of Jesus.
I'll just check the map, OK?
Where are you going?
Can I please see my dad?
Mom, there's somebody here!
I want to see my dad.
Jacques Veilleux.
You're his daughter?
I want to see him.
He moved away.
I don't believe you.
It's true.
You have to go home.
Where is he?
Let me see him!
Lea, we should go.
I want to see my dad.
He lives here, I know it!
Not since last summer.
Your dad left.
It's not true!
I'm alone with my boy.
I don't know where he is.
- Tell me!
- I can't help you, dear.
It's not true.
What?
Does your brother really work at a travel agency?
Course not, he's only 15.
What?
Maybe we can start a new life.
We're only 10, Leon.
Exactly, it's not too late.
Your lying won't get you anywhere.
Leon, come back here!
Leon, come back here!
I spent the most incredible day of my life with Lea.
But it ended as gently as a meteorite hitting a nursery school.
Up there, I thought of Jesus.
I dunno why.
Maybe I hoped he'd send a telegram to lighten the mood.
It was Dad's wrath or the void.
I chose the quieter place.
You can start school on time.
Good news, huh?
You said Lea would come.
Lea has problems at home.
She's staying with her grandma.
She can't come.
Explain to me what happened on the stairs.
Why did you jump?
Did you get a telegram from on high?
I have something to ask you.
I'm listening.
Take Jesus down from the wall.
Why, Leon?
Please.
I want to sleep now.
You'll have to face your demons one day.
Hello, Greece?
Leon calling the Peloponesus.
Ios?
Corfu?
Over.
Hello, Mom?
It took me four days.
Did you tell on me?
You left your bandana at the Mariniers', idiot!
I don't want the kite.
I'm tired, Leon.
Then go to bed.
Tired that we can't have a normal vacation.
Or play with the neighbours.
That I have to chuck our toys to protect you.
You have to change.
I know you've been unhappy since Mom left, but she's gone.
She's not coming back.
Dad stayed with us.
He loves us.
He shouldn't be crying at night.
I don't want to hear him cry anymore.
Understand?
I want you to be happy.
You have to be happy.
I just want you to be happy.
Please, Leon.
Why are we at the Moreaus'?
Spare the rod, spoil the child.
Come on.
I'll come straight to the point.
You know that Leon vandalized your house and stole money.
Here's what he stole, plus damages.
He'll pay it back, every penny.
Did you rough him up like that?
No, Leon roughed himself up, as you put it.
If ever you see him loitering, just call the police.
Hello, Mrs. Dufort.
This is my son.
Unfortunately he's also a thief, a vandal and a liar.
For now he can't be trusted.
Don't give or sell him anything.
No hotdogs or drinks.
Just call the police.
Don't let him in.
It's none of my business.
We won't sell him anything.
But Leon will always be welcome here, understand?
No, Dad!
Please!
Crazy family!
Get over here!
You listen to me!
We're not in the Middle Ages!
Now go play!
I spent the summer in Greece.
I met your mom.
She told me all about her boys.
Here.
To make a nice kite.
Why didn't she bring it?
Your mom lives in Greece now, see?
No, he doesn't see.
A business trip is just that.
It's just a trip.
A business trip?
Do you have her address?
She moves around.
- Your mom has a house on...
- Anything for Leon?
Here.
It's the first she did there.
She sent this too.
What's he doing?
We saw dolphins, but it was rainy.
We stayed at a motel.
Mom got a cold so we came back.
And when we got back...
We had...
There was...
Just a sec.
Leon, wait your turn.
When you got back?
Nothing special.
Raccoons had eaten all the veggies in our garden.
It's Leon's turn now.
Can I move?
Why?
It smells bad here.
It's my fault, Mrs. Chavagnac.
My tummy hurts.
It's because of going back to school.
I think I should go to the john, because it's not over yet.
Hi.
I can't talk to you.
Why not?
Gran says you're a bad influence.
Why'd you move away?
Don't tell anyone I cried over the Barbies, OK?
Why would I?
This place is a pigsty.
My hand still hurts.
It's not healed yet.
Go finish your homework.
Come play.
What are we playing?
Schubert.
It's been ages.
Like this?
Ready?
One, two...
Do you need the john, Leon?
Analyze this.
I can't.
I have to go.
You're falling way behind the others.
Go to the board.
Lea runs with Rene.
Where are they going?
Identify the subject, verb and complement.
It bugs me not to know where.
To the field, OK?
Who's Rene?
Analyze it!
What now?
Julie runs with Rene.
Lea can't be with Rene.
She has stuff to do.
Now can I go?
Otherwise I'll faint and not on purpose.
Leon loves Lea!
Analyze it!
Analyze it!
I have diarrhea.
Not a pretty sight.
Mustard yellow.
Want to analyze it?
Do what you have to do.
I'll keep you posted.
Write a composition about your outing last Tuesday to Montreal.
Describe the picnic.
You've got half an hour.
Can you buy me some Barbies?
Barbies?
A dozen or so.
And mini hair brushes too.
Aren't you supposed to be in school?
In fact, it's for a school project.
I was asked to bring presents for children in Vietnam.
Where's your teacher?
OK, it's not for school.
It's for my friend, Lea.
Her uncle beats her.
Your stories make no sense.
Mom said that if I had to lie, to keep my stories straight.
For once I'm not lying.
Lea's sad, her uncle beats her.
She dreams of Barbies.
It's the truth.
It's not my fault if it doesn't make sense.
I have a treasure for you.
We could learn to play like normal kids.
For the last time, leave me alone!
Think I'm interested in Barbies?
And bubblegum and cheap junk?
The police came to our house.
I had to see a psychologist.
I'm moving to another town.
It's over, Leon.
Understand?
So, Rene Levesque has founded a separatist party.
You're very quiet.
Nothing to tell me?
How was school this week?
Boring.
Something happened to me.
I'm listening.
I escaped out the second-storey window.
Lea wouldn't take my Barbies 'cause of her psychologist.
Let's talk like grown-ups.
Have you been calling overseas?
11 calls to Greece in 2 weeks.
Did you speak to your mother?
I've had it with the lies!
Maybe you were luckier, but when I called they only spoke Greek.
She doesn't live there.
Who gave you the number?
It's--
I stole it from that lady's purse.
You did what?
I did, and lots of other stuff.
- That's not it.
- You shut up!
Does Mom know I was in the hospital?
That I tried to kill myself?
I wrote her about your accident.
You have her address?
Why didn't she come see me?
You fell.
You just lost your balance.
Who cares?
You have her address!
Why didn't she come?
Greece is far away.
- So?
- It was better she didn't.
Better for who?
Is she dead and you don't want to tell us?
Don't overdramatize.
She's not dead.
She left.
That was her choice.
If she doesn't see you now... that's my choice.
I don't understand.
Your mom made her choice.
She knew she wouldn't see you again.
I didn't make that decision lightly.
Madeleine was a bad influence.
You lied!
You had her address!
Lying is bad.
But lying badly is worse!
What?
She didn't abandon us.
You forced her to stay away.
Goddamn liar!
It's complicated.
I know it's hard to understand.
I tried to do my best.
- To protect you.
- She's not coming back?
Where are you going?
Today I learned two things.
The first is that Dad's capable of lying.
He and I have that in common.
The second is that Lea and me was an accident.
The right place, the wrong time.
She emptied my reserves of love for a thousand years.
All that love, an atomic mushroom cloud over Bikini Island, led me here, to the back of a bowling alley.
So I'll take the advice of a Greek philosopher, who said,
"Desperate times, desperate measures".
I'm going to start a new life too.
It'll make it easier for Jerome, who wants only a normal life, and Dad, who needs more time to save the planet.
Starting over is like starting a new Lego house.
You have to undo the first one, reduce it to rubble.
After that, everything's possible.
Mom?
Yes.
What's the sky like there?
As beautiful as your eyes.
Are you happy there?
Yes.
Mom?
What?
I love you.
The ball hit the pin and the pin nicked my head.
Life's not made for me but I seem to be made for life.
I thought a lot while I was in my coma in hospital.
I know Mom's not coming back.
Not right away, anyway.
But I decided I'd wait for her a bit.
A bit all my life.
For now, I'll take care of Mrs. Brisebois.
IT'S NOT ME, I SWEAR!
English subtitles:
Robert Gray, Kinograph
Aha.
I killed him.
I told him not to.
I told him to stop.
But he didn't.
First I fired at his leg.
He didn't stop.
So this time I fired a bit higher up.
The bullet hit him in the stomach.
He still didn't stop.
So I took aim at his heart.
I begged him.
I begged him not to come any closer.
He didn't listen.
I cried.
I screamed.
I howled.
He didn't stop.
So I fired.
This time he fell at my feet.
He made a strange rasping sound.
He lifted his head and looked straight at me.
Then he laughed.
He laughed and laughed.
He didn't stop laughing.
20 April
Ali?
I went crazy when I got your note.
I couldn't wait for morning to see you.
What is it you have to tell me?
You said it was really important in the note.
- Ali?
- Huh?
What is it?
Has something bad happened?
Answer me!
What's bothering you?
Look at me, Ali.
Look at me, I said.
What's wrong?
Talk to me, please!
Is there some terrible problem?
Don't go quiet on me.
Say something!
Dilber...
Talk to me, please!
They're getting me married.
What?
They're getting me married.
Who to?
Hatice.
Hatice?
Well, what about me?
I thought you said we'd get married.
Your father doesn't want me.
What about your father?
Does he want me?
He doesn't want you either.
Why not?
My father and Hatice's father made a promise years ago.
That if their children were boys and girls they'd marry them off to each other.
Now they're saying,
"We promised, we made a vow."
"We can't go back on our word."
When are you getting married then?
- Tomorrow.
- What?
Dilber...
Da-a-a-d!
Da-a-a-a-d!
What's all this about, girl?
Why aren't you marrying me to Ali?
What right do you have to speak to your father like that?
Answer me!
Why aren't you marrying me to Ali?
Watch it or I'II...
- Hey!
- Just try.
Just you try!
I'll hack you all to pieces, first you, then Mum, then my brothers and sisters!
Whoa!
Have you lost your mind?
How dare you threaten your elders!
Shut up!
Give me an answer!
Why aren't you marrying me to Ali?
I swear to God it's not my fault.
Ali's father Haydar is to blame for everything.
He and Hatice's father Rýza made a promise to get them married.
Well, that's what they say.
Don't do anything stupid!
Wait, girl!
Life is fleeting!
Don't, Dilber!
Stop!
It's not worth it!
Don't, Dilber!
Stop!
Life's too short!
Don't!
Don't do anything stupid, girl!
Stop, girl!
Don't, girl!
Stop!
Haydar Amca!
Haydar Amca-a-a!
Haydar Amca, come outside!
Don't do this, Dilber!
Don't shame us in front of everyone!
Come out of there!
Come out!
- Is it me you want?
- Aha.
Go ahead.
Speak.
Why don't you want me as Ali's bride, Haydar Amca?
Look, Dilber.
What you're doing...
Stop it, Dad!
Shut up!
Or I'll kill the lot of you!
Speak up, Haydar Amca!
Why don't you want me for Ali?
Rýza and I made a deal in the army.
That we'd get our first-born children married.
We swore on the Koran.
Can't you forget about that?
You can't go back on your word!
You know as well as I do.
Your word is your honour.
But what about us, Haydar Amca?
What about me?
Ali and I have been in love for years.
Isn't it unfair on us?
What do you say to this?
Whatever...
Whatever my father says.
That's the way I was brought up, the way I know.
Inside...
I'm crying tears of blood inside.
But that's what I say.
God damn you!
God damn you all!
God damn your promises, your customs!
Well, I promise right here.
I'll marry the first man to come over that hill and ask for my hand.
I'll be his wife, his woman.
That's a promise.
I don't want a wedding, or jewellery, or a wedding dress.
I want everyone to know that.
And until that day I'm going to live in the barn with the animals.
Because even they're more human than you are.
Don't do this, Dilber.
Please don't do this.
Don't torture us or yourself like this.
Stop being stubborn.
Come back home.
Look, you're young, you're beautiful, you're hard-working.
There'll be other men.
You'll get married.
You'll have a family and forget about everything.
Come on now!
Don't bury yourself alive!
Your mother's distraught, your brothers and sisters too.
And I've had it.
I've had it!
Stop this stubbornness and come with me.
Come on, my beautiful.
Come on.
Huh?
It's up to you, girl.
It's up to you.
If you want to bury yourself alive...
It's up to you.
21 April
Dear daughter...
My ill-fated daughter...
My gazelle...
Come on.
Stop this stubbornness.
Don't eat yourself up, don't destroy yourself like this.
Look, Ali's getting married.
Tonight is his wedding night.
He'll be setting up a happy home.
He'll be happy.
He'll forget you.
My beautiful...
My gazelle...
Come on.
You forget him too!
Perhaps a good, honest man will come and find you.
You'll marry him and set up a happy home.
You'll forget Ali and everything that happened.
Man has forgotten all kinds of things over the centuries.
So don't tell me you can't forget Ali.
Come on, my beautiful.
My gazelle...
Get up.
Let's go home.
Come on, daughter.
Come on, my gazelle.
Come on.
Get up.
Let's go home.
Come on, daughter.
Let's go home.
Daughter...
Daughter...
Daughter... 22 April
- Selam aleykum.
- Aleykum selam.
- Dilber!
Dilber!
- What's happened?
He's here.
- Who's here?
- A man who wants to marry you.
You mean Ali?
Who is he?
His name's Mehmet.
Which village is he from?
He's from the town.
What does he do?
He's going to tell you the rest himself.
Why?
He said you should listen and decide for yourself.
Wait, Dilber.
Don't go.
Hear what Mehmet Efendi has to say.
Well, I don't have any family.
My parents died when I was still a child.
I had a grandfather.
He brought me up.
And he died last year.
I'm the caretaker at the town's primary school.
I'm lucky to earn a reasonable amount.
I get by on the minimum wage.
I have social insurance cover at the moment.
It'll soon be five years I've had the job.
We get a pay rise once a year.
I own a house in the town and a vegetable plot outside.
I inherited them from my grandfather.
I hear she doesn't want a wedding.
That's fine by me.
Other things too.
They're fine by me.
I find that perfectly reasonable.
If she's also willing by the will of God and the word of the Prophet I'd like to take your daughter and leave.
Here's the bride price.
It's all the money I've saved.
If you want more, there isn't any.
But if you like I'll sell the house and the land and bring you the money.
That's all very well, but...
If only you'd come with an elder.
You know as well as I do that's the custom.
I know it's the custom.
I know.
But no one wanted to come with me.
Because they can't take being turned down every time.
Trust me.
If you allow me to marry your daughter I'll look after her well.
I'll see that she's never in need.
I'll do anything she asks.
I'll be both the keeper of the home, the manservant and the master.
I don't go to bars or music taverns.
I don't drink, smoke or gamble.
I don't hang around teahouses.
I don't have many friends.
A roof over my head, a job, a wife and me...
That's good enough for me.
That's all I have to say.
The rest is for you to decide.
All right, son.
You've convinced me.
The bride price is OK too.
I don't want anything else from you.
I give you my daughter of her own free will.
Well...
Yes...
I honestly...
Can you read and write?
Yes.
I went to primary school until the fourth year.
Good.
Well...
This is our house.
Look, there's a three on this door and a three on the door outside.
OK?
OK.
Memorise that and don't ever forget.
Don't you have electricity in your village?
No.
They put up the poles and attached the cable.
But the electricity hasn't arrived yet.
It hasn't arrived?
Look...
This is the light switch.
Push it up and the lights go off.
Pull it down and the lights go on.
Got that?
This is the living room.
This is the kitchen.
The bathroom and toilet are in the yard.
Umm...
And this is the bedroom.
Umm...
You get yourself ready.
I'll be along in a minute.
Don't cry.
I...
Can I umm...
Can I sleep in the living room?
You sleep here.
I'll sleep in the living room.
OK?
Good night.
Sleep well.
23 April.
Good mor-ning.
I'm go-ing to work now.
I made a fresh pot of tea.
Have your break-fast.
See you this eve-ning.
Meh-met.
Don't open the door just like that.
- Ask who's there first.
All right?
- All right.
It's not the village here.
There's all sorts of people about.
Bad people, thieves, lunatics...
The other day, they broke into a house in broad daylight, tied up the woman and walked off with her bracelets.
Yes, really.
Anyway, they were caught later.
The blokes weren't even from this town.
They work as gangs now.
Gangs.
They come here from other places, do their thieving and go off again.
Poverty is driving people off the rails.
They even steal those ID bracelets off little children, you know.
Thanks.
Have you cooked anything?
Yes, I have.
I'll do some rice to go with it.
A friend's coming over tonight with his family to wish us well.
Can you make some yoghurt and cucumber to go with the rice?
All right.
Come on!
Won't you have a glass with me, Mehmet?
No.
You know it disagrees with me.
I won't.
Don't give me that!
How can raki disagree with you, huh?
It's medicine, the blessed stuff.
Medicine!
- You can't go without that poison!
- Keep out of this!
I'm enjoying a couple of rakis here.
Don't ruin it with your nagging!
Oh, God!
Do what you like.
Raki or poison, what do I care?
It's you who'll suffer.
How about putting on some tea to brew?
Hold on!
Wait!
I'll give you a hand.
Then we can have a natter.
Kemal, haven't you had a bit too much to drink?
I didn't want to say anything in front of Berivan, but she's right.
Look, stop lecturing me, Mehmet.
I've just had a couple of rakis.
- Is that so bad?
- Of course not.
Have a whole bottle if you like.
The point is that it doesn't end badly.
Nothing can happen to me!
Keep a tight rein from the start and later you can't handle these men.
The secret is not to keep a tight rein but to know what you're doing.
Give him some slack sometimes.
Let him have some air, get out and about.
Look, these men don't really go for idle wandering about, let me tell you.
Just as they're about to do the dirty, you pull in the reins.
Leave those reins slack and you're done for.
Let him eye another women just once and you'll be trodden on forever after.
Even if you had a gem, he'd be useless.
These men stop even looking at you!
Hey, girl!
Has our mug done the business yet?
- What business, Abla?
- What do you think?
That business.
Don't you understand?
Rumpy-pumpy, of course!
Get moving, damn you!
- Don't push me!
- Shut up and rot in hell!
- Why did you have to drink so much?
- I'll drink if I want.
I'll drink if I want.
I can get home by myself too.
Move!
Get moving!
Get off!
Hey, what's up with the road?
Why's it sliding about...
like this?
24 April
Leave the cleaning for tomorrow.
I've got away from school early.
We can have dinner early too, can't we?
Eat up.
I'm not hungry.
Is something troubling you?
No.
- Do you miss your family?
- No.
What's the matter then?
I'm so bored.
All alone in the house all day.
Sometimes I feel like I'm suffocating.
Look, this is the on-off button.
Press the button...
And the thing goes off.
Press it again and the thing comes on.
And this is the channel button.
Press the button and it goes to the next channel.
Press this one and it goes back to the previous channel.
Have you got that?
OK?
Here.
This is the town square.
That big building is the district governor's office.
But there's still no district governor.
That building there is the police headquarters.
I spent a night there once.
God forbid I have to do that again!
That's the town hall there.
This is the town's health centre.
That's the town's primary school.
It's the only school, and where I work.
And this is the nicest tea garden in town.
The tea's smuggled Ceylon tea and it's really good.
And this is my...
Well, now it's our vegetable plot.
The tomatoes, cucumber, aubergine and peppers grown here are dee-licious!
That's the town's leftie, Yücel Abi.
And this is the town's madman.
Find the truth.
Find the truth.
Find the truth.
Find the truth.
Find the truth, the truth...
Find the truth, son.
Find the truth.
If you can't find the truth, wait.
It'll find you.
Hey, what are you staring at?
Asshole!
Get out of here!
Piss off!
And here, this is our town.
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes.
Why do you always walk one step behind me?
Huh?
Are you ashamed of me?
Why would I be ashamed of you?
Then why do you always walk behind me?
That's the way I was brought up.
My grandmother always walked one step behind my grandfather.
My mother's the same with my father.
I mean, there's no other reason.
- There isn't?
- No.
Come here beside me.
From now on always walk beside me.
So we're side by side when we're walking.
OK?
Come on.
Let's go.
25 April
Two marriages and two children at the age of just 24.
Despite being so young she's not a happy person.
Emrah is on the streets with a baby less than six weeks old.
Who's going to help her?
I'm not a bad person.
But I...
No one's saying you're bad, Emrah.
But I don't want my family because they've been no support.
Who's going to take Emrah under their wing?
Now for a big surprise live on the program!
Thank you.
Our number is 0212320...
And Emrah's...
- Who is it?
- Me, Mehmet.
- Come on!
We're going.
- Where?
- To the vegetable plot?
- The vegetable plot?
Aha.
Come on!
Stop dawdling.
We need to be back before dark.
Bring along something to eat.
I'll be waiting on the street.
- What's this?
- A motorbike.
Where did you get it?
I borrowed it from Kemal for the day.
Come on!
Jump in the sidecar.
Let's go.
- In here?
- Jump in!
26 April
Good mor-ning, prin-cess of my soul.
To-day is clean-ing day at the school.
I have to leave ear-ly.
Sor-ry...
Meh-met.
P.S. It would be real-ly nice if you made bean stew to-night.
Good morning, princess of my soul...
Good morning, princess of my soul...
Princess of my soul...
- Take it easy there!
- Thanks, Abla.
Welcome.
Ooh!
I'm exhausted.
For the love of the dead make me a coffee, will you?
Of course, Abla.
I'll do that right away.
Look, look!
Right there!
Like I said, you have a long journey ahead.
But what kind of journey, I can't say.
Because there's nothing to tell me.
I'd say in two days, maybe three, you'll hear from someone you love.
But I'm not one to tell lies, you know.
It's bad news this.
Is it from the village or somewhere far away?
I don't know.
There's something covering it up.
You can't see what's underneath.
Goodness.
I don't suppose it's news from home, is it?
I've no idea.
But it could be.
I told you, there's a black cloud hiding what's underneath.
Hey!
There's an eye there!
Look, look!
It's an evil eye what's more!
He can't take his eyes off you!
See him staring at you like that?
Who could that be?
Well, Mehmet.
It's Mehmet!
He's standing on that gammy leg staring at you with those dark eyes.
Staring at you like an owl!
I left something on the stove.
I should go and check on it.
For the love of the dead, get me a glass of water, will you?
Drink poison!
Thanks.
It's really delicious.
Hope you enjoy it.
Berivan Abla came by today.
What did she want?
Nothing.
She just dropped by.
Good.
- I can't get to like Berivan Abla.
- Why not?
I don't know.
She's a bit strange.
Berivan Abla's a good person.
Ignore her... being so pushy.
She has ideas a bit above her station, that's all.
You know what?
You're a really good man.
Look what I bought you.
Thanks.
Open it up.
It's lovely.
Put it on.
27 April
- We got soaked!
- Yes.
Soaked.
Shall I bring you a towel?
No, there's one in the bedroom.
Are you going to bed?
Aha...
I think I will.
You?
Yes, me too.
I'm off to the vegetable plot early tomorrow morning.
The rain will have done some damage there.
OK.
OK.
Good night.
Sleep well.
You too.
Who on earth is that?
At this time of night...
Let me just go and see who it is.
Yes, my friend?
Why have you come here?
I'm talking to you, Ali.
Why have you come here?
I...
I've come to take you away.
Forgive me.
I...
I didn't want it to be like this.
It's all...
It's all my father's fault.
That promise of his was a disaster both for me, for you and for Hatice.
I got married.
But it's hopeless.
I...
I can't forget you.
I...
I can't be without you.
I can't live without you.
I've come to take you away.
Let's get away from here.
Huh?
Let's go.
I'm married.
Can't you see?
That's OK.
You can get divorced.
Let's go.
No!
I beg you.
Let's go.
Come on.
Get out of here!
And don't come back again.
I can't go.
Go, I said.
- I can't.
- Go!
- I can't!
- Get out of here, I said!
I can't!
Come on, she told you to go.
Are you deaf?
Get out of my way!
Out of my way!
Or I'll kill you.
I swear to God I will!
Get moving!
We're going.
I'm not coming.
Get moving!
Stay away or I'll shoot.
Stay away!
Stay away, I said!
Stay away!
Stay away, I said.
Stay away, I said.
Stay away, I said.
Stay away, I said.
Stay away, I said.
Stay away, I said.
Stay away, I said.
Did you love Ali?
Yes.
So what about Mehmet?
Did you love him?
Yes, I loved him too.
Anything else?
Anything else?
Do you have anything else to say?
EIGHT DAYS IN THE LIFE OF DÝLBER
For Zeynep
FRIDTHJOF FILM PRESENTS in collaboration with SCANBOX and TV2 DENMARK
Written by:
Mick Oegendahl and Rasmus Heide
Are you Theodor Joergensen?
- I assume you're Jesper Jansen?
- Jensen.
- Jesper Jensen.
- Right.
The girl over there is Lotte Markmann.
She's been here two years.
Excuse me?
Electronic, hazardous and combustible.
'Thank you' You're welcome.
Over there...
Dion!
A good guy but a little slow.
Be specific, or he won't get off his ass.
And you, my friend, are not the first of your kind to work at my site.
And believe you me...
I'll be watching you.
Follow me.
Take The Trash
ITS Infocom, Jesper Jensen.
Stenlose municipality, yes.
Lars is a fine consultant, but he doesn't have the technical know-how.
Hey, stop.
I think you got it backwards.
I pay my top-bracket taxes, whether I like it or not which implies that people like you pick up after people like me.
If you don't mind.
Thank you!
It's called refuse collection!
It may sound French, but it's Latin.
I'm back.
Sorry about that.
I look forward to doing business with you.
That's right, Jesper Jensen.
- This rubbish is jammed again.
- There, there.
Language, dear.
- When I...
- Yes.
Up and running again.
- I'll give it the once-over on Monday.
- You don't have to do that.
No, I don't.
You'll just owe me a little favour.
And you can start by taking these to accounting.
- Jesper...
- A deal with Stenlose municipality.
If you send them an invoice, I'll close the deal on Monday.
- But Stenlose is Lars' client.
- Elin, no one is anybody's client.
It's a free market.
- Did you lose weight?
- Perhaps.
I can tell.
You're becoming quite the desirable woman.
If fate hadn't put us a decade apart, we'd have a couple of kids by now.
See you at the Friday drink, Elin.
Lars speaking.
Hello, Fiona.
May I call you back?
Great.
Okay, bye.
- Fiona?
A new girl?
- Straight out of the factory.
- We're having some couples over.
- That sounds nice.
Your attention, please.
Folks...!
Yet again we've reached our goal of being the no. 1 IT company.
And as you know, our salesmen compete on contracts.
And...
I'm getting a little weary of always calling the same name.
We all know who it is:
Jesper Jensen!
Jesper, join me.
- Here you go, my boy.
- Thank you.
The rest of you should get in the game.
If I were him, I wouldn't be able to live with myself.
He has no moral reservations.
He couldn't care less.
I'm amazed that director Steiner doesn't see it.
If it maximized the numbers, he'd blow every stockholder.
So we're negotiating...
These social company gatherings are great.
So is your interest in the employees.
It enhances mutual respect.
After all, one should be able to live with oneself.
So, I wonder why anyone would say you blow the stockholders for profits.
Have a nice weekend.
Did you see that Globecom is looking for a key account manager?
No, I didn't.
It's on the internet.
I think I'll apply.
It's a dream position.
For you, obviously.
It's tough to be the eternal second.
Give me a break.
Listen, I'll drive my car home, and then take off so be a pal and remember to empty my mail box this time.
- Did you remember the Mascarpone?
- What?
Did you buy Mascarpone?
No, I didn't.
We agreed on Mascarpone for Italian dishes.
- Use cream.
- I've been waiting for 1 1/2 hour.
Jesper, would you mind waiting till they get here?
- Tom 's new girlfriend is called Tanja.
- I know.
It's not the one from last time.
This one's called Tanja.
I get it!
Hi!
Hello, Marianne.
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- What do you mean?
I told you that Tom's dad lost both legs to diabetes.
So, asking him if he wanted to play golf was just brilliant.
But it was funny when I told him that at least he knows his handicap.
Not a single person laughed.
- It' s no big deal.
- Jesper, I'm so tired of you.
Don't we have any cranberry juice?
I want a vodka cranberry.
Really tired!
Later, dear.
I'm going out for cranberry juice.
Excuse me.
You're not disabled, are you?
Hey.
Hello...
Hello?
Can you tell me what happened?
- No.
- You were in a traffic accident.
Okay...
I'll just draw a little blood.
Blood?
What for?
Without your license it just won't work.
I've spoken to a driving instructor, and he agreed to take me on and let me take the test as soon as possible.
Yes.
There's a job for you when you return, of course.
Maybe we could tell the others that I'm on leave.
We'll work something out.
Don't forget to hand in your key card.
Right.
I read the meter and I'll pay my share.
That's it then?
You can always call my dad's lawyer.
Hello, I'm Karen.
Jesper Jensen.
Executive key account manager.
Let's call it what it is, shall we?
Travelling salesman.
Right?
You were convicted pursuing to section 53 of the Road Traffic Act and have subsequently seen our counsellor.
She found you eligible for community service.
So, Monday at 7 you start work at a recycling station.
Let's call it what it is:
A dump site.
- We don 't call it that.
- Well, I do.
And no thank you.
Excuse me?
I say no thank you.
I won't be one of those blue men rearranging other people's crap.
Two things:
First of all, this is not a prize.
You've been convicted of DUI, and if you don't want community service there is an alternative called jail.
And I don't think you want that.
And secondly:
The 'blue men' you're referring to...
They're not blue they're orange.
And believe you me.
I'll be watching you.
Follow me.
Welcome.
I hope you'll feel at home here.
Don't worry, she's not hitting on you.
Lotte plays for the wrong team.
Handball, button rubbing and all that crap.
Okay, Doris.
What's your last name?
Doris!
Can you hear me?
Doris?
Jesus Christ, no rock'n roll...
I'm a doctor.
Emergency room...
- Scissors.
- Will she make it?
Step back.
Damn it.
1,2,3.
A,B,C.
7-9-13.
Damn it!
Damn it!
Come on!
Come one, live!
Live!
Can you hear me?
Stay back, I'm gonna use viral electro chargers...
I need 55 minimum volts.
Clear.
10 volt!
Give me 44/50 Boogieman!
It's no use.
We're losing her.
Come on, girl.
We're losing her.
Hello.
Got no heartbeat.
Work with me, Doris.
Last chance.
Work with me.
She's alive.
You're alive.
Lotte, Lotte...
Thank you, thank you.
Keep it up.
Excuse me.
Could you buy your own bottle?
Yes.
Dion is a jackass.
He loves beer and will end up as fat as his old man.
- He's got bigger tits than you.
- But mine don't sag as much.
Bloody good thing he has a chain guard on his bike.
Otherwise...
Hey, stop that.
Find an other tone, damn it!
For crying out loud, dad.
- I'm telling you for the last time!
- Yes.
Keep to the right, when it's an even number.
- And to the left, when it's uneven.
- Right.
It's not neuroscience, just remember that even numbers contain vowels.
One... two...
Would you turn on the water, please?
And FYI.
We have a no tolerance alcohol policy on the site.
It's too dangero...
What the hell is he doing?
Hey!
Take it easy.
Calm down, it's just a game.
- Racist pig.
- What?
- Shut you're ass.
- Cool it.
Shut up or die!
- What's going on?
- Yes, what's going on?
Time to hit the showers!
For me.
What the hell's with you?
Unbelievable!
Parking on a continuous white line!
No, that's a bad...
That's not a PVC pipe.
God damn it!
Hey!
Hey!
You there...
He's a little stressed out.
We may shut down.
There are two recycling stations, and the least efficient will be closed.
It's pure cost-benefit.
Yeah, but we need our jobs.
And it's a bitch to constantly be checked inside and out.
That doesn't look too healthy.
Yeah, drink Light instead.
Shit, during the thunderstorm, the amount of precipitation was 60 mm.
- No wonder it was so loud.
- That's got nothing to do with it!
'Got nothing...'
- The rain doesn't make it loud.
- Yes, it does!
- The rain?
- Can we agree that thunder is loud?
Yes, from electrical chargings between the clouds.
I'm gonna need you to repeat that.
Electricity and thermic heat.
Cold and hot air.
- Textbook stuff.
- Give me a break.
Cold and hot air colliding doesn't make loud noises.
The noise is from the cloud bursting, and the rain is the water falling out.
- That's why they call it cloud burst.
- No, it really isn't!
If you blow air into a paper bag and do like this...
It goes bang, and then take a good look at it.
- It burst, right?
- Definitely, Dion.
It would be great, if she had bought that.
'Bursting clouds', Jesus!
Any fool knows that the noise is from lightning striking the ground.
I hate this!
So you'll need to pass another driving test.
- Night classes?
- Yes.
I'm actually considering night classes, too.
10th grade?
No, more along the lines of...
Philosophy or photography.
I have tickets for Thai boxing, if you wanna join me.
It's like...
Strange how good they are considering their tiny Thai eyes.
Small cracks that only see straight ahead, so if you bend your knees...
Finally, a male student.
Women and clutches is a lousy combo right after lunch.
- This one girl is on her 54th lesson.
- Sounds expensive.
She has agreed to pay me with her goods.
I do a little rear ending.
- Did you remember sunglasses?
- No.
So, night driving is out, then.
- Hey, hey...
- Hi, Lars.
What's going on?
I return home, and hear that Dorte moved out.
I go to work, and you're on leave.
- Yes.
- Yes, what?
- I'm counting on your discretion.
- Sure.
I told Steiner the leave was for resting.
- I'm going into business for myself.
- Okay.
I'm sweeping the market, doing some analyses, and then we'll see.
If it doesn't work out, I can always return to the company.
If I get the Globecom position, I wonder what Steiner will do.
- Hell, yes...
- And Dorte?
- Dorte?
- Yes.
- I had to make a decision.
- How did she take it?
She was upset in the beginning, but...
- So, it's back on the market for you.
- Yeah, maybe.
You should join me on a date with Fiona and her friend.
Yes, sure.
But I gotta... go shower.
Can't you tell the time?
It's 7.20!
I realize you're not accustomed to dedicated goal oriented employees but certainly you'll concede to a certain flexibility.
Fancy word's that I don't understand, but I got the point.
- That's not my way.
- Okay.
Look up human resource management and the term 'flex hours'.
We have only one kind of flex hours:
Being on time!
- Get into your boiler suit ASAP!
- Okay, but...
Does that sign say 'knitting club'?
I don't think so!
Suit up, or I'll make a call, and then it's no more community service.
You'll do hard time with people who are a lot less friendly.
Are you going to the Green Concert?
That says it all, then.
Do you know what makes a dog sound like c cat?
No.
You deep-freeze it, take it out and cut it with a buzz saw:
Meow!
.
And how do you make a cat sound like a dog?
Drench it in petrol and light a match:
Woof!
Okay, that was new.
And, how do you make a cat...
What?
How do you make a cat sound like a chicken?
I don't know.
You deep-freeze it, take it out and hit it on the counter:
Gok-gok-gok.
And how do you make a worm...
- Volkswagen!
- What the hell?
You hit someone and say Volkswagen, when you see a beetle.
I'm sorry about the controversy this morning.
You have your rules, and I apologize.
All is forgiven.
May I leave early today?
- No, but you may sort out the rugs.
- Okay...
I know you have your ways around here.
But why don't you ask people to drop off linoleumin combustible?
It's an oil based material and will be incinerated anyway.
I'd call it Sisyphean labour.
Am I holding a knitting needle?
Am I doing this?
That's how it is and always has been.
How nice, we should do this more often.
I'm planning a garden party and I'd love to watch you two sip wine and show a little leg.
- When?
- I'll let you know.
Pass!
Did you apply to Globecom?
Yes, but Jesper is taking the big leap and starting on his own.
- I love a man with drive.
- I'm taking my clients with me.
- Of course, a client...
- May I help you?
- Hi!
- Dion?
- Hey, buddy!
- Hi.
- So, what's up.
- Cosy.
I'm here with the family.
Join us, if you want.
We have the White Beers that were on sale.
We were just about to...
- Don't hog the ball.
Hello.
- My dad.
Join us if you feel like it.
Sure.
- See you, Jesper.
- Absolutely.
Not.
- Who was that, Jesper?
- Old school mate.
What an unfortunate character.
School mates tend to think they're close to you.
Pass...
Super tackle!
Pick that up.
Right...
Compared to the other site, this is a mess.
Damn!
We're surrounded.
What the hell are we gonna do?
Listen to me, soldier.
Calm down.
Pull yourself together.
- Listen.
I'll have you covered.
Okay?
- Okay.
I'm staying here, and you try and force through enemy lines.
- Yeah!
- And I'll cover you, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
But who's gonna cover you?
- You're gonna die!
- So be it.
Go, kid.
Go!
How nice that your employees get to play war.
When they're not on a break, that is.
This is moronic.
The only efficient thing here is the wireless.
Now that you mention efficiency...
I'm gonna stop dumping the linoleum over there.
- It's oil based...
- I know.
It might as well go straight into combustible.
No point in sorting it before incineration.
That sounds too smart for your brain.
The routine here is ridiculous!
- Theodor?
- Did I ask you to speak?
- I'm not talking to you.
- Don't talk unless spoken to, kid.
- You arrogant son of a bitch.
- Outside!
Right now.
It's one phone call away, Jesper!
One phone call.
What an idiot!
And as I've told you many times, you need to tidy up all the metals.
It's a huge mess.
And it's not up for debate!
Right, uh...
I know you're pissed off about Varberg, but he knows your story.
Whether the call to your parole officer comes from him or me doesn't matter.
And he can be so obnoxious, as you saw, so...
I thought it a good idea for you to cool off a little.
Right.
See you tomorrow.
Your attention, please.
We have a joint decision to make about the summer party.
Do we spend all the coffee money or save some for next time?
- There is no next time.
- Shut up, Dion!
We don't know that, Dion!
Thank you, Lotte.
So, should we spend it all?
Yes, and let's invite our better halves.
- Very good, Dion.
- Then I get to see Lotte's girlfriend.
So, you wanna see her?
Yeah, I m dying to see what a steam roller like that looks like.
Lesbians can be feminine too, right Jesper?
People insecure about their sexual inclinations tend to be homophobic.
I've never been homo-anything!
Can we stay on track for a minute?
Who's in favour?
- Two.
And you, Jesper?
- I abstain.
- What does that mean?
- He won't vote.
Why not?
- I'm busy that day.
- We didn't set a date yet.
- I think I'll be busy.
- Then, I want his vote.
It doesn't work that way, Dion.
- We spend all of it and with partners.
- Yes.
Yes!
Party time.
Inclination...
Give me a break.
I'm considering art history.
Sounds exciting.
The artist expressing his emotions through copperprint, lithography, weaving and other means of expression.
Like, if I see lithography from the Lindenberg Collection -
- I can't look at it without completely breaking apart inside.
- The melancholia...
- What?
You wouldn't understand.
Long word.
Actually, I do.
I went to school with a girl who suffered from melancholia.
Everyday after lunch she threw up.
It can kill you, you know, so maybe you shouldn't make fun of it.
Not everybody's born with a silver spoon in their bed of roses, you know.
- Please.
- Hi.
Cheers.
Hello.
Did you have trouble finding it?
You're late as hell.
- Funny!
- Grab a glass.
- From the shoulder blade...
- And all the way down.
There are more meetings and paperwork.
- And Elin brewed a lot of coffee.
- Yes.
Alexandra, this is Steiner.
And Elin.
Hello.
- Jesper, whom you already know.
- Hi.
- How's your new company doing?
- New company?
- What's she talking about.
- Nothing, Steiner.
Come on!
It's quite clever.
Jesper is starting a business with clients from his old work place.
Alexandra, there's a drink with your name on it at the bar.
- Please explain.
- She misunderstood.
Of course, I'm not taking any clients.
I'm just restructuring the client base according to regional criteria.
That's true.
I recently moved Stenlose municipality to Jesper's file.
- That's all there is to it.
- Be quiet, Elin.
- A misunderstanding...
- Hang on, I need to understand this.
Stenlose is my client.
Are you stealing my clients?
No, I'm not stealing your clients!
Elin, It's not...
Are you starting a company?
Elin.
- Are you starting a company?
- Steiner...
Is that a yes or a no?
You make me lie about your DUI, and then bloody stab me in the back.
You're finished at ITS Infocom, and you can understand why, can't you?
Who the hell do you think you are?
I thought we were friends!
- Lars, wait...
- You really stink.
Good bye.
I am singing a song about me about me
The cutest and best little boy- mouse
And the world it revolves around me around me and that just makes me...
happy
- Good morning.
Theodore sent me.
- I came along just in case.
Are you okay?
No.
My life collapsed yesterday.
What now?
Did you always like girls?
Yes.
How did your parents react?
My dad didn't say much.
We don't talk.
- He won't accept it.
- And your mother?
My mother is very ill.
She has...
Volkswagen!
- What the hell are you doing, Dion?
- It was a beetle!
You moron!
- Relax.
Nothing happened.
- Pull over.
I know you're almost done here and will return to your good job...
I'm sorry I didn't show this morning.
- Yesterday, I...
- Fine, Jesper.
It's ridiculous to throw you out at this late date.
But next time, you're out.
And I mean that.
I expect you to respect us, as we respect you.
- Be on time and make an effort.
- Yes.
My life didn't turn out exactly as I had expected.
That's just how it is sometimes.
Trust me, I know.
Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it.
Okay.
- What did he say?
- Not much.
He was fair enough.
- So, you're staying.
- Yes.
I gotta take a shit.
- What did he say?
- Not much.
He gave me a warning.
I've gotten a few of those.
Did he yell and curse?
No.
That 's the worst.
It makes it hard to read him.
If he's shouting, you know what he'll do.
- I remember one time...
- We should get started.
Right... yes.
Hey, Lotte!
What's up, bitch?
Why do you homos take so long?
Confused about no. 1 and 2?
Can't tell one from the other?
Oops...
Or hi...
- Where do blinds go?
- Combustible, if it's wood.
Metals, if it's aluminium.
Hi.
- Hi, and thank you.
- You're welcome.
You have a lot of waste.
- Oh, you noticed?
- We notice these things.
- What people throw out.
- Okay.
- So what did she throw out lately?
- That woman?
- I'll have to pass on that.
- So, it's just me.
No, honestly.
It's just that I've seen you and your boyfriend around here.
He's just a friend who's helping me clear out the basement.
- That should keep you up to date.
- Let me get that for you.
Is it just me, or do you smell of liqueur?
- I got a little drunk yesterday.
- On a Monday?
I'm quite the rebel.
I sometimes eat my Saturday candy on Friday.
I'm Jesper.
If you ever need a hand, just ask for the guy in the orange boiler suit.
Yes, okay.
We have a situation.
Use code 4.
Come in Orson.
Description:
Tall dwarf in leather jacket and the Malaysian connection.
Operation Hot Chicks is temporarily aborted.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Moving to 20-0-10.
Orson, code 4.
I see you.
If you watch the road, I'll look out for the ladies.
Both hands on the wheel positioned 10 to 2.
I've always been crazy about women, and they've always had a thing for me.
I don't know why.
But I have a pretty good idea.
Just straight through the intersection.
In Poland you get a hooker for 150 zloty, and you can crap on her.
- No!
- Yes, yes.
It's not really a turn-on for me, but they charge you to use the toilet so you may as well kill two birds with one stone.
Damn, look at that one.
Damn!
- Only a lazy bastard wouldn't...
- Please shut up.
I don't care for your feeble-minded crap.
I see.
Don't forget that I can postpone your test just like that.
- Volkswagen!
- What the hell was that?
Every time you see a beetle, you may hit someone.
Really?
Okay, that's actually a fun idea.
Seeking :
Key Account Manager
She probably shits with the door open and pulls out spikes with her pussy.
Jesper!
Yeah!
Uh... nice job in the dirt and concrete section.
I'll start Lotte on...
the clothes container.
Theodor Joergensen, hello.
What?
But I'm at work.
But...
I'll come and get him, but it's damn...
Get it out of the way, dammit, before it takes root.
And then go and...
Jesper, look after things.
I have to pick up my son.
- Sure.
- I'll be right back.
Damn it!
I didn't know he had a son.
- So, Lotte's girlfriend...
- Ah, put a sock in it, Dion.
Entschuldigen Sie.
Wo sollen diese Klamotten hin?
What?
Alte Klamotten.
Diese Klamotten mochten wir abgeben.
- Alte Klamotten!
- Hallo.
Hallo, Alte Klamotten.
Hallo, hallo.
Wolfsburg, Hansa Rostock.
Borussia Monchengladbach!
You hide behind your language.
Leverkusen, Hertha Berlin.
This will be your demise.
Durch, fur, gegen ohne, wieder, um.
Kannst du nicht Akkusativ dann bist du wirklich dum.
Do you need help, Lotte?
Konnen Sie uns vielleicht hilfen?
- Ja, klar.
Gebt mal her.
- Danke.
- Bitte, tschuss.
- Tschuss.
- Tschuss?
- Yes.
I could take a German class.
Or Japanese.
Excuse me?
I don't know where this goes.
You must sort that yourself.
I pay top-bracket tax, which ought to cover your salary.
You paying top-bracket tax is completely irrelevant.
Everybody pays a nominal tax to public services such as this one.
- He's right.
- Aha.
Get going, okay?
Let's go in.
That's Lotte, Dion and Jesper.
Right.
This is my son, Karsten, and he'll be here for the rest of the week.
What, Dion?
Karsten will join us, because his workshop is closed due to sickness.
I've thrown a pair of Kansas on him, so that he can assist you, Jesper.
Hello, Jesper.
- Dion, carry on.
- With my break?
Shut up, Dion.
Lotte, you come with me.
Dion, get cracking.
Would you like to be her boyfriend?
- What?
- She looks fine.
She looks fine?
- I'll take her.
- You and me both.
Okay.
Then I'll go ask her out.
- We'll wait here.
- Yeah, we'll wait here.
- Hi.
- Hi.
There's this great restaurant in the park, do you know it?
Great food and a really nice place, where you can sit outside.
Perhaps you'd care to go there with me sometime?
You ask me out even though we're total strangers?
Yes.
Or maybe that was a bit too smart.
Or somewhat...
I'm sorry.
I'd love to.
Okay!
So, what do we do?
- I don't have any plans tonight.
- Me neither.
- It's a date, then?
- Yes.
Okay, see you.
- Jesper?
- Yes?
Shall we say at 7?
Yes, of course.
- See you then.
- See you.
So...
Karsten is doing great.
- Why wouldn't he?
- I don't know, he just is.
And that's strange because he's mentally challenged?
A...
- He's got a better head than most.
- Theodor!
That's not what I meant.
No.
Karsten just needs boundaries, and that's my responsibility.
I probably bring it to work sometimes, and appear a little rigid.
No one finds you uptight and rigid.
- Ah, shut up.
- Okay, maybe a little.
Why did you say uptight?
I didn't.
Did I?
- I'm sure I didn't.
- I don't think I'm uptight.
No!
No, I don't think I said...
I'd better get started on moving these fridges.
I mean, you've seen the boiler suits.
The colour alone is really something.
The first time I met Dion, he was telling these endless jokes.
That was a bit much, when I first came to the site.
You know...
But they're really nice people.
You've told me about you co-workers.
What should I know about you?
I was just dumped from a long-term relationship.
She was just...
Girls are a bit strange sometimes, you know...
Basically, she left because I treated her badly.
I was a real asshole.
You sure know how to sweet-talk a girl.
Well, I am a salesman.
You may be an asshole, but there's a really nice guy attached to it.
How poetic.
This is where I live.
Oh.
- I'd better be getting on home, then.
- I guess so.
Isn't it cold out there?
Yes.
Yeah?
I didn't make it.
You will live by your heart if you only give up thinking
Give it up, never stop and you feel everything
You will live by your heart if you only give up thinking
Give it up, never stop and you'll feel everything
No!
It's all wrong, Lotte.
- I'm right, and that's a fact.
- No, it isn't, Dion!
- GNP means:
Gross national product.
- Yes...
The product most exported, and that is farming!
- 'Gross' means...
- That is livestock, grain, barely...
- 'Gross' means all Danish production.
- Fur!
Don't debate him.
He's completely ignorant.
Thank you, Jesper!
Pardon the interruption, but what do I do with this old broom.
Stick her in a senior centre.
- I'm sorry, I don't understand.
- Just leave her.... uh it outside.
Thank you.
I know you're done now, but how about a round?
A round?
Like this.
And then you block here.
Who have we here?
Welcome!
- I thought drinking was banned.
- It's al most closing time.
We play charades.
Watch mama's magic.
This is a good one.
Tits.
- A man?
- Yes.
Anger, angry...
Do you need to take a dump?
- Theodor, damn it!
- Theodor!
Right!
Kissing!
Ass!
Theodor kisses ass on...
Varberg!
- Theodor kisses Varberg's ass!
- How hard was that?
- You're up, Jesper.
- Okay.
A man's dick is his sceptre.
- Carl
- Mar!
- More!
The woman should be spanked with the man's big dick.
Man has a big dick, and it is God.
She must worship his dick.
He has powder bags at the root.
It must be emptied by the woman at least once a day.
She must caress it and cuddle it.
She must obey!
She's a cheap slut!
After only one dinner, he's invited into her apartment.
She rolls over like a cheap bitch, and prepares to receive his dick.
He fucks the little bitch with his big hard dick.
He penetrates her and fucks her hard, the little slut.
He dick-slaps her in the face and gives her a...
Hi.
Don't ever call me again.
Sofie!
Sofie!
- I'm so sorry!
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm sorry, but I have to...
- God damn it!
Theodor!
Jesper!
Sofie!
- Do something!
- Jesper, do something!
Come on!
I'll definitely take legal action.
It's a Bertoni suit.
Theodor!
Ouch, damn it!
Did they find my computer?
They're searching.
You don't recall where you left it, do you?
I was scolded by a guy with a dangling dick!
I'm losing my focus!
I need my computer now, Theodor!
Yes.
Dion, more paper!
Go help them find the computer, for Christ's sake!
I found it.
Here you go.
Every single rule has been broken here.
- You have a mongolian on the loose.
- Hey!
He is not a Mongolian.
I don 't care what type of retard he is.
You all have shit for brains.
Remove that dick, please.
The municipality will be in touch.
Take off that dick.
So, Jesper, this is the last day before starting your new job...
I'm glad you decided to come to the party.
- Closing party.
- That hasn't been settled yet, Dion.
Anything can happen.
Okay, let's go.
Dion, come on.
Did you call Sofie?
- Yes, no... not yet.
- Oh?
- She said to never call her again.
- Women say stuff like that.
- Really?
- I think you should call her.
Good luck with your new job.
And I'll...
Thanks, Lotte.
So, Jesper, let's get started.
We actually decided on Lars from ITS Infocom, but your CV is impressive.
I expect great things and look forward to seeing your portfolio and every month the best salesmen gets a prize, so...
Happy hunting!
- Sofie speaking.
- Sofie?
It's Jesper.
Please, let me explain.
- You just walked out of there?
- Yes.
- So, you won't be a salesman?
- Sure, but not like that.
Someone sure is embracing the flex hours.
Relax, they're on their way.
I can't wait to see Lotte's girlfriend.
A lesbian isn't necessarily ugly or repulsive, sweetie.
- Here they come.
- Finally!
Hi!
Jesper.
Hi, Lotte.
Good to see you.
Hi, Karsten.
- Jane.
- Lotte.
I'm damned sorry I'm late.
Hey babe.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Jesper.
Hanna, hi.
They have great food here.
I know the chef, he's a queer.
I think one of the waiters is gay, so mind what you order.
- Why?
- The Creme brulee may be suspect.
- Let' s go inside and have a drink.
- Standing here won't get us drunk.
Sweetie, why don't we put a quota on the schnapps tonight.
Good evening, I'm Lennart, and I'll be serving you tonight.
Hey, hey.
Listen up.
Before I get too drunk, I have a few things to tell you.
- I have good news and bad.
- We're not shutting down!
The bad news is that we're shutting down.
Well, the writing was on the wall.
But the good news is...
Varberg has recommended us for jobs in the technical department.
- How the hell did that happen?
- I'll read you the recommendation.
Listen.
Regarding discontinuation of the recycling station.
As the municipal rationalization is based on cost-benefit analyses -
- I recommend that we, from a human resource point of view rehire the affected employees elsewhere in the municipality.
I'd never expect that of Varberg.
He recognizes a good team, when he sees one.
- Cheers!
- Absolutely.
- Cheers.
- Congratulations.
Hooray for us.
A strong team.
- Why didn't you call me sooner?
- You said to never call you again.
You must sense what I feel, not hear what I say.
- That can be difficult.
- I never said it was fair.
- But I liked you as a pageboy.
- What?
- With the dangling sock.
- How about an encore, then?
- This time without an audience.
- Ah, you girls and all your rules.
Yes, girls are a bit strange, right?
Stop!
The meteor is coming.
Fear not.
Lotte will save the world.
Houston, we have a problem.
This is gonna sting.
Yippee.
Jesper and Sofie now share a home.
Jesper is painting the nursery.
Lotte has seen a UFO twice.
The police, however, say that the tire tracks tell a different story.
- What the hell's with you?
- Are you talking to me?
Theodor took an anger management class.
The court later ruled that the teacher hit first.
Dion and Jane have had their second set of twins.
Dion is now sterilized.

Are you Theodor Joergensen?
- I assume you're Jesper Jansen?
- Jensen.
- Jesper Jensen.
- Right.
The girl over there is Lotte Markmann.
She's been here two years.
Excuse me?
Electronic, hazardous and combustible.
'Thank you' You're welcome.
Over there ...
Dion!
A good guy but a little slow.
Be specific, or he won't get off his ass.
And you, my friend, are not the first of your kind to work at my site.
And believe you me ...
I'll be watching you.
Follow me.
Take The Trash
ITS Infocom, Jesper Jensen.
Stenlose municipality, yes.
Lars is a fine consultant, but he doesn't have the technical know-how.
Hey, stop.
I think you got it backwards.
I pay my top-bracket taxes, whether I like it or not which implies that people like you pick up after people like me.
If you don't mind.
Thank you!
It's called refuse collection!
It may sound French, but it's Latin.
I'm back.
Sorry about that.
I look forward to doing business with you.
That's right, Jesper Jensen.
- This rubbish is jammed again.
- There, there.
Language, dear.
- When I ...
- Yes.
Up and running again.
- I'll give it the once-over on Monday.
- You don't have to do that.
No, I don't.
You'll just owe me a little favour.
And you can start by taking these to accounting.
- Jesper ...
- A deal with Stenlose municipality.
If you send them an invoice, I'll close the deal on Monday.
- But Stenlose is Lars' client.
- Elin, no one is anybody's client.
It's a free market.
- Did you lose weight?
- Perhaps.
I can tell.
You're becoming quite the desirable woman.
If fate hadn't put us a decade apart, we'd have a couple of kids by now.
See you at the Friday drink, Elin.
Lars speaking.
Hello, Fiona.
May I call you back?
Great.
Okay, bye.
- Fiona?
A new girl?
- Straight out of the factory.
- We're having some couples over.
- That sounds nice.
Your attention, please.
Folks ...!
Yet again we've reached our goal of being the no. 1 IT company.
And as you know, our salesmen compete on contracts.
And ...
I'm getting a little weary of always calling the same name.
We all know who it is:
Jesper Jensen!
Jesper, join me.
- Here you go, my boy.
- Thank you.
The rest of you should get in the game.
If I were him, I wouldn't be able to live with myself.
He has no moral reservations.
He couldn't care less.
I'm amazed that director Steiner doesn't see it.
If it maximized the numbers, he'd blow every stockholder.
So we're negotiating ...
These social company gatherings are great.
So is your interest in the employees.
It enhances mutual respect.
After all, one should be able to live with oneself.
So, I wonder why anyone would say you blow the stockholders for profits.
Have a nice weekend.
Did you see that Globecom is looking for a key account manager?
No, I didn't.
It's on the internet.
I think I'll apply.
It's a dream position.
For you, obviously.
It's tough to be the eternal second.
Give me a break.
Listen, I'll drive my car home, and then take off so be a pal and remember to empty my mail box this time.
- Did you remember the Mascarpone?
- What?
Did you buy Mascarpone?
No, I didn't.
We agreed on Mascarpone for Italian dishes.
- Use cream.
- I've been waiting for 1 1/2 hour.
Jesper, would you mind waiting till they get here?
- Tom's new girlfriend is called Tanja.
- I know.
It's not the one from last time.
This one's called Tanja.
I get it!
Hi!
Hello, Marianne.
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- What do you mean?
I told you that Tom's dad lost both legs to diabetes.
So, asking him if he wanted to play golf was just brilliant.
But it was funny when I told him that at least he knows his handicap.
Not a single person laughed.
- It's no big deal.
- Jesper, I'm so tired of you.
Don't we have any cranberry juice?
I want a vodka cranberry.
Really tired!
Later, dear.
I'm going out for cranberry juice.
Excuse me.
You're not disabled, are you?
Hey.
Hello ...
Hello?
Can you tell me what happened?
- No.
- You were in a traffic accident.
Okay ...
I'll just draw a little blood.
Blood?
What for?
.
Without your license it just won't work.
I've spoken to a driving instructor, and he agreed to take me on and let me take the test as soon as possible.
Yes.
There's a job for you when you return, of course.
Maybe we could tell the others that I'm on leave.
We'll work something out.
Don't forget to hand in your key card.
Right.
I read the meter and I'll pay my share.
That's it then?
You can always call my dad's lawyer.
Hello, I'm Karen.
Jesper Jensen.
Executive key account manager.
Let's call it what it is, shall we?
Travelling salesman.
Right?
You were convicted pursuing to section 53 of the Road Traffic Act and have subsequently seen our counsellor.
She found you eligible for community service.
So, Monday at 7 you start work at a recycling station.
Let's call it what it is:
A dump site.
- We don't call it that.
- Well, I do.
And no thank you.
Excuse me?
I say no thank you.
I won't be one of those blue men rearranging other people's crap.
Two things:
First of all, this is not a prize.
You've been convicted of DUI, and if you don't want community service there is an alternative called jail.
And I don't think you want that.
And secondly:
The 'blue men' you're referring to ...
They're not blue they're orange.
And believe you me.
I'll be watching you.
Follow me.
Welcome.
I hope you'll feel at home here.
Don't worry, she's not hitting on you.
Lotte plays for the wrong team.
Handball, button rubbing and all that crap.
Okay, Doris.
What's your last name?
Doris!
Can you hear me?
Doris?
Jesus Christ, no rock'n roll ...
I'm a doctor.
Emergency room ...
- Scissors.
- Will she make it?
Step back.
Damn it.
1, 2, 3.
A, B, C.
7-9-13.
Damn it!
Damn it!
Come on!
Come one, live!
Live!
Can you hear me?
Stay back, I'm gonna use viral electro chargers ...
I need 55 minimum volts.
Clear.
10 volt!
Give me 44/50 Boogieman!
It's no use.
We're losing her.
Come on, girl.
We're losing her.
Hello.
Got no heartbeat.
Work with me, Doris.
Last chance.
Work with me.
She's alive.
You're alive.
Lotte, Lotte ...
Thank you, thank you.
Keep it up.
Excuse me.
Could you buy your own bottle?
Yes.
Dion is a jackass.
He loves beer and will end up as fat as his old man.
- He's got bigger tits than you.
- But mine don't sag as much.
Bloody good thing he has a chain guard on his bike.
Otherwise ...
Hey, stop that.
Find another tone, damn it!
For crying out loud, dad.
- I'm telling you for the last time!
- Yes.
Keep to the right, when it's an even number.
- And to the left, when it's uneven.
- Right.
It's not neuroscience, just remember that even numbers contain vowels.
One ... two ...
Would you turn on the water, please?
And FYI.
We have a no tolerance alcohol policy on the site.
It's too dangero...
What the hell is he doing?
Hey!
Take it easy.
Calm down, it's just a game.
- Racist pig.
- What?
- Shut you're ass.
- Cool it.
Shut up or die!
- What's going on?
- Yes, what's going on?
Time to hit the showers!
For me.
What the hell's with you?
Unbelievable!
Parking on a continuous white line!
No, that's a bad ...
That's not a PVC pipe.
God damn it!
Hey!
Hey!
You there ...
He's a little stressed out.
We may shut down.
There are two recycling stations, and the least efficient will be closed.
It's pure cost-benefit.
Yeah, but we need our jobs.
And it's a bitch to constantly be checked inside and out.
That doesn't look too healthy.
Yeah, drink Light instead.
Shit, during the thunder storm, the amount of precipitation was 60 mm.
- No wonder it was so loud.
- That's got nothing to do with it!
'Got nothing ...'
- The rain doesn't make it loud.
- Yes, it does!
- The rain?
- Can we agree that thunder is loud?
Yes, from electrical chargings between the clouds.
I'm gonna need you to repeat that.
Electricity and thermic heat.
Cold and hot air.
- Textbook stuff.
- Give me a break.
Cold and hot air colliding doesn't make loud noises.
The noise is from the cloud bursting, and the rain is the water falling out.
- That's why they call it cloud burst.
- No, it really isn't!
If you blow air into a paper bag and do like this ...
It goes bang, and then take a good look at it.
- It burst, right?
- Definitely, Dion.
It would be great, if she had bought that.
'Bursting clouds', Jesus!
Any fool knows that the noise is from lightning striking the ground.
I hate this!
So you'll need to pass another driving test.
- Night classes?
- Yes.
I'm actually considering night classes, too.
10th grade?
No, more along the lines of ...
Philosophy or photography.
I have tickets for Thai boxing, if you wanna join me.
It's like ...
Strange how good they are considering their tiny Thai eyes.
Small cracks that only see straight ahead, so if you bend your knees ...
Finally, a male student.
Women and clutches is a lousy combo right after lunch.
- This one girl is on her 54th lesson.
- Sounds expensive.
She has agreed to pay me with her goods.
I do a little rear ending.
- Did you remember sunglasses?
- No.
So, night driving is out, then.
- Hey, hey ...
- Hi, Lars.
What's going on?
I return home, and hear that Dorte moved out.
I go to work, and you're on leave.
- Yes.
- Yes, what?
- I'm counting on your discretion.
- Sure.
I told Steiner the leave was for resting.
- I'm going into business for myself.
- Okay.
I'm sweeping the market, doing some analyses, and then we'll see.
If it doesn't work out, I can always return to the company.
If I get the Globecom position, I wonder what Steiner will do.
- Hell, yes ...
- And Dorte?
- Dorte?
- Yes.
- I had to make a decision.
- How did she take it?
She was upset in the beginning, but ...
- So, it's back on the market for you.
- Yeah, maybe.
You should join me on a date with Fiona and her friend.
Yes, sure.
But I gotta ... go shower.
Can't you tell the time?
It's 7.20!
I realize you're not accustomed to dedicated goal oriented employees but certainly you'll concede to a certain flexibility.
Fancy word's that I don't understand, but I got the point.
- That's not my way.
- Okay.
Look up human resource management and the term 'flex hours'.
We have only one kind of flex hours:
Being on time!
- Get into your boiler suit ASAP!
- Okay, but ...
Does that sign say 'knitting club'?
I don't think so!
Suit up, or I'll make a call, and then it's no more community service.
You'll do hard time with people who are a lot less friendly.
Are you going to the Green Concert?
That says it all, then.
Do you know what makes a dog sound like a cat?
No.
You deep-freeze it, take it out and cut it with a buzz saw:
Meow!
And how do you make a cat sound like a dog?
Drench it in petrol and light a match:
Woof!
Okay, that was new.
And, how do you make a cat ...
What?
How do you make a cat sound like a chicken?
I don't know.
You deep-freeze it, take it out and hit it on the counter:
Gok-gok-gok.
And how do you make a worm ...
- Volkswagen!
- What the hell?
You hit someone and say Volkswagen, when you see a beetle.
I'm sorry about the controversy this morning.
You have your rules, and I apologize.
All's forgiven.
May I leave early today?
.
- No, but you may sort out the rugs.
- Okay ...
I know you have your ways around here.
But why don't you ask people to drop off linoleum in combustible?
It's an oil based material and will be incinerated anyway.
I'd call it Sisyphean labour.
Am I holding a knitting needle?
Am I doing this?
That's how it is and always has been.
How nice, we should do this more often.
I'm planning a garden party and I'd love to watch you two sip wine and show a little leg.
- When?
- I'll let you know.
Pass!
Did you apply to Globecom?
Yes, but Jesper is taking the big leap and starting on his own.
- I love a man with drive.
- I'm taking my clients with me.
- Of course, a client ...
- May I help you?
- Hi!
- Dion?
- Hey, buddy!
- Hi.
- So, what's up.
- Cosy.
I'm here with the family.
Join us, if you want.
We have the White Beers that were on sale.
We were just about to ...
- Don't hog the ball.
Hello.
- My dad.
Join us if you feel like it.
Sure.
- See you, Jesper.
- Absolutely.
Not.
- Who was that, Jesper?
.
- Old school mate.
What an unfortunate character.
School mates tend to think they're close to you.
Pass ...
Super tackle!
Pick that up.
Right ...
Compared to the other site, this is a mess.
Damn!
We're surrounded.
What the hell are we gonna do?
Listen to me, soldier.
Calm down.
Pull yourself together.
- Listen.
I'll have you covered.
Okay?
- Okay.
I'm staying here, and you try and force through enemy lines.
- Yeah!
- And I'll cover you, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
But who's gonna cover you?
- You're gonna die!
- So be it.
Go, kid.
Go!
How nice that your employees get to play war.
When they're not on a break, that is.
This is moronic.
The only efficient thing here is the wireless.
Now that you mention efficiency ...
I'm gonna stop dumping the linoleum over there.
- It's oil based ...
- I know.
It might as well go straight into combustible.
No point in sorting it before incineration.
That sounds too smart for your brain.
The routine here is ridiculous!
- Theodor?
.
- Did I ask you to speak?
- I'm not talking to you.
- Don't talk unless spoken to, kid.
- You arrogant son of a bitch.
- Outside!
Right now.
It's one phone call away, Jesper!
One phone call.
What an idiot!
And as I've told you many times, you need to tidy up all the metals.
It's a huge mess.
And It's not up for debate!
Right, uh ...
I know you're pissed off about Varberg, but he knows your story.
Whether the call to your parole officer comes from him or me doesn't matter.
And he can be so obnoxious, as you saw, so ...
I thought it a good idea for you to cool off a little.
Right.
See you tomorrow.
Your attention, please.
We have a joint decision to make about the summer party.
Do we spend all the coffee money or save some for next time?
- There is no next time.
- Shut up, Dion!
We don't know that, Dion!
Thank you, Lotte.
So, should we spend it all?
Yes, and let's invite our better halves.
- Very good, Dion.
- Then I get to see Lotte's girlfriend.
So, you wanna see her?
Yeah, I'm dying to see what a steam roller like that looks like.
Lesbians can be feminine too, right Jesper?
.
People insecure about their sexual inclinations tend to be homophobic.
I've never been homo-anything!
Can we stay on track for a minute?
Who's in favour?
.
- Two.
And you, Jesper?
- I abstain.
- What does that mean?
- He won't vote.
Why not?
- I'm busy that day.
- We didn't set a date yet.
- I think I'll be busy.
- Then, I want his vote.
It doesn't work that way, Dion.
- We spend all of it and with partners.
- Yes.
Yes!
Party time.
Inclination ...
Give me a break.
I'm considering art history.
Sounds exciting.
The artist expressing his emotions through copperprint, lithography, weaving and other means of expression.
Like, if I see lithography from the Lindenberg Collection -
- I can't look at it without completely breaking apart inside.
- The melancholia ...
- What?
You wouldn't understand.
Long word.
Actually, I do.
I went to school with a girl who suffered from melancholia.
Everyday after lunch she threw up.
It can kill you, you know, so maybe you shouldn't make fun of it.
Not everybody's born with a silver spoon in their bed of roses, you know.
- Please.
- Hi.
Cheers.
Hello.
Did you have trouble finding it?
.
You're late as hell.
- Funny!
- Grab a glass.
- From the shoulder blade ...
- And all the way down.
There are more meetings and paperwork.
- And Elin brewed a lot of coffee.
- Yes.
Alexandra, this is Steiner.
And Elin.
Hello.
- Jesper, whom you already know.
- Hi.
- How's your new company doing?
- New company?
.
- What's she talking about.
- Nothing, Steiner.
Come on!
It's quite clever.
Jesper is starting a business with clients from his old work place.
Alexandra, there's a drink with your name on it at the bar.
- Please explain.
- She misunderstood.
Of course, I'm not taking any clients.
I'm just restructuring the client base according to regional criteria.
That's true.
I recently moved Stenlose municipality to Jesper's file.
- That's all there is to it.
- Be quiet, Elin.
- A misunderstanding ...
- Hang on, I need to understand this.
Stenlose is my client.
Are you stealing my clients?
No, I'm not stealing your clients!
Elin, It's not ...
Are you starting a company?
Elin.
- Are you starting a company?
- Steiner ...
Is that a yes or a no?
You make me lie about your DUI, and then bloody stab me in the back.
You're finished at ITS Infocom, and you can understand why, can't you?
Who the hell do you think you are?
I thought we were friends!
- Lars, wait ...
- You really stink.
Goodbye.
I am singing a song about me about me
The cutest and best little boy-mouse
And the world it revolves around me around me and that just makes me ...
happy
- Good morning.
Theodore sent me.
- I came along just in case.
Are you okay?
No.
My life collapsed yesterday.
What now?
Did you always like girls?
Yes.
How did your parents react?
My dad didn't say much.
We don't talk.
- He won't accept it.
- And your mother?
.
My mother is very ill.
She has ...
Volkswagen!
- What the hell are you doing, Dion?
- It was a beetle!
You moron!
- Relax.
Nothing happened.
- Pull over.
I know you're almost done here and will return to your good job ...
I'm sorry I didn't show this morning.
- Yesterday, I ...
- Fine, Jesper.
It's ridiculous to throw you out at this late date.
But next time, you're out.
And I mean that.
I expect you to respect us, as we respect you.
- Be on time and make an effort.
- Yes.
My life didn't turn out exactly as I had expected.
That's just how it is sometimes.
Trust me, I know.
Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it.
Okay.
- What did he say?
- Not much.
He was fair enough.
- So, you're staying.
- Yes.
I gotta take a shit.
- What did he say?
- Not much.
He gave me a warning.
I've gotten a few of those.
Did he yell and curse?
No.
That's the worst.
It makes it hard to read him.
If he's shouting, you know what he'll do.
- I remember one time ...
- We should get started.
Right ... yes.
Hey, Lotte!
What's up, bitch?
Why do you homos take so long?
Confused about no. 1 and 2?
Can't tell one from the other?
.
Oops ...
Or hi ...
- Where do blinds go?
- Combustible, if it's wood.
Metals, if it's aluminium.
Hi.
- Hi, and thank you.
- You're welcome.
You have a lot of waste.
- Oh, you noticed?
- We notice these things.
- What people throw out.
- Okay.
- So what did she throw out lately?
.
- That woman?
- I'll have to pass on that.
- So, it's just me.
No, honestly.
It's just that I've seen you and your boyfriend around here.
He's just a friend who's helping me clear out the basement.
- That should keep you up to date.
- Let me get that for you.
Is it just me, or do you smell of liqueur?
- I got a little drunk yesterday.
- On a Monday?
I'm quite the rebel.
I sometimes eat my Saturday candy on Friday.
I'm Jesper.
If you ever need a hand, just ask for the guy in the orange boiler suit.
Yes, okay.
We have a situation.
Use code 4.
Come in Orson.
Description:
Tall dwarf in leather jacket and the Malaysian connection.
Operation Hot Chicks is temporarily aborted.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Moving to 20-0-10.
Orson, code 4.
I see you.
If you watch the road, I'll look out for the ladies.
Both hands on the wheel positioned 10 to 2.
I've always been crazy about women, and they've always had a thing for me.
I don't know why.
But I have a pretty good idea.
Just straight through the intersection.
In Poland you get a hooker for 150 zloty, and you can crap on her.
- No!
- Yes, yes.
It's not really a turn-on for me, but they charge you to use the toilet so you may as well kill two birds with one stone.
Damn, look at that one.
Damn!
- Only a lazy bastard wouldn't ...
- Please shut up.
I don't care for your feeble-minded crap.
I see.
Don't forget that I can postpone your test just like that.
- Volkswagen!
- What the hell was that?
Every time you see a beetle, you may hit someone.
Really?
Okay, that's actually a fun idea.
Seeking:
Key Account Manager
She probably shits with the door open and pulls out spikes with her pussy.
Jesper!
Yeah!
Uh ... nice job in the dirt and concrete section.
I'll start Lotte on ...
the clothes container.
Theodor Joergensen, hello.
What?
But I'm at work.
But ...
I'll come and get him, but it's damn ...
Get it out of the way, dammit, before it takes root.
And then go and ...
Jesper, look after things.
I have to pick up my son.
- Sure.
- I'll be right back.
Damn it!
I didn't know he had a son.
- So, Lotte's girlfriend ...
- Ah, put a sock in it, Dion.
Entschuldigen Sie.
Wo sollen diese Klamotten hin?
What?
Alte Klamotten.
Diese Klamotten möchten wir abgeben.
- Alte Klamotten!
- Hallo.
Hallo, Alte Klamotten.
Hallo, hallo.
Wolfsburg, Hansa Rostock.
Borussia Mönchengladbach!
You hide behind your language.
Leverkusen, Hertha Berlin.
This will be your demise.
Durch, für, gegen ohne, wieder, um.
Kännst du nicht Akkusativ dann bist du wirklich dum.
Do you need help, Lotte?
Können Sie uns vielleicht hilfen?
- Ja, klar.
Gebt mal her.
- Danke.
- Bitte, tschüss.
- Tschüss.
- Tschüss?
- Yes.
I could take a German class.
Or Japanese.
Excuse me?
I don't know where this goes.
You must sort that yourself.
I pay top-bracket tax, which ought to cover your salary.
You paying top-bracket tax is completely irrelevant.
Everybody pays a nominal tax to public services such as this one.
- He's right.
- Aha.
Get going, okay?
.
Let's go in.
That's Lotte, Dion and Jesper.
Right.
This is my son, Karsten, and he'll be here for the rest of the week.
What, Dion?
Karsten will join us, because his workshop is closed due to sickness.
I've thrown a pair of Kansas on him, so that he can assist you, Jesper.
Hello, Jesper.
- Dion, carry on.
- With my break?
Shut up, Dion.
Lotte, you come with me.
Dion, get cracking.
Would you like to be her boyfriend?
- What?
- She looks fine.
She looks fine?
- I'll take her.
- You and me both.
Okay.
Then I'll go ask her out.
- We'll wait here.
- Yeah, we'll wait here.
- Hi.
- Hi.
There's this great restaurant in the park, do you know it?
Great food and a really nice place, where you can sit outside.
Perhaps you'd care to go there with me sometime?
You ask me out even though we're total strangers?
Yes.
Or maybe that was a bit too smart.
Or somewhat ...
I'm sorry.
I'd love to.
Okay!
So, what do we do?
- I don't have any plans tonight.
- Me neither.
- It's a date, then?
- Yes.
Okay, see you.
- Jesper?
.
- Yes?
Shall we say at 7?
Yes, of course.
- See you then.
- See you.
So ...
Karsten is doing great.
- Why wouldn't he?
- I don't know, he just is.
And that's strange because he's mentally challenged?
A ...
- He's got a better head than most.
- Theodor!
That's not what I meant.
No.
Karsten just needs boundaries, and that's my responsibility.
I probably bring it to work sometimes, and appear a little rigid.
No one finds you uptight and rigid.
- Ah, shut up.
- Okay, maybe a little.
Why did you say uptight?
.
I didn't.
Did I?
- I'm sure I didn't.
- I don't think I'm uptight.
No!
No, I don't think I said ...
I'd better get started on moving these fridges.
I mean, you've seen the boiler suits.
The colour alone is really something.
The first time I met Dion, he was telling these endless jokes.
That was a bit much, when I first came to the site.
You know ...
But they're really nice people.
You've told me about you co-workers.
What should I know about you?
I was just dumped from a long-term relationship.
She was just ...
Girls are a bit strange sometimes, you know ...
Basically, she left because I treated her badly.
I was a real asshole.
You sure know how to sweet-talk a girl.
Well, I am a salesman.
You may be an asshole, but there's a really nice guy attached to it.
How poetic.
This is where I live.
Oh.
- I'd better be getting on home, then.
- I guess so.
Isn't it cold out there?
Yes.
Yeah?
I didn't make it.
You will live by your heart if you only give up thinking
Give it up, never stop and you feel everything
You will live by your heart if you only give up thinking
Give it up, never stop and you'll feel everything
No!
It's all wrong, Lotte.
- I'm right, and that's a fact.
- No, it isn't, Dion!
- GNP means:
Gross national product.
- Yes ...
The product most exported, and that is farming!
- 'Gross' means ...
- That is livestock, grain, barely ...
- 'Gross' means all Danish production.
- Fur!
Don't debate him.
He's completely ignorant.
Thank you, Jesper!
Pardon the interruption, but what do I do with this old broom.
Stick her in a senior centre.
- I'm sorry, I don't understand.
- Just leave her .... uh it outside.
Thank you.
I know you're done now, but how about a round?
A round?
Like this.
And then you block here.
Who have we here?
Welcome!
- I thought drinking was banned.
- It's almost closing time.
We play charades.
Watch mama's magic.
This is a good one.
Tits.
- A man?
- Yes.
Anger, angry ...
Do you need to take a dump?
- Theodor, damn it!
- Theodor!
Right!
Kissing!
Ass!
Theodor kisses ass on ...
Varberg!
- Theodor kisses Varberg's ass!
- How hard was that?
- You're up, Jesper.
- Okay.
A man's dick is his sceptre.
- Carl-Mar!
- More!
The woman should be spanked with the man's big dick.
Man has a big dick, and it is God.
She must worship his dick.
He has powder bags at the root.
It must be emptied by the woman at least once a day.
She must caress it and cuddle it.
She must obey!
She's a cheap slut!
After only one dinner, he's invited into her apartment.
She rolls over like a cheap bitch, and prepares to receive his dick.
He fucks the little bitch with his big hard dick.
He penetrates her and fucks her hard, the little slut.
He dick-slaps her in the face and gives her a ...
Hi.
Don't ever call me again.
Sofie!
Sofie!
- I'm so sorry!
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm sorry, but I have to ...
- God damn it!
Theodor!
Jesper!
Sofie!
- Do something!
- Jesper, do something!
Come on!
I'll definitely take legal action.
It's a Bertoni suit.
Theodor!
Ouch, damn it!
Did they find my computer?
They're searching.
You don't recall where you left it, do you?
I was scolded by a guy with a dangling dick!
I'm losing my focus!
I need my computer now, Theodor!
Yes.
Dion, more paper!
Go help them find the computer, for Christ's sake!
I found it.
Here you go.
Every single rule has been broken here.
- You have a mongolian on the loose.
- Hey!
He is not a Mongolian.
I don't care what type of retard he is.
You all have shit for brains.
Remove that dick, please.
The municipality will be in touch.
Take off that dick.
So, Jesper, this is the last day before starting your new job ...
I'm glad you decided to come to the party.
- Closing party.
- That hasn't been settled yet, Dion.
Anything can happen.
Okay, let's go.
Dion, come on.
Did you call Sofie?
- Yes, no ... not yet.
- Oh?
- She said to never call her again.
- Women say stuff like that.
- Really?
.
- I think you should call her.
Good luck with your new job.
And I'll ...
Thanks, Lotte.
So, Jesper, let's get started.
We actually decided on Lars from ITS Infocom, but your CV is impressive.
I expect great things and look forward to seeing your portfolio and every month the best salesmen gets a prize, so ...
Happy hunting!
- Sofie speaking.
- Sofie?
It's Jesper.
Please, let me explain.
- You just walked out of there?
- Yes.
- So, you won't be a salesman?
- Sure, but not like that.
Someone sure is embracing the flex hours.
Relax, they're on their way.
I can't wait to see Lotte's girlfriend.
A lesbian isn't necessarily ugly or repulsive, sweetie.
- Here they come.
- Finally!
Hi!
Jesper.
Hi, Lotte.
Good to see you.
Hi, Karsten.
- Jane.
- Lotte.
I'm damned sorry I'm late.
Hey babe.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Jesper.
Hanna, hi.
They have great food here.
I know the chef, he's a queer.
I think one of the waiters is gay, so mind what you order.
- Why?
.
- The Crème brûlée may be suspect.
- Let's go inside and have a drink.
- Standing here won't get us drunk.
Sweetie, why don't we put a quota on the schnapps tonight.
Good evening, I'm Lennart, and I'll be serving you tonight.
Hey, hey.
Listen up.
Before I get too drunk, I have a few things to tell you.
- I have good news and bad.
- We're not shutting down!
The bad news is that we're shutting down.
Well, the writing was on the wall.
But the good news is ...
Varberg has recommended us for jobs in the technical department.
- How the hell did that happen?
- I'll read you the recommendation.
Listen.
Regarding discontinuation of the recycling station.
As the municipal rationalization is based on cost-benefit analyses -
- I recommend that we, from a human resource point of view rehire the affected employees elsewhere in the municipality.
I'd never expect that of Varberg.
He recognizes a good team, when he sees one.
- Cheers!
- Absolutely.
- Cheers.
- Congratulations.
Hooray for us.
A strong team.
- Why didn't you call me sooner?
.
- You said to never call you again.
You must sense what I feel, not hear what I say.
- That can be difficult.
- I never said it was fair.
- But I liked you as a pageboy.
- What?
- With the dangling sock.
- How about an encore, then?
- This time without an audience.
- Ah, you girls and all your rules.
Yes, girls are a bit strange, right?
Stop!
The meteor is coming.
Fear not.
Lotte will save the world.
Houston, we have a problem.
This is gonna sting.
Yippee.
Jesper and Sofie now share a home.
Jesper is painting the nursery.
Lotte has seen a UFO twice.
The police, however, say that the tire tracks tell a different story.
- What the hell's with you?
- Are you talking to me?
Theodor took an anger management class.
The court later ruled that the teacher hit first.
Dion and Jane have had their second set of twins.
Dion is now sterilized.

STAMPINGSTON:
Gentlemen, Toki Wartooth's father is on his deathbed.
Our psychological death expert, Dr. Ralphus Galkinsmelter.
Toki Wartooth has become a messenger of death.
Everything he touches with his love will die, for he brings death with him like a blackened cloud hovering in the cold night sky.
Like the Grim Reaper himself, his guitar is his scythe.
He cascades through the open window of your child's cradle to suck the very life from your baby's breath.
What a load of horse.
How dare you, General.
You're like a withering toad, eating flies on your lily pad.
Dr. Galkinsmelter, please behave yourself!
What does this all mean?
Toki has suppressed his feelings for his father.
His death may ignite long-dormant emotions.
He will spin out of control into a vortex of madness.
He will bring death to us all.
Thank you.
You know, I actually am looking forward to going to Norway.
It is the birthplace of black metal.
It's gonna be fun.
I mean, besides your dad's dying slowly from cancer.
How you doing with that, by the way?
My dad's dead.
He killed my mom, and then he killed himself.
Didn't affect me at all.
It's part of life.
How's it gonna affect you?
You were just a baby, little baby.
I was never a baby.
I had to become a man right there.
You're still a baby right now.
A baby with a man's heart.
I'm a warrior.
My dad is just like a "stare and say nothing" weirdo, and if he died, well, you know, what do you do?
I actually get along with my dad.
You know, we drink a lot of beer, and we go hunting.
If he died, whoa, that would be ed up.
But, hey, it's your dad that's gonna die.
My dad's safe.
All right, everyone shut up, all right.
This is about Toki right now, okay?
Murderface, hold on to this for a second.
Now, what I'm saying is -
Aah!
I'm sorry.
I could not resist.
That was good.
We talked about doing that for a while.
That's my bass-playing hand!
Uh oh, there goes the band.
Toki, I don't know where to go.
Where's your dad's house?
Well, it's outside the town.
It's complicated.
I want to get this crap over with.
Come on.
Yeah, let's get it over so we can have fun and goof off.
Let's just go into town and go shoppings first.
All right, we're going shopping.
Hey, where are all the black-metal guys around here?
I don't see any.
Oh, there's ones.
He looks like Boo Berry from the cereal.
Aw, yeah, he's a Norwegian Boo Berry.
Hey, shouldn't we go to your family's house and, you know, well, check in?
We don't needs to do that now.
We got still so much mores to see.
Behold, there's the first blacks-metal record shops, whats starts it all.
Is that a smoked-fish place?
TOKI:
No, next to it, rights there.
PICKLES:
Oh, the ski shop?
TOKI:
No, there.
This is my old friend Ronk Snogge.
Well, if it isn't the commercially successful Toki Wartooth.
This guy seems like an asshole.
I am a pagan trapped in the conservative hell that is Norway.
Yeah, what the are you listening to?
This is a demo tape from my band, Hestkuk, which means a horse's dick.
Do you like it?
I don't know.
It's okay.
Then I hate it.
Hey, where's the Dethklok albums?
I don't sell them.
Too digital.
Well, it's nice to see you, but we got to -
No, let's listens to more demo tapes, right?
So, what are we doing in here, Toki?
Oh, 'cause you gots to try these krumkakes with lingonberries.
They're real brutal.
This is a real brutal place.
Hey, did you know that Norway has the lowest murder rate in the whole world?
The lowest in the world!
Wait a minute.
You mean the murder rate in Canada is higher than Norway?
Yeah.
Oh, my God, that's lame.
This place is lame.
Admit it, Toki.
Norway's not brutal.
Danbury, Connecticut, is more brutal.
Yeah, dude, Tomahawk, Wisconsin, it's way more brutal.
At least we got crystal meth.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Let's go to your dad's house and see a guy die!

Cancer may be contagious.
You know, I'm just putting that out there.
So I'll wait here right before I freeze to death, then I'll go inside, okay?
- All right, that's good.

I mean, besides your dad's dying slowly from cancer.
How you doing with that, by the way?
My dad's dead.
He killed my mom, and then he killed himself.
Didn't affect me at all.
It's part of life.
How's it gonna affect you?
You were just a baby, little baby.
I was never a baby.
I had to become a man right there.
You're still a baby right now.
A baby with a man's heart.
I'm a warrior.
My dad is just like a "stare and say nothing" weirdo, and if he died, well, you know, what do you do?
I actually get along with my dad.
You know, we drink a lot of beer, and we go hunting.
If he died, whoa, that would be [bleep]ed up.
But, hey, it's your dad that's gonna die.
My dad's safe.
All right, everyone shut up, all right.
This is about Toki right now, okay?
Murderface, hold on to this for a second.
Now, what I'm saying is --
Aah!
I'm sorry.
I could not resist.
That was good.
We talked about doing that for a while.
That's my bass-playing hand!
Uh oh, there goes the band.
Toki, I don't know where to go.
Where's your dad's house?
Well, it's outside the town.
It's complicated.
I want to get this crap over with.
Come on.
Yeah, let's get it over so we can have fun and goof off.
Let's just go into town and go shoppings first.
All right, we're going shopping.
Hey, where are all the black-metal guys around here?
I don't see any.
Oh, there's ones.
He looks like Boo Berry from the cereal.
Aw, yeah, he's a Norwegian Boo Berry.
Hey, shouldn't we go to your family's house and, you know, well, check in?
We don't needs to do that now.
We got still so much mores to see.
Behold, there's the first blacks-metal record shops, whats starts it all.
NATHAN:
is that a smoked-fish place?
TOKl:
No, next to it, rights there.
pickles:
Oh, the ski shop?
TOKl:
No, there.
This is my old friend Ronk Snogge.
Well, if it isn't the commercially successful Toki Wartooth.
This guy seems like an asshole.
I am a pagan trapped in the conservative hell that is Norway.
Yeah, what the [bleep] are you listening to?
This is a demo tape from my band, Hestkuk, which means a horse's dick.
Do you like it?
I don't know.
It's okay.
Then I hate it.
Hey, where's the Dethklok albums?
I don't sell them.
Too digital.
Well, it's nice to see you, but we got to --
No, let's listens to more demo tapes, right?
[ metal music playing ]
So, what are we doing in here, Toki?
Oh, 'cause you gots to try these krumkakes with lingonberries.
They're real brutal.
This is a real brutal place.
Hey, did you know that Norway has the lowest murder rate in the whole world?
The lowest in the world!
Wait a minute.
You mean the murder rate in Canada is higher than Norway?
Yeah.
Oh, my god, that's lame.
This place is lame.
Admit it, Toki.
Norway's not brutal.
Danbury, Connecticut, is more brutal.
Yeah, dude, Tomahawk, Wisconsin, it's way more brutal.
At least we got crystal meth.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Let's go to your dad's house and see a guy die!
Toki, we've been standing out here for three hours.
It's really, really cold.

Ixnay on the cancer-ay contagious-ay.
Are you trying to speak pig Latin?
I don't want to catch cancer!
You know what?
Cancer may be contagious.
You know, I'm just putting that out there.
So I'll wait here right before I freeze to death, then I'll go inside, okay?
- All right, that's good.
- That's a good plan.
Toki, you take care of it.
I mean, it's your deal anyway.
[ whispers ]

We don't have much time.
Let's go!

The beer's coming out of my nose.
Don't give Murderface any firecrackers.
We just have to hold them.
Hey, can I have a firecracker?
You know what?
I think there's some over there.
Where?
I don't see any.
There's no firecrackers.

You've got to find these firecrackers.
They're down there somewhere.
Yeah, they're in the grass -- look.

Smash your face into the grass and look hard.
There you go.
Now you got it.
Oh, you mother[bleep]er, ow, that hurt!

Yeah, he was just, like, staring at his shoes and all mumblings.
I tries to cheers him up.
[bleep] him.
Oh, that poor little [bleep]er.
This is delicious.
What is this, crab dip?
You know, Toki's kind of in a fragile state of mind right now.
He could really use your support.
Ah, don't let him fool you.
He's tough as nails.
Come on, you don't think Toki is gonna freak out or anything, you know, like do something -- should we hide the guns?
Well, I wouldn't go that far.
I think he's just a little sad.
He's gonna kill himself?
No, I mean he might kill us.
He's the one to do that.
He's a strange -- l don't trust him.
He's [bleep]ed in the head.
He's [bleep]ed in the head.
I don't trust him, and --
- Hello.

Sees ya.
Sees ya laters, Toki.
Haves a great times.
Oh, yeah, and say hi to your dad from us -- l mean, if he doesn't die before you get there.
Well, you know, say hi to his corpse, I guess.
You know, I don't know.
Yeah, no matter what happens, say hi.

Oh, that would be great, but, you know, we got to do the record.
Aw, the album.
Got to work.
Got to get to work.
It's gonna be twice as hard without you, so... I understands.
[ sighs ]
Well, since you can't go to Norway because you got to work on the album, let's just work on that album.
Come on, guys.
In the recording room, chop-chop.
Recording room.
Come on, come on.
Every one of you, come on.
Chop-chop, let's go.
Recording room, let's go.
Recording room, let's go.
Let's go.
Come on, let's get it moving.
You know somethings?
You gots a hearts of ice.
You have a heart of ice.
How are we supposed to records when our brother suffers so badly?
He doesn't get it.
Once again, if you're here, you're working on the record.
Hey, I'm gonna go support Toki.
I can't work on the album.
I'm not cruel.
No.
Damn it, we should all go.
Ow!
Mother [bleep]ing firecracker!
Murderface, watch your language!
We're talking about Toki here!
Fine.
Fine.
You know, just don't go crazy, okay?
Don't -- whatever.
Save your receipts.
STAMPlNGSTON:
Gentlemen, Toki Wartooth's father is on his deathbed.
Our psychological death expert, Dr. Ralphus Galkinsmelter.
Toki Wartooth has become a messenger of death.
Everything he touches with his love will die, for he brings death with him like a blackened cloud hovering in the cold night sky.
Like the Grim Reaper himself, his guitar is his scythe.
He cascades through the open window of your child's cradle to suck the very life from your baby's breath.
What a load of horse[bleep].
How dare you, General.
You're like a withering toad, eating flies on your lily pad.
Dr. Galkinsmelter, please behave yourself!
What does this all mean?
Toki has suppressed his feelings for his father.
His death may ignite long-dormant emotions.
He will spin out of control into a vortex of madness.
He will bring death to us all.
He will bring death to us all.
Thank you.
NATHAN:

Pretty girl like you?
You've come to the right place.
Okay.
Now I know this is uncomfortable.
But we do this together.
We make her feel safe.
We all ready?
You ready for this?
Yeah.
Yeah.
-Wait for my word.
-All right.
Sarah, honey.
Honey.
What is this?
Sarah, welcome.
I'm Keith Bowen.
Have a seat.
Hey, Banks.
Read my lips.
Go ahead.
I'll take you for everything you got.
No, no, 'cause see, I'm done.
We're all done.
Your friends, your family, your agent, the studio.
All of us.
So, here it is, Chris, you're going to jail.
-Yeah, right.
-Oh, you don't think so?
You're holding, right?
One rock-- that's possession.
That's mandatory arrest.
Two or more?
That's possession with intent.
That's mandatory jail time.
Who... who are you?
Mom, what's going on?
I was retained by your family.
You gotta be kidding me.
Now, I've taken the time, like everyone else here.
-This is bullshit.
-No, no.
No, there are people here that love you.
Mom...
Sarah, baby, listen, please... we're all here to support you.
And you know how much we love you.
And to tell you that now's the time that's come for you to listen, Sarah.
So, please, take a seat.
Who is this moron?
You're not a cop.
No, you're right about that.
But my friend here is.
Do it.
See that?
I've got more friends than you.
All right, point made.
-Sarah!
-Sarah!
Sarah!
I'm the one who called him, not your sister.
Baby, I don't know what to do with you anymore.
-You need help!
-For once in your life, think about somebody else!
Let's be calm.
Remember why we are here.
No, there's no point to be made, all right?
I'm done.
You don't give a damn, I don't give a damn.
Get him outta here.
No, no, no.
No, wait, wait!
Wait!
This is a joke, right?
You were paid!
No, I washed my hands of it, all right?
I gave it all back.
But don't worry, tough guy like you you should be fine in County.
Sarah, no more money, no more handouts, no more lying.
It's time for everyone to be truth-tellers-- everyone.
You don't know what you're talking about.
No, this is not about me.
It's about you and the people who love you.
We mean it.
Both of us, Sarah.
Okay!
Okay.
Okay what?
All you have to do is sit and listen to the people who love you.
It's not so hard.
This is bullshit!
I'm outta here!
Whatever you say.
Just so we understand:
You stay... my rules.
Say yes.
Yes.
What kind
-of contract?
-We decide.
You and me.
We negotiate.
We make a peace treaty.
Look, you have your points.
I have mine.
We talk it out, we find a middle ground.
Just-just like in business.
Or countries at war.
Okay.
So where's Mom in all this?
She's Switzerland.
And this... this negotiation-- it includes everything?
Football?
Everything is on the table, Ben.
lncluding football.
So bring your A-game.
I'm no pushover.
We have a deal?
Not yet.
We'll negotiate.
Go ahead.
Meeting's over.
This is William Banks.
Anger like this in a heroin addict is unusual, especially when you're high.
What do you mean, unusual?
Well, I mean, heroin-- you know, you-you kick back, you chill.
You're floating on a cloud.
You're not lookin' for a fight.
Definitely not starting one.
Spoils the ride.
And Sarah didn't start the fight.
Oh, Mom.
She didn't.
You-you pushed her, she reacted.
I didn't push, Mom.
I was honest.
Look, that's been the problem, we haven't pushed enough.
Oh, I've pushed.
All the time.
You don't know.
I'm her mother.
You girls are my life.
Look, Mom, you don't sleep.
You don't eat.
You're worried all the time.
You can't do another year of this.
Sarah was a good girl.
Both my girls are good girls.
It's true, Kate.
She was a good sister.
She-she was smart, she had nice friends, she succeeded at everything, until... ls there something else I need to know?
No.
Again, I'm sorry to come back unannounced.
I just needed to have one more look.
I have no reason to think it won't assess per the comps of the neighborhood-- maybe even
-on the high end.
-That would be wonderful!
Maybe.
No promises.
I'm sorry, um, busy day today.
Mm-hmm.
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Not at all.
First door on the left.
-Thanks.
-When I spoke to you on the phone,
Mr. Banks, I mentioned another interventionist.
Keith Bowen.
I know him.
Yeah, my mom is still working with him.
Oh, really?
Yes.
Well, this was Kate's idea, to meet with you-- not mine.
I got Mr. Bowen's name from my doctor.
And I was assured that he was very good.
And-And everything was working fine until Kate spoke up, and did exactly what we were not supposed to do.
I'm-I'm sorry, I'm just a little confused about...
My mother wants to continue working with Mr. Bowen in spite of his failure, but since you come
-so highly recommended, I...
-Right.
-But if you already have someone...
-Someone who can't even sit my sister down and now she's
God knows where.
Look, we haven't seen her.
I talked to her boss Harvey.
She hasn't been in the office in five days.
She hasn't checked in.
They're getting pissed.
And no one seems to be able to help her.
Please don't say no.
You said yes.
Yeah.
All right, well, yes is fine.
Yes and pro bono, not so much.
Relax, I talked to the sister, Kate, she cut a deposit.
All right, well, I'm in.
Okay, but Keith Bowen?
I say give the money back.
Say we're booked.
And we are.
Who's Keith Bowen?
Keith Bowen, bro, is the second-fastest gun in the West, all right?
Second.
Guys, we're not competitors, all right?
-We're in the same trade.
-Yeah.
No, like, uh, Sherlock Holmes, Batman-- in the same trade.
-Swenton...
-He's right.
I mean, you and Bowen, bad juju.
-You forget.
-Look... let's rein it in here, guys, all right?
Bowen is irrelevant.
It's about the client.
Everybody got that?
The drug is heroin.
The mark is Sarah Garber, the source is unknown.
So, Swenton, I want you on the street-- find out what the brand du jour is.
Word is that players are chipping something new.
Yeah, I know, um, I can start with the HK Rollers.
Some bad boys.
-Okay, I'll go with him.
-No, I want you on the mark's job.
-Okay, I can do both.
-Uh, you know what?
If I can go on the record here?
I really appreciate the help.
I think I can handle this one
-by myself.
-Figure it out.
D...
I'm still at the safe house watching our little movie star.
Cool.
Where it's nice and quiet.
Now make sure you bring your laptop.
While you're sitting on Chris, I want you to download me on the mother, the mark, the sister.
Give me the financials-- work, DMV, all of that.
-Got it.
-Are we gonna reach out to Bowen?
-Considering the history there?
-No.
It's not about Bowen.
Look, guys, Sarah's been in the wind for five days, so the quicker we get on this, the quicker we can find her.
Go.
Hi, it's Sarah.
Leave a message.
Sarah, it's Harvey.
I'm here in the office with two very unhappy clients.
You were supposed to be at an appointment on Cloverdale two hours ago.
Please call me back as soon as you can.
Needless to say, you're no longer on the Cloverdale listing.
Look, snorting's cool and all, don't get me wrong.
You really want to enjoy the ride and catch the sights along the way?
If you ain't tapping' a vein, you're just hooverin' toot.
...20-year-old wunderkind against Chicago's veteran from
Staten Island, David Ortiz.
Los Angeles and Chicago scored a couple of runs apiece in the eight inning...
You gonna just stand there, or you gonna hand me that five-eighths socket wrench?
No, I'm gonna stand here.
And LA evened the score on a two-run bomb by...
Suit yourself.
Now we find ourselves all even in the bottom half of the ninth inning...
My client's sister seems determined to retain you.
Yeah, well, there's no explaining good taste, right?
Well, this is about the best interests of all involved.
Meaning yours or hers?
They're one and the same.
All right.
So, let me be clear.
If you take my client against her will,
I will have you arrested for kidnapping.
That's an awful lot of bark, Keith.
How's your bite?
Do yourself a favor, Banks.
Leave this to the professionals.
You or your "calling" aren't needed.
Aw.
And they say time heals all wounds.
Well, they were wrong.
You've been warned.
Once again, the runners will be going on three and two, goes out of the stretch, checks the runners...
Promise not to hit him.
Down and away, it's ball three...
Yeah, I know.
I know.
Well, it's not what I want.
Look, my boss has got me on three different jobs, Jeannie.
Please understand, all right?
So, the aunt who needed an operation...?
It's just that...
Darnell...
Listen to me, please.
Even when you're with me,
I don't feel like you're really with me.
It's just a hard time, that's all.
Look, can I call you later?
I think you need to do some soul-searching, D.
I really do.
Oh, please don't give up on us, all right?
I'm gonna explain everything, I promise, baby, all right?
All good, big man?
Yeah.
All right, listen up, guys, we got a new plan.
We're on the Sarah Garber job, full-court press.
Bowen push your buttons?
What do we know?
Her finances are all messed up.
So's her job.
She's a real estate assessor.
Her boss has had it with her.
Any day, she's toast.
All right, D, I want you to track her cell phone.
Got it.
What else?
Uh, you were right.
HK Rollers got a new product called Blue Dust.
That seems to be the unanimous taste sensation.
It's got hopheads lining up at drive-through windows all over the place.
That, and then, of course, there's the shooting galleries for the tourists who don't know any better.
And the bottom feeders who don't have cars.
So, if she's there?
It's a different play.
Rollers don't like strangers, right?
Yeah, so if we start flashing her picture, we don't get through the door.
Then don't flash her picture.
All right, let's get inside, get eyes on, and make the rounds.
Cool.
You want us to score?
Whatever it takes.
Akani, I want you on the sister.
Uh, I'm doing the rounds with Swenton.
No.
Start with this.
Bowen's been withholding information.
My guess is, the mother and sister Kate will be doing the same thing.
Okay.
Uh, just so we're clear, Bowen didn't push your buttons?
Hello?
Sarah, you missed another...
No, no, I'm on my way.
-Sarah, listen to me.
-Harvey...
-These are very important clients.
-I'm five minutes away.
I'll call them myself.
Where have you been?
Hi.
It's Sarah.
Leave a message.
Uh, hey, Sarah, this is Harvey.
I'm calling you back because...
well, you cut me off.
There's no easy way to put this, Sarah, and I hate to do it over the phone, but... we're gonna have to let you go.
You're constantly late, you show up at random listings that aren't even yours.
And it's just not working, Sarah.
If you're having some personal problems,
I hope that you get through them.
And I do wish you the best in whatever it is you're gonna do next, but...
Again, I'm sorry to do this over the phone, but I didn't even know if I'd ever see you again.
All right, take care, Sarah.
Call a cab?
Perfect.
Call the police, please?
Breaking and entering is a crime, William.
Do it.
Make the call.
Hold on a second.
It's not a crime if I have family authorization.
Then why didn't they give you the key?
Or unless you prefer breaking in.
Look, it's your ass I'm trying to save.
You do what you got to do.
Oh, no.
I shall, but it won't be my ass that I'm saving.
You can spin it any way you want, man.
Me, I'll be getting the job done.
Akani?
Yeah?
Download me on the sister.
I haven't done it yet.
I'm with Swenton.
I thought I told you...
I know what you said.
I'm here.
Is there something I need to know about Swenton?
No.
I'll get the work done, William.
Just forget it.
I'll handle it.
I can give you five minutes.
Hey.
Listen, uh, I'm only as good as the info you give me.
What do you mean?
Where does he fit in?
He doesn't.
No, no-- you gotta give me more than that.
They were engaged.
George gave her a choice:
drugs or marriage.
She said one thing, did another, and he left.
And that's it?
Yeah, and I'm glad he left, if that matters.
It was the one positive that came out of all this.
It wouldn't have been a very good marriage.
How out-of-the-picture is he?
Totally.
He moved to Texas, he's engaged again.
Look, all of this happened two years ago.
I mean, how can it mean anything?
Well, it does.
It all does.
Did you find anything out?
I did, as a matter of fact.
She got fired from her job today.
They called her boss and reported it.
Oh!
-Thank you.
-Yes, mm-hmm.
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.
That...
I...
You know, at least I...
I-I know she's alive.
I guess fired is the least of it.
Every time the phone rings, I expect the worst.
That can happen.
I understand how hard this is.
Oh, I-I really appreciate your understanding.
-You're not alone.
-You are not alone.
You know, my daughter Kate has retained another interventionist, William Banks.
I know.
He won't be helpful.
He thinks he's been anointed by God.
-Well, my daughter thinks...
-It's okay.
Just keep me apprised.
So, I'll keep digging.
For what?
So we can find her.
ls that a problem?
No.
No, of course not.
She'll need money more than ever.
Which means she'll come to you.
And you can't give it to her, no matter what she says, no matter what she does.
Can you do that?
I need you to do that.
-I'll try.
-I'll try.
I need you to do that.
Okay?
I should get back.
Listen, Kate, if I find her,
I can make a difference, but she will need your help.
I hired you, didn't I?
I don't know what went wrong, I...
I thought I was such a good mother.
You still are.
You're not alone, Paula.
You're not alone.
Okay?
Yo, yo, I triangulated a signal, got an address, and I found it in a bush.
That's great work, D.
This girl is definitely falling apart.
I believe this is the part where somebody says, "Bingo!"
Or-Or "Eureka!"
We, uh...
We-We found the car.
Uh, came up on a DMV hit.
Ticketed, no wheels.
-It's in a garage in Compton.
-Compton?
Why do you think home girl's all dressed up?
Shut up, Swenton.
We're backtracking with the tow company, finding where they picked it up.
My guess is it leads to this.
Blue Dust.
Excuse me.
Hey, Officer Herman, you got my message.
Listen, I wanted to tell you...
Yeah, we need to talk, William.
Bowen?
-Called us.
-Pressed charges?
Pressed charges.
This is bullshit, all right?
I'm working for the family of the girl that lives there.
Okay.
No sweat.
Have her come in and make a statement, and the BE goes away.
I can't, all right?
She's points unknown.
Look, the complainant-- he's got an ax to grind.
We shared a job a while back.
And things got a little weird.
He thinks I made him look bad.
He's got his Ph.D. panties all in a twist.
Just the same...
You can't actually be taking this seriously.
Witnesses tie our hands, William.
The landlord saw you enter and exit.
You play it fast-and-Ioose like this,
I can't have your back.
No one can.
Truthfully, we all thought you were a little smoother than this.
All right, my bad.
I'll fix it, all right?
I'll talk to Bowen, see if we can't act like adults.
-All right?
-Yeah?
'Cause under normal circumstances, you and I would be taking
-a ride.
-I got it, I got it.
-Okay?
-Yeah?
I'm sorry.
Look, one more thing, though.
You got anything on this?
Blue Dust?
Yeah, the guys in the unit are calling this Blue Death.
Bag's made in China for some toy company.
But it's laced with pesticides.
It's how they make the plastics-- who knew?
You smoke the shit in this bag, and your lungs bleed.
You do enough of it, you drown in your own blood.
Blue Death.
If your client's been using that, you might want to check the morgue.
Thanks.
What, do you think
I need a baby-sitter for this?
If the diaper fits...
-What, do you think I'm using?
-I know you did.
Once, all right?
Okay?
Once.
And that was just to keep my cover with the lnland Kings, all right, so I didn't blow the case, all right?
But now, I'm not, so all is good in my world, all right?
So maybe you can do me a favor and get off your broom.
Okay, I won't be your baby-sitter.
Terrif.
Just think of me as your bodyguard.
No, no, no, no.
It's not like that at all, Jeannie...
We all good?
-Nothing I can't handle.
-Look...
Hey, D, I want you to track down that ex-fiancé ASAP, all right?
I want the whole story.
-There's still some missing pieces.
-Now?
You got something else to do?
Get it done.
-All right, listen up.
-Sorry, Jeannie.
This Blue Dust-- it's killing people.
Right?
It's very dangerous shit.
You two, go to wherever they're slinging it, all right?
I want you to find Sarah.
-It's gonna be dark soon.
-And?
Oh, well, you know, Roller territory, night-- it's not exactly a place for a lady.
-Akani?
-Good thing I'm not a lady.
There you go.
Just in case, go strapped.
I'm gonna make a pit stop, then I'm gonna go visit a certain colleague of mine, maybe try to dance with the mom after that.
You need me, call me.
-Darnell?
-Yo.
Maybe you should check the morgue.
All right.
Swenton?
50 bucks.
Fifty?
Fifty?
This...
this is a Vera Wang.
Vera Wang?
Never heard of her.
50 bucks.
Come on, man.
At least $100.
I mean, this is a $15,000 dress.
I was gonna get married in this dress.
Married.
This look like a bridal shop to you?
Any woman sees this, trust me, you can ask any price you want.
A dress like this, it's... is not about the money, believe me.
Come on, have a heart.
50 bucks.
Take it or leave it.
Seventy-five.
Hey, babe.
He's waiting.
Can I take a second to kiss my wife?
Yes.
Mmm...
This was good, William.
A really good idea.
Well, let's...
let's see how it goes, all right?
Wish me luck.
You know what I mean...
Half a gram, Blue Dust.
Hey, my homegirl, you seen her?
White girl, blonde hair?
Your loss, bro, she's hot.
Let's go.
Hey, pal.
-You ready?
-How do you want to start?
Big items first, work our way down?
How's that sound?
Okay.
Age before beauty, I'll start.
First item: non-negotiable.
You're my son.
I love you, and nothing's ever going to change that.
Nothing, ever.
Your turn.
Okay... well...
Ah, you see that?
I got you, right, kind of threw you?
That's-That's part of negotiating.
Okay, seriously, I think you know what I want.
No, you...
Ben, you have to tell me what you want.
All right?
That's... that's how this works.
I thought you were bringing your A-game, man.
Football.
I want you to keep playing.
And I don't.
Ben, all right, look.
This... this is a negotiation, all right?
You have to make a case for what you want.
All right, you have to convince me or I'm gonna clean the table with you, so make your case.
Okay.
Point one.
Point one?
You told me to bring my A-game.
Yes, I did.
Yes, I did.
Yeah, Jeannie, it's me, Darnell.
Hey, um, listen,
I know things are strange with us, a little distance between us, and, uh... and so if you get a chance, could you call me?
You know what, no.
Maybe we can meet me in person, so we, uh... we could do it in person, you know, talk and work things out.
I really want to work things out, girl, okay?
Call me, please.
Thing is, Ben, if I give in on this point, and that's a very big if, then you have to give something back.
Like what?
One:
You have to promise me and your mother you'll never do anything stupid like running away again-- let me finish.
Two:
You have to replace something for football.
All right?
I don't care what it is.
Drama, school band, track, whatever.
It doesn't matter to me.
The point is, you're not just gonna be chilling around in your room like some kind of well-fed house pet.
What else?
That's it.
You do that, keep up your grades, then maybe me and you can work on my old truck, trick it out a little bit.
And then I can keep it?
You keep your grades up, no hanging around the house, find something to do with yourself... yeah.
Deal.
All right.
What are you doing?
Sarah, where have you been?
-Sarah...
-Leave me alone.
What, you're stealing now?
-No, just...
-Stealing?
!
That's what it's called.
Look... all you had to do was ask.
But no...
Oh, my God, you are pathetic.
You are a pathetic, selfish little bitch.
You don't care about Mom.
All you care about is yourself.
No!
Sarah, give me that!
You've lost it.
No!
No!
No!
Get off me.
Sarah...!
Leave me alone.
Sarah, no!
-No!
-Get away from me!
Sarah!
I'm a bitch?
I'm gonna call the police.
I'm a bitch?
!
Sarah, no!
Sarah!
Sarah!
Sarah!
Sarah!
Hey.
You called the cops on me?
You know, people have rights, Will.
You break into their personal property
-Iike a criminal...
-You don't like how I do things, that's tough, all right?
I stay out of your way, you stay out of mine.
You're not an interventionist, you're just...
-some kind of street thug.
-That's right, Doctor.
I didn't learn what I know from some classroom.
I didn't read it in some book, I lived it.
Maybe that's why I give a shit.
Oh, spare me the ex-addict sob story.
You only took this case to one-up me.
We both know what you really give a shit about.
Oh, you want to make this personal, Keith, huh?
Fine.
You know what your problem is, man?
Your big-time degrees, they don't make a bit of difference.
Not in this case, not in a single one.
That's your problem, all right, 'cause you got the same 75% failure rate that I do, and that just pisses you off
-to no end.
-No, don't do that.
Don't even compare what we do.
I've seen how you work, what you do.
I've paid the price, and it's not happening again.
You paid the price?
What is with you, man?
That is ancient history, all right?
One client, one time, chose me over you.
So what?
You know, if your clients meant as much to you as your stellar reputation...
-you know what...?
-Ex-addict, ex-junkie, direct line to God.
Answer me this.
If God is on your side, why isn't your success rate any better than mine?
Are we done here?
Because I don't do meetings like this.
It's not a calling, William.
It's a job.
A job that requires professionals.
I didn't hit him...
but next time.
See, girl?
That there...
It's the real deal.
She was gonna hit me, Mom.
She would've killed me after everything
-that we've done.
-Oh, Kate, she wouldn't have hurt you, not if she was in her real mind.
Mom, you have got to come to terms with this.
This is who Sarah is now-- the drugs have her.
-For now.
-No, forever.
If you give up on her, yes.
She's still my baby.
She's still my Sarah.
That wasn't her.
That wasn't her, Kate.
You know that; you know what happened to her.
Mom, this has got nothing to do with it.
Sarah wasn't always like this.
No one is.
What happened?
Kate, I need to know the facts about your sister-- what happened?
You hired him, Kate.
-You should tell him.
-No!
Sarah and George were engaged.
They... they were planning
-a wedding.
-Ugh... this is bullshit.
Well, he should know.
If you really want Mr. Banks to help, then he should know.
Pretty girl like you shouldn't track up your skin.
Kate and George slept together.
There's this convenient family myth that says that's why my sister became a heroin addict.
You were confused, George was...
Mom, I'll tell you what George was.
George hated Sarah.
Sarah chose drugs over him.
Before anything else happened, that was the decision she made, okay?
Yes, I slept with him.
Do you want to tell me that I'm responsible for my sister becoming a junkie?
Do you want to tell me that?
No.
I can't pretend to know that.
So, Mom, you wanted Keith to tie this up in a big bow?
Kate slept with George, so Sarah became a junkie?
Well, I'm sorry!
If that helps you sleep at night, then fine.
Honey...
Can you tell me what I did wrong?
Because I...
I don't know.
I...
I don't understand.
They're both so...
My daughters are both so unhappy.
Tell me... tell me what I can do.
Tell me...
I can fix it, I can... if you tell me what I can do.
-Mrs.
Garber, I...
-I can fix it.
I can't say you did anything wrong.
I'm sorry.
We've been here before.
Sometimes, all we can do is just not enough.
But have we done everything, turned over every stone?
Bro, we hit every shooting gallery in the hood.
This shit is blowing up.
Everywhere we went, it's all people are looking for:
Blue Dust.
I mean, it's cheap.
You know, cheap, tasty, plentiful... that's hard to beat.
-Even if it's killing people.
-Well, we're on
Sarah now, okay?
We can't help everyone.
Sarah Garber needs us.
So... no job, no car,
-no phone.
-No family, either.
Ex-fiancé was no help, brother.
He's happy he's moved on.
He couldn't get off the phone fast enough.
All right, well...
here's what we're gonna do.
Darnell, I want you, and I want...
Hold on a second.
Yeah?
Hey, sweetheart.
Okay, got it.
Well, thank, thank you.
Be safe.
Bye.
Divine intervention.
That was my girl, Cleo.
Says she saw a girl matching Sarah's description walking the corner of Santa Monica and Las Palmas.
First timers.
That's where the trannies hook.
Not today, baby.
Ugh.
-Come on.
-Sober up first.
Hey, you got 50 bucks?
I'll go with you for 50.
Sarah, we're here to help you.
Well, hello, and welcome to Transitions.
How can I help you on this fine, beautiful day?
Just cut the crap.
Where is she?
Right now, I know that you would do anything to step outside your body.
Even for a few seconds.
Even a split second.
'Cause it doesn't matter, nothing matters.
You would give anything.
I'm sorry, I don't know who you're talking about.
Sarah Garber.
William has her.
It's kidnapping.
I warned him.
And the police are on their way.
See, I know it because I've lived it.
I know the pain.
I know that need that comes from some dark, sick place that you didn't even know you had inside.
And I also know that right now you would just as soon die rather than ignore that need.
She's here.
I know she's here.
I know how William does things and this time, he's not going to get away with it.
Help yourself.
Really, go ahead.
We don't have anything to hide.
Oh, oh...
and try the coffee.
I can't do it.
I know.
Not by yourself.
I tried-- it's, it's almost impossible.
And that's why we're here.
So let me help you, Sarah.
Please, let me help you.
This isn't over.
Wherever he is, it's still kidnapping.
-You understand?
No matter where he has
-Stop!
-taken her, I will have him arrested for...
-Stop, please!
Stop.
This is about my daughter.
Paula, of course it is.
That is why...
No!
All I want to know is if Sarah is okay.
Not about Mr. Banks, not about you.
And if Sarah... if she isn't your main interest, then you don't belong here.
She is my main interest.
Then start acting like it!
I'll be outside.
Do you know anything about my daughter?
I know she's in the best hands.
He has her?
Not here.
Someplace safe.
Here.
Hello?
There are no promises,
Mrs. Garber.
Not for any of us.
And not for anyone fighting a demon like this.
So we have her.
We'll detox her, and... hopefully get her mind to a place where she can make better choices.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Don't thank me yet.
And it hit me when I heard William talk to that girl in that room.
I know it now.
This is where the Lord wants me.
I mean, I belong doing this, Jeannie.
But I believe He brought us together, too.
So you've been doing this, um... what do you call them?
"lnterventions."
Although with William, maybe not quite the way you might have heard about them.
So you lied about working at the car lot?
No, I've been working at the lot, too.
I've been trying to do both.
You know, to do this thing, this mission, Jeannie.
And still keep a nine-to-five, but I'm not a nine-to-five guy.
And I couldn't live with not telling you all of this.
It was eating me up.
Darnell, I respect you.
Your doing this--
I do-- this is... exactly the kind of man I imagined you to be.
Except...
Baby, I don't know if there's...
Oh, Jeannie, Jeannie, wait...
Let me speak.
The life you have right now... honestly, I'm not sure there's room in it for me.
Or a relationship, or anything.
No, no, listen-- that's not true.
Be honest.
We both deserve that.
I can do both.
But I'm not sure I can.
What I think I need, even if he's not helping people the way you do I need that nine-to-five guy.
You started this, you should finish.
Sarah's in a different place now.
She's scared.
Scared is okay.
Scared's good.
It's true.
Being decent this one time, doing the right thing... doesn't change my opinion of you.
We still have nothing in common.
Except Sarah.
Maybe she'll be one of the lucky 25% we do save.
Shall we?
So maybe you want to fill me in on that?
If I'm doing your work, why is it?
Why do he and I have the same rate of success?
And failure?
Previously on The Cleaner:
So you met this girl online?
That's right.
Jeannie, I am a car salesman.
My hours are difficult to explain.
I'm trying to make some extra money for my auntie.
She needs an operation.
It's work, Jeannie.
I should go, baby.
You want to put the Lord on hold?
I'm quitting football.
It's not up for discussion.
You can't make this decision for me.
I've already made it.
I'm quitting.
Sit down-- we're eating dinner.
Ben...
I said sit down!
What is he, five years old?
Running away from home to my father's house?
Why don't you come home.
I'm not coming home.
I can only apologize to you so many times.
You gotta let it go, man.
It's gone.
William!
I cannot smoke this.
Hit it.
SWENTON:
Help me.
I'm sorry.
Please come home.
Okay.
Now, I know this is uncomfortable.
But we do this together.
We make her feel safe.
We all ready?
You ready for this?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wait for my word.
All right.
Sarah, honey.
Honey.
What is this?
Sarah, welcome.
I'm Keith Bowen.
Have a seat.
Hey, Banks.
Read my lips.
Go ahead.
I'll take you for everything you got.
No, no, see, 'cause I'm done.
We're all done.
Your friends, your family, your agent, the studio.
All of us.
So, here it is, Chris, you're going to jail.
Yeah, right.
Oh, you don't think so?
You're holding, right?
One rock-- that's possession.
That's mandatory arrest.
Two or more?
That's possession with intent.
That's mandatory jail time.
Who... who are you?
Mom, what's going on?
I was retained by your family.
You gotta be kidding me.
BOWEN:
Now, I've taken the time, like everyone else here.
This is bullshit.
No, no.
No, there are people here that love you.
(under breath):
Mom...
Sarah, baby, listen, please...
We're all here to support you.
And you know how much we love you.
And to tell you that now the time has come for you to listen, Sarah.
So, please, take a seat.
Who is this moron?
You're not a cop.
No, you're right about that.
But my friend here is.
Do it.
See that?
I've got more friends than you.
All right, point made.
Sarah!
Sarah!
Sarah,
I'm the one who called him, not your sister.
Baby, I don't know what to do with you anymore.
You need help!
For once in your life, think about somebody else!
Let's be calm.
Remember why we are here.
No, there's no point to be made, all right?
I'm done.
You don't give a damn, I don't give a damn.
Get him out of here.
No, no, no.
No, wait, wait!
Wait!
This is a joke, right?
You were paid!
No, I washed my hands of it, all right.
I gave it all back.
Don't worry, tough guy like you should be fine in County.
Sarah, no more money, no more handouts, no more lying.
It's time for everyone to be truth-tellers-- everyone.
You don't know what you're talking about.
This is not about me.
It's about you and the people who love you.
We mean it.
Both of us, Sarah.
Okay!
Okay.
Okay what?
All you have to do is sit and listen to the people who love you.
It's not so hard.
This is bullshit!
I'm out of here!
Whatever you say.
Just so we understand:
You stay... my rules.
Say yes.
Yes.

What kind of contract?
We decide.
You and me.
We negotiate.
We make a peace treaty.
Look, you have your points.
I have mine.
We talk it out, we find a middle ground.
Just-just like in business.
Or countries at war.
Okay.
So where's Mom in all this?
She's Switzerland.
And this... this negotiation-- it includes everything?
Football?
Everything is on the table, Ben, including football-- so bring your A-game.
I'm no pushover.
We have a deal?
Not yet.
We'll negotiate.
Go ahead.
Meeting's over.
This is William Banks.
Anger like this in a heroin addict is unusual, especially when you're high.
What do you mean, unusual?
Well, I mean, heroin-- you know, you kick back, you chill.
You're floating on a cloud.
You're not lookin' for a fight.
Definitely not starting one.
Spoils the ride.
And Sarah didn't start the fight.
Oh, Mom.
She didn't.
You-you pushed her, she reacted.
I didn't push, Mom.
I was honest.
(sighs)
Look, that's been the problem, we haven't pushed enough.
PAULA:
Oh, I've pushed.
All the time.
You don't know.
I'm her mother.
You girls are my life.
Look, Mom, you don't sleep.
You don't eat.
You're worried all the time.
You can't do another year of this.
Sarah was a good girl.
Both of my girls are good girls.
It's true, Kate.
She was a good sister.
She-she was smart, she had nice friends, she succeeded at everything, until...
Is there something else I need to know?
No.
Again, I'm sorry to come back unannounced.
I just need to have one more look.
I have no reason to think it won't assess per the comps of the neighborhood.
Maybe even on the high end.
That would be wonderful!
Maybe.
No promises.
I'm sorry, um, busy day today.
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Not at all.
First door on the left.
Thanks.
When I spoke to you on the phone,
Mr. Banks, I mentioned another interventionist.
Keith Bowen.
I know him.
Yeah, my mom is still working with him.
Oh, really?
Yes.
Well, this was Kate's idea, to meet with you-- not mine.
I got Mr. Bowen's name from my doctor.
And I was assured that he was very good.
And everything was working fine until Kate spoke up, and did exactly what we were not supposed to do.
I'm-I'm sorry, I'm just a little confused about...
My mother wants to continue working with Mr. Bowen in spite of his failure, but since you come so highly recommended, I...
Right.
But if you already have someone...
Someone who can't even sit my sister down and now she's
God knows where.
Look, we haven't seen her.
I talked to her boss Harvey.
She hasn't been in the office in five days.
She hasn't checked in.
They're getting pissed.
And no one seems to be able to help her.
Please don't say no.
You said yes.
Yeah.
All right, well, yes is fine.
Yes and pro bono,not so much.
Relax, I talked to the sister, Kate, she cut a deposit.
All right, well, I'm in.
Okay, but Keith Bowen?
I say give the money back.
Say we're booked.
And we are.
Who's Keith Bowen?
Keith Bowen, bro, is the second-fastest gun in the West, all right?
Second.
Guys, we're not competitors, all right?
We're in the same trade.
Yeah, no, like, uh, Sherlock Holmes, Batman-- in the same trade.
Swenton...
He's right.
You and Bowen, bad juju.
You forget.
Look, let's rein it in here, guys, all right?
Bowen is irrelevant.
It's about the client.
Everybody got that?
The drug is heroin.
The mark is Sarah Garber, the source is unknown.
So, Swenton, I want you on the street-- find out what the brand du jour is.
Word is that players are chipping something new.
Yeah, I know, um, I can start with the HK Rollers.
Some bad boys.
I'll go with him.
No, I want you on the mark's job.
I can do both.
Uh, you know what?
If I can go on the record here?
I really appreciate the help.
I think I can handle this one by myself.
Figure it out.
D...
I'm still at the safe house watching our little movie star.
Cool.
Where it's nice and quiet.
Now make sure you bring your laptop.
While you're sitting on Chris, I want you to download on the mother, the mark, the sister.
Give me the financials-- work, DMV, all of that.
Got it.
Are we gonna reach out to Bowen?
Considering the history there?
No.
It's not about Bowen.
Look, guys, Sarah's been in the wind for five days, so the quicker we get on this, the quicker we can find her.
Go.
Hi, it's Sarah.
Leave a message.
Sarah, it's Harvey.
I'm here in the office with two very unhappy clients.
You were supposed to be at an appointment on Cloverdale two hours ago.
Please call me back as soon as you can.
Needless to say, you're no longer on the Cloverdale listing.
Look, snorting's cool and all, don't get me wrong.
You really want to enjoy the ride and catch the sights along the way?
If you ain't tapping' a vein, it's hooverin' toot.
You gonna just stand there, or you gonna hand me that five-eighths socket wrench?
No, I'm gonna stand here.
Suit yourself.
My client's sister seems determined to retain you.
Yeah, well, there's no explaining good taste, right?
Well, this is about the best interests of all involved.
Meaning yours or hers?
They're one and the same.
All right.
So, let me be clear.
If you take my client against her will,
I will have you arrested for kidnapping.
That's an awful lot of bark, Keith.
How's your bite?
Do yourself a favor, Banks.
Leave this to the professionals.
You or your "calling" aren't needed.
Aw.
And they say time heals all wounds.
And they were wrong.
You've been warned.
Promise not to hit him.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
Well, it's not what I want.
Look, my boss has got me on three differenjobs, Jeannie.
Please understand, all right?
So, the aunt who needed an operation...?
(sighs) It's just that...
Darnell, listen to me.
Listen to me, please.
Even when you're with me,
I don't feel like you're really with me.
(clears throat) It's just a hard time, that's all.
Look, can I call you later?
I think you need to do some soul-searching, D.
I really do.
Oh, please don't give up on us, all right?
I'm gonna explain everything, I promise, baby, all right?
All good, big man?
Yeah.
All right, listen up, guys, we got a new plan.
We're on the Sarah Garber job, full court press.
Bowen push your buttons?
What do we know?
Her finances are all messed up.
So's her job.
She's a real estate assessor.
Her boss has had it with her.
Any day, she's toast.
All right, D, I want you to track her cell phone.
Got it.
What else?
Uh, you were right.
HK Rollers got a new product called Blue Dust.
That seems to be the unanimous taste sensation.
It's got hopheads lining up at the drive-through windows all over the place.
That, and then, of course, there's the shooting galleries for the tourists who don't know any better.
WILLIAM:
And the bottom feeders who don't have cars.
SWENTON:
So, if she's there?
It's a different play.
Rollers don't like strangers, right?
Yeah, so if we start flashing her picture, we don't get through the door.
Then don't flash her picture.
All right, let's get inside, get eyes on, and make the rounds.
Cool.
Do you want us to score?
Whatever it takes.
Akani, I want you on the sister.
Uh, I'm doing the rounds with Swenton.
WILLIAM:
No.
Start with this.
Bowen's been withholding information.
My guess is, the mother and sister Kate will be doing the same thing.
Uh, just so we're clear, Bowen didn't push your buttons?
Hello?
Sarah, you missed...
No, no, I'm on my way.
Sarah, listen to me-- these are very important clients.
Harvey, I'm five minutes away.
Where have you been?
I'll call them myself.
Hi.
It's Sarah.
Leave a message.
Uh, hey, Sarah, this is Harvey.
I'm calling you back because...
well, you cut me off.
There's no easy way to put this, Sarah, and I hate to do it over the phone,
but we're gonna have to let you go.
You're constantly late, you show up at random listings that aren't even yours, and it's just not working, Sarah.
If you're having some personal problems,
I hope that you get through them, and I do wish you the best in whatever it is you're gonna do next, but, again, I'm sorry to do this over the phone, but didn't even know if I'd ever see you again.
All right, take care, Sarah.
Call a cab?
Perfect.
Call the police, please?
Breaking and entering is a crime, William.
Do it.
Make the call.
Hold on a second.
It's not a crime if I have family authorization.
Then why didn't they give you the key?
Or unless you prefer breaking in.
Look, it's your ass I'm trying to save.
You do what you got to do.
Oh, no.
I shall, but it won't be my ass that I'm saving.
You can spin it any way you want, man.
Me, I'll be getting the job done.
Akani?
AKANI:
Yeah?
Download me on the sister.
I haven't done it yet.
I'm with Swenton.
I thought I told you...
I know what you said.
I'm here.
Is there something I need to know about Swenton?
No.
I'll get the work done, William.
Just forget it.
I'll handle it.
I can give you five minutes.
Hey.
Listen, uh, I'm only as good as the info you give me.
What do you mean?
Where does he fit in?
He doesn't.
No, no-- you gotta give me more than that.
They were engaged.
George gave her a choice:
drugs or marriage.
She said one thing, did another, he left.
And that's it?
Yeah, and I'm glad he left, if that matters.
It was the one positive that came out of all of this.
It wouldn't have been a very good marriage.
How out-of-the-picture is he?
Totally.
He moved to Texas, he's engaged again.
Look, all of this happened two years ago.
I mean, how can it mean anything?
Well, it does.
It all does.
Did you find anything out?
I did, as a matter of fact.
She got fired from her job today.
They called her boss and reported it.
Oh!
Oh.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
That...
I...
You know, at least I...
I-I know she's alive.
I guess fired is the least of it.
Every time the phone rings, I expect the worst.
That can happen.
I understand how hard this is.
Oh, I really appreciate your understanding.
BOTH:
You're not alone.
You know, my daughter Kate has retained another interventionist, William Banks.
I know.
He won't be helpful.
He thinks he's been anointed by God.
Well, my daughter thinks...
It's okay.
Just keep me apprised.
So, I'll keep digging.
For what?
So we can find her.
Is that a problem?
No.
No, of course not.
She'll need money more than ever.
Which means she'll come to you.
And you can't give it to her, no matter what she says, no matter what she does.
Can you do that?
I need you to do that.
BOTH:
I'll try.
I need you to do that.
I should get back.
Listen, Kate, if I find her,
I can make a difference, but she will need your help.
I hired you, didn't I?
PAULA:
I don't know what went wrong.
I...
I thought I was such a good mother.
You still are.
You're not alone, Paula.
You're not alone.
Okay?
Yo, yo, I triangulated a signal, got an address, and I found it in a bush.
That's great work, D.
This girl is dinitely falling apart.
I believe this is the part where somebody says, "Bingo!"
Or-Or "Eureka!"
We, uh...
We-We found the car.
Uh, came up on a DMV hit.
Ticketed, no wheels.
It's in a garage in Compton.
Compton?
SWENTON:
Why do you think homegirl's all dressed up.
AKANI:
Shut up, Swenton.
We're backtracking with the tow company, finding where they picked it up.
My guess is it leads to this.
SWENTON:
Blue Dust.
Excuse me.
Hey, Officer Herman, you got my message.
Listen, I wanted to tell you...
Yeah, we need to talk, William.
Bowen?
Called us.
Pressed charges?
Pressed charges.
This is bullshit, all right?
I'm working for the family of the girl that lives there.
Okay.
No sweat.
Have her come in and make a statement, and the BE goes away.
I can't, all right?
She's points unknown.
Look, the complainant-- he's got an ax to grind.
We shared a job a while back.
Things got a little weird.
He thinks I made him look bad.
He's got his PhD panties all in a twist.
Just the same...
You can't actually be taking this seriously.
Witnesses tie our hands, William.
The landlord saw you enter and exit.
You play it fast-and-loose like this,
I can't have your back.
No one can.
Truthfully, we all thought you were a little smoother than this.
(clears throat) All right, my bad.
I'll fix it, all right?
I'll talk to Bowen, see if we can't act like adults.
All right?
Yeah?
Because under normal circumstances, you and I would be taking a ride.
I got it, I got it, okay?
I'm sorry.
Look, one more thing, though.
You got anything on this?
Blue Dust?
Yeah, the guys in the unit are calling this Blue Death.
Bag's made in China for some toy company.
But it's laced with pesticides.
It's how they make plastics-- who knew?
You smoke the shit in this bag, and your lungs bleed.
You do enough of it, you drown in your own blood.
Blue Death.
If your client's been using that, you might want to check the morgue.
Thanks.
SWENTON:
What, do you think
I need a baby-sitter for this?
If the diaper fits...
What, do you think I'm using?
I know you did.
Once, all right?
Okay?
Once.
And that was just to keep my cover with the Inland Kings, all right, so I didn't blow the case, all right?
But now, I'm not, so all is good in my world, all right?
So maybe you can do me a favor and get off your broom.
Okay, I won't be your baby-sitter.
Terrif.
Just think of me as your bodyguard.
We all good?
Nothing I can't handle.
Hey, D, I want you to track down that ex-fianc?
I want the whole story.
There's still some missing pieces.
Now?
WILLIAM:
You got something else to do?
Get it done.
All right, listen up.
Sorry, Jeannie.
This Blue Dust-- it's killing people.
Right?
It's very dangerous shit.
You two, go to wherever they're slinging it, all right?
I want you to find Sarah.
SWENTON:
It's gonna be dark soon.
And?
SWENTON:
Oh, well, you know, Roller territory, night-- it's not exactly a place for a lady.
Akani?
Good thing I'm not a lady.
There you go.
Just in case, go strapped.
I'm gonna make a pit stop, then I'm gonna go visit a certain colleague of mine, maybe try to dance with the mom after that.
You need me, call me.
Darnell?
Yo.
Maybe you should check the morgue.
All right.
Swenton?
50 bucks.
Fifty?
Fifty?
This...
this is Vera Wang.
Vera Wang?
Never heard of her.
50 bucks.
Come on, man.
At least $100.
I mean, this is a $15,000 dress.
I was gonna get married in this dress.
Married.
This look like a bridal shop to you?
Any woman sees this, trust me, you can ask any price you want.
A dress like this, it's... is not about the money, believe me.
Come on, have a heart.
50 bucks.
Take it or leave it.
Seventy-five.
Hey, babe.
He's waiting.
Can I take a second to kiss my wife?
Yes.
This was good, William.
A really good idea.
Well, let's...
let's see how it goes, all right?
Wish me luck.
AKANI:
Half a gram, Blue Dust.
Hey, my homegirl, you seen her?
White girl, blonde hair?
Your loss, bro, she's hot.
Let's go.
Hey, pal.
You ready?
How do you want to start?
Big items first, work our way down?
How's that sound?
Okay.
Age before beauty, I'll start.
First item: non-negotiable.
You're my son.
I love you, and nothing's ever going to change that.
Nothing, ever.
Your turn.
Okay... well...
Ah, you see that?
I got you, right, kind of threw you?
That's part of negotiating.
Okay, seriously, I think you know what I want.
No, you...
Ben, you have to tell me what you want.
All right?
That's... that's how this works.
I thought you were bringing your A-game.
Football.
I want you to keep playing.
And I don't.
Ben, all right, look.
This... this is a negotiation, all right?
You have to make a case for what you want.
All right, you have to convince me or I'm gonna clean the table with you, so make your case.
Okay.
Point one.
Point one?
You told me to bring my A-game.
Yes, I did.
Yes, I did.
Yeah, Jeannie, it's me, Darnell.
Hey, um, listen,
I know things are strange with us, a little distance between us, and, uh... and so if you get a chance, could you call me?
You know what, no.
Maybe we can meet me in person, so we, uh... we could do it in person, you know, talk and work things out.
I really want to work things out, girl, okay?
Call me, please.
Thing is, Ben, if I give in on this point, and that's a very big if, then you have to give something back.
Like what?
One:
You have to promise me and your mother you'll never do anything stupid like running away again-- let me finish.
Two:
You have to replace something for football.
All right?
I don't care what it is.
Drama, school band, track, whatever.
It doesn't matter to me.
The point is, you're not just gonna be chilling around in your room like some kind of well-fed house pet.
What else?
That's it.
You do that, keep up your grades, then maybe me and you can work on my old truck, trick it out a little bit.
And then I can keep it?
You keep your grades up, no hanging around the house, find something to do with yourself... yeah.
Deal.
All right.
What are you doing?
Sarah, where have you been?
Sarah...
Leave me alone.
What, you're stealing now?
No...
Stealing!
That's what it's called.
Look... all you had to do was ask.
But no...
My God, you are pathetic.
You are a pathetic, selfish little bitch.
?
Get off me.eutom lositr!
!
isrselrah,lvme
Sarah...!
Leave me alone.
Sarah, no!
No!
Get away from me!
Sarah!
I'm a bitch?
I'm gonna call the police.
I'm a bitch?
!
Sarah, no!
Sarah!
Sarah!
Sarah!
Hey.
You called the cops on me?
You know, people have rights, Will.
You break into their personal property like a criminal...
You don't like how I do things, that's tough, all right?
I stay out of your way, you stay out of mine.
You're not an interventionist, you're just... some kind of street thug.
That's right, Doctor.
I didn't learn what I know from some classroom.
I didn't read it in some book, I lived it.
Maybe that's why I give a shit.
Oh, spare me the ex-addict sob story.
You only took this case to one-up me.
We both know what you really give a shit about.
Oh, you want to make this personal, Keith, huh?
Fine.
You know what your problem is, man?
Your big-time degrees, they don't make a bit of difference.
Not in this case, not in a single one.
That's your problem, all right, 'cause you got the same 75% failure rate that I do, and that just pisses you off to no end.
No, don't do that.
Don't even compare what we do.
I've seen how you work, what you do.
I've paid the price, and it's not happening again.
You paid the price?
What is with you, man?
That is ancient history, all right?
One client, one time, chose me over you.
So what?
You know, if your clients meant as much to you as your stellar reputation...
Ex-addict, ex-junkie, direct line to God.
Answer me this.
If God is on your side, why isn't your success rate any better than mine?
Are we done here?
Because I don't do meetings like this.
It's not a calling, William.
It's a job.
A job that requires professionals.
I didn't hit him...
but next time.
See, girl?
That there it's the real deal.
KATE:
She was gonna hit me, Mom.
She would've killed me after everything that we've done.
Oh, Kate, she wouldn't have hurt you, not if she was in her real mind.
Mom, you have got to come to terms with this.
This is who Sarah is now-- the drugs have her.
For now.
No, forever.
If you give up on her, yes.
PAULA:
She's still my baby.
She's still my Sarah.
That wasn't her.
That wasn't her, Kate.
You know that; you know what happened to her.
Mom, this has got nothing to do with it.
Sarah wasn't always like this.
No one is.
What happened?
Kate, I need to know the facts about your sister-- what happened?
You hired him, Kate.
You should tell him.
No!
Sarah and George were engaged.
They... they were planning a wedding.
Ugh... bullshit.
Well, he should know.
If you really want Mr. Banks to help, then he should know.
Pretty girl like you shouldn't track up your skin.
Kate and George slept together.
There's this convenient family myth that says that's why my sister became a heroin addict.
You were confused, George was...
Mom, I'll tell you what George was.
George hated Sarah.
Sarah chose drugs over him.
Before anything else happened, that was the decision she made, okay?
Yes, I slept with him.
Do you want to tell me that I'm responsible for my sister becoming a junkie?
Do you want to tell me that?
No.
I can't pretend to know that.
So, Mom, you wanted Keith to tie this up in a big bow?
Kate slept with George, so Sarah became a junkie?
Well, I'm sorry!
(sobbing):
If that helps you sleep at night, then fine.
Honey...
Can you tell me what I did wrong?
Because I...
I don't know.
I...
I don't understand.
They're both so...
My daughters are both so unhappy.
(crying):
Tell me... tell me what we can do.
Tell me...
I can fix it, I can... if you tell me what I can do.
Mrs. Garber, I...
I can fix it.
I can't say you did anything wrong.
I'm sorry.
We've been here before.
Sometimes, all we can do is just not enough.
But have we done everything, turned over every stone?
Bro, we hit every shooting gallery in the hood.
This shit is blowing up.
Everywhere we went, it's all people are looking for:
Blue Dust.
SWENTON:
I mean, it's cheap.
You know, cheap, tasty, plentiful... that's hard to beat.
Even if it's killing people.
Well, we're on Sarah now, okay?
We can't help everyone.
Sarah Garber needs us.
So... no job, no car, no phone.
No family, either.
Ex-fianc?
was no help, brother.
He's happy he's moved on.
He couldn't get off the phone fast enough.
All right, well...
here's what we're gonna do.
Darnell, I want you, and I want...
Hold on a second.
Yeah?
Hey, sweetheart.
Okay, got it.
Thank, thank you.
Be safe.
Bye.
Divine intervention.
That was my girl, Cleo.
Says she saw a girl matching Sarah's description walking the corner of Santa Monica and Las Palmas.
(groans) First timers.
That's where the trannies hook.
Not today, baby.
Ugh.
Come on.
Hey, you got 50 bucks?
Sarah, we're here to help you.
Well, hello, and welcome to Transitions.
How can I help you on this fine, beautiful day?
Just cut the crap.
Where is she?
Right now, I know that you would do anything to step outside your body.
Even for a few seconds.
Even a split second.
'Cause it doesn't matter, nothing matters.
You would give anything.
I'm sorry, I don't know who you're talking about.
Sarah Garber.
William has her.
It's kidnapping.
I warned him.
And the police are on their way.
See, I know it because I've lived it.
I know the pain.
I know that need that comes from some dark, sick place that you didn't even know you had inside.
And I also know that right now you would just as soon die rather than ignore that need.
BOWEN:
She's here.
I know she's here.
I know how William does things and this time, he's not going to get away with it.
Help yourself.
Really, go ahead.
We don't have anything to hide.
Oh, and try the coffee.
I can't do this.
I know.
Not by yourself.
I tried-- it's, it's almost impossible.
And that's why we're here.
So let me help you, Sarah.
Please, let me help you.
This isn't over.
Wherever he is, it's still kidnapping.
You understand?
No matter where he has Stop!
taken her, I will have him arrested for...
Stop, please!
Stop.
This is about my daughter.
Paula, of course it is.
That is why...
No!
All I want to know is if Sarah is okay.
Not about Mr. Banks, not about you.
And if Sarah... if she isn't your main interest, then you don't belong here.
She is my main interest.
Then start acting like it!
I'll be outside.
Do you know anything about my daughter?
I know she's in the best hands.
He has her?
Not here.
Someplace safe.
Here.
Hello?
There are no promises, Mrs. Garber.
Not for any of us.
And not for anyone fighting a demon like this.
So we have her.
We'll detox her, and hopefully get her mind to a place where she can make better choices.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Don't thank me yet.
DARNELL:
And it hit me when I heard William talk to that girl in that room.
I know it now.
This is where the Lord wants me.
I belong doing this, Jeannie.
But I believe He brought us together, too.
So you've been doing this, um...
What do you call them?
Interventions.
Although with William, maybe not quite the way you might have heard about them.
So you lied about working at the car lot?
No, I've been working at the lot, too.
I've been trying to do both.
You know, to do this thing, this mission, Jeannie.
And still keep a nine-to-five, but...
I'm not a nine-to-five guy.
And I couldn't live with not telling you all of this.
It was eating me up.
Darnell, I respect you.
Your doing this--
I do-- this is... exactly the kind of man I imagined you to be.
Except...
Baby, I don't know if there's...
Jeannie, Jeannie, wait...
Let me speak.
The life you have right now... honestly, I'm not sure there's room in it for me.
Or a relationship, or anything.
No, no-- that's not true.
Be honest.
We both deserve that.
I can do both.
But I'm not sure I can.
What I think I need, even if he's not helping people the way you do I need that nine-to-five guy.
You started this, you should finish.
Sarah's in a different place now.
She's scar.
Scared is okay.
Scared's good.
It's true.
Being decent this one time, doing the right thing... doesn't change my opinion of you.
We still have nothing in common.
Except Sarah.
Maybe she'll be one of the lucky 25 percent we do save.
WILLIAM:
So maybe you want to fill me in on that?
If I'm doing your work, why is it?
Why do he and I have the same rate of success?
And failure?
You want the real deal?
Pretty girl like you?
You've come to the right place.
Okay.
Now I know this is uncomfortable.
But we do this together.
We make her feel safe.
We all ready?
You ready for this?
Yeah.
Yeah.
-Wait for my word.
-All right.
Sarah, honey.
Honey.
What is this?
Sarah, welcome.
I'm Keith Bowen.
Have a seat.
Hey, Banks.
Read my lips.
Go ahead.
I'll take you for everything you got.
No, no, 'cause see, I'm done.
We're all done.
Your friends, your family, your agent, the studio.
All of us.
So, here it is, Chris, you're going to jail.
-Yeah, right.
-Oh, you don't think so?
You're holding, right?
One rock-- that's possession.
That's mandatory arrest.
Two or more?
That's possession with intent.
That's mandatory jail time.
Who... who are you?
Mom, what's going on?
I was retained by your family.
You gotta be kidding me.
Now, I've taken the time, like everyone else here.
-This is bullshit.
-No, no.
No, there are people here that love you.
Mom...
Sarah, baby, listen, please... we're all here to support you.
And you know how much we love you.
And to tell you that now's the time that's come for you to listen, Sarah.
So, please, take a seat.
Who is this moron?
You're not a cop.
No, you're right about that.
But my friend here is.
Do it.
See that?
I've got more friends than you.
All right, point made.
-Sarah!
-Sarah!
Sarah!
I'm the one who called him, not your sister.
Baby, I don't know what to do with you anymore.
-You need help!
-For once in your life, think about somebody else!
Let's be calm.
Remember why we are here.
No, there's no point to be made, all right?
I'm done.
You don't give a damn, I don't give a damn.
Get him outta here.
No, no, no.
No, wait, wait!
Wait!
This is a joke, right?
You were paid!
No, I washed my hands of it, all right?
I gave it all back.
But don't worry, tough guy like you you should be fine in County.
Sarah, no more money, no more handouts, no more lying.
It's time for everyone to be truth-tellers-- everyone.
You don't know what you're talking about.
No, this is not about me.
It's about you and the people who love you.
We mean it.
Both of us, Sarah.
Okay!
Okay.
Okay what?
All you have to do is sit and listen to the people who love you.
It's not so hard.
This is bullshit!
I'm outta here!
Whatever you say.
Just so we understand:
You stay... my rules.
Say yes.
Yes.
What kind
-of contract?
-We decide.
You and me.
We negotiate.
We make a peace treaty.
Look, you have your points.
I have mine.
We talk it out, we find a middle ground.
Just-just like in business.
Or countries at war.
Okay.
So where's Mom in all this?
She's Switzerland.
And this... this negotiation-- it includes everything?
Football?
Everything is on the table, Ben.
lncluding football.
So bring your A-game.
I'm no pushover.
We have a deal?
Not yet.
We'll negotiate.
Go ahead.
Meeting's over.
This is William Banks.
Anger like this in a heroin addict is unusual, especially when you're high.
What do you mean, unusual?
Well, I mean, heroin-- you know, you-you kick back, you chill.
You're floating on a cloud.
You're not lookin' for a fight.
Definitely not starting one.
Spoils the ride.
And Sarah didn't start the fight.
Oh, Mom.
She didn't.
You-you pushed her, she reacted.
I didn't push, Mom.
I was honest.
Look, that's been the problem, we haven't pushed enough.
Oh, I've pushed.
All the time.
You don't know.
I'm her mother.
You girls are my life.
Look, Mom, you don't sleep.
You don't eat.
You're worried all the time.
You can't do another year of this.
Sarah was a good girl.
Both my girls are good girls.
It's true, Kate.
She was a good sister.
She-she was smart, she had nice friends, she succeeded at everything, until... ls there something else I need to know?
No.
Again, I'm sorry to come back unannounced.
I just needed to have one more look.
I have no reason to think it won't assess per the comps of the neighborhood-- maybe even
-on the high end.
-That would be wonderful!
Maybe.
No promises.
I'm sorry, um, busy day today.
Mm-hmm.
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Not at all.
First door on the left.
-Thanks.
-When I spoke to you on the phone,
Mr. Banks, I mentioned another interventionist.
Keith Bowen.
I know him.
Yeah, my mom is still working with him.
Oh, really?
Yes.
Well, this was Kate's idea, to meet with you-- not mine.
I got Mr. Bowen's name from my doctor.
And I was assured that he was very good.
And-And everything was working fine until Kate spoke up, and did exactly what we were not supposed to do.
I'm-I'm sorry, I'm just a little confused about...
My mother wants to continue working with Mr. Bowen in spite of his failure, but since you come
-so highly recommended, I...
-Right.
-But if you already have someone...
-Someone who can't even sit my sister down and now she's
God knows where.
Look, we haven't seen her.
I talked to her boss Harvey.
She hasn't been in the office in five days.
She hasn't checked in.
They're getting pissed.
And no one seems to be able to help her.
Please don't say no.
You said yes.
Yeah.
All right, well, yes is fine.
Yes and pro bono, not so much.
Relax, I talked to the sister, Kate, she cut a deposit.
All right, well, I'm in.
Okay, but Keith Bowen?
I say give the money back.
Say we're booked.
And we are.
Who's Keith Bowen?
Keith Bowen, bro, is the second-fastest gun in the West, all right?
Second.
Guys, we're not competitors, all right?
-We're in the same trade.
-Yeah.
No, like, uh, Sherlock Holmes, Batman-- in the same trade.
-Swenton...
-He's right.
I mean, you and Bowen, bad juju.
-You forget.
-Look... let's rein it in here, guys, all right?
Bowen is irrelevant.
It's about the client.
Everybody got that?
The drug is heroin.
The mark is Sarah Garber, the source is unknown.
So, Swenton, I want you on the street-- find out what the brand du jour is.
Word is that players are chipping something new.
Yeah, I know, um, I can start with the HK Rollers.
Some bad boys.
-Okay, I'll go with him.
-No, I want you on the mark's job.
-Okay, I can do both.
-Uh, you know what?
If I can go on the record here?
I really appreciate the help.
I think I can handle this one
-by myself.
-Figure it out.
D...
I'm still at the safe house watching our little movie star.
Cool.
Where it's nice and quiet.
Now make sure you bring your laptop.
While you're sitting on Chris, I want you to download me on the mother, the mark, the sister.
Give me the financials-- work, DMV, all of that.
-Got it.
-Are we gonna reach out to Bowen?
-Considering the history there?
-No.
It's not about Bowen.
Look, guys, Sarah's been in the wind for five days, so the quicker we get on this, the quicker we can find her.
Go.
Hi, it's Sarah.
Leave a message.
Sarah, it's Harvey.
I'm here in the office with two very unhappy clients.
You were supposed to be at an appointment on Cloverdale two hours ago.
Please call me back as soon as you can.
Needless to say, you're no longer on the Cloverdale listing.
Look, snorting's cool and all, don't get me wrong.
You really want to enjoy the ride and catch the sights along the way?
If you ain't tapping' a vein, you're just hooverin' toot.
...20-year-old wunderkind against Chicago's veteran from
Staten Island, David Ortiz.
Los Angeles and Chicago scored a couple of runs apiece in the eight inning...
You gonna just stand there, or you gonna hand me that five-eighths socket wrench?
No, I'm gonna stand here.
And LA evened the score on a two-run bomb by...
Suit yourself.
Now we find ourselves all even in the bottom half of the ninth inning...
My client's sister seems determined to retain you.
Yeah, well, there's no explaining good taste, right?
Well, this is about the best interests of all involved.
Meaning yours or hers?
They're one and the same.
All right.
So, let me be clear.
If you take my client against her will,
I will have you arrested for kidnapping.
That's an awful lot of bark, Keith.
How's your bite?
Do yourself a favor, Banks.
Leave this to the professionals.
You or your "calling" aren't needed.
Aw.
And they say time heals all wounds.
Well, they were wrong.
You've been warned.
Once again, the runners will be going on three and two, goes out of the stretch, checks the runners...
Promise not to hit him.
Down and away, it's ball three...
Yeah, I know.
I know.
Well, it's not what I want.
Look, my boss has got me on three different jobs, Jeannie.
Please understand, all right?
So, the aunt who needed an operation...?
It's just that...
Darnell...
Listen to me, please.
Even when you're with me,
I don't feel like you're really with me.
It's just a hard time, that's all.
Look, can I call you later?
I think you need to do some soul-searching, D.
I really do.
Oh, please don't give up on us, all right?
I'm gonna explain everything, I promise, baby, all right?
All good, big man?
Yeah.
All right, listen up, guys, we got a new plan.
We're on the Sarah Garber job, full-court press.
Bowen push your buttons?
What do we know?
Her finances are all messed up.
So's her job.
She's a real estate assessor.
Her boss has had it with her.
Any day, she's toast.
All right, D, I want you to track her cell phone.
Got it.
What else?
Uh, you were right.
HK Rollers got a new product called Blue Dust.
That seems to be the unanimous taste sensation.
It's got hopheads lining up at drive-through windows all over the place.
That, and then, of course, there's the shooting galleries for the tourists who don't know any better.
And the bottom feeders who don't have cars.
So, if she's there?
It's a different play.
Rollers don't like strangers, right?
Yeah, so if we start flashing her picture, we don't get through the door.
Then don't flash her picture.
All right, let's get inside, get eyes on, and make the rounds.
Cool.
You want us to score?
Whatever it takes.
Akani, I want you on the sister.
Uh, I'm doing the rounds with Swenton.
No.
Start with this.
Bowen's been withholding information.
My guess is, the mother and sister Kate will be doing the same thing.
Okay.
Uh, just so we're clear, Bowen didn't push your buttons?
Hello?
Sarah, you missed another...
No, no, I'm on my way.
-Sarah, listen to me.
-Harvey...
-These are very important clients.
-I'm five minutes away.
I'll call them myself.
Where have you been?
Hi.
It's Sarah.
Leave a message.
Uh, hey, Sarah, this is Harvey.
I'm calling you back because...
well, you cut me off.
There's no easy way to put this, Sarah, and I hate to do it over the phone, but... we're gonna have to let you go.
You're constantly late, you show up at random listings that aren't even yours.
And it's just not working, Sarah.
If you're having some personal problems,
I hope that you get through them.
And I do wish you the best in whatever it is you're gonna do next, but...
Again, I'm sorry to do this over the phone, but I didn't even know if I'd ever see you again.
All right, take care, Sarah.
Call a cab?
Perfect.
Call the police, please?
Breaking and entering is a crime, William.
Do it.
Make the call.
Hold on a second.
It's not a crime if I have family authorization.
Then why didn't they give you the key?
Or unless you prefer breaking in.
Look, it's your ass I'm trying to save.
You do what you got to do.
Oh, no.
I shall, but it won't be my ass that I'm saving.
You can spin it any way you want, man.
Me, I'll be getting the job done.
Akani?
Yeah?
Download me on the sister.
I haven't done it yet.
I'm with Swenton.
I thought I told you...
I know what you said.
I'm here.
Is there something I need to know about Swenton?
No.
I'll get the work done, William.
Just forget it.
I'll handle it.
I can give you five minutes.
Hey.
Listen, uh, I'm only as good as the info you give me.
What do you mean?
Where does he fit in?
He doesn't.
No, no-- you gotta give me more than that.
They were engaged.
George gave her a choice:
drugs or marriage.
She said one thing, did another, and he left.
And that's it?
Yeah, and I'm glad he left, if that matters.
It was the one positive that came out of all this.
It wouldn't have been a very good marriage.
How out-of-the-picture is he?
Totally.
He moved to Texas, he's engaged again.
Look, all of this happened two years ago.
I mean, how can it mean anything?
Well, it does.
It all does.
Did you find anything out?
I did, as a matter of fact.
She got fired from her job today.
They called her boss and reported it.
Oh!
-Thank you.
-Yes, mm-hmm.
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.
That...
I...
You know, at least I...
I-I know she's alive.
I guess fired is the least of it.
Every time the phone rings, I expect the worst.
That can happen.
I understand how hard this is.
Oh, I-I really appreciate your understanding.
-You're not alone.
-You are not alone.
You know, my daughter Kate has retained another interventionist, William Banks.
I know.
He won't be helpful.
He thinks he's been anointed by God.
-Well, my daughter thinks...
-It's okay.
Just keep me apprised.
So, I'll keep digging.
For what?
So we can find her.
ls that a problem?
No.
No, of course not.
She'll need money more than ever.
Which means she'll come to you.
And you can't give it to her, no matter what she says, no matter what she does.
Can you do that?
I need you to do that.
-I'll try.
-I'll try.
I need you to do that.
Okay?
I should get back.
Listen, Kate, if I find her,
I can make a difference, but she will need your help.
I hired you, didn't I?
I don't know what went wrong, I...
I thought I was such a good mother.
You still are.
You're not alone, Paula.
You're not alone.
Okay?
Yo, yo, I triangulated a signal, got an address, and I found it in a bush.
That's great work, D.
This girl is definitely falling apart.
I believe this is the part where somebody says, "Bingo!"
Or-Or "Eureka!"
We, uh...
We-We found the car.
Uh, came up on a DMV hit.
Ticketed, no wheels.
-It's in a garage in Compton.
-Compton?
Why do you think home girl's all dressed up?
Shut up, Swenton.
We're backtracking with the tow company, finding where they picked it up.
My guess is it leads to this.
Blue Dust.
Excuse me.
Hey, Officer Herman, you got my message.
Listen, I wanted to tell you...
Yeah, we need to talk, William.
Bowen?
-Called us.
-Pressed charges?
Pressed charges.
This is bullshit, all right?
I'm working for the family of the girl that lives there.
Okay.
No sweat.
Have her come in and make a statement, and the BE goes away.
I can't, all right?
She's points unknown.
Look, the complainant-- he's got an ax to grind.
We shared a job a while back.
And things got a little weird.
He thinks I made him look bad.
He's got his Ph.D. panties all in a twist.
Just the same...
You can't actually be taking this seriously.
Witnesses tie our hands, William.
The landlord saw you enter and exit.
You play it fast-and-Ioose like this,
I can't have your back.
No one can.
Truthfully, we all thought you were a little smoother than this.
All right, my bad.
I'll fix it, all right?
I'll talk to Bowen, see if we can't act like adults.
-All right?
-Yeah?
'Cause under normal circumstances, you and I would be taking
-a ride.
-I got it, I got it.
-Okay?
-Yeah?
I'm sorry.
Look, one more thing, though.
You got anything on this?
Blue Dust?
Yeah, the guys in the unit are calling this Blue Death.
Bag's made in China for some toy company.
But it's laced with pesticides.
It's how they make the plastics-- who knew?
You smoke the shit in this bag, and your lungs bleed.
You do enough of it, you drown in your own blood.
Blue Death.
If your client's been using that, you might want to check the morgue.
Thanks.
What, do you think
I need a baby-sitter for this?
If the diaper fits...
-What, do you think I'm using?
-I know you did.
Once, all right?
Okay?
Once.
And that was just to keep my cover with the lnland Kings, all right, so I didn't blow the case, all right?
But now, I'm not, so all is good in my world, all right?
So maybe you can do me a favor and get off your broom.
Okay, I won't be your baby-sitter.
Terrif.
Just think of me as your bodyguard.
No, no, no, no.
It's not like that at all, Jeannie...
We all good?
-Nothing I can't handle.
-Look...
Hey, D, I want you to track down that ex-fiancé ASAP, all right?
I want the whole story.
-There's still some missing pieces.
-Now?
You got something else to do?
Get it done.
-All right, listen up.
-Sorry, Jeannie.
This Blue Dust-- it's killing people.
Right?
It's very dangerous shit.
You two, go to wherever they're slinging it, all right?
I want you to find Sarah.
-It's gonna be dark soon.
-And?
Oh, well, you know, Roller territory, night-- it's not exactly a place for a lady.
-Akani?
-Good thing I'm not a lady.
There you go.
Just in case, go strapped.
I'm gonna make a pit stop, then I'm gonna go visit a certain colleague of mine, maybe try to dance with the mom after that.
You need me, call me.
-Darnell?
-Yo.
Maybe you should check the morgue.
All right.
Swenton?
50 bucks.
Fifty?
Fifty?
This...
this is a Vera Wang.
Vera Wang?
Never heard of her.
50 bucks.
Come on, man.
At least $100.
I mean, this is a $15,000 dress.
I was gonna get married in this dress.
Married.
This look like a bridal shop to you?
Any woman sees this, trust me, you can ask any price you want.
A dress like this, it's... is not about the money, believe me.
Come on, have a heart.
50 bucks.
Take it or leave it.
Seventy-five.
Hey, babe.
He's waiting.
Can I take a second to kiss my wife?
Yes.
Mmm...
This was good, William.
A really good idea.
Well, let's...
let's see how it goes, all right?
Wish me luck.
You know what I mean...
Half a gram, Blue Dust.
Hey, my homegirl, you seen her?
White girl, blonde hair?
Your loss, bro, she's hot.
Let's go.
Hey, pal.
-You ready?
-How do you want to start?
Big items first, work our way down?
How's that sound?
Okay.
Age before beauty, I'll start.
First item: non-negotiable.
You're my son.
I love you, and nothing's ever going to change that.
Nothing, ever.
Your turn.
Okay... well...
Ah, you see that?
I got you, right, kind of threw you?
That's-That's part of negotiating.
Okay, seriously, I think you know what I want.
No, you...
Ben, you have to tell me what you want.
All right?
That's... that's how this works.
I thought you were bringing your A-game, man.
Football.
I want you to keep playing.
And I don't.
Ben, all right, look.
This... this is a negotiation, all right?
You have to make a case for what you want.
All right, you have to convince me or I'm gonna clean the table with you, so make your case.
Okay.
Point one.
Point one?
You told me to bring my A-game.
Yes, I did.
Yes, I did.
Yeah, Jeannie, it's me, Darnell.
Hey, um, listen,
I know things are strange with us, a little distance between us, and, uh... and so if you get a chance, could you call me?
You know what, no.
Maybe we can meet me in person, so we, uh... we could do it in person, you know, talk and work things out.
I really want to work things out, girl, okay?
Call me, please.
Thing is, Ben, if I give in on this point, and that's a very big if, then you have to give something back.
Like what?
One:
You have to promise me and your mother you'll never do anything stupid like running away again-- let me finish.
Two:
You have to replace something for football.
All right?
I don't care what it is.
Drama, school band, track, whatever.
It doesn't matter to me.
The point is, you're not just gonna be chilling around in your room like some kind of well-fed house pet.
What else?
That's it.
You do that, keep up your grades, then maybe me and you can work on my old truck, trick it out a little bit.
And then I can keep it?
You keep your grades up, no hanging around the house, find something to do with yourself... yeah.
Deal.
All right.
What are you doing?
Sarah, where have you been?
-Sarah...
-Leave me alone.
What, you're stealing now?
-No, just...
-Stealing?
!
That's what it's called.
Look... all you had to do was ask.
But no...
Oh, my God, you are pathetic.
You are a pathetic, selfish little bitch.
You don't care about Mom.
All you care about is yourself.
No!
Sarah, give me that!
You've lost it.
No!
No!
No!
Get off me.
Sarah...!
Leave me alone.
Sarah, no!
-No!
-Get away from me!
Sarah!
I'm a bitch?
I'm gonna call the police.
I'm a bitch?
!
Sarah, no!
Sarah!
Sarah!
Sarah!
Sarah!
Hey.
You called the cops on me?
You know, people have rights, Will.
You break into their personal property
-Iike a criminal...
-You don't like how I do things, that's tough, all right?
I stay out of your way, you stay out of mine.
You're not an interventionist, you're just...
-some kind of street thug.
-That's right, Doctor.
I didn't learn what I know from some classroom.
I didn't read it in some book, I lived it.
Maybe that's why I give a shit.
Oh, spare me the ex-addict sob story.
You only took this case to one-up me.
We both know what you really give a shit about.
Oh, you want to make this personal, Keith, huh?
Fine.
You know what your problem is, man?
Your big-time degrees, they don't make a bit of difference.
Not in this case, not in a single one.
That's your problem, all right, 'cause you got the same 75% failure rate that I do, and that just pisses you off
-to no end.
-No, don't do that.
Don't even compare what we do.
I've seen how you work, what you do.
I've paid the price, and it's not happening again.
You paid the price?
What is with you, man?
That is ancient history, all right?
One client, one time, chose me over you.
So what?
You know, if your clients meant as much to you as your stellar reputation...
-you know what...?
-Ex-addict, ex-junkie, direct line to God.
Answer me this.
If God is on your side, why isn't your success rate any better than mine?
Are we done here?
Because I don't do meetings like this.
It's not a calling, William.
It's a job.
A job that requires professionals.
I didn't hit him...
but next time.
See, girl?
That there...
It's the real deal.
She was gonna hit me, Mom.
She would've killed me after everything
-that we've done.
-Oh, Kate, she wouldn't have hurt you, not if she was in her real mind.
Mom, you have got to come to terms with this.
This is who Sarah is now-- the drugs have her.
-For now.
-No, forever.
If you give up on her, yes.
She's still my baby.
She's still my Sarah.
That wasn't her.
That wasn't her, Kate.
You know that; you know what happened to her.
Mom, this has got nothing to do with it.
Sarah wasn't always like this.
No one is.
What happened?
Kate, I need to know the facts about your sister-- what happened?
You hired him, Kate.
-You should tell him.
-No!
Sarah and George were engaged.
They... they were planning
-a wedding.
-Ugh... this is bullshit.
Well, he should know.
If you really want Mr. Banks to help, then he should know.
Pretty girl like you shouldn't track up your skin.
Kate and George slept together.
There's this convenient family myth that says that's why my sister became a heroin addict.
You were confused, George was...
Mom, I'll tell you what George was.
George hated Sarah.
Sarah chose drugs over him.
Before anything else happened, that was the decision she made, okay?
Yes, I slept with him.
Do you want to tell me that I'm responsible for my sister becoming a junkie?
Do you want to tell me that?
No.
I can't pretend to know that.
So, Mom, you wanted Keith to tie this up in a big bow?
Kate slept with George, so Sarah became a junkie?
Well, I'm sorry!
If that helps you sleep at night, then fine.
Honey...
Can you tell me what I did wrong?
Because I...
I don't know.
I...
I don't understand.
They're both so...
My daughters are both so unhappy.
Tell me... tell me what I can do.
Tell me...
I can fix it, I can... if you tell me what I can do.
-Mrs.
Garber, I...
-I can fix it.
I can't say you did anything wrong.
I'm sorry.
We've been here before.
Sometimes, all we can do is just not enough.
But have we done everything, turned over every stone?
Bro, we hit every shooting gallery in the hood.
This shit is blowing up.
Everywhere we went, it's all people are looking for:
Blue Dust.
I mean, it's cheap.
You know, cheap, tasty, plentiful... that's hard to beat.
-Even if it's killing people.
-Well, we're on
Sarah now, okay?
We can't help everyone.
Sarah Garber needs us.
So... no job, no car,
-no phone.
-No family, either.
Ex-fiancé was no help, brother.
He's happy he's moved on.
He couldn't get off the phone fast enough.
All right, well...
here's what we're gonna do.
Darnell, I want you, and I want...
Hold on a second.
Yeah?
Hey, sweetheart.
Okay, got it.
Well, thank, thank you.
Be safe.
Bye.
Divine intervention.
That was my girl, Cleo.
Says she saw a girl matching Sarah's description walking the corner of Santa Monica and Las Palmas.
First timers.
That's where the trannies hook.
Not today, baby.
Ugh.
-Come on.
-Sober up first.
Hey, you got 50 bucks?
I'll go with you for 50.
Sarah, we're here to help you.
Well, hello, and welcome to Transitions.
How can I help you on this fine, beautiful day?
Just cut the crap.
Where is she?
Right now, I know that you would do anything to step outside your body.
Even for a few seconds.
Even a split second.
'Cause it doesn't matter, nothing matters.
You would give anything.
I'm sorry, I don't know who you're talking about.
Sarah Garber.
William has her.
It's kidnapping.
I warned him.
And the police are on their way.
See, I know it because I've lived it.
I know the pain.
I know that need that comes from some dark, sick place that you didn't even know you had inside.
And I also know that right now you would just as soon die rather than ignore that need.
She's here.
I know she's here.
I know how William does things and this time, he's not going to get away with it.
Help yourself.
Really, go ahead.
We don't have anything to hide.
Oh, oh...
and try the coffee.
I can't do it.
I know.
Not by yourself.
I tried-- it's, it's almost impossible.
And that's why we're here.
So let me help you, Sarah.
Please, let me help you.
This isn't over.
Wherever he is, it's still kidnapping.
-You understand?
No matter where he has
-Stop!
-taken her, I will have him arrested for...
-Stop, please!
Stop.
This is about my daughter.
Paula, of course it is.
That is why...
No!
All I want to know is if Sarah is okay.
Not about Mr. Banks, not about you.
And if Sarah... if she isn't your main interest, then you don't belong here.
She is my main interest.
Then start acting like it!
I'll be outside.
Do you know anything about my daughter?
I know she's in the best hands.
He has her?
Not here.
Someplace safe.
Here.
Hello?
There are no promises,
Mrs. Garber.
Not for any of us.
And not for anyone fighting a demon like this.
So we have her.
We'll detox her, and... hopefully get her mind to a place where she can make better choices.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Don't thank me yet.
And it hit me when I heard William talk to that girl in that room.
I know it now.
This is where the Lord wants me.
I mean, I belong doing this, Jeannie.
But I believe He brought us together, too.
So you've been doing this, um... what do you call them?
"lnterventions."
Although with William, maybe not quite the way you might have heard about them.
So you lied about working at the car lot?
No, I've been working at the lot, too.
I've been trying to do both.
You know, to do this thing, this mission, Jeannie.
And still keep a nine-to-five, but I'm not a nine-to-five guy.
And I couldn't live with not telling you all of this.
It was eating me up.
Darnell, I respect you.
Your doing this--
I do-- this is... exactly the kind of man I imagined you to be.
Except...
Baby, I don't know if there's...
Oh, Jeannie, Jeannie, wait...
Let me speak.
The life you have right now... honestly, I'm not sure there's room in it for me.
Or a relationship, or anything.
No, no, listen-- that's not true.
Be honest.
We both deserve that.
I can do both.
But I'm not sure I can.
What I think I need, even if he's not helping people the way you do I need that nine-to-five guy.
You started this, you should finish.
Sarah's in a different place now.
She's scared.
Scared is okay.
Scared's good.
It's true.
Being decent this one time, doing the right thing... doesn't change my opinion of you.
We still have nothing in common.
Except Sarah.
Maybe she'll be one of the lucky 25% we do save.
Shall we?
So maybe you want to fill me in on that?
If I'm doing your work, why is it?
Why do he and I have the same rate of success?
And failure?
Previously on The Cleaner:
So you met this girl online?
That's right.
Jeannie, I am a car salesman.
My hours are difficult to explain.
I'm trying to make some extra money for my auntie.
She needs an operation.
It's work, Jeannie.
I should go, baby.
You want to put the Lord on hold?
I'm quitting football.
It's not up for discussion.
You can't make this decision for me.
I've already made it.
I'm quitting.
Sit down-- we're eating dinner.
Ben...
I said sit down!
What is he, five years old?
Running away from home to my father's house?
Why don't you come home.
I'm not coming home.
I can only apologize to you so many times.
You gotta let it go, man.
It's gone.
William!
I cannot smoke this.
Hit it.
SWENTON:
Help me.
I'm sorry.
Please come home.
Okay.
Now, I know this is uncomfortable.
But we do this together.
We make her feel safe.
We all ready?
You ready for this?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wait for my word.
All right.
Sarah, honey.
Honey.
What is this?
Sarah, welcome.
I'm Keith Bowen.
Have a seat.
Hey, Banks.
Read my lips.
Go ahead.
I'll take you for everything you got.
No, no, see, 'cause I'm done.
We're all done.
Your friends, your family, your agent, the studio.
All of us.
So, here it is, Chris, you're going to jail.
Yeah, right.
Oh, you don't think so?
You're holding, right?
One rock-- that's possession.
That's mandatory arrest.
Two or more?
That's possession with intent.
That's mandatory jail time.
Who... who are you?
Mom, what's going on?
I was retained by your family.
You gotta be kidding me.
BOWEN:
Now, I've taken the time, like everyone else here.
This is bullshit.
No, no.
No, there are people here that love you.
(under breath):
Mom...
Sarah, baby, listen, please...
We're all here to support you.
And you know how much we love you.
And to tell you that now the time has come for you to listen, Sarah.
So, please, take a seat.
Who is this moron?
You're not a cop.
No, you're right about that.
But my friend here is.
Do it.
See that?
I've got more friends than you.
All right, point made.
Sarah!
Sarah!
Sarah,
I'm the one who called him, not your sister.
Baby, I don't know what to do with you anymore.
You need help!
For once in your life, think about somebody else!
Let's be calm.
Remember why we are here.
No, there's no point to be made, all right?
I'm done.
You don't give a damn, I don't give a damn.
Get him out of here.
No, no, no.
No, wait, wait!
Wait!
This is a joke, right?
You were paid!
No, I washed my hands of it, all right.
I gave it all back.
Don't worry, tough guy like you should be fine in County.
Sarah, no more money, no more handouts, no more lying.
It's time for everyone to be truth-tellers-- everyone.
You don't know what you're talking about.
This is not about me.
It's about you and the people who love you.
We mean it.
Both of us, Sarah.
Okay!
Okay.
Okay what?
All you have to do is sit and listen to the people who love you.
It's not so hard.
This is bullshit!
I'm out of here!
Whatever you say.
Just so we understand:
You stay... my rules.
Say yes.
Yes.

What kind of contract?
We decide.
You and me.
We negotiate.
We make a peace treaty.
Look, you have your points.
I have mine.
We talk it out, we find a middle ground.
Just-just like in business.
Or countries at war.
Okay.
So where's Mom in all this?
She's Switzerland.
And this... this negotiation-- it includes everything?
Football?
Everything is on the table, Ben, including football-- so bring your A-game.
I'm no pushover.
We have a deal?
Not yet.
We'll negotiate.
Go ahead.
Meeting's over.
This is William Banks.
Anger like this in a heroin addict is unusual, especially when you're high.
What do you mean, unusual?
Well, I mean, heroin-- you know, you kick back, you chill.
You're floating on a cloud.
You're not lookin' for a fight.
Definitely not starting one.
Spoils the ride.
And Sarah didn't start the fight.
Oh, Mom.
She didn't.
You-you pushed her, she reacted.
I didn't push, Mom.
I was honest.
(sighs)
Look, that's been the problem, we haven't pushed enough.
PAULA:
Oh, I've pushed.
All the time.
You don't know.
I'm her mother.
You girls are my life.
Look, Mom, you don't sleep.
You don't eat.
You're worried all the time.
You can't do another year of this.
Sarah was a good girl.
Both of my girls are good girls.
It's true, Kate.
She was a good sister.
She-she was smart, she had nice friends, she succeeded at everything, until...
Is there something else I need to know?
No.
Again, I'm sorry to come back unannounced.
I just need to have one more look.
I have no reason to think it won't assess per the comps of the neighborhood.
I'm sorry, um, busy day today.
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Not at all.
First door on the left.
Thanks.
When I spoke to you on the phone,
Mr. Banks, I mentioned another interventionist.
Keith Bowen.
I know him.
Yeah, my mom is still working with him.
Oh, really?
Yes.
Well, this was Kate's idea, to meet with you-- not mine.
I got Mr. Bowen's name from my doctor.
And I was assured that he was very good.
And everything was working fine until Kate spoke up, and did exactly what we were not supposed to do.
I'm-I'm sorry, I'm just a little confused about...
My mother wants to continue working with Mr. Bowen in spite of his failure, but since you come so highly recommended, I...
Right.
But if you already have someone...
Someone who can't even sit my sister down and now she's
God knows where.
Look, we haven't seen her.
I talked to her boss Harvey.
She hasn't been in the office in five days.
She hasn't checked in.
They're getting pissed.
And no one seems to be able to help her.
Please don't say no.
You said yes.
Yeah.
All right, well, yes is fine.
Yes and pro bono,not so much.
Relax, I talked to the sister, Kate, she cut a deposit.
All right, well, I'm in.
Okay, but Keith Bowen?
I say give the money back.
Say we're booked.
And we are.
Who's Keith Bowen?
Keith Bowen, bro, is the second-fastest gun in the West, all right?
Second.
Guys, we're not competitors, all right?
We're in the same trade.
Yeah, no, like, uh, Sherlock Holmes, Batman-- in the same trade.
Swenton...
He's right.
You and Bowen, bad juju.
You forget.
Look, let's rein it in here, guys, all right?
Bowen is irrelevant.
It's about the client.
Everybody got that?
The drug is heroin.
The mark is Sarah Garber, the source is unknown.
So, Swenton, I want you on the street-- find out what the brand du jour is.
Word is that players are chipping something new.
Yeah, I know, um, I can start with the HK Rollers.
Some bad boys.
I'll go with him.
No, I want you on the mark's job.
I can do both.
Uh, you know what?
If I can go on the record here?
I really appreciate the help.
I think I can handle this one by myself.
Figure it out.
D...
I'm still at the safe house watching our little movie star.
Cool.
Where it's nice and quiet.
Now make sure you bring your laptop.
While you're sitting on Chris, I want you to download on the mother, the mark, the sister.
Give me the financials-- work, DMV, all of that.
Got it.
Are we gonna reach out to Bowen?
Considering the history there?
No.
It's not about Bowen.
Look, guys, Sarah's been in the wind for five days, so the quicker we get on this, the quicker we can find her.
Go.
Hi, it's Sarah.
Leave a message.
Sarah, it's Harvey.
I'm here in the office with two very unhappy clients.
You were supposed to be at an appointment on Cloverdale two hours ago.
Please call me back as soon as you can.
Needless to say, you're no longer on the Cloverdale listing.
Look, snorting's cool and all, don't get me wrong.
You really want to enjoy the ride and catch the sights along the way?
If you ain't tapping' a vein, it's hooverin' toot.
You gonna just stand there, or you gonna hand me that five-eighths socket wrench?
No, I'm gonna stand here.
Suit yourself.
My client's sister seems determined to retain you.
Yeah, well, there's no explaining good taste, right?
Well, this is about the best interests of all involved.
Meaning yours or hers?
They're one and the same.
All right.
So, let me be clear.
If you take my client against her will,
I will have you arrested for kidnapping.
That's an awful lot of bark, Keith.
How's your bite?
Do yourself a favor, Banks.
Leave this to the professionals.
You or your "calling" aren't needed.
Aw.
And they say time heals all wounds.
And they were wrong.
You've been warned.
Promise not to hit him.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
Well, it's not what I want.
Look, my boss has got me on three differenjobs, Jeannie.
Please understand, all right?
So, the aunt who needed an operation...?
(sighs) It's just that...
Darnell, listen to me.
Listen to me, please.
Even when you're with me,
I don't feel like you're really with me.
(clears throat) It's just a hard time, that's all.
Look, can I call you later?
I think you need to do some soul-searching, D.
I really do.
Oh, please don't give up on us, all right?
I'm gonna explain everything, I promise, baby, all right?
All good, big man?
Yeah.
All right, listen up, guys, we got a new plan.
We're on the Sarah Garber job, full court press.
Bowen push your buttons?
What do we know?
Her finances are all messed up.
So's her job.
She's a real estate assessor.
Her boss has had it with her.
Any day, she's toast.
All right, D, I want you to track her cell phone.
Got it.
What else?
Uh, you were right.
HK Rollers got a new product called Blue Dust.
That seems to be the unanimous taste sensation.
It's got hopheads lining up at the drive-through windows all over the place.
That, and then, of course, there's the shooting galleries for the tourists who don't know any better.
WILLIAM:
And the bottom feeders who don't have cars.
SWENTON:
So, if she's there?
It's a different play.
Rollers don't like strangers, right?
Yeah, so if we start flashing her picture, we don't get through the door.
Then don't flash her picture.
All right, let's get inside, get eyes on, and make the rounds.
Cool.
Do you want us to score?
Whatever it takes.
Akani, I want you on the sister.
Uh, I'm doing the rounds with Swenton.
WILLIAM:
No.
Start with this.
Bowen's been withholding information.
My guess is, the mother and sister Kate will be doing the same thing.
Uh, just so we're clear, Bowen didn't push your buttons?
Hello?
Sarah, you missed...
No, no, I'm on my way.
Sarah, listen to me-- these are very important clients.
Harvey, I'm five minutes away.
Where have you been?
I'll call them myself.
Hi.
It's Sarah.
Leave a message.
Uh, hey, Sarah, this is Harvey.
I'm calling you back because...
well, you cut me off.
There's no easy way to put this, Sarah, and I hate to do it over the phone,
but we're gonna have to let you go.
You're constantly late, you show up at random listings that aren't even yours, and it's just not working, Sarah.
If you're having some personal problems,
I hope that you get through them, and I do wish you the best in whatever it is you're gonna do next, but, again, I'm sorry to do this over the phone, but didn't even know if I'd ever see you again.
All right, take care, Sarah.
Call a cab?
Perfect.
Call the police, please?
Breaking and entering is a crime, William.
Do it.
Make the call.
Hold on a second.
It's not a crime if I have family authorization.
Then why didn't they give you the key?
Or unless you prefer breaking in.
Look, it's your ass I'm trying to save.
You do what you got to do.
Oh, no.
I shall, but it won't be my ass that I'm saving.
You can spin it any way you want, man.
Me, I'll be getting the job done.
Akani?
AKANI:
Yeah?
Download me on the sister.
I haven't done it yet.
I'm with Swenton.
I thought I told you...
I know what you said.
I'm here.
Is there something I need to know about Swenton?
No.
I'll get the work done, William.
Just forget it.
I'll handle it.
I can give you five minutes.
Hey.
Listen, uh, I'm only as good as the info you give me.
What do you mean?
Where does he fit in?
He doesn't.
No, no-- you gotta give me more than that.
They were engaged.
George gave her a choice:
drugs or marriage.
She said one thing, did another, he left.
And that's it?
Yeah, and I'm glad he left, if that matters.
It was the one positive that came out of all of this.
It wouldn't have been a very good marriage.
How out-of-the-picture is he?
Totally.
He moved to Texas, he's engaged again.
Look, all of this happened two years ago.
I mean, how can it mean anything?
Well, it does.
It all does.
Did you find anything out?
I did, as a matter of fact.
She got fired from her job today.
They called her boss and reported it.
Oh!
Oh.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
That...
I...
You know, at least I...
I-I know she's alive.
I guess fired is the least of it.
Every time the phone rings, I expect the worst.
That can happen.
I understand how hard this is.
Oh, I really appreciate your understanding.
BOTH:
You're not alone.
You know, my daughter Kate has retained another interventionist, William Banks.
I know.
He won't be helpful.
He thinks he's been anointed by God.
Well, my daughter thinks...
It's okay.
Just keep me apprised.
So, I'll keep digging.
For what?
So we can find her.
Is that a problem?
No.
No, of course not.
She'll need money more than ever.
Which means she'll come to you.
And you can't give it to her, no matter what she says, no matter what she does.
Can you do that?
I need you to do that.
BOTH:
I'll try.
I need you to do that.
I should get back.
Listen, Kate, if I find her,
I can make a difference, but she will need your help.
I hired you, didn't I?
PAULA:
I don't know what went wrong.
I...
I thought I was such a good mother.
You still are.
You're not alone, Paula.
You're not alone.
Okay?
Yo, yo, I triangulated a signal, got an address, and I found it in a bush.
That's great work, D.
This girl is dinitely falling apart.
I believe this is the part where somebody says, "Bingo!"
Or-Or "Eureka!"
We, uh...
We-We found the car.
Uh, came up on a DMV hit.
Ticketed, no wheels.
It's in a garage in Compton.
Compton?
SWENTON:
Why do you think homegirl's all dressed up.
AKANI:
Shut up, Swenton.
We're backtracking with the tow company, finding where they picked it up.
My guess is it leads to this.
SWENTON:
Blue Dust.
Excuse me.
Hey, Officer Herman, you got my message.
Listen, I wanted to tell you...
Yeah, we need to talk, William.
Bowen?
Called us.
Pressed charges?
Pressed charges.
This is bullshit, all right?
I'm working for the family of the girl that lives there.
Okay.
No sweat.
Have her come in and make a statement, and the BE goes away.
I can't, all right?
She's points unknown.
Look, the complainant-- he's got an ax to grind.
We shared a job a while back.
Things got a little weird.
He thinks I made him look bad.
He's got his PhD panties all in a twist.
Just the same...
You can't actually be taking this seriously.
Witnesses tie our hands, William.
The landlord saw you enter and exit.
You play it fast-and-loose like this,
I can't have your back.
No one can.
Truthfully, we all thought you were a little smoother than this.
(clears throat) All right, my bad.
I'll fix it, all right?
I'll talk to Bowen, see if we can't act like adults.
All right?
Yeah?
Because under normal circumstances, you and I would be taking a ride.
I got it, I got it, okay?
I'm sorry.
Look, one more thing, though.
You got anything on this?
Blue Dust?
Yeah, the guys in the unit are calling this Blue Death.
Bag's made in China for some toy company.
But it's laced with pesticides.
It's how they make plastics-- who knew?
You smoke the shit in this bag, and your lungs bleed.
You do enough of it, you drown in your own blood.
Blue Death.
If your client's been using that, you might want to check the morgue.
Thanks.
SWENTON:
What, do you think
I need a baby-sitter for this?
If the diaper fits...
What, do you think I'm using?
I know you did.
Once, all right?
Okay?
Once.
And that was just to keep my cover with the Inland Kings, all right, so I didn't blow the case, all right?
But now, I'm not, so all is good in my world, all right?
So maybe you can do me a favor and get off your broom.
Okay, I won't be your baby-sitter.
Terrif.
Just think of me as your bodyguard.
We all good?
Nothing I can't handle.
Hey, D, I want you to track down that ex-fianc?
I want the whole story.
There's still some missing pieces.
Now?
WILLIAM:
You got something else to do?
Get it done.
All right, listen up.
Sorry, Jeannie.
This Blue Dust-- it's killing people.
Right?
It's very dangerous shit.
You two, go to wherever they're slinging it, all right?
I want you to find Sarah.
SWENTON:
It's gonna be dark soon.
And?
SWENTON:
Oh, well, you know, Roller territory, night-- it's not exactly a place for a lady.
Akani?
Good thing I'm not a lady.
There you go.
Just in case, go strapped.
I'm gonna make a pit stop, then I'm gonna go visit a certain colleague of mine, maybe try to dance with the mom after that.
You need me, call me.
Darnell?
Yo.
Maybe you should check the morgue.
All right.
Swenton?
50 bucks.
Fifty?
Fifty?
This...
this is Vera Wang.
Vera Wang?
Never heard of her.
50 bucks.
Come on, man.
At least $100.
I mean, this is a $15,000 dress.
I was gonna get married in this dress.
Married.
This look like a bridal shop to you?
Any woman sees this, trust me, you can ask any price you want.
A dress like this, it's... is not about the money, believe me.
Come on, have a heart.
50 bucks.
Take it or leave it.
Seventy-five.
Hey, babe.
He's waiting.
Can I take a second to kiss my wife?
Yes.
This was good, William.
A really good idea.
Well, let's...
let's see how it goes, all right?
Wish me luck.
AKANI:
Half a gram, Blue Dust.
Hey, my homegirl, you seen her?
White girl, blonde hair?
Your loss, bro, she's hot.
Let's go.
Hey, pal.
You ready?
How do you want to start?
Big items first, work our way down?
How's that sound?
Okay.
Age before beauty, I'll start.
First item: non-negotiable.
You're my son.
I love you, and nothing's ever going to change that.
Nothing, ever.
Your turn.
Okay... well...
Ah, you see that?
I got you, right, kind of threw you?
That's part of negotiating.
Okay, seriously, I think you know what I want.
No, you...
Ben, you have to tell me what you want.
All right?
That's... that's how this works.
I thought you were bringing your A-game.
Football.
I want you to keep playing.
And I don't.
Ben, all right, look.
This... this is a negotiation, all right?
You have to make a case for what you want.
All right, you have to convince me or I'm gonna clean the table with you, so make your case.
Okay.
Point one.
Point one?
You told me to bring my A-game.
Yes, I did.
Yes, I did.
Yeah, Jeannie, it's me, Darnell.
Hey, um, listen,
I know things are strange with us, a little distance between us, and, uh... and so if you get a chance, could you call me?
You know what, no.
Maybe we can meet me in person, so we, uh... we could do it in person, you know, talk and work things out.
I really want to work things out, girl, okay?
Call me, please.
Thing is, Ben, if I give in on this point, and that's a very big if, then you have to give something back.
Like what?
One:
You have to promise me and your mother you'll never do anything stupid like running away again-- let me finish.
Two:
You have to replace something for football.
All right?
I don't care what it is.
Drama, school band, track, whatever.
It doesn't matter to me.
The point is, you're not just gonna be chilling around in your room like some kind of well-fed house pet.
What else?
That's it.
You do that, keep up your grades, then maybe me and you can work on my old truck, trick it out a little bit.
And then I can keep it?
You keep your grades up, no hanging around the house, find something to do with yourself... yeah.
Deal.
All right.
What are you doing?
Sarah, where have you been?
Sarah...
Leave me alone.
What, you're stealing now?
No...
Stealing!
That's what it's called.
Look... all you had to do was ask.
But no...
My God, you are pathetic.
You are a pathetic, selfish little bitch.
?
Get off me.eutom lositr!
!
isrselrah,lvme
Sarah...!
Leave me alone.
Sarah, no!
No!
Get away from me!
Sarah!
I'm a bitch?
I'm gonna call the police.
I'm a bitch?
!
Sarah, no!
Sarah!
Sarah!
Sarah!
Hey.
You called the cops on me?
You know, people have rights, Will.
You break into their personal property like a criminal...
You don't like how I do things, that's tough, all right?
I stay out of your way, you stay out of mine.
You're not an interventionist, you're just... some kind of street thug.
That's right, Doctor.
I didn't learn what I know from some classroom.
I didn't read it in some book, I lived it.
Maybe that's why I give a shit.
Oh, spare me the ex-addict sob story.
You only took this case to one-up me.
We both know what you really give a shit about.
Oh, you want to make this personal, Keith, huh?
Fine.
You know what your problem is, man?
Your big-time degrees, they don't make a bit of difference.
Not in this case, not in a single one.
That's your problem, all right, 'cause you got the same 75% failure rate that I do, and that just pisses you off to no end.
No, don't do that.
Don't even compare what we do.
I've seen how you work, what you do.
I've paid the price, and it's not happening again.
You paid the price?
What is with you, man?
That is ancient history, all right?
One client, one time, chose me over you.
So what?
You know, if your clients meant as much to you as your stellar reputation...
Ex-addict, ex-junkie, direct line to God.
Answer me this.
If God is on your side, why isn't your success rate any better than mine?
Are we done here?
Because I don't do meetings like this.
It's not a calling, William.
It's a job.
A job that requires professionals.
I didn't hit him...
but next time.
See, girl?
That there it's the real deal.
KATE:
She was gonna hit me, Mom.
She would've killed me after everything that we've done.
Oh, Kate, she wouldn't have hurt you, not if she was in her real mind.
Mom, you have got to come to terms with this.
This is who Sarah is now-- the drugs have her.
For now.
No, forever.
If you give up on her, yes.
PAULA:
She's still my baby.
She's still my Sarah.
That wasn't her.
That wasn't her, Kate.
You know that; you know what happened to her.
Mom, this has got nothing to do with it.
Sarah wasn't always like this.
No one is.
What happened?
Kate, I need to know the facts about your sister-- what happened?
You hired him, Kate.
You should tell him.
No!
Sarah and George were engaged.
They... they were planning a wedding.
Ugh... bullshit.
Well, he should know.
If you really want Mr. Banks to help, then he should know.
Pretty girl like you shouldn't track up your skin.
Kate and George slept together.
There's this convenient family myth that says that's why my sister became a heroin addict.
You were confused, George was...
Mom, I'll tell you what George was.
George hated Sarah.
Sarah chose drugs over him.
Before anything else happened, that was the decision she made, okay?
Yes, I slept with him.
Do you want to tell me that I'm responsible for my sister becoming a junkie?
Do you want to tell me that?
No.
I can't pretend to know that.
So, Mom, you wanted Keith to tie this up in a big bow?
Kate slept with George, so Sarah became a junkie?
Well, I'm sorry!
(sobbing):
If that helps you sleep at night, then fine.
Honey...
Can you tell me what I did wrong?
Because I...
I don't know.
I...
I don't understand.
They're both so...
My daughters are both so unhappy.
(crying):
Tell me... tell me what we can do.
Tell me...
I can fix it, I can... if you tell me what I can do.
Mrs. Garber, I...
I can fix it.
I can't say you did anything wrong.
I'm sorry.
We've been here before.
Sometimes, all we can do is just not enough.
But have we done everything, turned over every stone?
Bro, we hit every shooting gallery in the hood.
This shit is blowing up.
Everywhere we went, it's all people are looking for:
Blue Dust.
SWENTON:
I mean, it's cheap.
You know, cheap, tasty, plentiful... that's hard to beat.
Even if it's killing people.
Well, we're on Sarah now, okay?
We can't help everyone.
Sarah Garber needs us.
So... no job, no car, no phone.
No family, either.
Ex-fianc?
was no help, brother.
He's happy he's moved on.
He couldn't get off the phone fast enough.
All right, well...
here's what we're gonna do.
Darnell, I want you, and I want...
Hold on a second.
Yeah?
Hey, sweetheart.
Okay, got it.
Thank, thank you.
Be safe.
Bye.
Divine intervention.
That was my girl, Cleo.
Says she saw a girl matching Sarah's description walking the corner of Santa Monica and Las Palmas.
(groans) First timers.
That's where the trannies hook.
Not today, baby.
Ugh.
Come on.
Hey, you got 50 bucks?
Sarah, we're here to help you.
Well, hello, and welcome to Transitions.
How can I help you on this fine, beautiful day?
Just cut the crap.
Where is she?
Right now, I know that you would do anything to step outside your body.
Even for a few seconds.
Even a split second.
'Cause it doesn't matter, nothing matters.
You would give anything.
I'm sorry, I don't know who you're talking about.
Sarah Garber.
William has her.
It's kidnapping.
I warned him.
And the police are on their way.
See, I know it because I've lived it.
I know the pain.
I know that need that comes from some dark, sick place that you didn't even know you had inside.
And I also know that right now you would just as soon die rather than ignore that need.
BOWEN:
She's here.
I know she's here.
I know how William does things and this time, he's not going to get away with it.
Help yourself.
Really, go ahead.
We don't have anything to hide.
Oh, and try the coffee.
I can't do this.
I know.
Not by yourself.
I tried-- it's, it's almost impossible.
And that's why we're here.
So let me help you, Sarah.
Please, let me help you.
This isn't over.
Wherever he is, it's still kidnapping.
You understand?
No matter where he has Stop!
taken her, I will have him arrested for...
Stop, please!
Stop.
This is about my daughter.
Paula, of course it is.
That is why...
No!
All I want to know is if Sarah is okay.
Not about Mr. Banks, not about you.
And if Sarah... if she isn't your main interest, then you don't belong here.
She is my main interest.
Then start acting like it!
I'll be outside.
Do you know anything about my daughter?
I know she's in the best hands.
He has her?
Not here.
Someplace safe.
Here.
Hello?
There are no promises, Mrs. Garber.
Not for any of us.
And not for anyone fighting a demon like this.
So we have her.
We'll detox her, and hopefully get her mind to a place where she can make better choices.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Don't thank me yet.
DARNELL:
And it hit me when I heard William talk to that girl in that room.
I know it now.
This is where the Lord wants me.
I belong doing this, Jeannie.
But I believe He brought us together, too.
So you've been doing this, um...
What do you call them?
Interventions.
Although with William, maybe not quite the way you might have heard about them.
So you lied about working at the car lot?
No, I've been working at the lot, too.
I've been trying to do both.
You know, to do this thing, this mission, Jeannie.
And still keep a nine-to-five, but...
I'm not a nine-to-five guy.
And I couldn't live with not telling you all of this.
It was eating me up.
Darnell, I respect you.
Your doing this--
I do-- this is... exactly the kind of man I imagined you to be.
Except...
Baby, I don't know if there's...
Jeannie, Jeannie, wait...
Let me speak.
The life you have right now... honestly, I'm not sure there's room in it for me.
Or a relationship, or anything.
No, no-- that's not true.
Be honest.
We both deserve that.
I can do both.
But I'm not sure I can.
What I think I need, even if he's not helping people the way you do I need that nine-to-five guy.
You started this, you should finish.
Sarah's in a different place now.
She's scar.
Scared is okay.
Scared's good.
It's true.
Being decent this one time, doing the right thing... doesn't change my opinion of you.
We still have nothing in common.
Except Sarah.
Maybe she'll be one of the lucky 25 percent we do save.
WILLIAM:
So maybe you want to fill me in on that?
If I'm doing your work, why is it?
Why do he and I have the same rate of success?
And failure?
South Park
- Season 12 Episode 6 "Over Logging"
Get off the Internet, Stanley, it's time for bed.
Mom, I just gotta do a couple more things.
Now, Stanley.
The Internet will be waiting for you in the morning.
- Off!
- Aw man!
Shelley, off the Internet.
It's bedtime.
Mom, I'm i-chatting with my boyfriend in Montana!
Now, Shelley!
Why do you hate me?
Randy, off the Internet.
No.
No come on, leave me alone.
- No, mister, it's time for night-night.
- But Sharon, I've got stuff to do.
I've gotta see my credit rating, I've gotta send an e-mail to Nelson and check out Foley's vacation photos-
You don't have to do all that now!
You can do one more thing and then it's bedtime.
One more thing?
Oooo yeah...
What the hell?
- Stan!
Stan, I gotta use your computer!
- What?
My Internet's not working;
I gotta use yours.
And give Daddy some private time, will ya?
- My Internet's not working either.
- What?
- Dad, the Internet's not working!
- I know that, okay?
I have to get online with my darling Amir before school starts!
Randy, I can't get my e-mail to open.
Everybody just calm down!
Calm down, all right?
It's going to be okay!
We just can't panic!
Gerald.
Please help us.
Randy.
What happened?
Our house...
It has no Internet.
Oh my God.
We've got nothing!
It's just gone.
Come in.
You can use our Internet until you figure out what to do.
Thank you Gerald.
- I'm getting on it first.
- Oh no you're not!
Kyle, I need to use your Internet.
- It's not working.
- What?
I've even unplugged it and plugged it back in.
No.
No, our Internet can't be broken.
Ah, I've gotta get an attachment Larry sent me last night.
It's not working, Gerald.
But it has to work!
Maybe if I-
Your Internet's not working, Gerald!
Face it!
I have to get online before it's school.
What about Starbucks?
They have free Internet.
Right, Starbucks!
Everyone get your stuff;
we can take my car.
- Hey, is your guys' Internet working?
- No!
Nobody's is!
What's happening?
Jesus.
Everyone's gonna go to Starbucks now.
Everyone in the car.
We have to beat them there.
God, the whole neighborhood's affected.
Get out of the way, Peterson!
Folks, there's no Internet here.
- It's not working, I tell ya.
- It's not working here?
Kids, get back in the car.
We can go to the Mac store.
No, don't.
You're wasting your time.
- How do you know?
- Because we just came from there!
There was nothing!
Not one scrap of Internet!
How can there be no Internet anywhere?
What's going on?
Anybody got a Blackberry?
Check Drudge Report.
Good idea!
No wait, we can't check Drudge Report: there's no Internet!
There has to be a way to find out what's going on.
We can't!
Don't you get it?
There's no Internet to find out why there's no Internet!
What did we used to do to get the news before the Internet?
A television!
Once again we apologize, but we cannot bring you the news.
It appears that we have no Internet here at News 4.
We'll be happy to bring you up on current events just as soon as our Internet is back.
- Jesus, it's statewide.
- It could be nationwide.
Hello?
Do you have Internet?
It's Channel 4 News.
No, we don't have Internet either.
No Internet... anywhere...
Jesus... we're all alone...
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.
I need to get on Web MD and see why I have this cough, but I can't.
What if my sweetheart is online looking for me?
He could be wondering why I don't get online with him.
Maybe he thinks I'm dead.
If my darling Amir gets another Internet girlfriend, I'm gonna kill him!
And you!
Shelley, whoa, stop, stop!
Dad, you've gotta do something!
She's out of control!
You're right.
We can't just sit here any longer.
- Randy, where will you go?
- We're gonna head west.
There's a rumor going around there might be some Internet out there.
So we're headed out Californee Way.
You don't know if there's any Internet in California.
Well there certainly ain't none here!
Look, maybe it's time you all face reality!
- The Internet here is dried up!
- It could come back.
Yeah, and maybe it won't!
In the meantime I got a family who needs the Internet right away.
We'll head out Californee Way and... see what we can find.
Come on, let's go.
Look, if you... you do find Internet, let us know, will ya?
How.
You won't have Internet.
Sorry folks, we're full up.
Know anywhere else we can stay?
We're... heading out Californee Way.
- Looking for some Internet.
- You and everyone else.
You'll have to stay out at the transient camp with all the others heading to Californee.
It's about a mile down the road.
I'm going down the road feeling bad.
I'm going down the road feeling bad.
I'm going down the road feeling bad, oh Lordy.
My Internet done up and went away.
- Where are you from, old-timer?
- Kansas City.
Had me a store there.
Kind of... computer supply store.
When the Internet went, the stores went too.
Things will be different when we get out to Californee.
Soon as we get us some Internet we can all rest easy.
Why sure, Silicon Valley.
They gots a whole mess of Internet up there.
'Say a man can practically roll around in it.
When I get to that Internet I'm gonna click on just about everything in sight.
'Might even click on a pop-up ad just for the heck of it.
Well I'm gonna sit down at that Internet and just start e-mailing.
Just keep on e-mailing till my fingers are sore to the bone.
Sure will be nice.
You folks all heading to Silicon Valley?
That's right.
We need to get online.
- "Get online" he says.
- What's so funny about that?
Think about it.
How many folk heading out to Californee?
A million?
More?
And how much Internet you think they got out there?
Might be some Internet, sure, but with everyone trying to use it at once, it's gonna go real slow-like.
I knows it 'cause I seen it.
My two children, they tried to load a Web page.
Took them over three days.
They sat there waiting, and by the time the loading bar was only half-full they was dead.
Starve on the Internet, with a belly stuck out like a big bladder...
Come on, Stan, let's get some rest.
Amir...
I miss you so much...
Don't cry, Shelley.
You'll be able to get online when we get to Californee.
Everyone, wake up!
We're here!
Silicon Valley, Californee!
- Name?
- Do they have Internet here?
- Name?
- Marsh.
- Service provider?
- NetZero.
All right, stay in line.
Once you're inside, Red Cross volunteers will direct you to your campsite.
So is there Internet here?
Stay in line and get to your campsite.
Excuse me, we're looking for some Internet.
- Yeah, they've got it here.
- All right!
But there ain't enough to go around.
All they got is a little Internet.
Barely a bar a signal.
So they have to ration it out, carefully.
Ya... sign up over there and use your time when they call your name.
Each family gets 40 seconds of Internet per day.
Forty seconds?
That ain't even long enough to check Wikipedia!
Well it's all we got, so we gotta make do.
Look, honey, we ordered us some books on Amazon.
All right, time's up.
No!
No wait!
I haven't entered the shipping information!
No!
No!
Next?
Brady, John H.
Aw, how am I supposed to see Internet porn that way?
- What did you say?
- Uh, you go ahead, Sharon.
Divide some Internet amongst the children.
I- gotta talk to somebody.
And that's about all we know.
Uh, there might be some Internet still in California and parts of Florida, though we certainly still don't have any here.
- A fax!
A fax is coming through!
- Oh yeah, a fax!
- A fax!
It's a fax, it's a fax!
- It's a fax, we got a fax!
It says,
"The government has sent their best people to the Internet in order to repair it."
We've gotta send a reporter out to the Internet!
Where... is... the Internet?
Gentlemen, the President is very angry that his Internet still isn't working.
We've tried everything, sir, but the Internet has slowed to a trickle and we can't get it working correctly.
Take me down below!
I want to see the Internet for myself!
Here it is, general.
The Internet.
What's wrong with it?
See that flashing orange light in the middle?
It's supposed to be solid green.
My God.
"Click on the dancing kitty and you could win a prize!"
All right, time's up.
No, wait, I just clicked on the kitty.
I got it.
No!
It wasn't long enough!
No!
Next?
Nelson, Peter T.
Excuse me, I need to uh, have some private Internet time.
Look, we're just trying to get by here.
Everyone's gotta take what they can get.
I haven't jacked off in over two weeks.
So jack off.
You don't understand.
I need the Internet to jack off.
I... got used to being able to see anything at the click of a button, you know?
Once you jack off to Japanese girls puking in each other's mouths you can't exactly go back to Playboy!
What do you want us to do?
Pick up the whole computer and put it inside for ten minutes just for you?
- Three minutes would be plenty.
- Get lost!
All right, each of you take a ticket.
When they call your name you can use the Internet.
- What number are you, turd?
- Eight fifty one.
- You're nine twenty three now.
- Hey!
Mom!
Shelley, give your brother his ticket back!
Can't you all see I'm in pain?
Nobody understands pure love!
Amir and I are closer than anybody in this stupid family!
Hey!
Over here!
You... happen to be looking for Internet porn?
Yeah, how'd you know?
Lots of us fellas came here for that reason.
We all got used to seeing lots of really perverted stuff on the Internet, so now we can't go back to Playboy.
- I know, right?
- Anyway, we got us a simulator.
You just call out what you wanna see and then say "click."
- "Internet Porn Simulator"
- Give it a try.
Japanese girls exchanging bodily fluids?
Click.
Oh this sucks!
I can't jack off to this!
Damnit.
Let's see.
Interracial gang bang Click.
Shemales!
Let's try shemales.
Click.
Bestiality?
Click on that.
Brazilian fart fetish porn?
Click!
Click!
No.
No, this isn't going to work.
It's just not the same.
Well, sorry.
And that'll be $49 on your credit card.
Well at least that part's like the Internet.
We now have a reporter on the scene.
Let's go live!
Tom, I'm at the Internet, where government officials are doing their best to get it running again.
All right, Internet.
What do you want from us?
If we've angered you somehow, let us know.
Try to communicate with it digitally again.
I've had it with this thing!
Fire a warning shot at it!
Hey, wait a minute.
Is it possible that...
What is it, Kyle?
I think...
I know what's wrong.
This is taking too long!
When do I get to use the Internet?
It's gotta be our turn soon.
All right, folks, it's bed time.
No more Internet for today.
No, no, we're locking it away until tomorrow.
Everyone get to bed!
Finally!
I'm online again!
Yes!
Japanese girls puking each other's mouths.
Oh nice...
Now let's see some bestiality.
Yes!
Let's get some Brazilian fart porn in there!
Oh that's good eh!
What is that?
Sounds like someone's being attacked by a tiger.
Get the keys!
We gotta get in there.
What the...?
- Dad?
- Randy!
There was a, there was a ghost!
And this, this ectoplasm!
Did you see the ghost?
It ran through here; it slimed me!
You son of a bitch!
Oh no it wasn't me, it was this spooky ghost!
This is our last chance.
With nowhere else to turn, the government is going to allow one brave nine-year-old boy to attempt his method to get the Internet running again.
It all comes down to this.
Can the little Jewish boy reason with the Internet?
Or will it be gone forever?
All clear for procedure.
All right!
Let's do it!
Look!
The flashing yellow light is steady green now!
He did it!
- I've got Internet!
- Me too!
Internet activity in all sectors, sir.
- I've got Internet.
- Me too!
It's back!
It's back?
It's back!
It's working!
I can i-chat with my darling Amir now!
Shelley.
Shelley Marsh?
- What?
- It's me.
Amir.
O... kay.
Your family came here too, huh?
Yeah.
So uh, I guess I'll e-mail you as soon as I get back home.
- Yeah, okay.
Sounds good.
- Okay, see ya.
We're back together!
We're back together! And so what have we learned through this ordeal?
The Internet went away.
It came back.
But for how long we do not know.
We cannot take the Internet for granted any longer.
We as a country must stop over-logging -on.
We must use the Internet only when we need it.
It's easy for us to think we can just use up all the Internet we want.
But if we don't treat the Internet with the respect...!
That it deserves, it could one day be gone forever.
So let us learn to live with the Internet, not for it.
No more browsing for no apparent reason, no more mindlessly surfing on our laptops while watching television.
And finally, we must learn to only use the Internet for porn twice a day.
Max.
I'm going down to South Park Gonna have myself a time
Friendly faces everywhere Humble folks without temptation
Going down to South Park Gonna leave my woes behind
Ample parking day or night People spouting, "Howdy, neighbour"
Heading on up to South Park Gonna see if I can't unwind
Come on down to South Park And meet some friends of mine
Get off the Internet, Stanley.
It's time for bed.
Mom, I just gotta do a couple more things.
Now, Stanley.
The Internet will be waiting for you in the morning.
- Off.

Shelly, off the Internet.

You don't have to do all that now.

- It's not working, I tell you.
- It's not working here?
Kids, get back in the car.
We can go to the Mac store.
- No, don't!
You're wasting your time.
- How do you know?
Because we just came from there.
There was nothing.
Not one scrap of Internet.
How can there be no Internet anywhere?
What's going on?
Anybody got a BlackBerry?
Check Drudge Report.
Good idea!
No, wait.
We can't check Drudge Report, there's no Internet!
There has to be a way to find out what's going on!
We can't!
Don't you get it?
There's no Internet to find out why there's no Internet!
What did we used to do to get the news before the Internet?
A television!
Once again, we apologise, but we cannot bring you the news.
It appears that we have no Internet here at News 4.
We'll be happy to bring you up on current events just as soon as our Internet is back.
- Jesus, it's state-wide.
- It could be nationwide.
Hello?
Do you have Internet?
It's Channel 4 News.
No, we don't have Internet, either.
- No Internet anywhere.
- Jesus, we're all alone.
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.
I need to get on WebMD and see why I have this cough, but I can't!
What if my sweetheart is online looking for me?
He could be wondering why I don't get online with him.
Maybe he thinks I'm dead.
If my darling Amir gets another Internet girlfriend, I'm going to kill him!
And you!
Shelly!
Shelly, whoa, stop!
Stop!
Dad, you gotta do something!
She's out of control.
You're right.
We can't just sit here any longer.
- Randy, where will you go?
- We're gonna head west.
There's a rumour going around there might be some Internet out there, so we're heading out Californee way.
You don't know if there's any Internet in California!
Well, there certainly ain't none here!
Look, maybe it's time you all face reality.
- The Internet here is dried up.
- It could come back.
Yeah, and maybe it won't.
In the meantime, I got a family who needs Internet right away.
We'll head out Californee way and see what we can find.
Come on, let's go.
Look, if you...
If you do find Internet, let us know, will you?
How?
You won't have Internet.
- Sorry, folks.
We're full up.
- Know anywhere else we can stay?
We're heading out Californee way.
Looking for some Internet.
You and everyone else.
You'll have to stay out at the transient camp with all the others heading to Californee.
It's about a mile down the road.
I'm going down the road feeling bad
I'm going down the road feeling bad
I'm going down the road feeling bad
Oh, Lordy My Internet done up and went away
Where are you from, old timer?
Kansas City.
Had me a store there, a kind of computer supply store.
When the Internet went, the stores went, too.
Things'll be different when we get out to Californee.
Soon as we get us some Internet, we can all rest easy.
Why, sure.
Silicon Valley.
They gots a whole mess of Internet up there, say a man can practically roll around in it.
When I get to that Internet, I'm gonna click on just about everything in sight!
Might even click on a pop-up ad just for the heck of it.
I'm gonna sit down at that Internet and just start e-mailing, just keep on e-mailing till my fingers are sore to the bone!
Sure will be nice.
- You folks all heading to Silicon Valley?
- That's right.
We need to get online.
- "Get online," he says.
- What's so funny about that?
Think about it.
How many folk heading out to Californee?
A million?
More?
And how much Internet you think they got out there?
Might be some Internet, sure, but with everyone trying to use it at once, it's gonna go real slow-like.
I knows, because I seen it.
My two children, they tried to load a webpage.
Took them over three days.
They sat there waiting.
By the time the loading bar was only half full, they was dead.
Starved on the Internet, with their bellies stuck out like a pig bladder.
Come on, Stan, let's get some rest.
Amir, I miss you so much.
Don't cry, Shelly.
You'll be able to get online when we get to Californee.
Everyone, wake up!
We're here!
Silicon Valley, Californee!
- Name?
- Do they have Internet here?
- Name?
- Marsh.
- Service provider?
- NetZero.
All right, stay in line.
Once you're inside,
Red Cross volunteers will direct you to your campsite.
- So, is there Internet here?
- Stay in line and get to your campsite.
Excuse me, we're looking for some Internet.
- Yeah, they got it here.
- All right!
But there ain't enough to go around.
All they got is a little Internet.
Barely a bar of signal, so they have to ration it out carefully.
You sign up over there and use your time when they call your name.
Each family gets 40 seconds of Internet per day.
Forty seconds?
That ain't even long enough to check Wikipedia!
Well, it's all we got, so we gotta make do.
Look, honey, I ordered us some books on Amazon!
- All right, time's up.
- No!
No, wait.
I haven't entered the shipping information!
No!
Next!
Grady, John H.
How am I supposed to see Internet porn that way?
- What did you say?
- You go ahead, Sharon, divide some Internet amongst the children.
I gotta go talk to somebody.
And that's about all we know.
There might be some Internet still in California and parts of Florida, though we certainly still don't have any here.
- A fax!
A fax is coming through!
- Yeah!
A fax!
- A fax!
We got a fax!
We got a fax!
- It's a fax!
It's a fax!
It's a fax!
It says, "The government has sent their best people
"to the Internet in order to repair it."
We gotta send a reporter out to the Internet!
Where is the Internet?
Gentlemen, the President is very angry that his Internet still isn't working.
We've tried everything, sir, but the Internet has slowed to a trickle and we can't get it working correctly.
Take me down below.
I want to see the Internet for myself.
Here it is, General.
The Internet.
So, what's wrong with it?
See that flashing orange light in the middle?
It's supposed to be solid green.
My God.
Thedancingkitty. com, I wonder what that is.
Click on the dancing kitty and you could win a prize.
All right, time's up.
No, wait.
I just clicked on the kitty.
I got it!
- No!
It wasn't long enough!
No!
- Next.
Nelson, Peter T.
Excuse me, I need to have some private Internet time.
Look, we're just trying to get by here.
Everyone's gotta take what they can get.
- I haven't jacked off in over two weeks.
- So, jack off.
You don't understand.
I need the Internet to jack off.
I got used to being able to see anything at the click of a button, you know?
Once you jack off to Japanese girls puking in each other's mouths, you can't exactly go back to Playboy.
What do you want us to do?
Pick up the whole computer and put it inside for 10 minutes, just for you?
- Three minutes would be plenty.
- Get lost!
All right, each of you take a ticket.
When they call your name, you can use the Internet.
- What number are you, turd?
- 851.
- You're 923 now.
- Hey, Mom!
Shelly, give your brother his ticket back.
Can't you all see I'm in pain?
Nobody understands pure love!
Amir and I are closer than anybody in this stupid family!
Hey, over here.
You happen to be looking for Internet porn?
Yeah!
How'd you know?
Lots of us fellows came here for that reason.
We all got used to seeing lots of really perverted stuff on the Internet,
- so now we can't go back to Playboy.
- I know!
Right?
Anyway, we got us a simulator.
You just call out what you want to see and then say, "Click."
Give it a try.
Japanese girls exchanging bodily fluids.
Click.
This sucks!
I can't jack off to this.
Damn it!
Let's see.
Interracial gang bang.
Click.
She-males.
Let's try she-males.
Click.
Bestiality.
Click on that.
Brazilian fart fetish porn?
Click.
Click.
Nope.
No, this isn't gonna work.
It's just not the same.
Well, sorry, that'll be $49 on your credit card.
Well, at least that part's like the Internet.
We now have a reporter on the scene!
Let's go live!
Tom, I'm at the Internet, where government officials are doing their best to get it running again.
All right, Internet.
What do you want from us?
If we've angered you somehow, let us know.
Try to communicate with it digitally again.
I've had it with this thing.
Fire a warning shot at it.
Hey, wait a minute.
Is it possible that...
What is it, Kyle?
I think I know what's wrong.
This is taking too long!
When do I get to use the Internet?
It's gotta be our turn soon.
All right, folks, it's bedtime.
No more Internet for today.
- Come on!
- Just a little longer!
No, no.
We're locking it away till tomorrow.
Everyone get to bed.
- Man!
- What?
Finally!
I'm online again!
Yes!
Japanese girls puke in each other's mouths.
Nice!
Now let's see some bestiality.
Yes!
Let's get some Brazilian fart porn in there.
That's got it!
What is that?
Sounds like someone's being attacked by a tiger!
Get the keys!
We gotta get in there!
What the...
- Dad?
- Randy!
There was a ghost!
This is ectoplasm!
Did you see the ghost?
- It ran through here and slimed me!
- You son of a bitch!
No, that wasn't me.
It was the spooky ghost!
This is our last chance.
With nowhere else to turn, the government is going to allow one brave nine-year-old boy to attempt his method to get the Internet running again.
It all comes down to this.
Can the little Jewish boy reason with the Internet, or will it be gone forever?
- All clear for procedure.
- All right, let's do it.
Look!
The flashing yellow light is steady green now!
He did it!
- I've got Internet!
- Me, too!
Internet activity in all sectors, sir!
- I've got Internet!
- Me, too!
It's back!
It's back!
It's back!
It's working!
I can i-chat with my darling Amir now!
Shelly?
Shelly Marsh?
- What?
- It's me.
Amir.
- Hey.
- Your family came here, too, huh?
Yeah.
So, I guess I'll e-mail you as soon as I get back home.
- Yeah, okay.
Sounds good.
- Okay, see you.
We're back together!
We're back together!
And so, what have we learned through this ordeal?
The Internet went away, it came back.
But for how long, we do not know.
We cannot take the Internet for granted any longer.
We, as a country, must stop overlogging on.
We must use the Internet only when we need it.
It's easy for us to think we can just use up all the Internet we want, but if we don't treat the Internet with the respect
that it deserves, it could one day be gone forever.
And so let us learn to live with the Internet, not for it.
No more browsing for no apparent reason.
No more mindlessly surfing on our laptops while watching television.
And finally, we must learn to only use the Internet for porn twice a day.
Max.

Shall we speak English or Chinese?
Your decision
Whichever is more natural
Then let's use our mother tongue
Nice to meet you
Our mother tongue?
Oops.
Look at me
So used to English, I forgot my own language
So nice to meet you
A pleasure
Sit down
Sir, please
Give me the specifics
This invention of yours... what inspired it?
The root of the world's endless wars and escalating conflicts is our inability to judge disputes impartially
Continue
As children, we all played a game:
Rock, paper, scissors
You've played it?
Uh-huh
It's our most primal and effective conflict resolution method
So, why, as adults have we discarded this method?
Why?
Two critical flaws:
Hand velocity differential and last-minute sleight of hand
Sleight of hand
Rock, papers, scissors
A cunning hand can cheat
The Conflict Resolution Terminal wipes out both flaws
Hold it here
Stick your hand in
Not your head.
Your hand
Let's try it
Rock.
Paper.
Scissors
Ready?
Yes
Pull it open at the count of three
One
Two
Three
Fascinating
It's cheat-proof
You invented this?
I did
Just imagine
For instance this beautiful girl here
If we both wanted her, but...
Don't even think about it
It was hypothetical
If we all had Conflict Resolution Terminals the wars in the Balkans and Middle East
American presidential elections to elect a white or black President
Win or lose
The tube decides
Super good
The CRT2008 is useful in all aspects of life
It's a revolutionary product
Say no more
This will be a massive high-tech IPO
I'll buy the patent
Name a price
Two million
One million
Two million
One million
Let's do this
Let the CRT2008 decide
Good idea
Rock.
Paper.
Scissors
Ready?
Yes
One.
Two.
Three
Resolved
You got yourself a deal
I meant US dollars
Huh.
I meant Sterling

Perfect men like Andy Lau and Tom Cruise won't be seeking you here
Nor do I expect to find Julia Roberts
Even if you were a goddess
I couldn't handle you
I'm not expecting a cover-girl to blow me away with your beauty
Just a sane, healthy woman
Modern on the outside traditional on the inside
Slightly demure would be ideal
Don't be too complicated
Don't be too young
Proficiency in folding laundry a plus
Preferably pressed and folded like they just came off the store shelf
Am I being specific?
Let me introduce myself
I'm no longer young
Solidly middle-class
Smoke, but don't drink
Went abroad to study
Lived overseas for a decade
Never really studied much
I slacked and learned a few survival skills
I've returned without accomplishment
Truthfully
I'm what they call a "Three Strikes" returnee:
No company.
No stocks.
No degree
Morally, I'm about 50-50
I'm no angel just too cowardly to do wrong
All in all, I'd classify myself as a constructive member of society
If interested, please call
I hope you're the one
Shan-shan
May I join you?
I'm expecting someone
You haven't changed much
Still handsome
You got the wrong guy
I'm Jianguo
From the construction company
I changed that much?
You don't recognize me?
Hey
From administration
Transferred from the army arts troupe
I was in logistics
Anyway, in charge of entertainment
Back then, you were a cute little boy
I remember you had single eyelids
How'd they get doubled?
Had them done in Korea
Gee, what a coincidence
Run into each other ten years later
What coincidence?
I made a date with you
A date with me?
Uh
Ai Moli
Molly
Like the name of this restaurant
I changed my name
I wanted to surprise you
Trying to get in my way?
My ad was for a marriage partner
I wanted to see you
Besides you didn't write
"No men wanted"
Of course I didn't
Why would I seek a man?
I'm not gay
You're...
Yes
Huh?
But I'm not
How do you know?
I used to think so too
But later I realized
I just lacked the courage to face it
Do you remember the labor union field trip to Shi Du?
My leg cramped when I was swimming
You rescued me
That's right
I held onto you tightly
You kept comforting me
Every since then, I felt so safe with you
When I don't see you
I want to...
Hey-hey-hey
You are ahead of the curve
But I am not that enlightened yet
Then why have you not married yet?
Haven't found the right one
Give me a break
Perhaps, subconsciously you dislike women
Oh...
No-no-no
Do you think I'm strange?
No
Absolutely not
I constantly ask myself:
Why am I so narrow-minded?
With such a big heart why can't I make room for a man?
Each time I clear a woman out guess what happens next?
Another woman fills in the space
Let me ask you something
Suppose
I were like you
I said "suppose"
Don't be angry if I get this wrong
You're bad
Forget it.
I better shut up
I know what you want to say
Deep down you're like my big brother
It's probably better that way
Brother
Yes?
You have great skin
So white
What's your first impression of me?
Much as I expected
Frankly looks aren't important
It's the inside that counts
Someone kind, and good to his parents
Even if I didn't like you
I'm sure you'll find a good wife
You really are a modern-traditional woman
A rare catch
Your parents still in good health?
My father passed away last year
My mother is still alive
I came back, so she wouldn't be alone
How old is she?
In her seventies
Your father...
Where is he buried?
At Eight Treasure Mountain
His urn is in the ossuary
Your mother is getting old
A filial son should give his parents a good resting place
Old people are fussy about final resting places
Don't you worry
I would never deprive them
A man should be responsible and filial
Even if he doesn't make much money he provides for his parents' needs
Now that's a reliable man
Tell the truth
Are you such a man?
I think I am
No, you're not
You keep your father's ashes in a tiny box
And how about when your mother dies?
Going to squeeze them both into a little box?
Not even enough room for incense and ghost money at Grave Sweeping Festival
You call that filial?
Then, I'll buy them a cemetery plot
It's not that I can't afford it
Just that when I left China only national heroes could afford a grave
Normal folk's ashes were kept on shelves
Don't worry
You find a spot with a nice view
I'll take care of it immediately
If you and I get along
I'll have your tombstone carved in advance
No way you'll be stored on a shelf
It really is a great investment
Just thirty thousand yuan gets you a grave plot with imperial fengshui
Thirty thousand
Price of a return trip to America
In just a few years, the same plot will be worth three hundred thousand
By the time you sell it you'll have made 1000% profit
Hold on
If I sell it where will my parents go?
You can buy two
If you buy two plots, my company will give you a 5% discount
Miss Liang?
Yes
I'm Qin Fen
Sorry, I was late
Have a seat
I never expected...
What?
Nothing
What's your line of work?
I'm a flight attendant
Which airline?
Hainan Airline
How would you grade yourself?
Six
Only six?
I'd give you a Nine
You've met a few already?
You mean these personals?
Uh
You're the first
Oh
Myself, I've met a couple
You're the first as beautiful as you
This one girl wasn't bad
But she was selling grave plots
She doesn't count
The rest were critically unkosher
Did you buy?
Huh?
The grave plots
Yes
She sweet-talked me
Called me a filial son
If I didn't buy, I'd ruin my reputation
No wife, but got myself a grave
I read your marriage ad.
I think you're very funny
Not like the others, so full of themselves
Or who write a load of sentimental crap
It's disgusting
I'll be totally honest with you
And I'm not trying to flatter you
But judging by your looks
I'd rank you at the "goddess" level
You must have high standards
You're not selling airplanes, are you?
Graves are one thing
But I can't afford airplanes
Why "no women entrepreneurs"?
They're too practical
I prefer more emotional types
What's wrong with being practical?
These days, most people are practical
My mom and friends all advise me to be more practical
That's why I'm here meeting you
To learn to be more practical
Then you got the wrong guy
I'm definitely not the type you're seeking
How do you know my type?
I don't even know what type is
Being here seems so unreal
But I did telephone you
I'm the one who asked you out
You mean you're not serious
You were confused and regret meeting me
A little
Don't be mad
It's not because of you
I think I'm a bit ridiculous
Then we should stop here
It's good we're direct.
Simpler
We won't waste each other's time
You busy?
Not at all
But we don't have any hope
Then, go ahead
I'll sit here awhile
Okay
See you later, then
Good-bye Wait, that's not right
We won't see each other again
In that case...
"Farewell" isn't correct either
You really are a pain
What we mean is...
See you never
Hey
Feel like a drink?
We can go somewhere nearby and chat a little more
Why?
Chat about what?
You a shill for a restaurant posing as a lonely woman?
Enough, already
I didn't suspect you of a crime
So, don't be suspicious of me
In truth, I am a criminal
I was worried you weren't
You drink like a wimp
It won't kill you
Drink up.
No one's stopping you
Keep talking
Heard of "love at first sight"?
I loved the first sight of you
We're not even "love at third sight"
Love at first sight doesn't mean
I fall for you when I see you
Or that you fall for me
It's not about sight
But smell
The other person's scent attracts you
Enchants you
Some people are made for each other
So, two strangers rush up and sniff each other up and down?
Is that possible?
It's not like that
If you're made for each other you'd sense each other from far away
Ever watch "Animal Planet"?
Yes
Even from dozens of miles away animals can sense each other
People are just like animals
Are you only attracted by one smell?
Animals don't fixate on just one lover or type
It's a mutual thing
It's not just attraction, but a kind of infatuation
Anything else repels you
Then why come all this way to bother me?
Infatuated, but you can't be together
You struggle to break free from it
You're torn apart by heartache
You drink yourself to sleep each night
The man has a family
He loves you, but can't marry you
Your parents don't know
It hurts, but you can't share it
I can't tell anyone
Then why tell me?
I couldn't take it anymore
I was hurt too badly
Anyway, I won't see you again
Who cares what you think of me
Then I should charge a fee
He has all the fun and I get a miserable woman
Since when are we best buddies?
Take as much as you want
But I'm paying you to drink up
You can't just sip
I really can't drink
I'll accompany you for free
So, don't drink
I told you one of my secrets
You should also tell me something you can't admit to anyone else
Then we'll be even
Why are you so complicated?
Fine, don't tell me
I don't care, anyway
Let it rot in your stomach
And I thought you were a big man
Based on what you've got dare you ask for a sentimental woman
We won't see each other again?
Nope
Know why I don't drink?
Aren't you drinking now?
A friend and I ran a travel agency in America
We specialized in Chinese groups
Once, we had a government tour group
Led by a bureau director
A very juicy gig
There was a woman named Xiaobai
A translator
Pretty.
The quiet type
I had her in my sights the moment they landed
During the trip
I started to fall for her
Later on we, you know...
What?
We, uh... got intimate
Afterwards, she cried
Wanted me to help her stay in America
I agreed without a second thought
I really liked her
Besides, it was easy for me
The next day I told my friend that I was with Xiaobai
I asked him to help me keep Xiaobai in America
He freaked out
Said, Absolutely not
We'd got the job because of his connection with the bureau director
If they left someone behind the director would be disciplined
Besides screwing the director it could also kill our business
If I insisted on her staying
I think my friend would killed me
So, you two sold her out
Let me finish
I had to beg my friend
I'd make sure she didn't run for it
But he had to promise not to report her
When we saw them off at the airport
Xiaobai just stared at me
With eyes like daggers
Couldn't even look at her
I was so ashamed
That's your secret?
This year the director heard I was back
He invited us to dinner
The people from the tour group came too
Only person missing was Xiaobai
I made a lot of small talk then casually asked about Xiaobai
They said, You don't know?
Soon after she returned, she killed herself
My head just exploded
I asked, What happened?
He said
Her husband was abusive
Beat her all the time
She kept trying to divorce him
She'd planned to stay in America
But she failed
Even got reported
She returned completely hopeless
So, I asked my friend if he'd reported her
He said, Yes
Said he couldn't trust me
So he told the director
That day
I beat up my friend
I drank a lot
Until finally
I was sprawling on the floor grabbing people's legs and crying
Why'd you beat him?
You're the one who killed her
You're despicable
After that day every time I drink, I remember her
Later, I just quit drinking
But you had to make me drink and spill my rotten guts
We even?
Now you know what I'm made of
You can go now
Leave
So, if we get married
I have to go live with your family?
Can I refuse?
There's something you need to know
What?
My aunt has a bad memory
How bad?
She can remember today's events
By tomorrow, it's all gone
Is your home far?
How do I get there?
First you fly to Kunming
Then a day's bus ride to Mengzi
Then another bus to Pingbian
Then a day by tractor
Another day by ox cart and you're home
She can't remember things
And people?
Nope
Not even people?
But she writes all important events and people in her notebook
If you two marry she'll read it every morning and recall who you are
Qin Fen
You're tired already?
Keep playing
If it doesn't work out
Can we divorce?
My big brother will break your legs
Sister
Don't record that
Best to forget what happened today
What we're talking about?
You like it here in Haikou?
It's great
Sunny, no pollution, tropical
I've been here two years
I play golf, swim, dive
Never felt healthier
Gotta take care of yourself
Uh
How are the blind dates?
Still blind
Let me fix you up
Yes For real
A really good person
If I weren't married
I'd marry her myself
I used to be married
My husband passed away
When?
Just recently
How long were you together?
Is this... very important to you?
Of course
If you were deeply in love
After all, his bones are barely cold yet
Seven or eight years
You must be hurting
Compared to before
I feel much better now
These past five years didn't even know where he slept at night
I finally know where he is
You found him a spot
Yanchun Ridge Cemetery
Whenever I need him, he's there
If he runs away now you should get your money back
How old are you?
Fifty?
No
Forty-something
I look older, don't I?
That's okay
I like older men
How's your health?
On the weak side
That's great
Don't bother exercising
If you get sick, I'll nurse you
You don't want a strong healthy body?
You prefer a soft marshmallow?
Soft marshmallows taste better
An old, sickly guy
You're not worried about marriage quality?
At your age...
Let me be frank
You're at your sexual peak
You believe the foundation for love is sex?
Not entirely
But love without sex is not love
That would be friendship
I don't agree
What's wrong with no sex?
Many people grow old together without it
I don't mean to imply no sex at all
Just not too frequently
Tell me
What's your idea of
"not too frequently"?
Ideally speaking...
Yes?
Once a month?
Once a year
If you agree we can meet again
I don't agree
I know why your husband never came home
If we got married
I'd be hard to find too
A real pity
Is sex really all that interesting?
Oh, yeah
Sorry, I couldn't answer just now
Smiley
Please don't get angry, but...
My wife and I will be on the same flight as you
Can't you change your ticket?
I just found out
She booked it ages ago
I never expected it would be your flight
You know I care about you
I have to attend my brother's wedding
I just hope you can make sure she doesn't see you
It would be better
How should I do that?
It's an airplane cabin and you're seated in first class
Where should I hide myself?
You can't treat me like this
Welcome to Grand China Air
Welcome to Grand China Air
Boarding pass, please
Smiley Liang
It really is you
Old foes meet again
Please take your seat and don't block the aisle
Welcome to Grand China Air
Hello.
This way, please
Welcome to Grand China Air
Boarding pass, please
This way on the left
Thank you
Welcome to Grand China Air
Boarding pass, please
This way, sir
Please hurry and take your seat
Sir, as soon as possible
We're about to close the door
Please sign this
Here
I'll sign it
Thank you
Hi, I'll get that for you
Please take your seat
Hot towel
Something to drink?
Miss?
If there is an empty seat
I'd like to sit with my husband
Sorry
First class is full today
But I'd be happy to look in economy
My husband and I booked this flight
Why aren't we seated together?
Next time you can arrive earlier to have your boarding passes changed
The computer doesn't know you're husband and wife
I'll switch with you
No one should split up a married couple
Young comrade
I know you're not responsible for ticketing
But you should listen to customer feedback and submit our suggestions to your superiors
The key to improving customer service is paying attention to details
Please, sir.
C'mon
No point in troubling you
It's a short flight
We're about to take off
If you're going to switch seats please do it soon
It's no trouble
I'm already up.
Go ahead
Please
Thank you
Please fasten your seat belts Thank you
Ladies and gentlemen we'll be taking off shortly
To ensure your safety, please check that your seat belts are fastened and that all cell phones are turned off
Thank you
We're already taxiing
Whatever it is, can wait
Just wanted to remind you for your own safety to fasten your seat belt
So, that gentleman is the little runt you can't live without?
Please don't interrupt my work
Some things just aren't meant to be
I'll be in Hangzhou for a few days
If you're flying to Beijing call me if you feel like a drink
I can be your non-fatal drinking buddy
When outsiders imagine Hangzhou they often think of West Lake
What they don't know is that a mere 5 kilometers away is a rare environmental treasure
Here is China's first wetlands national park:
West Brook Wetlands
An exiled Song Dynasty emperor happened upon these wetlands
Like me, he was enchanted
He wanted to build his temporary palace here
But due to lack of funds the project was abandoned
The night before he had to leave the Emperor said:
West Brook, may you remain here
And thus it earned its eternal name
The home we're seeing today is in Remain Here Town
I trust you'll want to stay too
The Emperor would have stayed
But he was broke
All that remained were his words
But I've brought cash
If I like the place my whole life will remain here
This is your foyer
Your living room
Your master bedroom
And this is your private pond
Hey, take it easy
Stop saying "your" living room, "your" bedroom
"your" private pond
I don't know if I'm buying yet
I'm sure you've seen better homes
But no amount of money could buy an environment like this
Hello?
I was in a lousy mood yesterday
So I took a day off and stayed in Hangzhou
Drank half a bottle of wine to get to sleep
Slept in the whole morning
Woke up not knowing what to do
If you're not busy care to join me for a chat?
That's fine, but
I've got another blind date
You came all the way to Hangzhou?
Really casting a wide net
Can't leave any stone unturned
Better to kill a thousand innocents than set one guilty person free
Well, I'm not busy
Take me along.
I'll consult for you
How should I introduce you?
Say we already dated but you rejected me?
Say we're drinking buddies
Or, don't introduce me at all
I'll just sit nearby and drink tea
I'll advise you afterwards
I won't get in your way
Sounds good
But I'm warning you:
If I find a suitable match if we dig each other's smell you're not my responsibility
Don't call me a fair-weather friend
Relax
If that happens
I'll be overjoyed for you
See you
Hey, miss
How much does this place cost?
Don't mind me
You are not from here
I'm Taiwanese
My father owns a factory in Hangzhou
We're here for the time being
Ever been to Beijing?
Of course
Which do you prefer?
That's a difficult question
For weather and living environment
Hangzhou, of course
But I quite like Beijingers
My grandfather is from Beijing
I love hearing his accent
What is go-ING on'?
The accent is the last word
Not the first word
What is going ON'
What is going ON'
What is going on'
Later on my grandfather went to Taiwan with the Nationalists after the Mainland had fallen
Hold on there
We call it "liberated"
You say "fallen"
we say "liberated"
Liberated?
What does "liberated" mean?
Liberated
I get it
The difference between liberated and fallen is just one's point-of-view
Right, that's it
We can agree to disagree
Exactly
There are some universal values
For instance compassion is to love all beings
After the recent earthquake
Taiwanese all rushed to provide relief
Mainland Chinese were very moved
My father's company donated too
It pained us to see fellow Chinese suffering
Especially children who lost their parents
Poor things
There was a dying mother on the news
To her last breath, she breast-fed her child
Even after dying, she was still nursing
Maternal love knows no bounds
A mother can sacrifice anything for her child
Dads too
Even if it wasn't my child
I could adopt one of those orphans
You have such deep love for children?
Yes
If you were an orphan
I'd adopt you too
Idealists really do have bad memories
I told you my father has a factory here
But don't despair
I have one in my belly
You can be his father
Thought you weren't married?
I'm not
But
I'm pregnant
Whose is it?
Not worth mentioning
He abandoned the darling in my belly
I don't want the child to be fatherless
So
I'm seeking a loving father for him
You're a good candidate
Uh, well
Do you like me?
I like you a lot but...
You said you didn't care if it was your own
If we don't tell him and the child only knows you
He would be just like your own
An orphan, I can accept
But with a full set of parents?
You can't just put a Mercedes ornament on the hood of a BMW
It will still be a good car
But if it breaks down
Mercedes parts won't fit and BMW won't repair it
We should forget it
I'm flattered you like me
But I'm not the right man
I'll have to bite the bullet
What a perfect opportunity
How could you be so heartless?
Seemed like a great fit
Look
She's beautiful wealthy and you get a son for free
For a guy like you it's like winning the lottery
Normally, I don't mind free lunches but starting a family requires self-reliance
No foreign aid accepted
I think this blind date thing isn't too kosher for me
I have no appetite for ugly ducklings but the good-looking ones are either hiding something or hate sex
Where'd the simple, sane women all go?
Why can't I meet even one?
What are you saying about me?
Think your sane and uncomplicated?
Oh, not you.
You're not good-looking
Calling you "good-looking" would be an insult
You're ravishingly beautiful
A rare, precious beauty
If you were royalty you'd be up there with Diana
Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder
But, no exaggeration even to a foe, you'd be beautiful
Don't hold it in.
Laugh
I need to ask you something
I sat with you through your date
Accompany me to meet someone?
I didn't ask you to come
You invited yourself
Will you or won't you?
No
I'm asking you one more time
No
Fine
Good-bye
This is Mr. Qin
You met on the flight
Nice to meet you
Have a seat
Sit here
Excuse us
We'll need some privacy
Okay
Thanks
Mr. Qin and I knew each other before
Just acquaintances
But meeting again on the flight something sparked between us
Perhaps it was "love at second sight"
After we landed, Mr. Qin called me
He asked me to stay a few more days to become better acquainted
We've been together the past two days
We feel fortunate to have met again
You're the person closest to me
So I brought him here to introduce you formally
It's right that you should know
Not going to wish us well?
You always wanted me to have a home
Smiley told me a lot about you
Said you treat her very well
Meeting you on the airplane seemed like fate
You've made your decision?
Mr. Qin
Perhaps you know about
Smiley and me
I'm not as lucky as you
I entrust her to you, good brother
Be good to her
She's stubborn.
I spoiled her
Be patient with her
If she's unhappy
I'll be unhappy too
Alright, this scene is over.
I can't take it
I'll be leaving now
I know it's difficult for you to meet
Smiley and I are just ordinary friends
You're the only one she cares about
You're the lucky one
She drinks everyday because of you
It could kill her if she keeps it up
I can't go on like this
I'm weak and ashamed
I will use my mind and body all of me to do something to make you regret
Stop drinking
Smiley
I have not betrayed you
How could I ever punish you?
You asked me to wait three years
I waited
You won't want me
But I will care about you until that day we agreed upon
I thought I could love you my whole life
I never thought our time together could one day end
One, two, three
One, two, three
One, two, three
One, two, three
I stopped drinking
Don't worry.
Smiley
Surname Qin
"Qin" as in Emperor Qin
Fen as in "to struggle"
Smiley
I got your text message
"Smiley" as in "smiles hiding knives"
Correct
I called twice but you didn't answer
Call me
Yeah
At the place we met the first time
I already said it eight times:
five o'clock
Yeah, that's right
Be there or be square
Pardon me
I've got two dates
Please don't mind my efficiency
No problem
I'm a stock trader
A real bear market lately
Using my spare time to find a husband
Once the market turns around
I won't have time
Do you play the stock market?
No
Don't understand it
Seeking a marriage partner is like trading stocks
You have to make your decisions based on a rational analysis of performance
For instance, the candidate's looks or body figure
Or, his personality and education
Or, his finances and family background
Or
So... if I were a stock how would I rate?
Judging from age and looks you've sunk below your offer price
So, I'm in danger of being delisted?
Not necessarily
Inexperienced traders often buy high
But that's very risky
It's very easy to get trapped
More experienced traders buy low
A stock like you with bad performance most won't touch you
Few would show interest
Thus you're a low risk
You're already at the bottom
Can't go any lower
So, for a stock like me bought low would you invest long-term or just "pump and dump"?
Pump and dump?
Do you have explosive potential?
I'd buy long-term and hold it
What if you held it for a while but found its performance lacking?
Don't worry
I'm not stupid.
I'd diversify
They can't all underperform, right?
No one's that unlucky
Hello?
You're here?
I'm here
I see you
Wait for me
Order whatever you like.
It's on me
I feel obligated to warn you:
I'm very risky
Best to keep your distance
If you got stuck with me
I'd be useless and unsightly
Might never be able to get rid of me
As an investment
I'd be subprime
Only a criminal would sell me to you
Let's stop trading for today
I also have another stock to see at six o'clock
Go ahead and chat with her
The whole market is down right now
But don't jump in blindly
Don't rush it
Wait and see
Did I interrupt anything?
She wasn't interested
Said I'd dropped below my offer price
Poor thing
Old guy on the dating scene getting his pride injured
Spare me the alligator tears
So what's up?
I want to become your girlfriend
Which type of girlfriend?
The kind you marry
Why?
You knocked up, too?
I'm not in a mood for joking
I have just one condition
What?
While we're dating or even married
I'll fulfill all the duties of a wife but you'll allow me to have someone else in my heart
I won't do anything
I'll just keep a space for him in my heart
I might miss him from time to time
But it won't be anything more than that
I'll never contact him
Can you accept this?
Your body is here but your heart is elsewhere
You can refuse
I know it's unfair
Then, is it okay with you if my heart is here but my body occasionally has a fling?
No
Well, what if when your heart drifts away my heart drifts away too?
Fine
But our bodies are faithful to each other
Come here
Then, I'll need to find someone else too
Otherwise, you'll have one and I won't
I'd be at a huge disadvantage
Then, you agree?
Yes
Will you go with me to Hokkaido?
He and I started there
I'd like to end it there too
Are you bubbling with joy?
Wu Sang
Haven't changed in ten years
Look just like a Hokkaido peasant
Except a bit more devious
This is Smiley
This is the Wu Sang I told you about
Married a Hokkaido wife and never left
Ms. Liang, honored to be of service to you
Thank you
I'll get that
Thanks
This way
Wu Sang
What are those arrows for?
Ms. Liang you've been here before
You must know why.
Tell him
Hey
Hey
He asked you a question
What?
Those arrows pointing down
Know what they mean?
Hokkaido gets heavy snow in winter
The arrows point to the road's edge so drivers don't hit the curb
Ah
I see
Did I say it right?
Yes
You learned that from him, right?
Let's have a good time here
You're my boyfriend now
Let's not mention him
Okay?
I'm not used to it yet
It's like my wallet is full of borrowed money
After I spend it, I'll be in debt
Hey, Wu Sang, stop the car
I need to go worship
Don't know what he's saying
No chance today
Why not?
The temple's closed to the public today
No worshipping for you
Well, talk to him
Tell him we came from China just for today
Have you done something wrong?
I thought you were atheist
Why so suddenly pious?
I found religion
God sent me such a beautiful wife
I'd be rude not to burn some incense
Hey
I'm not your wife yet
Besides, a Japanese Buddha can't help you
Blasphemy
Buddha has no nationality
Hokkaido is my land of fortune
I'll pray to every Buddha I find here
Go talk to him
Okay, okay
In honor of your incredible luck with Ms. Liang
I'll talk to him for you
Why are we being frisked?
It's the funeral of an influential family
Then, let's get out of here
You kidding?
We can't go now
Stop peeking
Act mournful
Did you really cry?
No laughing
You didn't cry?
I saw you cry too
I tried to keep the tears in
Just couldn't hold them any longer
These Japanese must think we Chinese are really loyal friends
We're not even family, but we came all this way to cry our eyes out
Practically forced our way in
Neither of you better piss me off
I'm a mafia guy now
You knew this was a funeral
What are you complaining about?
You just had to go in
You're truly adorable
Excuse me
Which way to Hinanoza Hotel?
Straight ahead
Turn right and you'll see it
Thank you
Very easy to find
It's just up ahead
That says "Four Sisters-What?"
Four Sisters dining bar
How are we going to sleep?
You two in one room
You and I can share a room
Catch up on old times
Cut the pretense
A beauty like her and you want to be in my room?
It's not a pretense
We're not that close yet
I'm not the one she loves
Wishing you a pleasant rest
Thank you
Here, try this
It's fishy
Penetrating
Stimulating
Try it
I'm already over-stimulated
What I need now is numbness
Best part about drinking is the numbness
Can't drink on an empty stomach
Try these clams
I need to get numb too
If your dreams had not been shattered
I'd never be talking marriage with you
My life's been no easier than yours
How can you allow your girlfriend to have someone else in her heart?
Why do you like me?
Did I say I liked you?
Be honest
It our basis for being together in the future
My basis for marrying you is that
I can't find anyone more foolish
I'll never be so foolish again
You are incapable of splitting your heart in half
You're a terrible actor
Your feelings are writ across your face
Here's what I think
You're not over him yet
But once you are your heart will be whole again
That's why I tolerate you right now
You're a fool, but I'm not
If I learn my lesson and get smart will it ruin your beautiful plan?
In that case
I'll sell you to the local tribesmen
You'll hunt and fish for the rest of your life
And have a slew of babies
Scorched by the sun, drenched in rain
Half-starving, in tattered clothes
If you try to escape they'll catch you and beat you
Three tortuous years from now you'll be an ugly, repulsive, wizened old hag
I'm just getting started
Wanna hear more?
I'm only fooling around with you because you're pretty
Can you accept that?
You up to it?
In the game of emotional counterfeit you think you're my match?
I'll bet you couldn't even tell if I had eight other women in my heart
I've got nothing to lose
You don't care about me
So, I just take what you're giving away
What are you guys so upset for
Getting on my case
If I didn't say something nasty, she'd never stop
You really are serious
Sit down
Let her go
What a perfect opportunity
After this drink, you should invite Smiley to the hot spring with you
What friend would do that?
And abandon you here?
Spare me
This time, I'm serious about marrying her
I can't be reckless
She'd never give me her body before she gave me her heart
But, then once she gives you her heart your body is sentenced for life
So, I should enjoy freedom while I can
What do you like about her?
She has a good soul
Oh, please
You like her because she's pretty
What's wrong with that?
I should deprive my children of good genes?
Must I marry someone ugly?
Spend the life trying to escape?
Which of these four is prettiest?
They're all charming
Natsuyo.
She's pretty
I say Haruko
Sorry to disturb you
May we come in?
Welcome
Please, come in
So few customers
It's still early
Please, sit
Ask Natsuyo and Haruko to drink with us
I am Natsuyo
And that's Haruko
She is Akimi
I am Akimi
And Yukie
And the photo outside?
That photo was taken forty years ago
Oh, really?
We were famous in Tokyo
We were "The Four Seasons"
You suckers fell for it
We stayed together all these years
Aren't we beautiful?
Very beautiful
Now I get it
Where are the Four Sisters?
They're here
She is Natsuyo
Haruko, the one you like, is singing
All old ladies?
They took that photo forty years ago
They used to be famous
They retired here in Hokkaido and opened this bar
Let's leave
No
We can't leave now
It wouldn't be polite
See how friendly they are?
Have a drink
What would you like?
No more sake
A whiskey
How about Windsor whiskey?
Fine
A bottle of Whiskey, please
Right away
With ice, but no green tea
Fooled us with a forty-year-old photo
Very funny
Come in
A beautiful woman
Bottoms up
This is an inspirational song
Why are your voices so full of despair?
Added together, those four sisters are more than three hundred years old
How could we not despair?
You take your girlfriend on a trip
But you sneak out drinking and don't come home
What kind of romance is that?
You call that faithful?
It's called paying her back in her own coin
I allow your heart to love another man but my body can't enjoy a little fling?
You're shameless
If you let go of the past and be mine
I swear:
even if we were with Maggie Cheung plus
Angelina Jolie plus Sophie Marceau and supermodel Chi-Ling Lin
I wouldn't drink a single cup
That's right
You'd drink the whole bar
Feel to see if he has a fever
He's starting to talk crazy
Oh, my
Poor thing
Reality was so distant from your expectations
Should I find you a psychologist?
No medicine can heal my wounded heart
You're my best medicine
Not afraid I'm poison?
I'd drink you, even if you were
Someone tormented you
Now, you torment me
That's the wheel of fate
Bad karma
Hey
We passed this several times but I didn't say anything
Is it a church?
Why so small?
It's for confessions
Confessions?
A lot of city people feel guilty about all the bad things they've done
So, they come to Hokkaido to confess
Get the guilt out and seek forgiveness
You must have a lot of sins
Do a good confession
Clear your conscience and start over
Go in
They can't speak Chinese, anyway
You can tell them everything you've done
Better than keeping it inside and having nightmares
Go ahead
God is more forgiving than the police
We won't listen
We'll wait here for you
He's in your hands
Okay
Wu Sang
Sure he can't speak Chinese?
Don't worry.
Even if he did he's not going to broadcast it
Please, begin
I want to donate 10 million.
You want it?
Do you speak English?
That's ten times a million.
A lot
No English
Don't want any money?
You really don't understand
Now, I can relax
Let me start from the bad things I did in kindergarten
He really is a lot of fun
He hasn't changed in all these years
Just like he used to be
These past few days together brought back many good memories
He's a good man
And quite romantic
A head full of impractical ideas
Deep down
He's an idealist
That's why he's still a bachelor
Marriage is about destiny
Sometimes it's just not meant to be
It's fate
He really likes you
Most women don't understand him
I think you do
I hope it works out with you two
Did he tell you about his invention?
It's very interesting
Made him a chunk of money too
I don't know much about him
But he felt like an old friend
My intuition told me that he's a man I can rely on
If I'm going to get married, but can't be with the man I love
I should at least find a buddy
If that's what you're thinking
I advise you to let him go
Wouldn't be fair to him
I haven't lied to him
He accepts it
Smiley
I don't know what kind of man you really want to love
Does he deserve it more than Qin Fen?
You're being very selfish
You can't exploit other people's feelings
I hope I'm not being too direct
That's okay
I like straight-talkers
And then there was this time we were studying farm production all in the same dorm
Me
Little Wen
Zhang Kui, Lu Dewei
And also...
Oh, anyhow, there were eight or nine of us
And then, um
It was night time
I got this idea
The idea was, uh
We rubbed balm on the soles of his feet
Then waved a fan over them
As soon as we did
Zhang Kui wet his bed
His blanket and sheets were soaked
It really cracked us up
We didn't admit who did it
But later the next morning, he discovered that everything was wet
He didn't dare hang them out
He asked, How'd I pee myself?
Nobody said anything
Then somebody sold me out
Said I did it
I said, I would never do that
Excuse me
The time.
It's very late
I'm just getting started
After middle-school, I have countryside stories
Then my career
And love life
Just getting started
I said
I'm not that kind of person
I said, Little Wen did it
Little Wen said he said he didn't do it
He said I did it
No way.
I'd never do that
It was Lu Dewei and them
They did it
Me?
Even if it were possible
I'm not saying it wasn't my idea, but...
Miss
Miss, excuse me
Yes?
What's wrong?
Your friend is extremely pious
But he has far too many sins
We're a small church
We don't have enough room
Nearby is a much bigger church
So, please be so kind and take him there for confession
So sorry
I'll get him out right away
Very sorry
God please forgive his sins
I was young.
Didn't know any better
Felt I'd really wronged her
But now that I think of it...
Cut it out.
Let's go
Would even let me bow to her
Hey, Qin Fen
How many sins do you have?
The kind even Hell wouldn't let you in for?
Water...
Give me water
Lord please forgive his atrocities
The Lord sent you to save my soul and rescue me from Hell
Don't let Him down
I'm still in a world of suffering
Who will save me?
I will
That's hot
I hear this place has lots of bears
That's right
Anyone get hurt?
Yes
Bears seem clumsy
But when they attack
They're very fast
Faster than a deer
Smiley
Smiley.
Come back
Watch out for bears
Seeing a bear is good luck for you
Nonsense.
It's the bear's good luck
You see any?
Where?
C'mon, let's go
You really worried?
If you got hurt, how would I explain it?
To whom?
No one cares about me
I do
Wu Sang
Ask if they've seen any bears
What did they say?
They were a party of four
Now there's only two left
Huh?
How could there be bears here?
Impossible
We fooled you
You really believed us
Who says Japanese aren't funny?
A bunch of real jokers
The bear is coming
Protect your head and heart
If the bear flips you over flip back to your original position
So pretty
A terrible pity to eat you
Best keep you alive to mother cubs
You don't have bear eyes
What are they?
The eyes of a wolf
Regret meeting me?
No.
I'm quite happy
If you'll marry me our days will be sweet as honey
Would you really marry me?
If you say yes
We can tie the knot tonight
Such a big, bad bear
He said, Don't talk to bears
They'll tear you to pieces
I was torn apart long ago
Cold?
Let's go back
I'll light it for you
I want to do it for you
Do you want me?
Yes
I'm yours tonight
Just for tonight?
Yes
Then I'd rather not have you
Why not?
Don't you think I'm pretty?
I want to repay you
I can't owe you this favor
I won't be able to pay it back
You don't have to
You deserve it
Let me be a fool this once
I'm in love with you
Will you marry me?
Uh
Don't just say, "uh"
I want you to say
Yes or no?
Yes
When?
I need more time
How long?
Qin Fen
The last few days, I've watched myself through Wu Sang's eyes
I'm such a strange woman
Came all this way with you but just kept pushing you away
But you understand how I got here
I keep struggling to rescue myself from an abyss of despair
I hoped that your kindness and pristine Hokkaido could help me rediscover life's beauty
That was my selfish hope
But terrible love has already emptied me
The more I struggle the more the memories pull me down
This evening in the last sunset of my life
I saw the more lovely side of you
I also saw how pathetic and helpless I was
You are the perfect partner
If I'd only met you years ago
I'm a fool to let you pass me by
But this is God's punishment of me
Good-bye, Qin Fen
Don't look for me
Just please forgive me
After Smiley jumped she was found by a fishing boat
They rescued her
She's in surgery right now
So damned foolish
Now matter what happens, I'll be there for her
You really are naughty
I thought I was trouble
But you're worse than me
Your brother knows you've been hurt
But with your brother here you can overcome anything
Okay
I'm leaving
Alright
Otherwise, you'll lose your job
Be good to her
She's a good girl with a true heart
She's already died once
Her love for him is dead now too
This is for your wife and kids
More than ten years since we last met
Who knows when we'll meet again
She's going to need money now
Don't pull that polite crap with me
Money means nothing to me
What I lack are friends
My best friends are scattered to the winds
Sometimes, I really miss you guys
I feel terribly lonely
Take care
It's almost New Year's
You cheated death
So, make a wish
Give me your phone
Hello?
It's me
It's been a long time
I just want to thank you for once having loved me
I'm very happy now
Because I've found someone
I want to share my life with
Be good to your wife
I wish you both the best
Good-bye
That was my phone
Your phone sleeps with the fishes
You don't need to call anyone else
Understood
The root of the world's endless wars and escalating conflicts is our inability to judge disputes impartially
The Conflict Resolution Terminal wipes out both flaws
Please insert your hand
Okay
Now, grab this handle
Rock, paper, scissors
When I count to three we both pull it open
One
Two
Three
Interesting
Did you sell that to him?
Isn't that your invention?
You two are venture capitalists
I have my own humble opinion about the nature of investment
Venture capital is about risk
The greater the risk, the more one invests
No risk, no investment
I'll stake my reputation in saying to invest in this product is way too risky
Very suitable for venture capitalists
This will be a massive hi-tech IPO
A revolutionary product
Let's play each other with it
If I win throw it into the ocean for me
Is that you?
Who else could it be?
Why's you hair all grey?
The worst financial crisis of the century wiped me out
This year's economy is really in the dumps
Three top investment banks belly up
Nothing's selling
Don't cry
It's gonna be okay
Don't cry
Listen
I sold this to you, right?
Uh
Right?
Right
I'll buy it back
Name your price
Two million
But you were throwing it away
One million
Two million
One million
Let's not argue
A million, it is
Deal
I meant Sterling
Huh.
I meant Japanese Yen
Japanese Yen?
Uh
Don't worry.
Next year when the economy rebounds
I'll sell it at a high price
I'll split it with you
Let me see.
What are you looking at?
The future
Our wedding toast
Such beautiful delusions
Like sweet sugar cubes
Jumping into bitter coffee
Words I thought were true
Tears were all I knew
There's no going back now
Just waking up to get drunk again
Yes, Mr. Fan
This inventor...
What's his name again?
Qin Fen
Qin as in Qin Dynasty
Fen as in "to struggle"
He's waiting in the living room
Show him to the dining room
Yes, sir
This is Mr. Fan, angel investor
Mr. Qin, inventor of the CRT2008
Shall we speak English or Chinese?
Your decision
Whichever is more natural
Then let's use our mother tongue
Nice to meet you
Our mother tongue?
Oops.
Look at me
So used to English, I forgot my own language
So nice to meet you
A pleasure
Sit down
Sir, please
Give me the specifics
This invention of yours... what inspired it?
The root of the world's endless wars and escalating conflicts is our inability to judge disputes impartially
Continue
As children, we all played a game:
Rock, paper, scissors
You've played it?
Uh-huh
It's our most primal and effective conflict resolution method
So, why, as adults have we discarded this method?
Why?
Two critical flaws:
Hand velocity differential and last-minute sleight of hand
Sleight of hand
Rock, papers, scissors
A cunning hand can cheat
The Conflict Resolution Terminal wipes out both flaws
Hold it here
Stick your hand in
Not your head.
Your hand
Let's try it
Rock.
Paper.
Scissors
Ready?
Yes
Pull it open at the count of three
One
Two
Three
Fascinating
It's cheat-proof
You invented this?
I did
Just imagine
For instance this beautiful girl here
If we both wanted her, but...
Don't even think about it
It was hypothetical
If we all had Conflict Resolution Terminals the wars in the Balkans and Middle East
American presidential elections to elect a white or black President
Win or lose
The tube decides
Super good
The CRT2008 is useful in all aspects of life
It's a revolutionary product
Say no more
This will be a massive high-tech IPO
I'll buy the patent
Name a price
Two million
One million
Two million
One million
Let's do this
Let the CRT2008 decide
Good idea
Rock.
Paper.
Scissors
Ready?
Yes
One.
Two.
Three
Resolved
You got yourself a deal
I meant US dollars
Huh.
I meant Sterling
Marriage Personal
Looking for hot guys?
Don't bother
No gold-diggers either
To avoid mutual disappointment
PhD's need not reply
Women entrepreneurs need not reply
Parentheses: tradeswomen and peddlers excepted
Perfect men like Andy Lau and Tom Cruise won't be seeking you here
Nor do I expect to find Julia Roberts
Even if you were a goddess
I couldn't handle you
I'm not expecting a cover-girl to blow me away with your beauty
Just a sane, healthy woman
Modern on the outside traditional on the inside
Slightly demure would be ideal
Don't be too complicated
Don't be too young
Proficiency in folding laundry a plus
Preferably pressed and folded like they just came off the store shelf
Am I being specific?
Let me introduce myself
I'm no longer young
Solidly middle-class
Smoke, but don't drink
Went abroad to study
Lived overseas for a decade
Never really studied much
I slacked and learned a few survival skills
I've returned without accomplishment
Truthfully
I'm what they call a "Three Strikes" returnee:
No company.
No stocks.
No degree
Morally, I'm about 50-50
I'm no angel just too cowardly to do wrong
All in all, I'd classify myself as a constructive member of society
If interested, please call
I hope you're the one
Shan-shan
May I join you?
I'm expecting someone
You haven't changed much
Still handsome
You got the wrong guy
I'm Jianguo
From the construction company
I changed that much?
You don't recognize me?
Hey
From administration
Transferred from the army arts troupe
I was in logistics
Anyway, in charge of entertainment
Back then, you were a cute little boy
I remember you had single eyelids
How'd they get doubled?
Had them done in Korea
Gee, what a coincidence
Run into each other ten years later
What coincidence?
I made a date with you
A date with me?
Uh
Ai Moli
Molly
Like the name of this restaurant
I changed my name
I wanted to surprise you
Trying to get in my way?
My ad was for a marriage partner
I wanted to see you
Besides you didn't write
"No men wanted"
Of course I didn't
Why would I seek a man?
I'm not gay
You're...
Yes
Huh?
But I'm not
How do you know?
I used to think so too
But later I realized
I just lacked the courage to face it
Do you remember the labor union field trip to Shi Du?
My leg cramped when I was swimming
You rescued me
That's right
I held onto you tightly
You kept comforting me
Every since then, I felt so safe with you
When I don't see you
I want to...
Hey-hey-hey
You are ahead of the curve
But I am not that enlightened yet
Then why have you not married yet?
Haven't found the right one
Give me a break
Perhaps, subconsciously you dislike women
Oh...
No-no-no
Do you think I'm strange?
No
Absolutely not
I constantly ask myself:
Why am I so narrow-minded?
With such a big heart why can't I make room for a man?
Each time I clear a woman out guess what happens next?
Another woman fills in the space
Let me ask you something
Suppose
I were like you
I said "suppose"
Don't be angry if I get this wrong
You're bad
Forget it.
I better shut up
I know what you want to say
Deep down you're like my big brother
It's probably better that way
Brother
Yes?
You have great skin
So white
What's your first impression of me?
Much as I expected
Frankly looks aren't important
It's the inside that counts
Someone kind, and good to his parents
Even if I didn't like you
I'm sure you'll find a good wife
You really are a modern-traditional woman
A rare catch
Your parents still in good health?
My father passed away last year
My mother is still alive
I came back, so she wouldn't be alone
How old is she?
In her seventies
Your father...
Where is he buried?
At Eight Treasure Mountain
His urn is in the ossuary
Your mother is getting old
A filial son should give his parents a good resting place
Old people are fussy about final resting places
Don't you worry
I would never deprive them
A man should be responsible and filial
Even if he doesn't make much money he provides for his parents' needs
Now that's a reliable man
Tell the truth
Are you such a man?
I think I am
No, you're not
You keep your father's ashes in a tiny box
And how about when your mother dies?
Going to squeeze them both into a little box?
Not even enough room for incense and ghost money at Grave Sweeping Festival
You call that filial?
Then, I'll buy them a cemetery plot
It's not that I can't afford it
Just that when I left China only national heroes could afford a grave
Normal folk's ashes were kept on shelves
Don't worry
You find a spot with a nice view
I'll take care of it immediately
If you and I get along
I'll have your tombstone carved in advance
No way you'll be stored on a shelf
It really is a great investment
Just thirty thousand yuan gets you a grave plot with imperial fengshui
Thirty thousand
Price of a return trip to America
In just a few years, the same plot will be worth three hundred thousand
By the time you sell it you'll have made 1000% profit
Hold on
If I sell it where will my parents go?
You can buy two
If you buy two plots, my company will give you a 5% discount
Miss Liang?
Yes
I'm Qin Fen
Sorry, I was late
Have a seat
I never expected...
What?
Nothing
What's your line of work?
I'm a flight attendant
Which airline?
Hainan Airline
How would you grade yourself?
Six
Only six?
I'd give you a Nine
You've met a few already?
You mean these personals?
Uh
You're the first
Oh
Myself, I've met a couple
You're the first as beautiful as you
This one girl wasn't bad
But she was selling grave plots
She doesn't count
The rest were critically unkosher
Did you buy?
Huh?
The grave plots
Yes
She sweet-talked me
Called me a filial son
If I didn't buy, I'd ruin my reputation
No wife, but got myself a grave
I read your marriage ad.
I think you're very funny
Not like the others, so full of themselves
Or who write a load of sentimental crap
It's disgusting
I'll be totally honest with you
And I'm not trying to flatter you
But judging by your looks
I'd rank you at the "goddess" level
You must have high standards
You're not selling airplanes, are you?
Graves are one thing
But I can't afford airplanes
Why "no women entrepreneurs"?
They're too practical
I prefer more emotional types
What's wrong with being practical?
These days, most people are practical
My mom and friends all advise me to be more practical
That's why I'm here meeting you
To learn to be more practical
Then you got the wrong guy
I'm definitely not the type you're seeking
How do you know my type?
I don't even know what type is
Being here seems so unreal
But I did telephone you
I'm the one who asked you out
You mean you're not serious
You were confused and regret meeting me
A little
Don't be mad
It's not because of you
I think I'm a bit ridiculous
Then we should stop here
It's good we're direct.
Simpler
We won't waste each other's time
You busy?
Not at all
But we don't have any hope
Then, go ahead
I'll sit here awhile
Okay
See you later, then
Good-bye Wait, that's not right
We won't see each other again
In that case...
"Farewell" isn't correct either
You really are a pain
What we mean is...
See you never
Hey
Feel like a drink?
We can go somewhere nearby and chat a little more
Why?
Chat about what?
You a shill for a restaurant posing as a lonely woman?
Enough, already
I didn't suspect you of a crime
So, don't be suspicious of me
In truth, I am a criminal
I was worried you weren't
You drink like a wimp
It won't kill you
Drink up.
No one's stopping you
Keep talking
Heard of "love at first sight"?
I loved the first sight of you
We're not even "love at third sight"
Love at first sight doesn't mean
I fall for you when I see you
Or that you fall for me
It's not about sight
But smell
The other person's scent attracts you
Enchants you
Some people are made for each other
So, two strangers rush up and sniff each other up and down?
Is that possible?
It's not like that
If you're made for each other you'd sense each other from far away
Ever watch "Animal Planet"?
Yes
Even from dozens of miles away animals can sense each other
People are just like animals
Are you only attracted by one smell?
Animals don't fixate on just one lover or type
It's a mutual thing
It's not just attraction, but a kind of infatuation
Anything else repels you
Then why come all this way to bother me?
Infatuated, but you can't be together
You struggle to break free from it
You're torn apart by heartache
You drink yourself to sleep each night
The man has a family
He loves you, but can't marry you
Your parents don't know
It hurts, but you can't share it
I can't tell anyone
Then why tell me?
I couldn't take it anymore
I was hurt too badly
Anyway, I won't see you again
Who cares what you think of me
Then I should charge a fee
He has all the fun and I get a miserable woman
Since when are we best buddies?
Take as much as you want
But I'm paying you to drink up
You can't just sip
I really can't drink
I'll accompany you for free
So, don't drink
I told you one of my secrets
You should also tell me something you can't admit to anyone else
Then we'll be even
Why are you so complicated?
Fine, don't tell me
I don't care, anyway
Let it rot in your stomach
And I thought you were a big man
Based on what you've got dare you ask for a sentimental woman
We won't see each other again?
Nope
Know why I don't drink?
Aren't you drinking now?
A friend and I ran a travel agency in America
We specialized in Chinese groups
Once, we had a government tour group
Led by a bureau director
A very juicy gig
There was a woman named Xiaobai
A translator
Pretty.
The quiet type
I had her in my sights the moment they landed
During the trip
I started to fall for her
Later on we, you know...
What?
We, uh... got intimate
Afterwards, she cried
Wanted me to help her stay in America
I agreed without a second thought
I really liked her
Besides, it was easy for me
The next day I told my friend that I was with Xiaobai
I asked him to help me keep Xiaobai in America
He freaked out
Said, Absolutely not
We'd got the job because of his connection with the bureau director
If they left someone behind the director would be disciplined
Besides screwing the director it could also kill our business
If I insisted on her staying
I think my friend would killed me
So, you two sold her out
Let me finish
I had to beg my friend
I'd make sure she didn't run for it
But he had to promise not to report her
When we saw them off at the airport
Xiaobai just stared at me
With eyes like daggers
Couldn't even look at her
I was so ashamed
That's your secret?
This year the director heard I was back
He invited us to dinner
The people from the tour group came too
Only person missing was Xiaobai
I made a lot of small talk then casually asked about Xiaobai
They said, You don't know?
Soon after she returned, she killed herself
My head just exploded
I asked, What happened?
He said
Her husband was abusive
Beat her all the time
She kept trying to divorce him
She'd planned to stay in America
But she failed
Even got reported
She returned completely hopeless
So, I asked my friend if he'd reported her
He said, Yes
Said he couldn't trust me
So he told the director
That day
I beat up my friend
I drank a lot
Until finally
I was sprawling on the floor grabbing people's legs and crying
Why'd you beat him?
You're the one who killed her
You're despicable
After that day every time I drink, I remember her
Later, I just quit drinking
But you had to make me drink and spill my rotten guts
We even?
Now you know what I'm made of
You can go now
Leave
So, if we get married
I have to go live with your family?
Can I refuse?
There's something you need to know
What?
My aunt has a bad memory
How bad?
She can remember today's events
By tomorrow, it's all gone
Is your home far?
How do I get there?
First you fly to Kunming
Then a day's bus ride to Mengzi
Then another bus to Pingbian
Then a day by tractor
Another day by ox cart and you're home
She can't remember things
And people?
Nope
Not even people?
But she writes all important events and people in her notebook
If you two marry she'll read it every morning and recall who you are
Qin Fen
You're tired already?
Keep playing
If it doesn't work out
Can we divorce?
My big brother will break your legs
Sister
Don't record that
Best to forget what happened today
What we're talking about?
You like it here in Haikou?
It's great
Sunny, no pollution, tropical
I've been here two years
I play golf, swim, dive
Never felt healthier
Gotta take care of yourself
Uh
How are the blind dates?
Still blind
Let me fix you up
Yes For real
A really good person
If I weren't married
I'd marry her myself
I used to be married
My husband passed away
When?
Just recently
How long were you together?
Is this... very important to you?
Of course
If you were deeply in love
After all, his bones are barely cold yet
Seven or eight years
You must be hurting
Compared to before
I feel much better now
These past five years didn't even know where he slept at night
I finally know where he is
You found him a spot
Yanchun Ridge Cemetery
Whenever I need him, he's there
If he runs away now you should get your money back
How old are you?
Fifty?
No
Forty-something
I look older, don't I?
That's okay
I like older men
How's your health?
On the weak side
That's great
Don't bother exercising
If you get sick, I'll nurse you
You don't want a strong healthy body?
You prefer a soft marshmallow?
Soft marshmallows taste better
An old, sickly guy
You're not worried about marriage quality?
At your age...
Let me be frank
You're at your sexual peak
You believe the foundation for love is sex?
Not entirely
But love without sex is not love
That would be friendship
I don't agree
What's wrong with no sex?
Many people grow old together without it
I don't mean to imply no sex at all
Just not too frequently
Tell me
What's your idea of
"not too frequently"?
Ideally speaking...
Yes?
Once a month?
Once a year
If you agree we can meet again
I don't agree
I know why your husband never came home
If we got married
I'd be hard to find too
A real pity
Is sex really all that interesting?
Oh, yeah
Sorry, I couldn't answer just now
Smiley
Please don't get angry, but...
My wife and I will be on the same flight as you
Can't you change your ticket?
I just found out
She booked it ages ago
I never expected it would be your flight
You know I care about you
I have to attend my brother's wedding
I just hope you can make sure she doesn't see you
It would be better
How should I do that?
It's an airplane cabin and you're seated in first class
Where should I hide myself?
You can't treat me like this
Welcome to Grand China Air
Welcome to Grand China Air
Boarding pass, please
Smiley Liang
It really is you
Old foes meet again
Please take your seat and don't block the aisle
Welcome to Grand China Air
Hello.
This way, please
Welcome to Grand China Air
Boarding pass, please
This way on the left
Thank you
Welcome to Grand China Air
Boarding pass, please
This way, sir
Please hurry and take your seat
Sir, as soon as possible
We're about to close the door
Please sign this
Here
I'll sign it
Thank you
Hi, I'll get that for you
Please take your seat
Hot towel
Something to drink?
Miss?
If there is an empty seat
I'd like to sit with my husband
Sorry
First class is full today
But I'd be happy to look in economy
My husband and I booked this flight
Why aren't we seated together?
Next time you can arrive earlier to have your boarding passes changed
The computer doesn't know you're husband and wife
I'll switch with you
No one should split up a married couple
Young comrade
I know you're not responsible for ticketing
But you should listen to customer feedback and submit our suggestions to your superiors
The key to improving customer service is paying attention to details
Please, sir.
C'mon
No point in troubling you
It's a short flight
We're about to take off
If you're going to switch seats please do it soon
It's no trouble
I'm already up.
Go ahead
Please
Thank you
Please fasten your seat belts Thank you
Ladies and gentlemen we'll be taking off shortly
To ensure your safety, please check that your seat belts are fastened and that all cell phones are turned off
Thank you
We're already taxiing
Whatever it is, can wait
Just wanted to remind you for your own safety to fasten your seat belt
So, that gentleman is the little runt you can't live without?
Please don't interrupt my work
Some things just aren't meant to be
I'll be in Hangzhou for a few days
If you're flying to Beijing call me if you feel like a drink
I can be your non-fatal drinking buddy
When outsiders imagine Hangzhou they often think of West Lake
What they don't know is that a mere 5 kilometers away is a rare environmental treasure
Here is China's first wetlands national park:
West Brook Wetlands
An exiled Song Dynasty emperor happened upon these wetlands
Like me, he was enchanted
He wanted to build his temporary palace here
But due to lack of funds the project was abandoned
The night before he had to leave the Emperor said:
West Brook, may you remain here
And thus it earned its eternal name
The home we're seeing today is in Remain Here Town
I trust you'll want to stay too
The Emperor would have stayed
But he was broke
All that remained were his words
But I've brought cash
If I like the place my whole life will remain here
This is your foyer
Your living room
Your master bedroom
And this is your private pond
Hey, take it easy
Stop saying "your" living room, "your" bedroom
"your" private pond
I don't know if I'm buying yet
I'm sure you've seen better homes
But no amount of money could buy an environment like this
Hello?
I was in a lousy mood yesterday
So I took a day off and stayed in Hangzhou
Drank half a bottle of wine to get to sleep
Slept in the whole morning
Woke up not knowing what to do
If you're not busy care to join me for a chat?
That's fine, but
I've got another blind date
You came all the way to Hangzhou?
Really casting a wide net
Can't leave any stone unturned
Better to kill a thousand innocents than set one guilty person free
Well, I'm not busy
Take me along.
I'll consult for you
How should I introduce you?
Say we already dated but you rejected me?
Say we're drinking buddies
Or, don't introduce me at all
I'll just sit nearby and drink tea
I'll advise you afterwards
I won't get in your way
Sounds good
But I'm warning you:
If I find a suitable match if we dig each other's smell you're not my responsibility
Don't call me a fair-weather friend
Relax
If that happens
I'll be overjoyed for you
See you
Hey, miss
How much does this place cost?
Don't mind me
You are not from here
I'm Taiwanese
My father owns a factory in Hangzhou
We're here for the time being
Ever been to Beijing?
Of course
Which do you prefer?
That's a difficult question
For weather and living environment
Hangzhou, of course
But I quite like Beijingers
My grandfather is from Beijing
I love hearing his accent
What is go-ING on'?
The accent is the last word
Not the first word
What is going ON'
What is going ON'
What is going on'
Later on my grandfather went to Taiwan with the Nationalists after the Mainland had fallen
Hold on there
We call it "liberated"
You say "fallen"
we say "liberated"
Liberated?
What does "liberated" mean?
Liberated
I get it
The difference between liberated and fallen is just one's point-of-view
Right, that's it
We can agree to disagree
Exactly
There are some universal values
For instance compassion is to love all beings
After the recent earthquake
Taiwanese all rushed to provide relief
Mainland Chinese were very moved
My father's company donated too
It pained us to see fellow Chinese suffering
Especially children who lost their parents
Poor things
There was a dying mother on the news
To her last breath, she breast-fed her child
Even after dying, she was still nursing
Maternal love knows no bounds
A mother can sacrifice anything for her child
Dads too
Even if it wasn't my child
I could adopt one of those orphans
You have such deep love for children?
Yes
If you were an orphan
I'd adopt you too
Idealists really do have bad memories
I told you my father has a factory here
But don't despair
I have one in my belly
You can be his father
Thought you weren't married?
I'm not
But
I'm pregnant
Whose is it?
Not worth mentioning
He abandoned the darling in my belly
I don't want the child to be fatherless
So
I'm seeking a loving father for him
You're a good candidate
Uh, well
Do you like me?
I like you a lot but...
You said you didn't care if it was your own
If we don't tell him and the child only knows you
He would be just like your own
An orphan, I can accept
But with a full set of parents?
You can't just put a Mercedes ornament on the hood of a BMW
It will still be a good car
But if it breaks down
Mercedes parts won't fit and BMW won't repair it
We should forget it
I'm flattered you like me
But I'm not the right man
I'll have to bite the bullet
What a perfect opportunity
How could you be so heartless?
Seemed like a great fit
Look
She's beautiful wealthy and you get a son for free
For a guy like you it's like winning the lottery
Normally, I don't mind free lunches but starting a family requires self-reliance
No foreign aid accepted
I think this blind date thing isn't too kosher for me
I have no appetite for ugly ducklings but the good-looking ones are either hiding something or hate sex
Where'd the simple, sane women all go?
Why can't I meet even one?
What are you saying about me?
Think your sane and uncomplicated?
Oh, not you.
You're not good-looking
Calling you "good-looking" would be an insult
You're ravishingly beautiful
A rare, precious beauty
If you were royalty you'd be up there with Diana
Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder
But, no exaggeration even to a foe, you'd be beautiful
Don't hold it in.
Laugh
I need to ask you something
I sat with you through your date
Accompany me to meet someone?
I didn't ask you to come
You invited yourself
Will you or won't you?
No
I'm asking you one more time
No
Fine
Good-bye
This is Mr. Qin
You met on the flight
Nice to meet you
Have a seat
Sit here
Excuse us
We'll need some privacy
Okay
Thanks
Mr. Qin and I knew each other before
Just acquaintances
But meeting again on the flight something sparked between us
Perhaps it was "love at second sight"
After we landed, Mr. Qin called me
He asked me to stay a few more days to become better acquainted
We've been together the past two days
We feel fortunate to have met again
You're the person closest to me
So I brought him here to introduce you formally
It's right that you should know
Not going to wish us well?
You always wanted me to have a home
Smiley told me a lot about you
Said you treat her very well
Meeting you on the airplane seemed like fate
You've made your decision?
Mr. Qin
Perhaps you know about
Smiley and me
I'm not as lucky as you
I entrust her to you, good brother
Be good to her
She's stubborn.
I spoiled her
Be patient with her
If she's unhappy
I'll be unhappy too
Alright, this scene is over.
I can't take it
I'll be leaving now
I know it's difficult for you to meet
Smiley and I are just ordinary friends
You're the only one she cares about
You're the lucky one
She drinks everyday because of you
It could kill her if she keeps it up
I can't go on like this
I'm weak and ashamed
I will use my mind and body all of me to do something to make you regret
Stop drinking
Smiley
I have not betrayed you
How could I ever punish you?
You asked me to wait three years
I waited
You won't want me
But I will care about you until that day we agreed upon
I thought I could love you my whole life
I never thought our time together could one day end
One, two, three
One, two, three
One, two, three
One, two, three
I stopped drinking
Don't worry.
Smiley
Surname Qin
"Qin" as in Emperor Qin
Fen as in "to struggle"
Smiley
I got your text message
"Smiley" as in "smiles hiding knives"
Correct
I called twice but you didn't answer
Call me
Yeah
At the place we met the first time
I already said it eight times:
five o'clock
Yeah, that's right
Be there or be square
Pardon me
I've got two dates
Please don't mind my efficiency
No problem
I'm a stock trader
A real bear market lately
Using my spare time to find a husband
Once the market turns around
I won't have time
Do you play the stock market?
No
Don't understand it
Seeking a marriage partner is like trading stocks
You have to make your decisions based on a rational analysis of performance
For instance, the candidate's looks or body figure
Or, his personality and education
Or, his finances and family background
Or
So... if I were a stock how would I rate?
Judging from age and looks you've sunk below your offer price
So, I'm in danger of being delisted?
Not necessarily
Inexperienced traders often buy high
But that's very risky
It's very easy to get trapped
More experienced traders buy low
A stock like you with bad performance most won't touch you
Few would show interest
Thus you're a low risk
You're already at the bottom
Can't go any lower
So, for a stock like me bought low would you invest long-term or just "pump and dump"?
Pump and dump?
Do you have explosive potential?
I'd buy long-term and hold it
What if you held it for a while but found its performance lacking?
Don't worry
I'm not stupid.
I'd diversify
They can't all underperform, right?
No one's that unlucky
Hello?
You're here?
I'm here
I see you
Wait for me
Order whatever you like.
It's on me
I feel obligated to warn you:
I'm very risky
Best to keep your distance
If you got stuck with me
I'd be useless and unsightly
Might never be able to get rid of me
As an investment
I'd be subprime
Only a criminal would sell me to you
Let's stop trading for today
I also have another stock to see at six o'clock
Go ahead and chat with her
The whole market is down right now
But don't jump in blindly
Don't rush it
Wait and see
Did I interrupt anything?
She wasn't interested
Said I'd dropped below my offer price
Poor thing
Old guy on the dating scene getting his pride injured
Spare me the alligator tears
So what's up?
I want to become your girlfriend
Which type of girlfriend?
The kind you marry
Why?
You knocked up, too?
I'm not in a mood for joking
I have just one condition
What?
While we're dating or even married
I'll fulfill all the duties of a wife but you'll allow me to have someone else in my heart
I won't do anything
I'll just keep a space for him in my heart
I might miss him from time to time
But it won't be anything more than that
I'll never contact him
Can you accept this?
Your body is here but your heart is elsewhere
You can refuse
I know it's unfair
Then, is it okay with you if my heart is here but my body occasionally has a fling?
No
Well, what if when your heart drifts away my heart drifts away too?
Fine
But our bodies are faithful to each other
Come here
Then, I'll need to find someone else too
Otherwise, you'll have one and I won't
I'd be at a huge disadvantage
Then, you agree?
Yes
Will you go with me to Hokkaido?
He and I started there
I'd like to end it there too
Are you bubbling with joy?
Wu Sang
Haven't changed in ten years
Look just like a Hokkaido peasant
Except a bit more devious
This is Smiley
This is the Wu Sang I told you about
Married a Hokkaido wife and never left
Ms. Liang, honored to be of service to you
Thank you
I'll get that
Thanks
This way
Wu Sang
What are those arrows for?
Ms. Liang you've been here before
You must know why.
Tell him
Hey
Hey
He asked you a question
What?
Those arrows pointing down
Know what they mean?
Hokkaido gets heavy snow in winter
The arrows point to the road's edge so drivers don't hit the curb
Ah
I see
Did I say it right?
Yes
You learned that from him, right?
Let's have a good time here
You're my boyfriend now
Let's not mention him
Okay?
I'm not used to it yet
It's like my wallet is full of borrowed money
After I spend it, I'll be in debt
Hey, Wu Sang, stop the car
I need to go worship
Don't know what he's saying
No chance today
Why not?
The temple's closed to the public today
No worshipping for you
Well, talk to him
Tell him we came from China just for today
Have you done something wrong?
I thought you were atheist
Why so suddenly pious?
I found religion
God sent me such a beautiful wife
I'd be rude not to burn some incense
Hey
I'm not your wife yet
Besides, a Japanese Buddha can't help you
Blasphemy
Buddha has no nationality
Hokkaido is my land of fortune
I'll pray to every Buddha I find here
Go talk to him
Okay, okay
In honor of your incredible luck with Ms. Liang
I'll talk to him for you
Why are we being frisked?
It's the funeral of an influential family
Then, let's get out of here
You kidding?
We can't go now
Stop peeking
Act mournful
Did you really cry?
No laughing
You didn't cry?
I saw you cry too
I tried to keep the tears in
Just couldn't hold them any longer
These Japanese must think we Chinese are really loyal friends
We're not even family, but we came all this way to cry our eyes out
Practically forced our way in
Neither of you better piss me off
I'm a mafia guy now
You knew this was a funeral
What are you complaining about?
You just had to go in
You're truly adorable
Excuse me
Which way to Hinanoza Hotel?
Straight ahead
Turn right and you'll see it
Thank you
Very easy to find
It's just up ahead
That says "Four Sisters-What?"
Four Sisters dining bar
How are we going to sleep?
You two in one room
You and I can share a room
Catch up on old times
Cut the pretense
A beauty like her and you want to be in my room?
It's not a pretense
We're not that close yet
I'm not the one she loves
Wishing you a pleasant rest
Thank you
Here, try this
It's fishy
Penetrating
Stimulating
Try it
I'm already over-stimulated
What I need now is numbness
Best part about drinking is the numbness
Can't drink on an empty stomach
Try these clams
I need to get numb too
If your dreams had not been shattered
I'd never be talking marriage with you
My life's been no easier than yours
How can you allow your girlfriend to have someone else in her heart?
Why do you like me?
Did I say I liked you?
Be honest
It our basis for being together in the future
My basis for marrying you is that
I can't find anyone more foolish
I'll never be so foolish again
You are incapable of splitting your heart in half
You're a terrible actor
Your feelings are writ across your face
Here's what I think
You're not over him yet
But once you are your heart will be whole again
That's why I tolerate you right now
You're a fool, but I'm not
If I learn my lesson and get smart will it ruin your beautiful plan?
In that case
I'll sell you to the local tribesmen
You'll hunt and fish for the rest of your life
And have a slew of babies
Scorched by the sun, drenched in rain
Half-starving, in tattered clothes
If you try to escape they'll catch you and beat you
Three tortuous years from now you'll be an ugly, repulsive, wizened old hag
I'm just getting started
Wanna hear more?
I'm only fooling around with you because you're pretty
Can you accept that?
You up to it?
In the game of emotional counterfeit you think you're my match?
I'll bet you couldn't even tell if I had eight other women in my heart
I've got nothing to lose
You don't care about me
So, I just take what you're giving away
What are you guys so upset for
Getting on my case
If I didn't say something nasty, she'd never stop
You really are serious
Sit down
Let her go
What a perfect opportunity
After this drink, you should invite Smiley to the hot spring with you
What friend would do that?
And abandon you here?
Spare me
This time, I'm serious about marrying her
I can't be reckless
She'd never give me her body before she gave me her heart
But, then once she gives you her heart your body is sentenced for life
So, I should enjoy freedom while I can
What do you like about her?
She has a good soul
Oh, please
You like her because she's pretty
What's wrong with that?
I should deprive my children of good genes?
Must I marry someone ugly?
Spend the life trying to escape?
Which of these four is prettiest?
They're all charming
Natsuyo.
She's pretty
I say Haruko
Sorry to disturb you
May we come in?
Welcome
Please, come in
So few customers
It's still early
Please, sit
Ask Natsuyo and Haruko to drink with us
I am Natsuyo
And that's Haruko
She is Akimi
I am Akimi
And Yukie
And the photo outside?
That photo was taken forty years ago
Oh, really?
We were famous in Tokyo
We were "The Four Seasons"
You suckers fell for it
We stayed together all these years
Aren't we beautiful?
Very beautiful
Now I get it
Where are the Four Sisters?
They're here
She is Natsuyo
Haruko, the one you like, is singing
All old ladies?
They took that photo forty years ago
They used to be famous
They retired here in Hokkaido and opened this bar
Let's leave
No
We can't leave now
It wouldn't be polite
See how friendly they are?
Have a drink
What would you like?
No more sake
A whiskey
How about Windsor whiskey?
Fine
A bottle of Whiskey, please
Right away
With ice, but no green tea
Fooled us with a forty-year-old photo
Very funny
Come in
A beautiful woman
Bottoms up
This is an inspirational song
Why are your voices so full of despair?
Added together, those four sisters are more than three hundred years old
How could we not despair?
You take your girlfriend on a trip
But you sneak out drinking and don't come home
What kind of romance is that?
You call that faithful?
It's called paying her back in her own coin
I allow your heart to love another man but my body can't enjoy a little fling?
You're shameless
If you let go of the past and be mine
I swear:
even if we were with Maggie Cheung plus
Angelina Jolie plus Sophie Marceau and supermodel Chi-Ling Lin
I wouldn't drink a single cup
That's right
You'd drink the whole bar
Feel to see if he has a fever
He's starting to talk crazy
Oh, my
Poor thing
Reality was so distant from your expectations
Should I find you a psychologist?
No medicine can heal my wounded heart
You're my best medicine
Not afraid I'm poison?
I'd drink you, even if you were
Someone tormented you
Now, you torment me
That's the wheel of fate
Bad karma
Hey
We passed this several times but I didn't say anything
Is it a church?
Why so small?
It's for confessions
Confessions?
A lot of city people feel guilty about all the bad things they've done
So, they come to Hokkaido to confess
Get the guilt out and seek forgiveness
You must have a lot of sins
Do a good confession
Clear your conscience and start over
Go in
They can't speak Chinese, anyway
You can tell them everything you've done
Better than keeping it inside and having nightmares
Go ahead
God is more forgiving than the police
We won't listen
We'll wait here for you
He's in your hands
Okay
Wu Sang
Sure he can't speak Chinese?
Don't worry.
Even if he did he's not going to broadcast it
Please, begin
I want to donate 10 million.
You want it?
Do you speak English?
That's ten times a million.
A lot
No English
Don't want any money?
You really don't understand
Now, I can relax
Let me start from the bad things I did in kindergarten
He really is a lot of fun
He hasn't changed in all these years
Just like he used to be
These past few days together brought back many good memories
He's a good man
And quite romantic
A head full of impractical ideas
Deep down
He's an idealist
That's why he's still a bachelor
Marriage is about destiny
Sometimes it's just not meant to be
It's fate
He really likes you
Most women don't understand him
I think you do
I hope it works out with you two
Did he tell you about his invention?
It's very interesting
Made him a chunk of money too
I don't know much about him
But he felt like an old friend
My intuition told me that he's a man I can rely on
If I'm going to get married, but can't be with the man I love
I should at least find a buddy
If that's what you're thinking
I advise you to let him go
Wouldn't be fair to him
I haven't lied to him
He accepts it
Smiley
I don't know what kind of man you really want to love
Does he deserve it more than Qin Fen?
You're being very selfish
You can't exploit other people's feelings
I hope I'm not being too direct
That's okay
I like straight-talkers
And then there was this time we were studying farm production all in the same dorm
Me
Little Wen
Zhang Kui, Lu Dewei
And also...
Oh, anyhow, there were eight or nine of us
And then, um
It was night time
I got this idea
The idea was, uh
We rubbed balm on the soles of his feet
Then waved a fan over them
As soon as we did
Zhang Kui wet his bed
His blanket and sheets were soaked
It really cracked us up
We didn't admit who did it
But later the next morning, he discovered that everything was wet
He didn't dare hang them out
He asked, How'd I pee myself?
Nobody said anything
Then somebody sold me out
Said I did it
I said, I would never do that
Excuse me
The time.
It's very late
I'm just getting started
After middle-school, I have countryside stories
Then my career
And love life
Just getting started
I said
I'm not that kind of person
I said, Little Wen did it
Little Wen said he said he didn't do it
He said I did it
No way.
I'd never do that
It was Lu Dewei and them
They did it
Me?
Even if it were possible
I'm not saying it wasn't my idea, but...
Miss
Miss, excuse me
Yes?
What's wrong?
Your friend is extremely pious
But he has far too many sins
We're a small church
We don't have enough room
Nearby is a much bigger church
So, please be so kind and take him there for confession
So sorry
I'll get him out right away
Very sorry
God please forgive his sins
I was young.
Didn't know any better
Felt I'd really wronged her
But now that I think of it...
Cut it out.
Let's go
Would even let me bow to her
Hey, Qin Fen
How many sins do you have?
The kind even Hell wouldn't let you in for?
Water...
Give me water
Lord please forgive his atrocities
The Lord sent you to save my soul and rescue me from Hell
Don't let Him down
I'm still in a world of suffering
Who will save me?
I will
That's hot
I hear this place has lots of bears
That's right
Anyone get hurt?
Yes
Bears seem clumsy
But when they attack
They're very fast
Faster than a deer
Smiley
Smiley.
Come back
Watch out for bears
Seeing a bear is good luck for you
Nonsense.
It's the bear's good luck
You see any?
Where?
C'mon, let's go
You really worried?
If you got hurt, how would I explain it?
To whom?
No one cares about me
I do
Wu Sang
Ask if they've seen any bears
What did they say?
They were a party of four
Now there's only two left
Huh?
How could there be bears here?
Impossible
We fooled you
You really believed us
Who says Japanese aren't funny?
A bunch of real jokers
The bear is coming
Protect your head and heart
If the bear flips you over flip back to your original position
So pretty
A terrible pity to eat you
Best keep you alive to mother cubs
You don't have bear eyes
What are they?
The eyes of a wolf
Regret meeting me?
No.
I'm quite happy
If you'll marry me our days will be sweet as honey
Would you really marry me?
If you say yes
We can tie the knot tonight
Such a big, bad bear
He said, Don't talk to bears
They'll tear you to pieces
I was torn apart long ago
Cold?
Let's go back
I'll light it for you
I want to do it for you
Do you want me?
Yes
I'm yours tonight
Just for tonight?
Yes
Then I'd rather not have you
Why not?
Don't you think I'm pretty?
I want to repay you
I can't owe you this favor
I won't be able to pay it back
You don't have to
You deserve it
Let me be a fool this once
I'm in love with you
Will you marry me?
Uh
Don't just say, "uh"
I want you to say
Yes or no?
Yes
When?
I need more time
How long?
Qin Fen
The last few days, I've watched myself through Wu Sang's eyes
I'm such a strange woman
Came all this way with you but just kept pushing you away
But you understand how I got here
I keep struggling to rescue myself from an abyss of despair
I hoped that your kindness and pristine Hokkaido could help me rediscover life's beauty
That was my selfish hope
But terrible love has already emptied me
The more I struggle the more the memories pull me down
This evening in the last sunset of my life
I saw the more lovely side of you
I also saw how pathetic and helpless I was
You are the perfect partner
If I'd only met you years ago
I'm a fool to let you pass me by
But this is God's punishment of me
Good-bye, Qin Fen
Don't look for me
Just please forgive me
After Smiley jumped she was found by a fishing boat
They rescued her
She's in surgery right now
So damned foolish
Now matter what happens, I'll be there for her
You really are naughty
I thought I was trouble
But you're worse than me
Your brother knows you've been hurt
But with your brother here you can overcome anything
Okay
I'm leaving
Alright
Otherwise, you'll lose your job
Be good to her
She's a good girl with a true heart
She's already died once
Her love for him is dead now too
This is for your wife and kids
More than ten years since we last met
Who knows when we'll meet again
She's going to need money now
Don't pull that polite crap with me
Money means nothing to me
What I lack are friends
My best friends are scattered to the winds
Sometimes, I really miss you guys
I feel terribly lonely
Take care
It's almost New Year's
You cheated death
So, make a wish
Give me your phone
Hello?
It's me
It's been a long time
I just want to thank you for once having loved me
I'm very happy now
Because I've found someone
I want to share my life with
Be good to your wife
I wish you both the best
Good-bye
That was my phone
Your phone sleeps with the fishes
You don't need to call anyone else
Understood
The root of the world's endless wars and escalating conflicts is our inability to judge disputes impartially
The Conflict Resolution Terminal wipes out both flaws
Please insert your hand
Okay
Now, grab this handle
Rock, paper, scissors
When I count to three we both pull it open
One
Two
Three
Interesting
Did you sell that to him?
Isn't that your invention?
You two are venture capitalists
I have my own humble opinion about the nature of investment
Venture capital is about risk
The greater the risk, the more one invests
No risk, no investment
I'll stake my reputation in saying to invest in this product is way too risky
Very suitable for venture capitalists
This will be a massive hi-tech IPO
A revolutionary product
Let's play each other with it
If I win throw it into the ocean for me
Is that you?
Who else could it be?
Why's you hair all grey?
The worst financial crisis of the century wiped me out
This year's economy is really in the dumps
Three top investment banks belly up
Nothing's selling
Don't cry
It's gonna be okay
Don't cry
Listen
I sold this to you, right?
Uh
Right?
Right
I'll buy it back
Name your price
Two million
But you were throwing it away
One million
Two million
One million
Let's not argue
A million, it is
Deal
I meant Sterling
Huh.
I meant Japanese Yen
Japanese Yen?
Uh
Don't worry.
Next year when the economy rebounds
I'll sell it at a high price
I'll split it with you
Let me see.
What are you looking at?
The future
Our wedding toast
Such beautiful delusions
Like sweet sugar cubes
Jumping into bitter coffee
Words I thought were true
Tears were all I knew
There's no going back now
Just waking up to get drunk again
Subtitles by LeapinLar
What is the future of humanity?
Beneath the ebb and flow of civilization is a torrent of eternal conflict
Then disputes continue unresolved
they give birth tragedy
Must the wheel of history keep turning like this?
I have a dream
I dream of a day when
There will be a way to resolve all the world's conflicts
Swords beaten into ploughshears and spears into pruning hooks
I dream of a day when
There will be a method able to resolve any human disputes
Flowers in the field shall bloom and childern shall once more know joy
I have a dream
What is this century's most precious commodity?
Peace
Yes, Mr.Fan
This inventor
What's his name again?
Qin Fen
Qin as in Qin Dynasty
Fen as in "to struggle"
He's waiting in the living room
Show him to the dining room
Yes, sir
This is Mr.Fan, angel investor
Mr.Qin, inventor of the CRT2008
Shall we speak English or Chinese?
Your decision
Whichever is more natural
Then let's use our mother tongue
Nice to meet you
Our mother tongue?
Oops, Look at me
So used to English, I forgot my own language
So nice to meet you
A pleasure
Sit down
Sir please
Give me the specifics
This invention;
This invention of yours, what inspires it?
The root of the world's endless wars and escalating conflicts is our inability to judge disputes impartially
Continue
As children, we all played a game
Rock, paper, scissors
You played it
Hmm!
It's our most primal and effective conflict resolution method
So, why as adults have we discarded this method?
Why?
Two critical flaws hand velocity differential and
last minute sleight of hand
Sleight of hand
Rock, paper, scissors
A cunning hand can cheat!
The Conflict Resolution Terminal wipes out both flaws
Hold it here
Stick your hand in
Not your head!
Your hand!
Let's try it
Rock, paper, scissors
Ready?
Yes
Pull it open at the count of three
One
Two
Three!
Fascinating!
It's cheat proof
You invented this?
I did
Just imagine;
For instance
This beautiful girl here
If we both wanted her, but
Don't even think about it
It was hypothetical if we all had Conflict Resolution Terminals the wars in the Balkans and Middle East
American Presidential elections to elect a white or black President win or lose the tube decides!
Super good!
The CRT2008 is useful in all aspects of life
It's a revolutionary product
Say no more
This will be a massive high tech IPO
I'll buy the patent
Name a price
Two millions
One million
Two millions
One million
Let's do this
Let the CRT2008 decide
Good idea
Rock, paper, scissors
Rock!
Paper!
Scissors!
One...

You got yourself a deal
I meant US dollars
Huh!
I meant British pounds!
(Marriage Personal)
Looking for hot guys?
Don't bother
No gold-diggers either
To avoid mutual disappointment
PhD's need not apply
Women entrepreneurs need not reply
Parentheses: tradeswomen and peddlers exempted
Perfect men like Andy Lau and Tom Cruise won't be seeking you here
Nor do I expect to find Julia Roberts
Even if you were a goddess
I couldn't handle you
I'm not expecting a cover girl to blow me away with your beauty
Just a sane, healthy woman
Modern on the outside traditional on the inside
Slightly demure would be ideal
Don't be too young
Don't be too complicated
Proficiency in folding laundry a plus
Preferably pressed and folded
like they just came off the store shelf
Am I being too specific?
Let me introduce myself
I'm no longer young
Solidly middle class
Smoke but don't drink
Went abroad to study
Lived overseas for a decade
Never really studied much
I slacked and learned a few survival skills
I've returned without accomplishment
Truthfully
I'm what they call a "Three Strikes" returnee;
No company, No stocks, No degree
Morally, I'm about 50-50
I'm no angel just too cowardly to do wrong
All in all, I'd classify myself as a constructive member of society
If interested, please call
I hope you're the one
Shan-shan
May I join you?
I'm expecting someone
You haven't changed much
Still handsome
You got the wrong guy
I'm Jianguo!
From the construction company!
I changed that much?
You don't recognize me?
Hey!
From administration!
Transferred from the army art's troupe
I was in logistics
Anyway, in charge of entertainment
Back then, you were a cute little boy
I remember you had single eyelids
How'd they get doubled?
Had them done in Korea
Gee, what a coincidence
Run into each other ten years later!
What coincidence?
I made a date with you
A date with me?
Uh...
Ai Moli
Like the name of this restaurant
I changed my name
I wanted to see you
Trying to get in my way?
My ad was for a marriage partner
I wanted to see you
Besides
You didn't write
No men wanted
Of course I didn't
Why would I seek a man?
I'm not gay
You're.....
Hmm!
Uh...
But I'm not
How do you know?
I used to think so too
But later I realized
I just lacked the courage to face it
Do you remember
The labor union field trip to Shi Du?
My leg cramped when I was swimming
You rescued me
That's right
I held onto you tightly
You kept comforting me
Ever since then, I felt
So safe with you
When I don't see you
I want to
Hey!
hey!
hey!
You... are ahead of the future
But I am not that enlightened yet
Then why have you not married yet?
Haven't found the right one
Give me a break
Perhaps, subconsciously you dislike women
Hmm!
Oh...
No no no!
Do you think I'm strange
No!
Absolutely not
I constantly ask myself;
Why am I so narrow minded?
With such a big heart why can't I make room for a man?
Each time I clear a woman out guess what happens next?
Another woman fills in the space
Let me ask you something
Suppose
I were like you
I said 'suppose'
Don't be angry if I get this wrong
You're bad
Forget it.
I better shut up
I know what you want to say
Deep down you're like my big brother
It's probably better that way
Brother
Yes?
You have great skin
So white
Is that right
What's your first impression of me?
Much as I expected
Frankly
Looks aren't important
It's the inside that count
Someone kind and good to his parents
Even if I didn't like you
I'm sure you'll find a good wife
You really are a modern traditional woman
A rare catch
Your parents still in good health?
My father passed away last year
My mother is still alive
I came back, so she wouldn't be alone
How old is she?
In her seventies
Your father...
Where is he buried?
At Eight Treasure Mountain
His urn is in the ossuary
Your mother is getting old
A filial son should give his parents a good resting place
Old people are fussy about final resting place
Don't you worry
I would never deprive them
A man should be responsible and filial
Even if he doesn't make much money
He provides for his parents needs
Now that's a reliable man
Tell the truth
You're.....such a man
I think I am
No, you're not!
You keep your father's ashes in a tiny box!
And when your mother dies?
Going to squeeze them both into a little box?
Not enough room for incense and ghost money at Grave Sweeping Festival!
You call that filial?
Then, I'll buy them a cemetery plot
It's not that I can't afford it
Just that when I left China only national heroes could afford a grave
Normal folk's ashes were kept on shelves
Don't worry
You find a spot with a nice view and beautiful scenery
I'll take care of it immediately
If you and I...get along
I'll have your tombstone carved in advance
It really is a great investment
Just thirty thousand yuan gets you a grave plot with imperial fengshui
Thirty thousand!
Price of a return trip to America
In just a few years, the same plot will be worth three hundred thousand
By the time you sell it you'll have made 1000% profit
Hold on
If I sell it where will my parents go?
You can buy two!
If you buy two plots, my company will give you a 5% discount
Miss Liang?
Hmm!
I'm Qin Fen
Sorry I was late
Have a seat
I never expected
What?
Nothing
What's your line of work?
I'm a flight attendant
Which airline?
Hainan Airline
How would you grade yourself?
Sixty
Sixty points
I'd give you ninety
You've met a few already?
You mean those personals?
Uh
You're the first
Oh
Myself, I've met a couple
You're the first as beautiful as you
This one girl wasn't bad
But she was selling grave plots
She doesn't count
The rest were critically unkosher
Did you buy?
Uh
The grave plots
Yes!
She sweet-talked me
Called me a filial son
If I didn't buy, I'd ruin my reputation
No wife, but got myself a grave
I read your marriage ad.
I think you're very funny
Not like the others, so full of themselves
Or who write a load of sentimental crap
It's disgusting
I'll be totally honest with you
And I'm not trying to flatter you
But judging by your looks
I'd rank you at the "goddess" level
You must have high standards
You're not selling airplanes, are you?
The grave plots are one thing
But I can't afford airplanes
Why 'no women entrepreneurs'?
They're too practical
I prefer more emotional types
What's wrong with being practical?
These days, most people are practical
My mom and friends all advise me to be more practical
That's why I'm here meeting you
To learn to be more practical
Then you got the wrong guy
I'm definitely the type you're seeking
How do you know my type?
I don't even know what type is
Being here seems so unreal
But I did telephone you
I'm the one who asked you out
You mean you're not serious
You were confused and regret meeting me
A little
Don't be mad
It's not because of you
I think I'm a bit ridiculous
Then we should stop here
It's good we're direct, Simpler
We won't waste each other's time
You busy?
Not at all
But we don't have any hope
Then, go ahead
I'll sit here awhile
Okay
See you later, then
Wait, that's not right
We won't see each other again
In that case...
"Farewell" isn't correct either
You really are a pain
What we mean is...
See you never
Yes?
Feel like a drink?
We can go somewhere nearby and chat a little more
Why?
Chat about what?
You a shill for a restaurant posing as a lonely women?
Enough already
I didn't suspect you of a crime
So, don't be suspicious of me
In truth, I am a criminal
I was worried you weren't
You drink like a wimp
It won't kill you
Drink up.
No one's stopping you
Continue
Heard of "love at first sight"?
I loved the first sight of you
We're not even "love at third sight"
Love at first sight doesn't mean
I fall for you when I see you
Or that you fall for me
It's not about sight
But smell
The other person's scent attracts you
Enchants you
Some people are made for each other
So, two strangers rush up and sniff each other up and down?
Is that possible?
It's not like that
If you're made for each other you'd sense each other from far away
Ever watch 'Animal Planet'?
Yes
Even from dozens of miles away animals can sense each other
People are just like animals
Are you only attracted by one smell?
Animals don't fixate on just one lover
It's about a type
It's a mutual thing
It's not just attraction but a kind of infatuation
Anything else repels you
Then why come all this way to bother me?
Infatuated but you can't be together
You struggle to break free from it
You're torn apart by heartache
You drink yourself to sleep each night
The man has a family
He loves you but can't marry you
Your parents don't know
It hurts but you can't share it
I can't tell anyone
Then why tell me?
I couldn't take it anymore
I was hurt too badly
Anyway, I won't see you again
Who cares what you think of me
Then I should charge you a fee
He has all the fun and I get a miserable women
Since when are we best buddies?
Take as much as you want
But I'm paying you to drink up
You can't just sip
I really can't drink
I'll accompany you for free
So, don't drink
I told you one of my secrets
You should also tell me something you can't admit to anyone else
Then we'll be even
Why are you so complicated?
Fine, don't tell me
I don't care anyway
Let it rot in your stomach
And I thought you were a big man
Just based on the fact you're seeking an emotional woman
We won't see each other again?
See you never
Know why I don't drink?
Aren't you drinking now?
A friend and I ran a travel agency in America
We specialized in Chinese groups
Once, we had a government tour group
Led by a bureau director
A very juicy gig
There was a woman named Xiao Bai
A translator
Pretty, the quiet type
I had her in my sights the moment they landed
During the trip
I started to fall for her
Later on we, you know
What?
We, uh... got intimate
Afterwards, she cried
Wanted me to help her stay in America
I agreed without a second thought
I really liked her
Besides, it was easy for me
The next day I told my friend that I was with Xiaobai
I asked him to help me keep Xiaobai in America
He freaked out
Said, absolutely not
We'd got the job because of his connection with the bureau director lf they left someone behind the director would be disciplined
Besides screwing the director it could also kill our business
If I insisted on her staying
I think my friend would killed me
So, you two sold her out
Let me finish
I had to beg my friend
I'd make sure she didn't run for it
But he had to promised not to report her
When we saw them off at the airport
Xiaobai just stared at me
With eyes like daggers
Couldn't even look at her
I was so ashamed
That's your secret?
This year
The director heard I was back
He invited us to dinner
The people from the tour group came too
Only person missing was Xiaobai
I made a lot of small talk then casually asked about Xiaobai
They said, you don't know?
Soon after she returned, she killed herself
My head just exploded
I asked, what happened?
He said
Her husband was abusive
Beat her all the time
She kept trying to divorce him
She'd planned to stay in America
But she failed
Even got reported
She returned completely hopeless
So, I asked my friend if he'd reported her
He said, Yes
He said he couldn't trust me
So he told the director
That day
I beat up my friend
I drank a lot
Until finally
I was sprawled on the floor grabbing people's legs and crying
Why'd you beat him?
You're the one who killed her
You're despicable
After that day... every time I drink, I remember her
Later,I quit drinking
But you had to make me drink
And spill my rotten guts
We even?
Now you know what I'm made of
You can go now
Leave!
So, if we get married
I have to go live with your family?
Can I refuse?
There's something you need to know
What?
My aunt has a bad memory
How bad?
She can remember today's events
By tomorrow, it's all gone
Serve up
Is your home far?
How do I get there?
First you fly to Kunming
Then a day's bus ride to Mengzi
Then another bus to Pingbian
Then a day by tractor
One day by ox cart
And you're home
She can't remember things
And people?
Nope
Not even people?
But she writes all important events and people in her notebook
If you two marry she'll read it every morning and recall who you are
Qin Fen
You're tired already?
Keep playing
If it doesn't work out
Can we divorce?
My big brother will break your legs
Sister!
Don't record that!
Best to forget what happened today
What were we talking about?
You like it here in Haikou?
It's great
Sunny, no pollution, tropical
I've been here two years
I play golf...swim...dive...
Never felt healthier
Gotta take care of yourself!
Hmm!
How are the blind dates?
Still blind
Let me fix you up
Sure
A really good person
If I weren't married
I'd marry her myself
I used to be married
My husband passed away
When?
Just recently
How long were you together?
These
These...is this very important to you?
Of course lf you were deeply in love
After all, his bones are barely cold yet
Seven or eight years
You must be hurting
Compared to before
I feel much better now
These past five years
I didn't even know where he slept at night
I finally know where he is
You found him a spot
Yanchun Ridge Cemetery
Whenever I need him, he's there
If he runs away now you should get your money back
How old are you?
Fifty?
No
Forty something
I look older, don't I?
That's okay
I like older men
How's your health?
On the weak side
That's great
Don't bother exercising
If you get sick, I'll nurse you!
You don't want a strong healthy body?
You prefer a soft marshmallow?
Soft marshmallows taste better!
An old sickly guy...
You're not worried about marriage quality?
At your age
Let me be frank you're at your sexual peak
You believe the foundation for love is sex
Not entirely
But love without sex is not love
That would be friendship
I don't agree
What's wrong with no sex?
Many people grow old together without it
I don't mean to imply no sex at all
Just not too frequently
Tell me
What's your idea of 'not too frequently'
Ideally speaking
Yes?
Once a month?
Once a year
If you agree we can meet again
I don't agree
I know why your husband never come home
If we got married
I'd be hard to find too
A real pity
Is sex really all that interesting?
Oh, yeah
Sorry, I couldn't answer just now
Smiley
Please don't get angry but...
My wife and I will be on the same flight as you
Can't you change your ticket?
I just found out
She booked it ages ago
I never expected it would be your flight
You know I care about you
I have to attend my brother's wedding
I just hope you can make sure she doesn't see you
It would be better
How should I do that?
It's an airplane cabin
And you're seated in first class
Where should I hide myself?
You can't treat me like this
Welcome to Grand China Air
Welcome to Grand China Air
Boarding pass, please
Smiley Liang
It really is you!
Old foes meet again
Please take your seat and don't block the aisle
Welcome to Grand China Air
Hello, this way please
Welcome to Grand China Air
Boarding pass, please
This way on the left
Thank you
Welcome to Grand China Air
Boarding pass, please
This way, sir
Please hurry and take your seat
Sir, as soon as possible
We're about to close the door
Please sign this
Thank you;
Here
I'll sign it
Thank you
Hi, I'll get that for you
Please take your seat
Hot towel?
Something to drink?
Miss?
If there is an empty seat
I'd like to seat with my husband
Sorry
First class is full today
But I'd be happy to look in economy
My husband and I booked this flight
Why aren't we seated together?
Next time you can arrive earlier to have your boarding passes changed
The computer doesn't know you're husband and wife
I'll switch with you
No one should split up a married couple
Young comrade
I know you're not responsible for ticketing
But you should listen to customer feedback and submit our suggestions to your superiors
The key to improving customer's service is paying attention to details
Please, sir, C'mon
No point in troubling you
It's a short flight
We're about to take off lf you're going to switch seats please do it soon
It's no trouble
I'm already up.
Go ahead
Please
Thank you
Please fasten your seat belts, thank you!
Ladies and gentlemen we'll be taking off shortly
To ensure your safety, please check that your seat belts are fastened
and that all cell phones are turned off
Thank you
We're already taxiing
Whatever it is, can wait
Just wanted to remind you for your own safety to fasten your seat belt
So, that gentleman is the little runt you can't live without?
don't interrupt my work
Some things just aren't meant to be
I'll be in Hangzhou for a few days
If you're flying to Beijing call me if you feel like a drink
I can be your non-fatal drinking buddy
When outsiders imagine Hangzhou they often think of West Lake what they don't know is that a mere 5 kilometers away is a rare environmental treasure
Here is China's first wetlands national park;
West Brook Wetlands
An exiled Song Dynasty emperor happened upon these wetlands
Like me, he was enchanted
He wanted to build his temporary palace here
But due to lack of funds the project was abandoned
The night before he had to leave
The Emperor said:
West Brook, may you remain here
And thus it earned its eternal name
The home we're seeing today is in Remain Here Town
I trust you'll want to stay too
The Emperor would have stayed
But he was broke
All that remained were his words
But I've brought cash
If I like the place my whole life will remain here
This is your foyer
Your living room
Your master bedroom
And this is your private pond
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Stop saying 'your' living room, 'your' bedroom 'your' private pond
I'm sure you've seen better homes
But no amount of money could buy an enviroment like this
Hello?
I was in a lousy mood yesterday
So I took a day of and stayed in Huangzhou
Drank half a bottle of wine to get to sleep
Slept in the whole morning
Woke up not knowing what to do
If you're not busy care to join me for a chat?
That's fine, but
I've got another blind date
You came all the way to Huangzhou?
Really casting a wide net!
Can't leave any stone unturned
Better to kill a thousand innocents than set one guilty person free
Well, I'm not busy
Take me along, I'll consult for you
How should I introduce you?
Say we already dated but you rejected me?
Say we're drinking buddies or don't introduce me at all
I'll just sit nearby and drink tea
I'll advise you afterwards
I won't get in your way
Sounds good
But I'm warning you;
If I find a suitable match if we dig each other's smell you're not my responsibility
Don't call me a fair weather friend
Relax
If that happens
I'll be overjoyed for you
See you
Hey, miss
How much does this place cost?
Don't mind me
You are not from here
I'm Taiwanese
My father owns a factory in Hangzhou
We're here for the time being
Ever been to Beijing?
Of course which do you prefer?
That's a difficult question
For weather and living environment
Hangzhou, of course
But I quite like Beijingers
My grandfather is from Beijing
I love hearing his accent
What is go-ING on?
The accent is the last word
Not the first word
What is going ON
What is going ON
What is going ON
Later on my grandfather went to Taiwan with the Nationalists after the Mainland had fallen
Hold on there
We call it 'liberated'
You say 'fallen'
We say 'liberated'
Liberated?
What does liberated mean?
'Liberated'
I get it
The difference between liberated and fallen is just one's point of view
Hmm!
That's right
We can agree to disagree
Exactly
There are some universal values
For instance compassion is to love all beings
After the recent earthquake
Taiwanese all rushed to provide relief
Mainland Chinese were very moved
My father's company donated too
It pained us to see fellow Chinese suffering
Especially chilren who lost their parents
Poor things
There was a dying mother on the news
To her last breath, she breast fed her child
Even after dying, she was still nursing
Maternal love knows no bounds
A mother can sacrifice anything for her child
Dad's too
Even if it wasn't my child
I could adopt one of those orphans
You have such deep love for children?
Oh, yeah
If you were an orphan
I'd adopt you too
Idealists really do have bad memories;
I told you
My father owns a factory in Hangzhou
But don't despair
I have one in my belly
You can be his father
Thought you weren't married?
No
I'm not
I'm pregnant
Whose is it?
Not worth mentioning
He abandoned the darling in my belly
I don't want the child to be fatherless
So
I'm seeking a loving father for him
You're a good candidate
Uh, well
Do you like me?
I like you a lot but
You said you didn't care if it wasn't your own lf we don't tell him and the child only knows you
He would be just like your own son
An orphan I can accept
But with a full set of parents?
You can't just put a Mercedes ornament on the hood of a BMW
It will still be a good car but if it breaks down
Mercedes parts won't fit and BMW won't repair it
We should forget it
I'm flattered you like me
But I'm not the right man
I'll have to bite the bullet
What a perfect opportunity
How could you be so heartless?
Seemed like a great fit
Look
She's beautiful wealthy and you get a son for free
For a guy like you it's like winning the lottery!
Normally, I don't mind free lunches but starting a family requires self reliance
No foreign aid accepted
I think this blind date thing isn't too kosher for me
I have no appetite for ugly ducklings but the good looking ones are either hiding something or hate sex
Where'd the simple, sane women all go?
Why can't I meet even one?
What are you saying about me?
Think you're sane and uncomplicated?
Oh, not you.
You're not good looking
Calling you "good looking" would be an insult
You're ravishingly beautiful
A rare, precious beauty
If you were royalty you'd be up there with Diana
Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder
But no exaggeration even to a foe, you'd be beautiful
Don't hold it in, laugh
I need to ask you something
I sat with you through your date
Accompany me to meet someone?
I didn't ask you to come
You invited yourself
Will you or won't you?
No
I'm asking you one more time
No
Okay
Good bye
This is Mr.Qin
You met on the flight
Nice to meet you
Have a seat
Sit here
Excuse us
We'll need some privacy
Yes, sir
Thank you
Mr.Qin and I knew each other before
Just acquaintances
But meeting again on the flight something sparked between us
Perhaps it was 'love at second sight'
After we landed Mr.Qin called me
He asked me to stay a few more days to become better acquainted
We've been together the past two days
We feel fortunate to have met again
You're the person closest to me
So I brought him here to introduce him formally
It's right that you should know
Not going to wish us well?
You always wanted me to have a home
Smiley told me a lot about you
Said you treat her very well
Meeting you on the airplane seemed like fate
You've made your decision?
Mr.Qin
Perhaps you know about
Smiley and me
I'm not as lucky as you
I entrust her to you, good brother
Be good to her
She's stubborn.
I spoiled her
Be patient with her lf she's unhappy
I'll be unhappy too
Alright, this scene is over, I can't take it
I'll be leaving now
I know it's difficult for you to meet
Smiley and I are just ordinary friends
You're the only one she cares about
You're the lucky one
She drinks everyday because of you
It could kill her if she keeps it up
I can't go on like this
I'm weak and ashamed
I will use my mind and body all of me
To do something to make you regret
Stop drinking
Smiley
I have not betrayed you
How could I ever punish you?
You asked me to wait three years
I waited
You won't want me
But I will care about you until that day we agreed upon
I thought I could love you my whole life
I never expected our time together could one day end
One, two, three...
One, two, three...
One, two, three...
One, two, three...
I stopped drinking
Don't worry, Smiley
Surname Qin
"Qin" as in Emperor Qin
Fen as in "to struggle"
Smiley
I got your text message
"Smiley" as in "smiles hiding knives"
Uh Uh Correct
I called twice but you didn't answer
Call me
Yeah
At the place we met the first time
I already said it eight times; five o' clock
Yeah, that's right
Be there or be square
Pardon me, I've got two dates
Please don't mind my efficiency
No problem
I'm a stock trader
A real bear market lately
Using my spare time to find a husband
Once the market turns around
I won't have time
Do you play the stock market?
No
Don't understand it
Seeking a marriage partner is like trading stocks
You have to make your decisions based on a rational analysis of performance
For instance the candidate's looks or body figure or his personality and education or his finances and family background
Or
So if I were a stock how would I rate?
Judging from age and looks you've sunk below your offer price
So I'm in danger of being delisted?
Not necessarily
Inexperienced traders often buy high
But that's very risky
It's very easy to get trapped
More experienced traders buy low
What is the future of humanity?
Beneath the ebb and flow of civilization is a torrent of eternal conflict
Then disputes continue unresolved
they give birth tragedy
Must the wheel of history keep turning like this?
I have a dream
I dream of a day when
There will be a way to resolve all the world's conflicts
Swords beaten into ploughshears and spears into pruning hooks
I dream of a day when
There will be a method able to resolve any human disputes
Flowers in the field shall bloom and childern shall once more know joy
I have a dream
What is this century's most precious commodity?
Peace
Yes, Mr.Fan
This inventor
What's his name again?
Qin Fen
Qin as in Qin Dynasty
Fen as in "to struggle"
He's waiting in the living room
Show him to the dining room
Yes, sir
This is Mr.Fan, angel investor
Mr.Qin, inventor of the CRT2008
Shall we speak English or Chinese?
Your decision
Whichever is more natural
Then let's use our mother tongue
Nice to meet you
Our mother tongue?
Oops, Look at me
So used to English, I forgot my own language
So nice to meet you
A pleasure
Sit down
Sir please
Give me the specifics
This invention;
This invention of yours, what inspires it?
The root of the world's endless wars and escalating conflicts is our inability to judge disputes impartially
Continue
As children, we all played a game
Rock, paper, scissors
You played it
Hmm!
It's our most primal and effective conflict resolution method
So, why as adults have we discarded this method?
Why?
Two critical flaws hand velocity differential and
last minute sleight of hand
Sleight of hand
Rock, paper, scissors
A cunning hand can cheat!
The Conflict Resolution Terminal wipes out both flaws
Hold it here
Stick your hand in
Not your head!
Your hand!
Let's try it
Rock, paper, scissors
Ready?
Yes
Pull it open at the count of three
One
Two
Three!
Fascinating!
It's cheat proof
You invented this?
I did
Just imagine;
For instance
This beautiful girl here
If we both wanted her, but
Don't even think about it
It was hypothetical if we all had Conflict Resolution Terminals the wars in the Balkans and Middle East
American Presidential elections to elect a white or black President win or lose the tube decides!
Super good!
The CRT2008 is useful in all aspects of life
It's a revolutionary product
Say no more
This will be a massive high tech IPO
I'll buy the patent
Name a price
Two millions
One million
Two millions
One million
Let's do this
Let the CRT2008 decide
Good idea
Rock, paper, scissors
Rock!
Paper!
Scissors!
One...
Two...
Three!
Resolved
You got yourself a deal
I meant US dollars
Huh!
I meant British pounds!
(Marriage Personal)
Looking for hot guys?
Don't bother
No gold-diggers either
To avoid mutual disappointment
PhD's need not apply
Women entrepreneurs need not reply
Parentheses: tradeswomen and peddlers exempted
Perfect men like Andy Lau and Tom Cruise won't be seeking you here
Nor do I expect to find Julia Roberts
Even if you were a goddess
I couldn't handle you
I'm not expecting a cover girl to blow me away with your beauty
Just a sane, healthy woman
Modern on the outside traditional on the inside
Slightly demure would be ideal
Don't be too young
Don't be too complicated
Proficiency in folding laundry a plus
Preferably pressed and folded
like they just came off the store shelf
Am I being too specific?
Let me introduce myself
I'm no longer young
Solidly middle class
Smoke but don't drink
Went abroad to study
Lived overseas for a decade
Never really studied much
I slacked and learned a few survival skills
I've returned without accomplishment
Truthfully
I'm what they call a "Three Strikes" returnee;
No company, No stocks, No degree
Morally, I'm about 50-50
I'm no angel just too cowardly to do wrong
All in all, I'd classify myself as a constructive member of society
If interested, please call
I hope you're the one
Shan-shan
May I join you?
I'm expecting someone
You haven't changed much
Still handsome
You got the wrong guy
I'm Jianguo!
From the construction company!
I changed that much?
You don't recognize me?
Hey!
From administration!
Transferred from the army art's troupe
I was in logistics
Anyway, in charge of entertainment
Back then, you were a cute little boy
I remember you had single eyelids
How'd they get doubled?
Had them done in Korea
Gee, what a coincidence
Run into each other ten years later!
What coincidence?
I made a date with you
A date with me?
Uh...
Ai Moli
Like the name of this restaurant
I changed my name
I wanted to see you
Trying to get in my way?
My ad was for a marriage partner
I wanted to see you
Besides
You didn't write
No men wanted
Of course I didn't
Why would I seek a man?
I'm not gay
You're.....
Hmm!
Uh...
But I'm not
How do you know?
I used to think so too
But later I realized
I just lacked the courage to face it
Do you remember
The labor union field trip to Shi Du?
My leg cramped when I was swimming
You rescued me
That's right
I held onto you tightly
You kept comforting me
Ever since then, I felt
So safe with you
When I don't see you
I want to
Hey!
hey!
hey!
You... are ahead of the future
But I am not that enlightened yet
Then why have you not married yet?
Haven't found the right one
Give me a break
Perhaps, subconsciously you dislike women
Hmm!
Oh...
No no no!
Do you think I'm strange
No!
Absolutely not
I constantly ask myself;
Why am I so narrow minded?
With such a big heart why can't I make room for a man?
Each time I clear a woman out guess what happens next?
Another woman fills in the space
Let me ask you something
Suppose
I were like you
I said 'suppose'
Don't be angry if I get this wrong
You're bad
Forget it.
I better shut up
I know what you want to say
Deep down you're like my big brother
It's probably better that way
Brother
Yes?
You have great skin
So white
Is that right
What's your first impression of me?
Much as I expected
Frankly
Looks aren't important
It's the inside that count
Someone kind and good to his parents
Even if I didn't like you
I'm sure you'll find a good wife
You really are a modern traditional woman
A rare catch
Your parents still in good health?
My father passed away last year
My mother is still alive
I came back, so she wouldn't be alone
How old is she?
In her seventies
Your father...
Where is he buried?
At Eight Treasure Mountain
His urn is in the ossuary
Your mother is getting old
A filial son should give his parents a good resting place
Old people are fussy about final resting place
Don't you worry
I would never deprive them
A man should be responsible and filial
Even if he doesn't make much money
He provides for his parents needs
Now that's a reliable man
Tell the truth
You're.....such a man
I think I am
No, you're not!
You keep your father's ashes in a tiny box!
And when your mother dies?
Going to squeeze them both into a little box?
Not enough room for incense and ghost money at Grave Sweeping Festival!
You call that filial?
Then, I'll buy them a cemetery plot
It's not that I can't afford it
Just that when I left China only national heroes could afford a grave
Normal folk's ashes were kept on shelves
Don't worry
You find a spot with a nice view and beautiful scenery
I'll take care of it immediately
If you and I...get along
I'll have your tombstone carved in advance
It really is a great investment
Just thirty thousand yuan gets you a grave plot with imperial fengshui
Thirty thousand!
Price of a return trip to America
In just a few years, the same plot will be worth three hundred thousand
By the time you sell it you'll have made 1000% profit
Hold on
If I sell it where will my parents go?
You can buy two!
If you buy two plots, my company will give you a 5% discount
Miss Liang?
Hmm!
I'm Qin Fen
Sorry I was late
Have a seat
I never expected
What?
Nothing
What's your line of work?
I'm a flight attendant
Which airline?
Hainan Airline
How would you grade yourself?
Sixty
Sixty points
I'd give you ninety
You've met a few already?
You mean those personals?
Uh
You're the first
Oh
Myself, I've met a couple
You're the first as beautiful as you
This one girl wasn't bad
But she was selling grave plots
She doesn't count
The rest were critically unkosher
Did you buy?
Uh
The grave plots
Yes!
She sweet-talked me
Called me a filial son
If I didn't buy, I'd ruin my reputation
No wife, but got myself a grave
I read your marriage ad.
I think you're very funny
Not like the others, so full of themselves
Or who write a load of sentimental crap
It's disgusting
I'll be totally honest with you
And I'm not trying to flatter you
But judging by your looks
I'd rank you at the "goddess" level
You must have high standards
You're not selling airplanes, are you?
The grave plots are one thing
But I can't afford airplanes
Why 'no women entrepreneurs'?
They're too practical
I prefer more emotional types
What's wrong with being practical?
These days, most people are practical
My mom and friends all advise me to be more practical
That's why I'm here meeting you
To learn to be more practical
Then you got the wrong guy
I'm definitely the type you're seeking
How do you know my type?
I don't even know what type is
Being here seems so unreal
But I did telephone you
I'm the one who asked you out
You mean you're not serious
You were confused and regret meeting me
A little
Don't be mad
It's not because of you
I think I'm a bit ridiculous
Then we should stop here
It's good we're direct, Simpler
We won't waste each other's time
You busy?
Not at all
But we don't have any hope
Then, go ahead
I'll sit here awhile
Okay
See you later, then
Wait, that's not right
We won't see each other again
In that case...
"Farewell" isn't correct either
You really are a pain
What we mean is...
See you never
Yes?
Feel like a drink?
We can go somewhere nearby and chat a little more
Why?
Chat about what?
You a shill for a restaurant posing as a lonely women?
Enough already
I didn't suspect you of a crime
So, don't be suspicious of me
In truth, I am a criminal
I was worried you weren't
You drink like a wimp
It won't kill you
Drink up.
No one's stopping you
Continue
Heard of "love at first sight"?
I loved the first sight of you
We're not even "love at third sight"
Love at first sight doesn't mean
I fall for you when I see you
Or that you fall for me
It's not about sight
But smell
The other person's scent attracts you
Enchants you
Some people are made for each other
So, two strangers rush up and sniff each other up and down?
Is that possible?
It's not like that
If you're made for each other you'd sense each other from far away
Ever watch 'Animal Planet'?
Yes
Even from dozens of miles away animals can sense each other
People are just like animals
Are you only attracted by one smell?
Animals don't fixate on just one lover
It's about a type
It's a mutual thing
It's not just attraction but a kind of infatuation
Anything else repels you
Then why come all this way to bother me?
Infatuated but you can't be together
You struggle to break free from it
You're torn apart by heartache
You drink yourself to sleep each night
The man has a family
He loves you but can't marry you
Your parents don't know
It hurts but you can't share it
I can't tell anyone
Then why tell me?
I couldn't take it anymore
I was hurt too badly
Anyway, I won't see you again
Who cares what you think of me
Then I should charge you a fee
He has all the fun and I get a miserable women
Since when are we best buddies?
Take as much as you want
But I'm paying you to drink up
You can't just sip
I really can't drink
I'll accompany you for free
So, don't drink
I told you one of my secrets
You should also tell me something you can't admit to anyone else
Then we'll be even
Why are you so complicated?
Fine, don't tell me
I don't care anyway
Let it rot in your stomach
And I thought you were a big man
Just based on the fact you're seeking an emotional woman
We won't see each other again?
See you never
Know why I don't drink?
Aren't you drinking now?
A friend and I ran a travel agency in America
We specialized in Chinese groups
Once, we had a government tour group
Led by a bureau director
A very juicy gig
There was a woman named Xiao Bai
A translator
Pretty, the quiet type
I had her in my sights the moment they landed
During the trip
I started to fall for her
Later on we, you know
What?
We, uh... got intimate
Afterwards, she cried
Wanted me to help her stay in America
I agreed without a second thought
I really liked her
Besides, it was easy for me
The next day I told my friend that I was with Xiaobai
I asked him to help me keep Xiaobai in America
He freaked out
Said, absolutely not
We'd got the job because of his connection with the bureau director lf they left someone behind the director would be disciplined
Besides screwing the director it could also kill our business
If I insisted on her staying
I think my friend would killed me
So, you two sold her out
Let me finish
I had to beg my friend
I'd make sure she didn't run for it
But he had to promised not to report her
When we saw them off at the airport
Xiaobai just stared at me
With eyes like daggers
Couldn't even look at her
I was so ashamed
That's your secret?
This year
The director heard I was back
He invited us to dinner
The people from the tour group came too
Only person missing was Xiaobai
I made a lot of small talk then casually asked about Xiaobai
They said, you don't know?
Soon after she returned, she killed herself
My head just exploded
I asked, what happened?
He said
Her husband was abusive
Beat her all the time
She kept trying to divorce him
She'd planned to stay in America
But she failed
Even got reported
She returned completely hopeless
So, I asked my friend if he'd reported her
He said, Yes
He said he couldn't trust me
So he told the director
That day
I beat up my friend
I drank a lot
Until finally
I was sprawled on the floor grabbing people's legs and crying
Why'd you beat him?
You're the one who killed her
You're despicable
After that day... every time I drink, I remember her
Later,I quit drinking
But you had to make me drink
And spill my rotten guts
We even?
Now you know what I'm made of
You can go now
Leave!
So, if we get married
I have to go live with your family?
Can I refuse?
There's something you need to know
What?
My aunt has a bad memory
How bad?
She can remember today's events
By tomorrow, it's all gone
Serve up
Is your home far?
How do I get there?
First you fly to Kunming
Then a day's bus ride to Mengzi
Then another bus to Pingbian
Then a day by tractor
One day by ox cart
And you're home
She can't remember things
And people?
Nope
Not even people?
But she writes all important events and people in her notebook
If you two marry she'll read it every morning and recall who you are
Qin Fen
You're tired already?
Keep playing
If it doesn't work out
Can we divorce?
My big brother will break your legs
Sister!
Don't record that!
Best to forget what happened today
What were we talking about?
You like it here in Haikou?
It's great
Sunny, no pollution, tropical
I've been here two years
I play golf...swim...dive...
Never felt healthier
Gotta take care of yourself!
Hmm!
How are the blind dates?
Still blind
Let me fix you up
Sure
A really good person
If I weren't married
I'd marry her myself
I used to be married
My husband passed away
When?
Just recently
How long were you together?
These
These...is this very important to you?
Of course lf you were deeply in love
After all, his bones are barely cold yet
Seven or eight years
You must be hurting
Compared to before
I feel much better now
These past five years
I didn't even know where he slept at night
I finally know where he is
You found him a spot
Yanchun Ridge Cemetery
Whenever I need him, he's there
If he runs away now you should get your money back
How old are you?
Fifty?
No
Forty something
I look older, don't I?
That's okay
I like older men
How's your health?
On the weak side
That's great
Don't bother exercising
If you get sick, I'll nurse you!
You don't want a strong healthy body?
You prefer a soft marshmallow?
Soft marshmallows taste better!
An old sickly guy...
You're not worried about marriage quality?
At your age
Let me be frank you're at your sexual peak
You believe the foundation for love is sex
Not entirely
But love without sex is not love
That would be friendship
I don't agree
What's wrong with no sex?
Many people grow old together without it
I don't mean to imply no sex at all
Just not too frequently
Tell me
What's your idea of 'not too frequently'
Ideally speaking
Yes?
Once a month?
Once a year
If you agree we can meet again
I don't agree
I know why your husband never come home
If we got married
I'd be hard to find too
A real pity
Is sex really all that interesting?
Oh, yeah
Sorry, I couldn't answer just now
Smiley
Please don't get angry but...
My wife and I will be on the same flight as you
Can't you change your ticket?
I just found out
She booked it ages ago
I never expected it would be your flight
You know I care about you
I have to attend my brother's wedding
I just hope you can make sure she doesn't see you
It would be better
How should I do that?
It's an airplane cabin
And you're seated in first class
Where should I hide myself?
You can't treat me like this
Welcome to Grand China Air
Welcome to Grand China Air
Boarding pass, please
Smiley Liang
It really is you!
Old foes meet again
Please take your seat and don't block the aisle
Welcome to Grand China Air
Hello, this way please
Welcome to Grand China Air
Boarding pass, please
This way on the left
Thank you
Welcome to Grand China Air
Boarding pass, please
This way, sir
Please hurry and take your seat
Sir, as soon as possible
We're about to close the door
Please sign this
Thank you;
Here
I'll sign it
Thank you
Hi, I'll get that for you
Please take your seat
Hot towel?
Something to drink?
Miss?
If there is an empty seat
I'd like to seat with my husband
Sorry
First class is full today
But I'd be happy to look in economy
My husband and I booked this flight
Why aren't we seated together?
Next time you can arrive earlier to have your boarding passes changed
The computer doesn't know you're husband and wife
I'll switch with you
No one should split up a married couple
Young comrade
I know you're not responsible for ticketing
But you should listen to customer feedback and submit our suggestions to your superiors
The key to improving customer's service is paying attention to details
Please, sir, C'mon
No point in troubling you
It's a short flight
We're about to take off lf you're going to switch seats please do it soon
It's no trouble
I'm already up.
Go ahead
Please
Thank you
Please fasten your seat belts, thank you!
Ladies and gentlemen we'll be taking off shortly
To ensure your safety, please check that your seat belts are fastened
and that all cell phones are turned off
Thank you
We're already taxiing
Whatever it is, can wait
Just wanted to remind you for your own safety to fasten your seat belt
So, that gentleman is the little runt you can't live without?
don't interrupt my work
Some things just aren't meant to be
I'll be in Hangzhou for a few days
If you're flying to Beijing call me if you feel like a drink
I can be your non-fatal drinking buddy
When outsiders imagine Hangzhou they often think of West Lake what they don't know is that a mere 5 kilometers away is a rare environmental treasure
Here is China's first wetlands national park;
West Brook Wetlands
An exiled Song Dynasty emperor happened upon these wetlands
Like me, he was enchanted
He wanted to build his temporary palace here
But due to lack of funds the project was abandoned
The night before he had to leave
The Emperor said:
West Brook, may you remain here
And thus it earned its eternal name
The home we're seeing today is in Remain Here Town
I trust you'll want to stay too
The Emperor would have stayed
But he was broke
All that remained were his words
But I've brought cash
If I like the place my whole life will remain here
This is your foyer
Your living room
Your master bedroom
And this is your private pond
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Stop saying 'your' living room, 'your' bedroom 'your' private pond
I'm sure you've seen better homes
But no amount of money could buy an enviroment like this
Hello?
I was in a lousy mood yesterday
So I took a day of and stayed in Huangzhou
Drank half a bottle of wine to get to sleep
Slept in the whole morning
Woke up not knowing what to do
If you're not busy care to join me for a chat?
That's fine, but
I've got another blind date
You came all the way to Huangzhou?
Really casting a wide net!
Can't leave any stone unturned
Better to kill a thousand innocents than set one guilty person free
Well, I'm not busy
Take me along, I'll consult for you
How should I introduce you?
Say we already dated but you rejected me?
Say we're drinking buddies or don't introduce me at all
I'll just sit nearby and drink tea
I'll advise you afterwards
I won't get in your way
Sounds good
But I'm warning you;
If I find a suitable match if we dig each other's smell you're not my responsibility
Don't call me a fair weather friend
Relax
If that happens
I'll be overjoyed for you
See you
Hey, miss
How much does this place cost?
Don't mind me
You are not from here
I'm Taiwanese
My father owns a factory in Hangzhou
We're here for the time being
Ever been to Beijing?
Of course which do you prefer?
That's a difficult question
For weather and living environment
Hangzhou, of course
But I quite like Beijingers
My grandfather is from Beijing
I love hearing his accent
What is go-ING on?
The accent is the last word
Not the first word
What is going ON
What is going ON
What is going ON
Later on my grandfather went to Taiwan with the Nationalists after the Mainland had fallen
Hold on there
We call it 'liberated'
You say 'fallen'
We say 'liberated'
Liberated?
What does liberated mean?
'Liberated'
I get it
The difference between liberated and fallen is just one's point of view
Hmm!
That's right
We can agree to disagree
Exactly
There are some universal values
For instance compassion is to love all beings
After the recent earthquake
Taiwanese all rushed to provide relief
Mainland Chinese were very moved
My father's company donated too
It pained us to see fellow Chinese suffering
Especially chilren who lost their parents
Poor things
There was a dying mother on the news
To her last breath, she breast fed her child
Even after dying, she was still nursing
Maternal love knows no bounds
A mother can sacrifice anything for her child
Dad's too
Even if it wasn't my child
I could adopt one of those orphans
You have such deep love for children?
Oh, yeah
If you were an orphan
I'd adopt you too
Idealists really do have bad memories;
I told you
My father owns a factory in Hangzhou
But don't despair
I have one in my belly
You can be his father
Thought you weren't married?
No
I'm not
I'm pregnant
Whose is it?
Not worth mentioning
He abandoned the darling in my belly
I don't want the child to be fatherless
So
I'm seeking a loving father for him
You're a good candidate
Uh, well
Do you like me?
I like you a lot but
You said you didn't care if it wasn't your own lf we don't tell him and the child only knows you
He would be just like your own son
An orphan I can accept
But with a full set of parents?
You can't just put a Mercedes ornament on the hood of a BMW
It will still be a good car but if it breaks down
Mercedes parts won't fit and BMW won't repair it
We should forget it
I'm flattered you like me
But I'm not the right man
I'll have to bite the bullet
What a perfect opportunity
How could you be so heartless?
Seemed like a great fit
Look
She's beautiful wealthy and you get a son for free
For a guy like you it's like winning the lottery!
Normally, I don't mind free lunches but starting a family requires self reliance
No foreign aid accepted
I think this blind date thing isn't too kosher for me
I have no appetite for ugly ducklings but the good looking ones are either hiding something or hate sex
Where'd the simple, sane women all go?
Why can't I meet even one?
What are you saying about me?
Think you're sane and uncomplicated?
Oh, not you.
You're not good looking
Calling you "good looking" would be an insult
You're ravishingly beautiful
A rare, precious beauty
If you were royalty you'd be up there with Diana
Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder
But no exaggeration even to a foe, you'd be beautiful
Don't hold it in, laugh
I need to ask you something
I sat with you through your date
Accompany me to meet someone?
I didn't ask you to come
You invited yourself
Will you or won't you?
No
I'm asking you one more time
No
Okay
Good bye
This is Mr.Qin
You met on the flight
Nice to meet you
Have a seat
Sit here
Excuse us
We'll need some privacy
Yes, sir
Thank you
Mr.Qin and I knew each other before
Just acquaintances
But meeting again on the flight something sparked between us
Perhaps it was 'love at second sight'
After we landed Mr.Qin called me
He asked me to stay a few more days to become better acquainted
We've been together the past two days
We feel fortunate to have met again
You're the person closest to me
So I brought him here to introduce him formally
It's right that you should know
Not going to wish us well?
You always wanted me to have a home
Smiley told me a lot about you
Said you treat her very well
Meeting you on the airplane seemed like fate
You've made your decision?
Mr.Qin
Perhaps you know about
Smiley and me
I'm not as lucky as you
I entrust her to you, good brother
Be good to her
She's stubborn.
I spoiled her
Be patient with her lf she's unhappy
I'll be unhappy too
Alright, this scene is over, I can't take it
I'll be leaving now
I know it's difficult for you to meet
Smiley and I are just ordinary friends
You're the only one she cares about
You're the lucky one
She drinks everyday because of you
It could kill her if she keeps it up
I can't go on like this
I'm weak and ashamed
I will use my mind and body all of me
To do something to make you regret
Stop drinking
Smiley
I have not betrayed you
How could I ever punish you?
You asked me to wait three years
I waited
You won't want me
But I will care about you until that day we agreed upon
I thought I could love you my whole life
I never expected our time together could one day end
One, two, three...
One, two, three...
One, two, three...
One, two, three...
I stopped drinking
Don't worry, Smiley
Surname Qin
"Qin" as in Emperor Qin
Fen as in "to struggle"
Smiley
I got your text message
"Smiley" as in "smiles hiding knives"
Uh Uh Correct
I called twice but you didn't answer
Call me
Yeah
At the place we met the first time
I already said it eight times; five o' clock
Yeah, that's right
Be there or be square
Pardon me, I've got two dates
Please don't mind my efficiency
No problem
I'm a stock trader
A real bear market lately
Using my spare time to find a husband
Once the market turns around
I won't have time
Do you play the stock market?
No
Don't understand it
Seeking a marriage partner is like trading stocks
You have to make your decisions based on a rational analysis of performance
For instance the candidate's looks or body figure or his personality and education or his finances and family background
Or
So if I were a stock how would I rate?
Judging from age and looks you've sunk below your offer price
So I'm in danger of being delisted?
Not necessarily
Inexperienced traders often buy high
But that's very risky
It's very easy to get trapped
More experienced traders buy low
A stock like you with bad perfomance most won't touch you
Few would show interest
Thus you're a low risk
You're already at the bottom
Can't go any lower
So for a stock like me bought low would you invest long-term or just 'pump and dump'
Pump and dump?
Do you have explosive potential?
I'd buy long-term and hold it
What if you held it for awhile but found its performance lacking?
Don't worry
I'm not stupid.
I'd diversify
They can't all under perform, right?
No one's that unlucky
Hello?
You're here?
I'm here
I see you
Wait for me
Order whatever you like.
It's on me
I feel obligated to warn you
I'm very risky
Best to keep your distance
If you got stuck with me
I'd be useless and unsightly
Might never be able to get rid of me
As an investment
I'd be subprime
Only a criminal would sell me to you
Let's stop trading for today
I also have another stock to see at six o' clock
Go ahead and chat with her
The whole market is down right now
But don't jump in blindly
Don't rush it
Wait and see
Did I interrupt anything?
She wasn't interested
Said I'd dropped below my offer price
Poor thing
Old guy on the dating scene getting his pride injured
Spare me the alligator tears
So what's up?
I want to become your girlfriend
Which type of girlfriend?
The kind you marry
Why?
You knocked up, too?
I'm not in a mood for joking
I have just one condition
What?
While we're dating or even married
I'll fulfill all the duties of a wife but you'll allow me to have someone else in my heart
I won't do anything
I'll just keep a space for him in my heart
I might miss him from time to time
But it won't be anything more than that
I'll never contact him
Can you accept this?
Her body is here but her heart is elsewhere
You can refuse
I know it's unfair
Then, is it okay with you if my heart is here but my body occasionally has a fling?
No
Well, what if when your heart drifts away my heart drifts away too?
Fine
But our bodies are faithful to each other
Come here
Then, I'll need to find someone else too
Otherwise, you'll have one and I won't
I'd be at a huge disadvantage
Then, you agree?
Yes
Will you go with me to Hokkaido?
He and I started there
I'd like to end it there too
Are you bubbling with joy?
Wu Sang!
Haven't changed in ten years
Look just like a Hokkaido peasant
Except a bit more devious
This is Smiley
This is the Wu Sang I told you about
Married a Hokkaido wife and never left
Ms.Liang
Honored to be of service to you
Thank you
I'll get that
Thanks
This way
Wu Sang!
What are those arrows for?
Ms.Liang you've been here before
You must know why, Tell him
Hey
Hey
He asked you a question
What?
Those arrows pointing down
Know what they mean?
Hokkaido gets heavy snow in winter
The arrows points to the road's edge
So drivers don't hit the curb
Ah
I see
Did I say it right?
Yes
You learned that from him, right?
Let's have a good time here
You're my boyfriend now
Let's not mention him
Okay?
I'm not used to it yet
It's like my wallet is full of borrowed money
After I spend it, I'll be in debt
Hey!
Wu Sang!
Stop the car!
I need to go worship
Don't know what he's saying
No chance today
Why not?
The temple's closed to the public today
No worshipping for you
Well, talk to him!
Tell him we came from China just for today
Have you done something wrong?
I thought you were atheist why so suddenly pious?
I found religion
God sent me such a beautiful wife
I'd be rude not to burn some incense
Hello?
I'm not your wife yet
Besides, a Japanese Buddha can't help you
Blasphemy!
Buddha has no nationality
Hokkaido is my land of fortune
I'll pray to every Buddha I find here
Go talk to him!
Okay, okay
In honor of your incredible luck with Ms.Liang
I'll talk to him for you
Why are we being frisked?
It's the funeral of an influential family
Then, let's get out of here
You kidding?
We can't go now
Stop peeking!
Act mournful!
Did you really cry?
No laughing!
You didn't cry?
I saw you cry too
I tried to keep the tears in
Just couldn't hold them any longer
These Japanese must think we Chinese are really loyal friends
We're not even family, but we came all this way to cry our eyes out
Pratically forced our way in
Neither of you better not piss me off
I'm a mafia guy now
You knew this was a funeral!
What are you complaining about?
You just had to go in
You're truly adorable!
Excuse me
Which way to Hinanoza Hotel?
Straight ahead...
Turn right and you'll see it
Thank you
Very easy to find
It's just up ahead
That says "Four Sisters-What?"
Four Sisters dining bar
How are we going to sleep?
You two in one room?
You and I can share a room
Catch up on old times
Cut the pretense
A beauty like her and you want to be in my room?
It's not a pretense
We're not that close yet!
I'm not the one she loves
Wishing you a pleasant rest
Thanks
Here, try this
It's fishy
Penetrating
Stimulating
Try it
I'm already over stimulated
What I need now is numbness
Best part about drinking is the numbness
Can't drink on empty stomach
Try these clams
I need to get numb too
If your dreams had not been shattered
I'd never be talking marriage with you
My life's been no easier than yours
How can you allow your girlfriend to have someone else in her heart?
Why do you like me?
Did I say I liked you?
Be honest
It is our basis for being together in the future
My basis for marrying you is that
I can't find anyone more foolish
I'll never be so foolish again
You are incapable of splitting your heart in half
You're a terrible actor
Your feelings are writ across your face
Here's what I think
You're not over him yet
But once you are your heart will be whole again
That's why I tolerate you right now
You're a fool but I'm not
If I learn my lesson and get smart will it ruin your beautiful plan
In that case
I'll sell you to the local tribesmen
You'll hunt and fish for the rest of your life
And have a slew of babies
Scorched by the sun, drenched in rain
Half starving, in tattered clothes
If you try to escape they'll catch you and beat you
Three tortuous years from now you'll be an ugly, repulsive, wizened old hag!
I'm just getting started
Wanna hear more?
I'm only fooling around with you because you're pretty
Can you accept that?
You up to it?
In the game of emotional counterfeit you think you're my match
I'll bet you couldn't even tell if I had eight other women in my heart
I've got nothing to lose
You don't care about me
So, I just take what you're giving away
What are you guys so upset for?
Getting in my case
If I didn't say something nasty, she'd never stop
You really are serious
Sit down
Let her go
What a perfect opportunity
After this drink, you should invite Smiley to the hot spring with you
What friend would do that?
And abandon you here?
Spare me
This time, I'm serious about marrying her
I can't be reckless
She'd never give me her body before she gave me her heart
But, then once she gives you her heart your body is sentenced for life
So, I should enjoy freedom while I can
What do you like about her?
She has a good soul
Oh, please
You like her because she's pretty
What's wrong with that?
I should deprive my children of good genes?
Must I marry someone ugly?
Spend my life trying to escape?
Which of these four is prettiest?
They're all charming
Natsuyo, She's pretty
I say Haruko
Sorry to disturb you!
May we come in?
Welcome!
Please, come in
So few customers
It's still early
Please, sit
Ask Natsuyo and Haruko to drink with us
I am Natsuyo
And that's Haruko
She is Akimi
I am Akimi
And Yukie
And the photo outside?
That photo was taken forty years ago
Oh, really?
We were famous in Tokyo
We were "The Four Seasons"
You suckers fell for it!
We stayed together all these years
Aren't we beautiful?
Very beautiful!
Now I get it
Where are the Four Sisters?
They're here
She is Natsuyo
Haruko, the one you like, is singing
All old ladies?
They took that photo forty years ago
They used to be famous they retired here in Hokkaido and opened this bar
Then, let's get out of here
No!
We can't leave now!
It wouldn't be polite
See how friendly they are?
Have a drink
What would you drink?
No more sake
A whiskey
How about Windsor whisky?
Fine
A bottle of Whiskey, please
Right away
With ice but no green tea
Fooled us with a forty year old photo
Very funny
Come in!
A beautiful woman!
Bottoms up!
This is an inspirational song
Why are your voices so full of despair?
Added together, those four sisters are more than three hundred years old
How could we not despair?
You take your girlfriend on a trip
But you sneak out drinking and don't come home
What kind of romance is that?
You call that faithful?
It's called paying her back in her own coin
I allow your heart to love another man but my body can't enjoy a little fling?
You're shameless
If you let go of the past and be mine
I swear;
even if we were with Maggie Cheung plus
Angelina Jolie plus Sophie Marceau and supermodel Chi-Ling Lin
I wouldn't drink a single cup
That's right
You'd drink the whole bar
Feel to see if he has a fever
He's starting to talk crazy
Oh, my!
Poor thing
Reality was so distant from your expectations
Should I find you a psychologist?
No medicine can heal my wounded heart
You're my best medicine
Not afraid I'm poison?
I'd drink you even if you were
Someone tormented you
Now, you torment me
That's the wheel of fate
Bad karma
Hello?
We passed this several times but I didn't say anything
Is it a church?
Why so small?
It's for confessions
Confessions?
A lot of city people feel guilty about all the bad things they've done
So, they come to Hokkiado to confess
Get the guilt out and seek forgiveness
You must have a lot of sins
Do a good confessions
Clear your conscience and start over
Go in
They can't speak Chinese, anyway
You are incapable!
You can tell them everything you've done
Better than keeping it inside and having nightmares
Go in
God is more forgiving than the police
We won't listen
We'll wait here for you
He's in your hand
Right away
Wu Sang!
Sure he can't speak Chinese?
Don't worry.
Even if he did he's not going to broadcast it
Please, begin
I want to donate 10 million.
You want it?
Do you speak English?
That's ten times a million, a lot
No English
Don't want any money?
You really don't understand!
Now, I can relax
Let me start from the bad things I did in kindergarden
He really is a lot of fun
He hasn't changed in all these years
Just like he used to be
These past few days together brought back many good memories
He's a good man
And quite romantic
A head full of impratical ideas
Deep down
He's an idealist
That's why he's still a bachelor
Marriage is about destiny
Sometimes it's just not meant to be
It's fate
He really likes you
Most women don't understand him
I think you do
I hope it works out with you two
Did he tell you about his invention?
It's very interesting
Made him a lot of money
I don't know much about him
But he felt like an old friend
My instuition told me that he's a man I can rely on
If I'm going to get married, but can't be with the man I love
I should at least find a buddy
If that's what you're thinking
I advise you to let him go
Wouldn't be fair to him
I haven't lie to him
He accepts it
Smiley
I don't know what kind of man you really want to love
Does he deserve it more than Qin Fen?
You're being very selfish
You can't exploit other people's feelings
I hope I'm not being too direct
That's okay
I like straight talkers
There was once I went to steal peaches
There was a door here and a door there we jump over the wall holding onto each other shoulder as we ran
Later on
Both sides are not reachable
Then there was someone screaming
There was once we were studying farm production all in the same dorm
Me
Little Wen, Zhang Kui
Lu Dewei
And also
Oh, anyhow, there were eight or nine of us
And then, um
It was night time
I got this idea
The idea was, uh
We rubbed him with balm on the soles of his feet
Then waved a fan over them
As soon as we did
Zhang Kui wet his bed
His blanket and sheets were soaked
It really cracked us up!
We didn't admit who did it
But later the next morning, he discovered that everything was wet
He didn't dare hang them out
He asked, How'd I pee myself?
Nobody said anything
Then somebody sold me out
Said I did it I said, I would never do that
Excuse me
The time.
It's very late
I'm just getting started
After middle-school, I have country-side stories
Then my career
And love life
Just getting started
Later on I said, I would never do that
I'm not that kind of person!
Little Wen said;
he said he didn't do it
He said I did it
No way!
I'd never do that!
It was Lu Dewei and them
They did it
Me?
even if it were possible
I'm not saying it wasn't my idea, but...
Miss!
Miss!
Excuse me
What's wrong?
Yes?
Your friend is extremely pious
But he has far too many sins
We're a small church
We don't have enough room
Nearby is a much bigger church
So, please be so kind and take him there for confession
So sorry!
I'll get him out right away!
Very sorry
God... please forgive his sins
I was young, didn't know any better
Felt I'd really wronged her
But now that I think of it...
Cut it out!
Let's go!
Wouldn't even let me bow to her
Hey, Qin Fen
How many sins do you have?
The kind even Hell wouldn't let you in for?
Water...give me water!
Lord please forgive his actrocities
The lord sent you to save my soul and rescue me from Hell
Don't let him down
I'm still in a world of suffering
Who will save me?
Oh, my!
That's hot
I hear this place has lots of bears
That's right
Anyone get hurt?
Yes
Bears seem clumsy
But when they attack
They're very fast
Faster than a deer
Smiley
Smiley!
Come back!
Watch out for bears!
Seeing a bear is good luck for you
Nonsense!
It's the bear's good luck!
You see any?
Where?
C'mon, let's go!
You really worried?
If you got hurt, how would I explain it?
To whom?
No one cares about me I do
Wu Sang!
Ask if they've seen any bears
Just want to ask
Hello?
Did you met any bears?
Bears...
Yeah
When we went into the mountain, there were four of us
Now, there is only two of us
What did they say?
They were a party of four
Now there's only two left
Huh?
How could there be bears here?
Impossible
We fooled you
You really believed us
Who says Japanese aren't funny?
A bunch of real jokers
The bear is coming!
Protect your head and heart!
If the bear flips you over flip back to your original position
So pretty
A terrible pity to eat you
Best keep you alive to mother cubs
You don't have bear eyes
What are they?
The eyes of a wolf
Regret meeting me?
No, I'm quite happy
If you'll marry me our days will be sweet as honey
Would you really marry me?
If you say yes
We can tie the knot tonight
Such a big bad bear
Don't talk to the bear
He said, don't talk to the bears
They'll tear you to pieces!
He said, don't talk to the bears
I was torn apart long ago
Cold?
Let's go back
I'll light it for you I want to do it for you
Do you want me?
Yes
I'm yours tonight
Just for tonight?
Yes
Then I'd rather not have you
Why not?
Don't you think I'm pretty l want to repay you
I can't owe you this favour I won't be able to pay it back
You don't have to
You deserve it
Let me be a fool this once
I'm in love with you
Will you marry me?
Yes
Don't just say 'uh' I want you to say
Yes or no?
Yes
When?
I need more time
How long?
Qin Fen
The last few days, I've watched myself through Wu Sang's eyes
I'm such a strange woman
Came all this way with you
But just kept pushing you away
But you understand how I got here I keep struggling to rescue myself from an abyss of despair I hoped that your kindness and pristine Hokkaido could help me rediscover life's beauty
That was my selfish hope
But terrible love has already emptied me
The more I struggle the more the memories pull me down
This evening in the last sunset of my life I saw the more lovely side of you
I also saw how pathetic and helpless I was
You are the perfect partner
If I'd only met you years ago
I'm a fool to let you pass me by
But this God's punishment of me
Good bye, Qin Fen
Don't look for me
Just please forgive me
After Smiley jumped she was found by a fishing boat
They rescued her
She's in surgery right now
So damned foolish!
No matter what happens, I'll be there for her
You really are naughty l thought I was trouble
But you're worse than me
Your brother knows you've been hurt
But with your brother here you can overcome anything
Okay
I'm leaving
Alright
Otherwise, you'll lose your job
Be good to her
She's a good girl with a true heart
She's already died once
Her love for him is dead now too
This is for your wife and kids
More than ten years since we last met
Who knows when we'll meet again
Don't pull that polite crap with me
She's going to need money now
Money means nothing to me
What I lack are friends
My best friends are scattered to the winds
Sometimes, I really miss you guys
I feel terribly lonely
Take care
It's almost New Year's
You cheated death
So, make a wish
Give me your phone
Hello
It's me
It's been a long time I just want to thank you
Thanks for once having loved me
I'm very happy now
Because I've found someone I want to share my life with
Be good to your wife
I wish you both the best
Goodbye
That was my phone!
Your phone sleeps with the fishes
You don't need to call anyone else
Understood
The root of the world's endless wars and escalating conflicts is our inability to judge disputes impartially
The Conflict Resolution Terminal wipes out both flaws
Please insert your hand
Okay
Now, grab this handle
Rock, papers, scissors!
When I count to three we both pull it open
One
Two

Interesting
Did you sell that to him?
Isn't that your invention?
You two are venture capitalists
I have my own humble opinion about the nature of investment
Venture capital is about risk
The greater the risk, the more one invests
No risk, no investment
I'll stake my reputation in saying to invest in this product is way too risky!
Very suitable for venture capitalists
This will be a massive hi-tech IPO
A revolutionary product
Let's play each other with it lf I win throw it into the ocean for me
Is that you?
Who else could it be
Why have your hair turn white?
Total financial investments meltdown have hit me
This year investment's climate is too tumultuous
Three out of five investments gone bad
All investment's down the drain
Don't cry!
Don't cry!
Don't cry!
Please listen to me
This is the terminal I sold to you
Yes
Is it?
Yeah
I'll buy it back
Name me a price
Two millions
You are going to dump it
One million
Two millions
One million
Don't fight over it
One million then one million
Done l meant English pound
Nonsense...
I meant Japanese yen
Japanese yen
Yes
Don't think it's a loss
When the economy climate is better next year
I will resell it at a higher profit
To be share with you
What's to see, I wanna see
The future!
Yes, Mr. Fan
This inventor...
What's his name again?
Qin Fen
Qin as in Qin Dynasty
Fen as in "to struggle"
He's waiting in the living room
Show him to the dining room
Yes, sir
This is Mr. Fan, angel investor
Mr. Qin, inventor of the CRT2008
Shall we speak English or Chinese?
Your decision
Whichever is more natural
Then let's use our mother tongue
Nice to meet you
Our mother tongue?
Oops.
Look at me
So used to English, I forgot my own language
So nice to meet you
A pleasure
Sit down
Sir, please
Give me the specifics
This invention of yours... what inspired it?
The root of the world's endless wars and escalating conflicts is our inability to judge disputes impartially
Continue
As children, we all played a game:
Rock, paper, scissors
You've played it?
Uh-huh
It's our most primal and effective conflict resolution method
So, why, as adults have we discarded this method?
Why?
Two critical flaws:
Hand velocity differential and last-minute sleight of hand
Sleight of hand
Rock, papers, scissors
A cunning hand can cheat
The Conflict Resolution Terminal wipes out both flaws
Hold it here
Stick your hand in
Not your head.
Your hand
Let's try it
Rock.
Paper.
Scissors
Ready?
Yes
Pull it open at the count of three
One
Two
Three
Fascinating
It's cheat-proof
You invented this?
I did
Just imagine
For instance this beautiful girl here
If we both wanted her, but...
Don't even think about it
It was hypothetical
If we all had Conflict Resolution Terminals the wars in the Balkans and Middle East
American presidential elections to elect a white or black President
Win or lose
The tube decides
Super good
The CRT2008 is useful in all aspects of life
It's a revolutionary product
Say no more
This will be a massive high-tech IPO
I'll buy the patent
Name a price
Two million
One million
Two million
One million
Let's do this
Let the CRT2008 decide
Good idea
Rock.
Paper.
Scissors
Ready?
Yes
One.
Two.

Resolved
You got yourself a deal
I meant US dollars
Huh.
I meant Sterling
Marriage Personal
Looking for hot guys?
Don't bother
No gold-diggers either
To avoid mutual disappointment
PhD's need not reply
Women entrepreneurs need not reply
Parentheses:
Trades women and peddlers excepted
Perfect men like Andy Lau and Tom Cruise won't be seeking you here
Nor do I expect to find Julia Roberts
Even if you were a goddess
I couldn't handle you
I'm not expecting a cover-girl to blow me away with your beauty
Just a sane, healthy woman
Modern on the outside traditional on the inside
Slightly demure would be ideal
Don't be too complicated
Don't be too young
Proficiency in folding laundry a plus
Preferably pressed and folded like they just came off the store shelf
Am I being specific?
Let me introduce myself
I'm no longer young
Solidly middle-class
Smoke, but don't drink
Went abroad to study
Lived overseas for a decade
Never really studied much
I slacked and learned a few survival skills
I've returned without accomplishment
Truthfully
I'm what they call a "Three Strikes" returnee:
No company.
No stocks.
No degree
Morally, I'm about 50-50
I'm no angel just too cowardly to do wrong
All in all, I'd classify myself as a constructive member of society
If interested, please call
I hope you're the one
Shan-shan
May I join you?
I'm expecting someone
You haven't changed much
Still handsome
You got the wrong guy
I'm Jianguo
From the construction company
I changed that much?
You don't recognize me?
Hey
From administration
Transferred from the army arts troupe
I was in logistics
Anyway, in charge of entertainment
Back then, you were a cute little boy
I remember you had single eyelids
How'd they get doubled?
Had them done in Korea
Gee, what a coincidence
Run into each other ten years later
What coincidence?
I made a date with you
A date with me?
Uh
Ai Moli
Molly
Like the name of this restaurant
I changed my name
I wanted to surprise you
Trying to get in my way?
My ad was for a marriage partner
I wanted to see you
Besides you didn't write
"No men wanted"
Of course I didn't
Why would I seek a man?
I'm not gay
You're...
Yes
Huh?
But I'm not
How do you know?
I used to think so too
But later I realized
I just lacked the courage to face it
Do you remember the labor union field trip to Shi Du?
My leg cramped when I was swimming
You rescued me
That's right
I held onto you tightly
You kept comforting me
Every since then, I felt so safe with you
When I don't see you
I want to...
Hey-hey-hey
You are ahead of the curve
But I am not that enlightened yet
Then why have you not married yet?
Haven't found the right one
Give me a break
Perhaps, subconsciously you dislike women
Oh...
No-no-no
Do you think I'm strange?
No
Absolutely not
I constantly ask myself:
Why am I so narrow-minded?
With such a big heart why can't I make room for a man?
Each time I clear a woman out guess what happens next?
Another woman fills in the space
Let me ask you something
Suppose
I were like you
I said "suppose"
Don't be angry if I get this wrong
You're bad
Forget it.
I better shut up
I know what you want to say
Deep down you're like my big brother
It's probably better that way
Brother
Yes?
You have great skin
So white
What's your first impression of me?
Much as I expected
Frankly looks aren't important
It's the inside that counts
Someone kind, and good to his parents
Even if I didn't like you
I'm sure you'll find a good wife
You really are a modern-traditional woman
A rare catch
Your parents still in good health?
My father passed away last year
My mother is still alive
I came back, so she wouldn't be alone
How old is she?
In her seventies
Your father...
Where is he buried?
At Eight Treasure Mountain
His urn is in the ossuary
Your mother is getting old
A filial son should give his parents a good resting place
Old people are fussy about final resting places
Don't you worry
I would never deprive them
A man should be responsible and filial
Even if he doesn't make much money he provides for his parents' needs
Now that's a reliable man
Tell the truth
Are you such a man?
I think I am
No, you're not
You keep your father's ashes in a tiny box
And how about when your mother dies?
Going to squeeze them both into a little box?
Not even enough room for incense and ghost money at Grave Sweeping Festival
You call that filial?
Then, I'll buy them a cemetery plot
It's not that I can't afford it
Just that when I left China only national heroes could afford a grave
Normal folk's ashes were kept on shelves
Don't worry
You find a spot with a nice view
I'll take care of it immediately
If you and I get along
I'll have your tombstone carved in advance
No way you'll be stored on a shelf
It really is a great investment
Just thirty thousand yuan gets you a grave plot with imperial fengshui
Thirty thousand
Price of a return trip to America
In just a few years, the same plot will be worth three hundred thousand
By the time you sell it you'll have made 1000% profit
Hold on
If I sell it where will my parents go?
You can buy two
If you buy two plots, my company will give you a 5% discount
Miss Liang?
Yes
I'm Qin Fen
Sorry, I was late
Have a seat
I never expected...
What?
Nothing
What's your line of work?
I'm a flight attendant
Which airline?
Hainan Airline
How would you grade yourself?
Six
Only six?
I'd give you a Nine
You've met a few already?
You mean these personals?
Uh
You're the first
Oh
Myself, I've met a couple
You're the first as beautiful as you
This one girl wasn't bad
But she was selling grave plots
She doesn't count
The rest were critically unkosher
Did you buy?
Huh?
The grave plots
Yes
She sweet-talked me
Called me a filial son
If I didn't buy, I'd ruin my reputation
No wife, but got myself a grave
I read your marriage ad.
I think you're very funny
Not like the others, so full of themselves
Or who write a load of sentimental crap
It's disgusting
I'll be totally honest with you
And I'm not trying to flatter you
But judging by your looks
I'd rank you at the "goddess" level
You must have high standards
You're not selling airplanes, are you?
Graves are one thing
But I can't afford airplanes
Why "no women entrepreneurs"?
They're too practical
I prefer more emotional types
What's wrong with being practical?
These days, most people are practical
My mom and friends all advise me to be more practical
That's why I'm here meeting you
To learn to be more practical
Then you got the wrong guy
I'm definitely not the type you're seeking
How do you know my type?
I don't even know what type is
Being here seems so unreal
But I did telephone you
I'm the one who asked you out
You mean you're not serious
You were confused and regret meeting me
A little
Don't be mad
It's not because of you
I think I'm a bit ridiculous
Then we should stop here
It's good we're direct.
Simpler
We won't waste each other's time
You busy?
Not at all
But we don't have any hope
Then, go ahead
I'll sit here awhile
Okay
See you later, then
Good-bye Wait, that's not right
We won't see each other again
In that case...
"Farewell" isn't correct either
You really are a pain
What we mean is...
See you never
Hey
Feel like a drink?
We can go somewhere nearby and chat a little more
Why?
Chat about what?
You a shill for a restaurant posing as a lonely woman?
Enough, already
I didn't suspect you of a crime
So, don't be suspicious of me
In truth, I am a criminal
I was worried you weren't
You drink like a wimp
It won't kill you
Drink up.
No one's stopping you
Keep talking
Heard of "love at first sight"?
I loved the first sight of you
We're not even "love at third sight"
Love at first sight doesn't mean
I fall for you when I see you
Or that you fall for me
It's not about sight
But smell
The other person's scent attracts you
Enchants you
Some people are made for each other
So, two strangers rush up and sniff each other up and down?
Is that possible?
It's not like that
If you're made for each other you'd sense each other from far away
Ever watch "Animal Planet"?
Yes
Even from dozens of miles away animals can sense each other
People are just like animals
Are you only attracted by one smell?
Animals don't fixate on just one lover or type
It's a mutual thing
It's not just attraction, but a kind of infatuation
Anything else repels you
Then why come all this way to bother me?
Infatuated, but you can't be together
You struggle to break free from it
You're torn apart by heartache
You drink yourself to sleep each night
The man has a family
He loves you, but can't marry you
Your parents don't know
It hurts, but you can't share it
I can't tell anyone
Then why tell me?
I couldn't take it anymore
I was hurt too badly
Anyway, I won't see you again
Who cares what you think of me
Then I should charge a fee
He has all the fun and I get a miserable woman
Since when are we best buddies?
Take as much as you want
But I'm paying you to drink up
You can't just sip
I really can't drink
I'll accompany you for free
So, don't drink
I told you one of my secrets
You should also tell me something you can't admit to anyone else
Then we'll be even
Why are you so complicated?
Fine, don't tell me
I don't care, anyway
Let it rot in your stomach
And I thought you were a big man
Based on what you've got dare you ask for a sentimental woman
We won't see each other again?
Nope
Know why I don't drink?
Aren't you drinking now?
A friend and I ran a travel agency in America
We specialized in Chinese groups
Once, we had a government tour group
Led by a bureau director
A very juicy gig
There was a woman named Xiaobai
A translator
Pretty.
The quiet type
I had her in my sights the moment they landed
During the trip
I started to fall for her
Later on we, you know...
What?
We, uh... got intimate
Afterwards, she cried
Wanted me to help her stay in America
I agreed without a second thought
I really liked her
Besides, it was easy for me
The next day I told my friend that I was with Xiaobai
I asked him to help me keep Xiaobai in America
He freaked out
Said, Absolutely not
We'd got the job because of his connection with the bureau director
If they left someone behind the director would be disciplined
Besides screwing the director it could also kill our business
If I insisted on her staying
I think my friend would killed me
So, you two sold her out
Let me finish
I had to beg my friend
I'd make sure she didn't run for it
But he had to promise not to report her
When we saw them off at the airport
Xiaobai just stared at me
With eyes like daggers
Couldn't even look at her
I was so ashamed
That's your secret?
This year the director heard I was back
He invited us to dinner
The people from the tour group came too
Only person missing was Xiaobai
I made a lot of small talk then casually asked about Xiaobai
They said, You don't know?
Soon after she returned, she killed herself
My head just exploded
I asked, What happened?
He said
Her husband was abusive
Beat her all the time
She kept trying to divorce him
She'd planned to stay in America
But she failed
Even got reported
She returned completely hopeless
So, I asked my friend if he'd reported her
He said, Yes
Said he couldn't trust me
So he told the director
That day
I beat up my friend
I drank a lot
Until finally
I was sprawling on the floor grabbing people's legs and crying
Why'd you beat him?
You're the one who killed her
You're despicable
After that day every time I drink, I remember her
Later, I just quit drinking
But you had to make me drink and spill my rotten guts
We even?
Now you know what I'm made of
You can go now
Leave
So, if we get married
I have to go live with your family?
Can I refuse?
There's something you need to know
What?
My aunt has a bad memory
How bad?
She can remember today's events
By tomorrow, it's all gone
Is your home far?
How do I get there?
First you fly to Kunming
Then a day's bus ride to Mengzi
Then another bus to Pingbian
Then a day by tractor
Another day by ox cart and you're home
She can't remember things
And people?
Nope
Not even people?
But she writes all important events and people in her notebook
If you two marry she'll read it every morning and recall who you are
Qin Fen
You're tired already?
Keep playing
If it doesn't work out
Can we divorce?
My big brother will break your legs
Sister
Don't record that
Best to forget what happened today
What we're talking about?
You like it here in Haikou?
It's great
Sunny, no pollution, tropical
I've been here two years
I play golf, swim, dive
Never felt healthier
Gotta take care of yourself
Uh
How are the blind dates?
Still blind
Let me fix you up
Yes For real
A really good person
If I weren't married
I'd marry her myself
I used to be married
My husband passed away
When?
Just recently
How long were you together?
Is this... very important to you?
Of course
If you were deeply in love
After all, his bones are barely cold yet
Seven or eight years
You must be hurting
Compared to before
I feel much better now
These past five years didn't even know where he slept at night
I finally know where he is
You found him a spot
Yanchun Ridge Cemetery
Whenever I need him, he's there
If he runs away now you should get your money back
How old are you?
Fifty?
No
Forty-something
I look older, don't I?
That's okay
I like older men
How's your health?
On the weak side
That's great
Don't bother exercising
If you get sick, I'll nurse you
You don't want a strong healthy body?
You prefer a soft marshmallow?
Soft marshmallows taste better
An old, sickly guy
You're not worried about marriage quality?
At your age...
Let me be frank
You're at your sexual peak
You believe the foundation for love is sex?
Not entirely
But love without sex is not love
That would be friendship
I don't agree
What's wrong with no sex?
Many people grow old together without it
I don't mean to imply no sex at all
Just not too frequently
Tell me
What's your idea of
"not too frequently"?
Ideally speaking...
Yes?
Once a month?
Once a year
If you agree we can meet again
I don't agree
I know why your husband never came home
If we got married
I'd be hard to find too
A real pity
Is sex really all that interesting?
Oh, yeah
Sorry, I couldn't answer just now
Smiley
Please don't get angry, but...
My wife and I will be on the same flight as you
Can't you change your ticket?
I just found out
She booked it ages ago
I never expected it would be your flight
You know I care about you
I have to attend my brother's wedding
I just hope you can make sure she doesn't see you
It would be better
How should I do that?
It's an airplane cabin and you're seated in first class
Where should I hide myself?
You can't treat me like this
Welcome to Grand China Air
Welcome to Grand China Air
Boarding pass, please
Smiley Liang
It really is you
Old foes meet again
Please take your seat and don't block the aisle
Welcome to Grand China Air
Hello.
This way, please
Welcome to Grand China Air
Boarding pass, please
This way on the left
Thank you
Welcome to Grand China Air
Boarding pass, please
This way, sir
Please hurry and take your seat
Sir, as soon as possible
We're about to close the door
Please sign this
Here
I'll sign it
Thank you
Hi, I'll get that for you
Please take your seat
Hot towel
Something to drink?
Miss?
If there is an empty seat
I'd like to sit with my husband
Sorry
First class is full today
But I'd be happy to look in economy
My husband and I booked this flight
Why aren't we seated together?
Next time you can arrive earlier to have your boarding passes changed
The computer doesn't know you're husband and wife
I'll switch with you
No one should split up a married couple
Young comrade
I know you're not responsible for ticketing
But you should listen to customer feedback and submit our suggestions to your superiors
The key to improving customer service is paying attention to details
Please, sir.
C'mon
No point in troubling you
It's a short flight
We're about to take off
If you're going to switch seats please do it soon
It's no trouble
I'm already up.
Go ahead
Please
Thank you
Please fasten your seat belts Thank you
Ladies and gentlemen we'll be taking off shortly
To ensure your safety, please check that your seat belts are fastened and that all cell phones are turned off
Thank you
We're already taxiing
Whatever it is, can wait
Just wanted to remind you for your own safety to fasten your seat belt
So, that gentleman is the little runt you can't live without?
Please don't interrupt my work
Some things just aren't meant to be
I'll be in Hangzhou for a few days
If you're flying to Beijing call me if you feel like a drink
I can be your non-fatal drinking buddy
When outsiders imagine Hangzhou they often think of West Lake
What they don't know is that a mere 5 kilometers away is a rare environmental treasure
Here is China's first wetlands national park:
West Brook Wetlands
An exiled Song Dynasty emperor happened upon these wetlands
Like me, he was enchanted
He wanted to build his temporary palace here
But due to lack of funds the project was abandoned
The night before he had to leave the Emperor said:
West Brook, may you remain here
And thus it earned its eternal name
The home we're seeing today is in Remain Here Town
I trust you'll want to stay too
The Emperor would have stayed
But he was broke
All that remained were his words
But I've brought cash
If I like the place my whole life will remain here
This is your foyer
Your living room
Your master bedroom
And this is your private pond
Hey, take it easy
Stop saying "your" living room, "your" bedroom
"your" private pond
I don't know if I'm buying yet
I'm sure you've seen better homes
But no amount of money could buy an environment like this
Hello?
I was in a lousy mood yesterday
So I took a day off and stayed in Hangzhou
Drank half a bottle of wine to get to sleep
Slept in the whole morning
Woke up not knowing what to do
If you're not busy care to join me for a chat?
That's fine, but
I've got another blind date
You came all the way to Hangzhou?
Really casting a wide net
Can't leave any stone unturned
Better to kill a thousand innocents than set one guilty person free
Well, I'm not busy
Take me along.
I'll consult for you
How should I introduce you?
Say we already dated but you rejected me?
Say we're drinking buddies
Or, don't introduce me at all
I'll just sit nearby and drink tea
I'll advise you afterwards
I won't get in your way
Sounds good
But I'm warning you:
If I find a suitable match if we dig each other's smell you're not my responsibility
Don't call me a fair-weather friend
Relax
If that happens
I'll be overjoyed for you
See you
Hey, miss
How much does this place cost?
Don't mind me
You are not from here
I'm Taiwanese
My father owns a factory in Hangzhou
We're here for the time being
Ever been to Beijing?
Of course
Which do you prefer?
That's a difficult question
For weather and living environment
Hangzhou, of course
But I quite like Beijingers
My grandfather is from Beijing
I love hearing his accent
What is go-ING on'?
The accent is the last word
Not the first word
What is going ON'
What is going ON'
What is going on'
Later on my grandfather went to Taiwan with the Nationalists after the Mainland had fallen
Hold on there
We call it "liberated"
You say "fallen"
we say "liberated"
Liberated?
What does "liberated" mean?
Liberated
I get it
The difference between liberated and fallen is just one's point-of-view
Right, that's it
We can agree to disagree
Exactly
There are some universal values
For instance compassion is to love all beings
After the recent earthquake
Taiwanese all rushed to provide relief
Mainland Chinese were very moved
My father's company donated too
It pained us to see fellow Chinese suffering
Especially children who lost their parents
Poor things
There was a dying mother on the news
To her last breath, she breast-fed her child
Even after dying, she was still nursing
Maternal love knows no bounds
A mother can sacrifice anything for her child
Dads too
Even if it wasn't my child
I could adopt one of those orphans
You have such deep love for children?
Yes
If you were an orphan
I'd adopt you too
Idealists really do have bad memories
I told you my father has a factory here
But don't despair
I have one in my belly
You can be his father
Thought you weren't married?
I'm not
But
I'm pregnant
Whose is it?
Not worth mentioning
He abandoned the darling in my belly
I don't want the child to be fatherless
So
I'm seeking a loving father for him
You're a good candidate
Uh, well
Do you like me?
I like you a lot but...
You said you didn't care if it was your own
If we don't tell him and the child only knows you
He would be just like your own
An orphan, I can accept
But with a full set of parents?
You can't just put a Mercedes ornament on the hood of a BMW
It will still be a good car
But if it breaks down
Mercedes parts won't fit and BMW won't repair it
We should forget it
I'm flattered you like me
But I'm not the right man
I'll have to bite the bullet
What a perfect opportunity
How could you be so heartless?
Seemed like a great fit
Look
She's beautiful wealthy and you get a son for free
For a guy like you it's like winning the lottery
Normally, I don't mind free lunches but starting a family requires self-reliance
No foreign aid accepted
I think this blind date thing isn't too kosher for me
I have no appetite for ugly ducklings but the good-looking ones are either hiding something or hate sex
Where'd the simple, sane women all go?
Why can't I meet even one?
What are you saying about me?
Think your sane and uncomplicated?
Oh, not you.
You're not good-looking
Calling you "good-looking" would be an insult
You're ravishingly beautiful
A rare, precious beauty
If you were royalty you'd be up there with Diana
Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder
But, no exaggeration even to a foe, you'd be beautiful
Don't hold it in.
Laugh
I need to ask you something
I sat with you through your date
Accompany me to meet someone?
I didn't ask you to come
You invited yourself
Will you or won't you?
No
I'm asking you one more time
No
Fine
Good-bye
This is Mr. Qin
You met on the flight
Nice to meet you
Have a seat
Sit here
Excuse us
We'll need some privacy
Okay
Thanks
Mr. Qin and I knew each other before
Just acquaintances
But meeting again on the flight something sparked between us
Perhaps it was "love at second sight"
After we landed, Mr. Qin called me
He asked me to stay a few more days to become better acquainted
We've been together the past two days
We feel fortunate to have met again
You're the person closest to me
So I brought him here to introduce you formally
It's right that you should know
Not going to wish us well?
You always wanted me to have a home
Smiley told me a lot about you
Said you treat her very well
Meeting you on the airplane seemed like fate
You've made your decision?
Mr. Qin
Perhaps you know about
Smiley and me
I'm not as lucky as you
I entrust her to you, good brother
Be good to her
She's stubborn.
I spoiled her
Be patient with her
If she's unhappy
I'll be unhappy too
Alright, this scene is over.
I can't take it
I'll be leaving now
I know it's difficult for you to meet
Smiley and I are just ordinary friends
You're the only one she cares about
You're the lucky one
She drinks everyday because of you
It could kill her if she keeps it up
I can't go on like this
I'm weak and ashamed
I will use my mind and body all of me to do something to make you regret
Stop drinking
Smiley
I have not betrayed you
How could I ever punish you?
You asked me to wait three years
I waited
You won't want me
But I will care about you until that day we agreed upon
I thought I could love you my whole life
I never thought our time together could one day end
One, two, three
One, two, three
One, two, three
One, two, three
I stopped drinking
Don't worry.
Smiley
Surname Qin
"Qin" as in Emperor Qin
Fen as in "to struggle"
Smiley
I got your text message
"Smiley" as in "smiles hiding knives"
Correct
I called twice but you didn't answer
Call me
Yeah
At the place we met the first time
I already said it eight times:
Five'o'clock
Yeah, that's right
Be there or be square
Pardon me
I've got two dates
Please don't mind my efficiency
No problem
I'm a stock trader
A real bear market lately
Using my spare time to find a husband
Once the market turns around
I won't have time
Do you play the stock market?
No
Don't understand it
Seeking a marriage partner is like trading stocks
You have to make your decisions based on a rational analysis of performance
For instance, the candidate's looks or body figure
Or, his personality and education
Or, his finances and family background
Or
So... if I were a stock how would I rate?
Judging from age and looks you've sunk below your offer price
So, I'm in danger of being delisted?
Not necessarily
Inexperienced traders often buy high
But that's very risky
It's very easy to get trapped
More experienced traders buy low
A stock like you with bad performance most won't touch you
Few would show interest
Thus you're a low risk
You're already at the bottom
Can't go any lower
So, for a stock like me bought low would you invest long-term or just "pump and dump"?
Pump and dump?
Do you have explosive potential?
I'd buy long-term and hold it
What if you held it for a while but found its performance lacking?
Don't worry
I'm not stupid.
I'd diversify
They can't all underperform, right?
No one's that unlucky
Hello?
You're here?
I'm here
I see you
Wait for me
Order whatever you like.
It's on me
I feel obligated to warn you:
I'm very risky
Best to keep your distance
If you got stuck with me
I'd be useless and unsightly
Might never be able to get rid of me
As an investment
I'd be subprime
Only a criminal would sell me to you
Let's stop trading for today
I also have another stock to see at six o'clock
Go ahead and chat with her
The whole market is down right now
But don't jump in blindly
Don't rush it
Wait and see
Did I interrupt anything?
She wasn't interested
Said I'd dropped below my offer price
Poor thing
Old guy on the dating scene getting his pride injured
Spare me the alligator tears
So what's up?
I want to become your girlfriend
Which type of girlfriend?
The kind you marry
Why?
You knocked up, too?
I'm not in a mood for joking
I have just one condition
What?
While we're dating or even married
I'll fulfill all the duties of a wife but you'll allow me to have someone else in my heart
I won't do anything
I'll just keep a space for him in my heart
I might miss him from time to time
But it won't be anything more than that
I'll never contact him
Can you accept this?
Your body is here but your heart is elsewhere
You can refuse
I know it's unfair
Then, is it okay with you if my heart is here but my body occasionally has a fling?
No
Well, what if when your heart drifts away my heart drifts away too?
Fine
But our bodies are faithful to each other
Come here
Then, I'll need to find someone else too
Otherwise, you'll have one and I won't
I'd be at a huge disadvantage
Then, you agree?
Yes
Will you go with me to Hokkaido?
He and I started there
I'd like to end it there too
Are you bubbling with joy?
Wu Sang
Haven't changed in ten years
Look just like a Hokkaido peasant
Except a bit more devious
This is Smiley
This is the Wu Sang I told you about
Married a Hokkaido wife and never left
Ms. Liang, honored to be of service to you
Thank you
I'll get that
Thanks
This way
Wu Sang
What are those arrows for?
Ms. Liang you've been here before
You must know why.
Tell him
Hey
Hey
He asked you a question
What?
Those arrows pointing down
Know what they mean?
Hokkaido gets heavy snow in winter
The arrows point to the road's edge so drivers don't hit the curb
Ah
I see
Did I say it right?
Yes
You learned that from him, right?
Let's have a good time here
You're my boyfriend now
Let's not mention him
Okay?
I'm not used to it yet
It's like my wallet is full of borrowed money
After I spend it, I'll be in debt
Hey, Wu Sang, stop the car
I need to go worship
Don't know what he's saying
No chance today
Why not?
The temple's closed to the public today
No worshipping for you
Well, talk to him
Tell him we came from China just for today
Have you done something wrong?
I thought you were atheist
Why so suddenly pious?
I found religion
God sent me such a beautiful wife
I'd be rude not to burn some incense
Hey
I'm not your wife yet
Besides, a Japanese Buddha can't help you
Blasphemy
Buddha has no nationality
Hokkaido is my land of fortune
I'll pray to every Buddha I find here
Go talk to him
Okay, okay
In honor of your incredible luck with Ms. Liang
I'll talk to him for you
Why are we being frisked?
It's the funeral of an influential family
Then, let's get out of here
You kidding?
We can't go now
Stop peeking
Act mournful
Did you really cry?
No laughing
You didn't cry?
I saw you cry too
I tried to keep the tears in
Just couldn't hold them any longer
These Japanese must think we Chinese are really loyal friends
We're not even family, but we came all this way to cry our eyes out
Practically forced our way in
Neither of you better piss me off
I'm a mafia guy now
You knew this was a funeral
What are you complaining about?
You just had to go in
You're truly adorable
Excuse me
Which way to Hinanoza Hotel?
Straight ahead
Turn right and you'll see it
Thank you
Very easy to find
It's just up ahead
That says "Four Sisters-What?"
Four Sisters dining bar
How are we going to sleep?
You two in one room
You and I can share a room
Catch up on old times
Cut the pretense
A beauty like her and you want to be in my room?
It's not a pretense
We're not that close yet
I'm not the one she loves
Wishing you a pleasant rest
Thank you
Here, try this
It's fishy
Penetrating
Stimulating
Try it
I'm already over-stimulated
What I need now is numbness
Best part about drinking is the numbness
Can't drink on an empty stomach
Try these clams
I need to get numb too
If your dreams had not been shattered
I'd never be talking marriage with you
My life's been no easier than yours
How can you allow your girlfriend to have someone else in her heart?
Why do you like me?
Did I say I liked you?
Be honest
It our basis for being together in the future
My basis for marrying you is that
I can't find anyone more foolish
I'll never be so foolish again
You are incapable of splitting your heart in half
You're a terrible actor
Your feelings are writ across your face
Here's what I think
You're not over him yet
But once you are your heart will be whole again
That's why I tolerate you right now
You're a fool, but I'm not
If I learn my lesson and get smart will it ruin your beautiful plan?
In that case
I'll sell you to the local tribesmen
You'll hunt and fish for the rest of your life
And have a slew of babies
Scorched by the sun, drenched in rain
Half-starving, in tattered clothes
If you try to escape they'll catch you and beat you
Three tortuous years from now you'll be an ugly, repulsive, wizened old hag
I'm just getting started
Wanna hear more?
I'm only fooling around with you because you're pretty
Can you accept that?
You up to it?
In the game of emotional counterfeit you think you're my match?
I'll bet you couldn't even tell if I had eight other women in my heart
I've got nothing to lose
You don't care about me
So, I just take what you're giving away
What are you guys so upset for
Getting on my case
If I didn't say something nasty, she'd never stop
You really are serious
Sit down
Let her go
What a perfect opportunity
After this drink, you should invite Smiley to the hot spring with you
What friend would do that?
And abandon you here?
Spare me
This time, I'm serious about marrying her
I can't be reckless
She'd never give me her body before she gave me her heart
But, then once she gives you her heart your body is sentenced for life
So, I should enjoy freedom while I can
What do you like about her?
She has a good soul
Oh, please
You like her because she's pretty
What's wrong with that?
I should deprive my children of good genes?
Must I marry someone ugly?
Spend the life trying to escape?
Which of these four is prettiest?
They're all charming
Natsuyo.
She's pretty
I say Haruko
Sorry to disturb you
May we come in?
Welcome
Please, come in
So few customers
It's still early
Please, sit
Ask Natsuyo and Haruko to drink with us
I am Natsuyo
And that's Haruko
She is Akimi
I am Akimi
And Yukie
And the photo outside?
That photo was taken forty years ago
Oh, really?
We were famous in Tokyo
We were "The Four Seasons"
You suckers fell for it
We stayed together all these years
Aren't we beautiful?
Very beautiful
Now I get it
Where are the Four Sisters?
They're here
She is Natsuyo
Haruko, the one you like, is singing
All old ladies?
They took that photo forty years ago
They used to be famous
They retired here in Hokkaido and opened this bar
Let's leave
No
We can't leave now
It wouldn't be polite
See how friendly they are?
Have a drink
What would you like?
No more sake
A whiskey
How about Windsor whiskey?
Fine
A bottle of Whiskey, please
Right away
With ice, but no green tea
Fooled us with a forty-year-old photo
Very funny
Come in
A beautiful woman
Bottoms up
This is an inspirational song
Why are your voices so full of despair?
Added together, those four sisters are more than three hundred years old
How could we not despair?
You take your girlfriend on a trip
But you sneak out drinking and don't come home
What kind of romance is that?
You call that faithful?
It's called paying her back in her own coin
I allow your heart to love another man but my body can't enjoy a little fling?
You're shameless
If you let go of the past and be mine
I swear:
Even if we were with Maggie Cheung plus
Angelina Jolie plus Sophie Marceau and supermodel Chi-Ling Lin
I wouldn't drink a single cup
That's right
You'd drink the whole bar
Feel to see if he has a fever
He's starting to talk crazy
Oh, my
Poor thing
Reality was so distant from your expectations
Should I find you a psychologist?
No medicine can heal my wounded heart
You're my best medicine
Not afraid I'm poison?
I'd drink you, even if you were
Someone tormented you
Now, you torment me
That's the wheel of fate
Bad karma
Hey
We passed this several times but I didn't say anything
Is it a church?
Why so small?
It's for confessions
Confessions?
A lot of city people feel guilty about all the bad things they've done
So, they come to Hokkaido to confess
Get the guilt out and seek forgiveness
You must have a lot of sins
Do a good confession
Clear your conscience and start over
Go in
They can't speak Chinese, anyway
You can tell them everything you've done
Better than keeping it inside and having nightmares
Go ahead
God is more forgiving than the police
We won't listen
We'll wait here for you
He's in your hands
Okay
Wu Sang
Sure he can't speak Chinese?
Don't worry.
Even if he did he's not going to broadcast it
Please, begin
I want to donate 10 million.
You want it?
Do you speak English?
That's ten times a million.
A lot
No English
Don't want any money?
You really don't understand
Now, I can relax
Let me start from the bad things I did in kindergarten
He really is a lot of fun
He hasn't changed in all these years
Just like he used to be
These past few days together brought back many good memories
He's a good man
And quite romantic
A head full of impractical ideas
Deep down
He's an idealist
That's why he's still a bachelor
Marriage is about destiny
Sometimes it's just not meant to be
It's fate
He really likes you
Most women don't understand him
I think you do
I hope it works out with you two
Did he tell you about his invention?
It's very interesting
Made him a chunk of money too
I don't know much about him
But he felt like an old friend
My intuition told me that he's a man I can rely on
If I'm going to get married, but can't be with the man I love
I should at least find a buddy
If that's what you're thinking
I advise you to let him go
Wouldn't be fair to him
I haven't lied to him
He accepts it
Smiley
I don't know what kind of man you really want to love
Does he deserve it more than Qin Fen?
You're being very selfish
You can't exploit other people's feelings
I hope I'm not being too direct
That's okay
I like straight-talkers
And then there was this time we were studying farm production all in the same dorm
Me
Little Wen
Zhang Kui, Lu Dewei
And also...
Oh, anyhow, there were eight or nine of us
And then, um
It was night time
I got this idea
The idea was, uh
We rubbed balm on the soles of his feet
Then waved a fan over them
As soon as we did
Zhang Kui wet his bed
His blanket and sheets were soaked
It really cracked us up
We didn't admit who did it
But later the next morning, he discovered that everything was wet
He didn't dare hang them out
He asked, How'd I pee myself?
Nobody said anything
Then somebody sold me out
Said I did it
I said, I would never do that
Excuse me
The time.
It's very late
I'm just getting started
After middle-school, I have countryside stories
Then my career
And love life
Just getting started
I said
I'm not that kind of person
I said, Little Wen did it
Little Wen said he said he didn't do it
He said I did it
No way.
I'd never do that
It was Lu Dewei and them
They did it
Me?
Even if it were possible
I'm not saying it wasn't my idea, but...
Miss
Miss, excuse me
Yes?
What's wrong?
Your friend is extremely pious
But he has far too many sins
We're a small church
We don't have enough room
Nearby is a much bigger church
So, please be so kind and take him there for confession
So sorry
I'll get him out right away
Very sorry
God please forgive his sins
I was young.
Didn't know any better
Felt I'd really wronged her
But now that I think of it...
Cut it out.
Let's go
Would even let me bow to her
Hey, Qin Fen
How many sins do you have?
The kind even Hell wouldn't let you in for?
Water...
Give me water
Lord please forgive his atrocities
The Lord sent you to save my soul and rescue me from Hell
Don't let Him down
I'm still in a world of suffering
Who will save me?
I will
That's hot
I hear this place has lots of bears
That's right
Anyone get hurt?
Yes
Bears seem clumsy
But when they attack
They're very fast
Faster than a deer
Smiley
Smiley.
Come back
Watch out for bears
Seeing a bear is good luck for you
Nonsense.
It's the bear's good luck
You see any?
Where?
C'mon, let's go
You really worried?
If you got hurt, how would I explain it?
To whom?
No one cares about me
I do
Wu Sang
Ask if they've seen any bears
What did they say?
They were a party of four
Now there's only two left
Huh?
How could there be bears here?
Lmpossible
We fooled you
You really believed us
Who says Japanese aren't funny?
A bunch of real jokers
The bear is coming
Protect your head and heart
If the bear flips you over flip back to your original position
So pretty
A terrible pity to eat you
Best keep you alive to mother cubs
You don't have bear eyes
What are they?
The eyes of a wolf
Regret meeting me?
No.
I'm quite happy
If you'll marry me our days will be sweet as honey
Would you really marry me?
If you say yes
We can tie the knot tonight
Such a big, bad bear
He said, Don't talk to bears
They'll tear you to pieces
I was torn apart long ago
Cold?
Let's go back
I'll light it for you
I want to do it for you
Do you want me?
Yes
I'm yours tonight
Just for tonight?
Yes
Then I'd rather not have you
Why not?
Don't you think I'm pretty?
I want to repay you
I can't owe you this favor
I won't be able to pay it back
You don't have to
You deserve it
Let me be a fool this once
I'm in love with you
Will you marry me?
Uh
Don't just say, "uh"
I want you to say
Yes or no?
Yes
When?
I need more time
How long?
Qin Fen
The last few days, I've watched myself through Wu Sang's eyes
I'm such a strange woman
Came all this way with you but just kept pushing you away
But you understand how I got here
I keep struggling to rescue myself from an abyss of despair
I hoped that your kindness and pristine Hokkaido could help me rediscover life's beauty
That was my selfish hope
But terrible love has already emptied me
The more I struggle the more the memories pull me down
This evening in the last sunset of my life
I saw the more lovely side of you
I also saw how pathetic and helpless I was
You are the perfect partner
If I'd only met you years ago
I'm a fool to let you pass me by
But this is God's punishment of me
Good-bye, Qin Fen
Don't look for me
Just please forgive me
After Smiley jumped she was found by a fishing boat
They rescued her
She's in surgery right now
So damned foolish
Now matter what happens, I'll be there for her
You really are naughty
I thought I was trouble
But you're worse than me
Your brother knows you've been hurt
But with your brother here you can overcome anything
Okay
I'm leaving
Alright
Otherwise, you'll lose your job
Be good to her
She's a good girl with a true heart
She's already died once
Her love for him is dead now too
This is for your wife and kids
More than ten years since we last met
Who knows when we'll meet again
She's going to need money now
Don't pull that polite crap with me
Money means nothing to me
What I lack are friends
My best friends are scattered to the winds
Sometimes, I really miss you guys
I feel terribly lonely
Take care
It's almost New Year's
You cheated death
So, make a wish
Give me your phone
Hello?
It's me
It's been a long time
I just want to thank you for once having loved me
I'm very happy now
Because I've found someone
I want to share my life with
Be good to your wife
I wish you both the best
Good-bye
That was my phone
Your phone sleeps with the fishes
You don't need to call anyone else
Understood
The root of the world's endless wars and escalating conflicts is our inability to judge disputes impartially
The Conflict Resolution Terminal wipes out both flaws
Please insert your hand
Okay
Now, grab this handle
Rock, paper, scissors
When I count to three we both pull it open
One
Two
Three
Interesting
Did you sell that to him?
Isn't that your invention?
You two are venture capitalists
I have my own humble opinion about the nature of investment
Venture capital is about risk
The greater the risk, the more one invests
No risk, no investment
I'll stake my reputation in saying to invest in this product is way too risky
Very suitable for venture capitalists
This will be a massive hi-tech IPO
A revolutionary product
Let's play each other with it
If I win throw it into the ocean for me
Is that you?
Who else could it be?
Why's you hair all grey?
The worst financial crisis of the century wiped me out
This year's economy is really in the dumps
Three top investment banks belly up
Nothing's selling
Don't cry
It's gonna be okay
Don't cry
Listen
I sold this to you, right?
Uh
Right?
Right
I'll buy it back
Name your price
Two million
But you were throwing it away
One million
Two million
One million
Let's not argue
A million, it is
Deal
I meant Sterling
Huh.
I meant Japanese Yen
Japanese Yen?
Uh
Don't worry.
Next year when the economy rebounds
I'll sell it at a high price
I'll split it with you
Let me see.
What are you looking at?
The future
Our wedding toast
Such beautiful delusions
Like sweet sugar cubes
Jumping into bitter coffee
Words I thought were true
Tears were all I knew
There's no going back now
Just waking up to get drunk again
THE END Subtitles by:
Previously on In Treatment.
- Yeah, I don't think I can do this.
- Do what?
This therapy, I...
- I just don't think it's leading anywhere, it's...
- Where do you want it to lead?
Someplace where I feel less shitty about myself. (Sighs)
I got a call from my wing commander.
He's trying to figure out if I'm ready, for active duty.
- What do you think?
- No, I don't think you're ready.
(Paul) Oh.
Well, I feel like I should salute you.
At ease, Doc.
This is gonna be my last time, for a while anyway.
I'm here to settle up.
And I need something from you.
Mm.
- Would you like some coffee?
- Sure.
I know I'm not giving you any notice.
- You want me to pay for the next session too?
- No, that's fine.
- Sorry the gravy train is ending here.
- That's OK.
- So why are you leaving?
- I got you curious, huh?
Remember I told you my squadron commander called me?
Mm-hm.
Last week they brought me in.
I thought they'd ease me back in, but no.
They need me to train the new pilots for their deployment, get them ready to fly ASAP.
- Always playing catch-up in this war.
- What did you say to them?
I said, "Fuck you!
I'm 39 years old, in the prime of my life
"and one of the most decorated fighter pilots in the navy.
"You're not putting me out to pasture, not during a war.
- "Get yourself another boy."
- That's what you said to them?
Well, not really, but...
but I thought it.
Actually what I said was, "Yes, sir.
However I can be of service."
And I reported for duty the next day.
You think I'm crazy?
I can only get away with that bullshit with you.
(Chuckles) At least we know why you come.
Mm.
- So what's it like being back at base?
- Ah, it's been a real trip.
Most of these guys are out of TOPGUN, cocky as hell.
They look in my eyes, they know I've been places they couldn't conjure up in their worst nightmares.
Makes them think twice before fucking with me.
Mm.
So, training young pilots, is that something you can see yourself doing?
I don't know, maybe in another context.
But this is set up to fail.
No way these kids are gonna be ready for combat missions in a month.
It's crazy.
I'm taking them through situations.
Some of them do better than others, but when you're up in the air, it's read and react.
Like a machine.
Split-second decisions that can cost thousands of lives, including their own.
Most of these kids, they look at me on the simulators and they're like, "Whoa!"
- Well, they're blown away.
- That must feel really great.
I overheard some kids talking shit about me, that I might be good on the simulators but they'd kick my ass on the obstacle course.
Called me "old man".
Well, hey, I called their bluff.
Check this out - the drill is called the gauntlet.
It's a five-mile run through dense woods and sand traps and rope-and-barrier hurdles, balance beams and a maze.
Now after all that, there's the helo-dunker.
Now the helo-dunker is like this giant... it looks like a beer can.
It's basically a crash simulator.
We hit the water hard, upside down, strapped in tight.
And we have to get out with almost no oxygen.
We're in full gear, helmet, spacesuit,
G-suit, gloves, the whole nine yards.
There are four immersions.
The last two, the water's dark.
It's like a night landing.
A lot of these kids, they get disoriented and start flipping the fuck out.
So we have to rescue them.
It's tough.
It separates the men from the boys, let me tell you.
So, Doc, how do you think I did?
(Chuckles)
- Do I really have to guess, Alex?
- (Laughs)
Touché.
I never panic.
I'm at home down there in the dark, swimming for my life.
And not only did I beat all their asses,
I came within two seconds of a base record.
Not bad for a broken-down old pilot, huh?
- Huh?
Come on, Paul.
- (Chuckles)
OK, so my squadron commander calls me back up to his office.
This time all the brass were there and they want to know if I'm interested in active duty.
If I am, I have to go through a modified basic training at Pensacola, a battery of tests, physical, psychological...
just to make sure I've recovered.
So I said, "Bring it on, baby!
I'm ready for anything!"
Are you surprised?
Well, a little, I guess.
I, um...
I shouldn't be, but I suppose it was always a possibility.
But you think it's too fast, right?
Do you think it's too fast?
Doc, you have no idea how good it feels to be useful again.
I think that's been the real problem.
I've been sitting around feeling sorry for myself.
I'm a doer, not a talker, so all of this, that's over.
Those days are over.
So, here's what I need from you - you'll get a call from one of your compatriots.
A navy doctor named Connell.
He's gonna be checking up on me.
You said you're seeing me?
I thought that was professional suicide.
Yeah, they caught wind that I had left the house and they wanted to know if it was to do with the bombing.
I told them I'd been doing some counselling with you.
My marriage...
And that I was fit as a fiddle.
- Do you feel fit as a fiddle?
- Don't fuck with me on this.
You're talking about my career now.
Just tell him all good things.
The navy can't afford to have someone like me just pissing around.
Tell him I'm ready.
- Let's talk about whether you are ready or not.
- Cut the crap!
I need this.
You're putting me in a very difficult position, Alex.
We talked about a lot more than Michaela.
You don't expect me to lie, do you?
OK, physically I'm fine.
I had the heart attack almost four months ago.
All the cardiologists say that...
They're amazed at my recovery.
I can handle it.
But what about emotionally?
Can you imagine yourself back in an aeroplane flying a mission after what happened?
Are you talking about the madrasah?
The madrasah is the crisis that brought you here in the first place.
Are you sure that you're ready to put yourself in that kind of a situation again?
No, listen.
Terrorists hide among civilians.
It's a common tactic.
It's their fault if there's collateral damage, not ours.
They're putting their women and children at risk.
Let's put aside the question of who's at fault or... or who isn't.
Could you live with yourself if you were responsible for more civilian casualties?
That's bullshit.
Alex, you gave yourself a heart attack a few months ago.
Can you honestly tell me that you're not scared that your guilt will lead to...
Guilt is not an issue for a pilot in a time of war.
- We're not trained to think that way.
- I'm not asking what you think.
I'm asking you to tell me what you feel.
- And I'm telling you it doesn't matter.
- (Low buzz)
Let me just see who this is.
Sorry.
(Alex sighs, beep)
(Alex) Hey.
It went fine.
Yeah, they did ask me.
No.
No, I can't talk about that right now.
Can I call you back?
Michaela, let me go, all right?
I'm with somebody right now.
Yeah, I will.
Yeah, bye.
Sorry.
She wanted to know how the meeting with the brass went.
You know, she's totally obsessed with me flying again.
You know that.
Why do you think she's so anxious for you to fly again?
Well, my little sabbatical upset her sense of order.
If it was a couple of weeks, it would be all right.
I was taking a break, whatever.
I told you we were having dinner to discuss me coming back home?
Well, the heat is on.
I don't think I can fight it any longer.
Plus, it's what everybody wants.
Everyone?
Everybody.
My father.
He and Michaela, they're united in everything.
Why is your father so anxious for you to fly again?
Well, there's nothing deep behind it, Paul.
He thinks I need to get back to my job.
It's what a man does.
- Mm-hm.
- And he's right.
Can you tell me how you got to that conclusion?
(Laughs)
- Are you sure you have time for that?
- We've got plenty of time.
This is something we need to talk about, especially if you're trying to push me for an assessment.
It's hot as hell in here.
Um...
We had a party for my son, a birthday party.
And everything became clear.
Mm.
I told you my son Roy is a special kid.
Have I told you that?
He doesn't seem to need friends.
So, when we asked him what kind of party he wanted, he said only family.
I supported that.
I didn't want to force him to be anything he isn't.
So all the uncles and aunts came and cousins and everybody was in a good mood.
My dad, he got there early.
He's setting up everything and acting like he owns the place, ordering my wife around.
I could tell he had been there a lot since I left.
And the bitch he married was there too, in the kitchen cooking as if my mother never existed.
It made me feel like shit, like a...
a stranger in my own home.
My father sees me and he gives me one of those cold smiles.
"Alex, nice of you to make it."
I could tell he had a wild hare up his ass about something.
But I didn't ask, cos when he wants to share, he shares, and then he's all over me.
And I'm in no rush to get there.
But he is great with Roy, though.
They... they connect.
Somehow.
It's easy for them.
Did you feel like you weren't connecting with Roy?
There were a lot of people there.
We didn't have much time alone.
Mm.
Have you seen a lot of him since you left home?
Once, twice.
I don't know what you consider a lot.
Did he ever ask why you weren't living at home any more?
Yeah.
I told him that his dad was on a special mission.
I mean, I'm gone half the time.
He's used to it.
To tell you the truth, I think it's been a relief for him.
Why would it be a relief for his dad to be away?
He was loose as hell at the party.
He's running around, playing with his cousins, talking to everybody.
You should have seen him.
A different person.
He was open, he was outgoing.
It's like he bloomed in my absence.
Well, not bloomed.
Jeez, he's not a fucking flower.
It's like he spread his wings.
Yeah, that's what it was like.
Maybe he was happy because you were there, maybe because he was just glad to see you.
It's interesting when you talk about flying because you make no bones whatsoever about the fact that the navy really needs you, that they can't do it without you.
Yet when it comes to talking about your son...
Paul, slow the fuck down.
The boy was having a great day before I ever got there.
Is it possible that you're projecting your own feelings about your father onto your son?
- How do you mean?
- That you might be doing better yourself, spreading your wings too if he wasn't there, if he wasn't in your way, so to speak.
No, Doc, my being there didn't make the kid happy that day.
Just the opposite in fact.
How?
What happened?
I told you Roy was obsessed with chess, right?
I got him this magnificent set.
It was all ivory, imported from Nairobi, just a real work of art.
He just looked at the pieces, mesmerised.
But that was only half of the gift.
The other half was that I had been working on my own chess game and I was gonna play my boy.
So we sat down at the chessboard.
Everybody's watching.
I thought I'd open with something simple.
The King's Indian, which is where you establish your pawns in the centre.
Then he moved, and I countered.
And he moved again.
I countered again.
And we're moving along at this real nice clip and I think I'm holding my own.
And then... (Sighs)
I'll never forget it.
He looked up suddenly and it was like a shadow fell over his face.
And he stood up from the table and he said,
"I'm not feeling well.
I don't want to play."
He goes up to his bedroom.
I follow him up the stairs.
I knock on the door.
He doesn't answer.
I crack the door open and I see him.
He's sitting at his desk.
He's got his back to me.
I don't know if he heard me.
I was about to say something, but I didn't.
I just stood there and I stared at the back of his head.
Something about him, I don't know what it was.
It broke my heart.
Then I heard these footsteps and I turn around and it's my father.
And he says, "You know why he quit, don't you?"
I shook my head.
And he gives me that look, that look that sees right through you.
He says, "He knew in three moves, Alex, you were gonna lose.
"He didn't want to beat his father in front of the whole family.
"He felt sorry for you."
Do you think he was right?
I know he was right.
That's my son to a T.
And then my father, he pulls me into a room and he just ripped into me.
He says, "You are pathetic.
"One thing goes wrong in your little cushy life and you turn soft as butter."
He didn't understand why I wasn't eager to fly again or why I was away from home doing God knows what with God knows who like a fucking teenager.
He says, "You disappoint me, boy.
"I raised you to be stronger than that, to be a man."
And he wanted to know who put all these ideas in my head.
Who turned me into a...
What did...
Who turned me into a "selfish, whining little bitch."
Was it the fags I was hanging around with?
Or was it, and this one he really seized on, was it the shrink?
How would he know you were seeing a shrink?
- Michaela told him.
- You told her?
(Sighs) Yeah, I had to.
I've been paying you cash to avoid a paper trail.
But that means I've been withdrawing from ATMs all the time.
Michaela looks at the bank statements and wanted to know where the money was going.
Anyway, I told her I've been consulting with someone about my thoughts, and that was the word, "thoughts".
My thoughts about me and her.
And did you get into that, your thoughts about, uh, the two of you?
No, she shut down.
So anyway, listen.
My father...
Yeah, he gives me this whole earful.
He goes downstairs and, oh, man...
I felt like I had been hit by a freight train.
I locked myself in the bathroom and I sat there so I could just... just catch my breath.
And when I finally got my shit together I went back downstairs, and...
And everybody was around the chessboard again watching another match, including Michaela and...
And you know what it was?
It was my father... and my son locked in this epic battle, matching each other move for move.
Totally out of my league.
And everyone's oohing and ahhing and they... they didn't even notice that I was there.
What was it about Roy that broke your heart when you were watching him in his room?
Uhh...
He seemed so... vulnerable, somehow.
Vulnerable to what?
I don't know, really, um...
Everything...
Forces, expectations, stuff coming at him that...
he can't control,
I can't control.
So...
I slipped out of the house... without anyone knowing.
- It was for the better.
- For whom?
For my boy.
Do you really think that your son is better off without his father on his birthday?
Yeah, I do.
After that I got in my car and I drove... drove and drove, fast.
And when I finally ran out of gas it was after dark.
I wound up at this bar that Sean and Daniel had taken me to.
And I started to drink hard, looking at all the faggots prancing around.
I felt like knocking somebody's teeth down their fucking throat.
But nobody came near me.
They didn't even look at me.
It was kind of like they knew, like I had this invisible force field around me.
You said before that, um, when you started telling me about the party, that everything became clear that day.
What was it that became clear?
That I needed to go.
I needed to get back to the navy.
Discipline, order, "Yes, sir.
No, sir."
Knowing when to sleep, when to wake up, what to wear, what to eat, what to do.
To get out of my own head.
This is not for everyone, self-examination.
Some of us, we just need to live our lives, man.
Why do you think you went to that particular bar?
I don't know.
I wanted anyone to so much as breathe so I could beat the living hell out of them, that's why.
Mm.
But nobody did.
(Laughs)
No.
Could it be, Alex, that you were there for exactly the opposite reason?
Cos no one would question you or ask you to be anything other than yourself?
These issues with your father, with your own identity, with what you really want for yourself, these things, they have to be looked at.
Don't you think it would be better to deal with them here on the ground than have them follow you 20,000 feet into the air?
Wait, are you actually expressing an opinion here?
Are you telling me not to fly?
I can't answer that.
It makes me feel like you're asking me to share responsibility for another major decision in your life.
You know, go back to Baghdad, leave Michaela.
I think we're way past that.
I'm not asking you to decide, Paul.
I can decide.
I have decided.
No, I'm asking you man to man...
Tell me, what would you do if you were me?
(Sighs)
Alex, if I was you, I would stay in therapy.
I would continue to deal with the complex issues that we've been talking about, not sweep them under the carpet like you've been doing in your life.
I can tell you one thing... they will creep up on you again.
But you won't tell me not to fly.
You know, you're wrong.
I don't make mistakes.
When I'm up in the sky, that's when I'm in control.
You don't get it yet.
I am... the best.
Now, Paul, listen to me.
Paul.
Don't fuck me up with this navy shrink.
Please.
Don't take my world away from me.
Well...
I think we're done.
What is it, Doc?
Here's my, uh... my cellphone.
I want you to call me any time, day or night, if you need to talk about anything, OK?
I just had a thought.
Soon I'm going to be flying over the armpit of the fucking world and I'll be thinking about you and your... and your chair.
(Laughs)
You know, Alex,
I just wanted to say that
I think you've done great work here.
Brave.
Really.
I want us to continue that.
OK?
- Goodbye, Doc.
- Take care, Alex.
English SDH
Previously on "In Treatment"...
- Yeah, I don't think I can do this.
- Do what?
This therapy, I...
I just don't think it's leading anywhere, that's all, I, it's...
Where do you want it to lead, Alex?
Someplace where I feel less shitty about myself.
You know, I got a call from my wing commander, he's -- trying to figure out if I'm ready... for active duty.
What do you think?
No, I don't think you're ready.
Well, I feel like I should salute you.
At ease, doc.
This is gonna be my last time... for a while anyway.
I'm here to settle up.
And I need something from you.
Would you like some coffee?
Sure.
S01E32:
Alex, Week Seven
I know I'm not giving you any notice.
You want me to pay
- for the next session, too?
- No, no that's, uh, that's fine.
Sorry the gravy train is ending here, doc.
That's okay.
So, why are you leaving?
I got you curious, huh?
Remember I told you my squadron commander called me?
Well, last week they finally brought me in.
Now, I thought they wanted to ease me back in, but no.
They need me to train the next wave of pilots for their deployment, get them ready to fly ASAP.
Always playing catch-up in this war.
- So what did you say to them?
- I said, "Fuck you!
I'm 39 years old, in the prime of my life, and one of the most decorated fighter pilots in the Navy.
No, no, you're not gonna put me out to pasture, no, not in the middle of a war.
Get yourself another boy."
- That's what you said to them?
- Well, not really, but, but I thought it.
Actually, what I said was,
"Yes, sir.
However I can be of service to you, sir", and, uh...
I reported for duty the next day.
You think I'm crazy?
I can only get away with that bullshit with you.
Well, at least we know why you come here.
So what's it like, being back at base?
It's been a real trip, I mean... most of these guys are right out of TOPGUN, cocky as hell.
When they look in my eyes, they know I've been places they couldn't conjure up in their worst nightmares.
Makes them think twice before fucking with me.
So, training young pilots, is that... is that something you can see yourself doing?
I don't know, maybe in a... another context.
But this is set up to fail.
There's no way these kids are gonna be ready for combat missions in a month.
I mean, it's crazy.
Look, I'm taking them through tactical situations.
Some of them are doing better than others, but when you're up in the air, it's read and react.
Read-react, like a machine, no thinking.
It's, it's like split-second decisions that can cost thousands of lives, including their own.
Most of these kids, they look at me on the simulators, and they're like, "Whoa!"
Well, they're blown away.
That must feel really great.
I overheard a couple of these kids talking shit about me... saying that I -
- I might be good on the simulators but they'd kick my ass on the obstacle course.
Called me old man and all that bullshit.
Well, hey...
I called their bluff.
Check this out:
now, the drill is called "the gauntlet".
It's a five-mile run through dense woods and sand traps, and, uh, rope-and-barrier hurdles, balance beams, and a maze.
Now after all that, ha-haa... there's the, uh... helo-dunker.
Now, the helo-dunker is like this giant -- looks, it looks like a beer can.
It's basically a crash simulator.
And we hit the water, hard, upside down, strapped in tight.
And we have to get out... with almost no oxygen.
We're in full gear: helmet, spacesuit,
G-suit, gloves, the whole nine yards.
Now, there are four immersions.
The last two, the water's dark.
It's like a, like a night landing.
And a lot of these kids, they get disoriented and start flipping the fuck out.
So... we have to rescue them.
It's, it's tough.
It separates the men from the boys, let me tell you.
So, doc... how do you think I did?
Do I really have to guess, Alex?
Touché.
I never panic.
I'm at home down there, in the dark, swimming for my life.
And not only did I beat all their asses,
I came within two seconds of a base record.
Not bad for a broken-down old pilot, huh?
Huh?
Come on, Paul.
Okay, so, my squadron commander calls me back up to his office.
This time, all the brass were there, and they want to know if I'm interested in going back to active duty.
If I am, I have to go through a modified basic training at Pensacola, a battery of tests -- physical, psychological -- just to make sure I've recovered.
So I said,
"Bring it on, baby!
I'm ready for anything!"
Are you surprised?
Well, a little, I guess.
I, uh...
I shouldn't be, but I suppose it was always a possibility.
But you think, it's too fast, right?
Do you think, it's too fast?
Doc... you have no idea how good it feels to be useful again.
I mean, to tell you the truth, I think, that's been the real problem.
I mean, sitting around, feeling sorry for myself.
I'm a doer, not a talker, so all, all of this, it's, that's over.
Those days are over.
So, here's what I need from you:
You're gonna get a call from one of your compatriots.
He's a Navy doctor named Connell.
He's gonna be checking up on me.
You told the Navy you were seeing me?
I thought that was professional suicide.

So I told them I'd been doing some counseling with you... you know, my marriage...
and that I was fit as a fiddle.
- Do you feel fit as a fiddle?
- Paul, don't fuck with me on this.
You're talking about my career now.
Just tell him all good things.
Plus, the Navy needs me.
You think they can afford to have someone like me just pissing around?
Just tell him I'm ready.
Well, let's just talk about whether you are ready or not.
Look, hey, cut the crap!
I need this.
You're putting me in a very difficult position, Alex.
We talked about a lot more than Michaela.
You don't expect me to lie, do you?
Okay, physically, I'm fine.

I'm asking you to tell me what you feel.
And I'm telling you, it doesn't matter.
Let me just see who this is.
Sorry.
It went fine.
Yeah, yeah, they did ask me.
No...
No, I can't talk about that right now.
Can I call you back?
Michaela, let me go, all right?
I'm with somebody right now.
Yeah, I will.
Yeah.
Bye.
Sorry.
She wanted to know how the meeting with the brass went.
You know, she's totally obsessed with me flying again.
You know that.
Why do you think she's so anxious for you to fly again?
Well, my little sabbatical upset her sense of order.

'Cause I just came by --
We've got plenty of time.
I think, this is something important that we need to talk about, especially, if you are trying to push me for an assessment.
It's hot as hell in here.
We had a party, for my son, a birthday party.

He doesn't seem to need friends.

I supported that.
I didn't want to force him to be anything he isn't.
So, all the uncles and aunts came and the cousins, and everybody was in a good mood.
My dad, he got there early.
He's establishing and setting up everything and acting like he owns the place, ordering my wife around.
I could tell, he had been there a lot -- since I left.
And the bitch he married, she was there, too, in the kitchen cooking, as if my mother never existed.
It made me feel like -- shit, like a... a stranger in my own home.
My father sees me and he gives me one of those cold smiles, and...
"Alex... nice of you to make it."
I could tell he had... a wild hair up his ass about something.
But, you know what?
I didn't ask.
'Cause when he wants to share, he shares, and then he's all over me, and then, you know, I'm in no rush to get there.
But he is great with Roy, though, they, they connect.
Somehow it's easy for them.
Did you feel like you weren't connecting with Roy?
I don't know, there were a lot of people there, we didn't have much time alone.
Have you seen a lot of him since you left home?
Once, twice.
I, I don't know what you consider "a lot".
Did he ever ask why you weren't living at home anymore?
Yeah.
I told him that his dad was on a special mission.
I mean, I'm gone half the time.
He's used to it.
To tell you the truth...
I think it's been a relief for him.

How do you mean?
Well, that you might be doing better yourself, spreading your wings, too, if he wasn't there, if he wasn't... in your way, so to speak.
No, doc.
My being there didn't make the kid happy that day.
Just the opposite... in fact.
How?
What happened?
I told you, Roy was obsessed with chess, right?
I got him this magnificent set, it was -- all ivory, imported from Nairobi, just a real work of art.

god knows what with god knows who like a fucking teenager.
He says, "You know, you disappoint me, boy.
I raised you to be stronger than that.

Who turned me into a...

You know I've been paying you cash, 'cause I was trying to avoid a paper trail.
But -- that means I've been withdrawing...
from ATMs all the time.
Michaela looks at the bank statements and she saw that there wasn't money there, and she wanted to know where it was going.
Anyway, look, I told her, I've been consulting with someone about my thoughts...
And that was the word, "thoughts"... my "thoughts" about me and her.
And did you get into that, your thoughts about, uh...
about the two of you?
No, she shut down.
So, anyway, anyway, listen.
My father... yeah, my father, he's giving me this whole earful, he goes downstairs, and -- man...
I felt like I had been hit by a freight train.
I locked myself in the bathroom and I sat there... so I could just, just catch my breath.
And when I finally got my shit together I went back downstairs, and... and everybody was around the chessboard again, watching another match, including Michaela.
And...
You know what it was?
It was my father... and my son, and they are locked in this epic battle, matching each other move for move, totally out of my league.
And everyone's oohing and ahhing and...
They didn't even notice... that I was there.
What was it about Roy that broke your heart when you were watching him in his room?
Uhh...
He seemed so... vulnerable, somehow.
Vulnerable to what?
I don't know, really, um...
Everything...
Forces, expectations... stuff coming at him that -- he can't control,
I can't control.
So, I slipped out of the house, without anyone knowing.
It was for the better.
For whom?
For my boy.
Do you really think that your son is better off without his father on his birthday?
Yeah, I do.
After that, I got in my car, and I drove... drove and drove, fast.
And when I finally ran out of gas, it was after dark.
I wound up at this bar that Sean and Daniel had taken me to.
And I started to drink -- hard, looking at all the faggots prancing around.
I felt like knocking somebody's teeth down their fucking throat.
But nobody came near me, they -- didn't even look at me.
It was kind of like they knew like I had this invisible force field around me.
You said before that, um, when you started telling me about the party, that everything became clear that day.
What, what was it that became clear?
That I needed to go.
I needed to get back to the Navy... discipline, order, "Yes, sir, no, sir", knowing when to go to sleep, when to wake up, what to wear, what to eat, what to do,
I, to get out of my own head.
This is not for everyone, you know, this self-examination.
Some of us... we just need to live our lives, man.
Why do you think you went to that particular bar?
I don't know.
I wanted anyone so much as breathe so I could beat the living hell out of them, that's why.
But nobody did.
No.
Could it be, Alex, that you were there for exactly the opposite reason?
'Cause no one would question you or ask you to be anything other than yourself?
You see, these issues with your father, with your own identity, with what you really want for yourself... these things... they have to be looked at.
Don't you think it would be better to deal with them here on the ground than have them follow you 20,000 feet into the air?
Wait, wait, wait.
Are you actually expressing an opinion here?
Are you telling me not to fly?
I can't answer that.
I-I-It makes me feel like y-y-you're asking me to share responsibility for another major decision in your life, you know, go back to Baghdad, leave Michaela.
I think, we're way past that.
I'm not asking you to decide, Paul.
I can decide.
I have decided.
No, I'm asking you -- man to man...
Tell me, what would you do... if you were me?
Alex, if I was you...
I would stay in therapy.
I would continue to deal with the complex, difficult issues that we've been talking about, not sweep them under the carpet like you've been doing in your life.
I can tell you one thing:
They will creep up on you again.
But you won't tell me not to fly.
You know, you're wrong.
I don't make mistakes.
When I'm up in the sky, that's when I'm in control.
You don't get it yet.
I am -- the best.
Now, Paul, listen to me.
Paul...
Don't fuck me up with this Navy shrink.
Please.
Don't take my world away from me.
Well...
I think we're done.
What is it, doc?
Here's my, uh, my cell phone.
I want you to call me anytime, day or night... if you need to talk about anything.
Okay?
I just had a thought.
Soon I'm going to be flying over the armpit of the fucking world... and I'll be thinking about you... in your... in your chair.
You know, Alex,
I just wanted to say that...
I think, you've done great work here... brave... really.
I want us to continue that.
Okay?
- Bye, doc.
- Take care, Alex.
They're all taking a huge hit as the full impact of this economic recession makes itself felt.
Pension plans have shriveled by 20% or more.
Overseas, problems continue to mount.
Just last weekend, senator Bob Eastman of Montana returned from a visit to Baghdad with a withering critique of president Bush's policy in Iraq.
You can't just flex your muscles and call it a day.
A foreign policy based on brute force is doomed to failure.
Not in my neighborhood, it ain't.
We can't just round up all the Sunnis and Shiites and proclaim,
- "now you just get along, fellas".
- Wanna bet?
We have to be sensitive to their history.
Americans are gonna have to realize the limits of their power.
That'll be the day we roll over and die.
In other news today...
How's the noggin?
- What do you want?
- Your happiness.
That is my abiding concern.
And I fear for your happiness when I hear the rumors.
What rumors?
The rumors about your pal Colin and your lady friend Kath.
You gonna arrest me, Mr. Policeman, or what?
Answer me this...
Where's Colin right now?
Lookin' for the meanin' of life in...
East Providence.
East Providence?
Really?
- Really.
- What about Kath?
She's with him in East Providence, cleaning' out his ear with her tongue?
You scared me.
Sorry.
New cell phone.
Michael asked me to bring it over.
- And...
- Where is he?
Don't worry about Michael.
And I brought somethin' else for you too.
What is this?
Open it up.
Winter mint, they call it.
Go ahead, smell it.
Are you out of your mind?
What?
You can't give me this.
It's just a candle.
Girls buy themselves candles all the time.
If Michael sees this, and he looks me in the eye, he'll know.
He'll know what?
I'm sorry.
Know what though?
Look, I'm sorry.
It's really sweet.
It smells really good...
Colin, this has to...
This has to stop now.
You know that.
I mean it.
It's not okay.
It sucks, Kath.
Dr. Ross has just decided that the best thing for mom is to stay in bed until the baby is born.
- She's gonna stay in bed for a month?
- That's right.
- It's just a precaution.
- She can't get up to pee?
She can pee.
Is mom gonna die?
No, honey.
Mom's not gonna die.
Is the baby going to die?
- Are you off to work?
- If you don't need me.
How are the girls?
They're fine.
I explained there's nothing to be afraid of.
Did you get the building permit for the new house?
- I'll do it today.
- Don't forget.
I won't.
Look who's the lucky girl who doesn't get to go to work.
If that bed were a beach, you'd be in Bermuda.
Well, it's not a beach, and I wish I could go to work.
That is positively un-American.
You're in good hands.
Call me if you need me.
Stay in bed.
- Thanks, Jimmy.
- Sure, man.
So you spent several months and... tens of thousands of dollars investigating the men who hired you to lead the investigation?
Correct.
It's no wonder you've been avoiding me.
You're out of your mind!
Mr. Attorney general...
I was more concerned about putting you in a tough spot, sir.
Who is this... informant of yours?
I'm afraid that's gonna have to remain confidential.
This is not your mandate.
I'm pulling the plug on this.
I'm sending you back to murder police.
You can't do that.
Watch me.
I was hired by the Speaker of the House of the state of Rhode Island.
He gave me explicit reign to follow my leads wherever they take me.
I answer to him and not to you.
This was nothing but a courtesy.
And one last thought.
If any of this, any of it, gets out...
I will know that it came from someone in this room.
Good afternoon, representative Caffee.
I'm eating.
How come you're not sharin' the waterfront pie?
My cousin, Vinnie Constada, would love to win that water main contract, but he can't get anyone to see him.
Your brother Michael's gettin' plenty of action.
Why not Vinnie?
Michael's got nothin' to do with the waterfront project.
By the way, Vinnie is a very, very, very highly qualified contractor.
You should look the guy up.
He's got a web page and everything.
I can't help you.
The state police have an informant inside the waterfront project.
Your caution is very understandable.
But fair is fair.
Can I tell Vinnie to give you a call?
I said I can't help you.
What are you doin'?
- I thought I saw you in there.
- You're not followin' me?
Followin' you?
Why would I be followin' you?
That's what I'm askin' you.
- Why are you following me?
- I'm gettin' my meds.
What's the matter with you?
Why would you be so paranoid?
Where you goin'?
I'm goin' to pee.
Is that okay?
He's following me now.
Who?
Michael's following me.
- Where?
- Garden city.
- What should I do?
- Just hold on a minute.
Go and talk to him.
Maybe he just wants somethin'.
He's really startin' to freak me out now, OK?
Don't worry, Kath.
It's... because he loves you is all.
You know?
Be nice to him.
He's hardly gonna hurt ya in the middle of a shoppin' center, is he?
I thought we weren't supposed to talk.
We're not.
It's simple.
Greed rules.
Greed is everything.
It's every man for himself.
And that's what matters.
The rest of this all, it's bullshit.
Not everyone's a whack job like you.
- Mother Teresa, for example.
- Mother Teresa is an idiot.
She wasted her life on morons and cripples.
Mother Teresa...
Is Michael here?
He's not here, but we're expectin' him back any moment.
- I'll tell him you stopped by.
- I'm gonna wait.
We were discussin' Mother Teresa.
Moe thinks her life was a waste of time.
You're in the political game.
What do you think?
It's every man for himself.
Am I right?
Yeah, I think it's every man for himself.
Except some men are better than others.
We need to talk.
Alfonse Nozzoli paid me a visit today.
He leaned on me to get his cousin Vinnie a contract on the waterfront project.
He came to you?
He thinks I'm throwin' jobs and you're getting rich off the whole thing.
That fat fuck pushed you around.
I can't believe it.
And he also said the state police had an informant on the inside.
You know anything about that?
An informant?
No.
You think you could find out?
What's goin' on?
You're in trouble?
It'd help me if I knew.
I can look into it.
I'd appreciate it.
How's Eileen?
Can you imagine her lying around in bed all day?
Not really.
I got Jimmy on the job.
I think I should give him a medal.
- Is everything okay with Eileen then?
- I hope so.
Send her my best, will ya?
I will.
- Did you give Kath that new cell phone?
- Yeah, today.
- How'd she like it?
- She liked it fine.
Anything else?
- What do you mean?
- When you gave her the phone, did you chat?
Have a coffee?
Did you catch up on things?
What?
- We chatted for a bit, yeah.
- About what?
This and that.
And then?
Then I left.
Is everything all right?
Yeah.
Good.
Moving?
Moving where?
Caitlin's house in Cranston.
- Cranston?
- It's 10 minutes away, Rose.
- Colander?
- Goodwill.
Ten years ago, you told me... you'd rather be tortured by the Chinese than live in Cranston.
A girl can change her mind, can't she?
These are nice.
Bring 'em, sweetheart.
Listen, Maeve.
You can't just pack up and leave.
This is your whole life here.
You were born in this house.
I don't wanna grow old alone, Rose.
I wanna be with my family.
- Freedom trail spoon?
- Goodwill.
Are you out of your mind?
It's the freedom trail spoon.
We bought this spoon together.
I have one just like it, remember?
How dare you... want to give it away to the goodwill?
Colin, sweetheart.
There's... something I've been meaning to discuss.
What is it?
I want you... to have this house.
- Me?
- Yes.
This house?
Why?
So you'd have a place of your own.
A place to call home.
Space to start a family.
I only need the one small room.
And, of course, I won't get in your way.
But I can help you with the cleaning and the cooking.
Thanks, auntie Rose.
But I can't accept.
You see...
I may be leaving Rhode Island.
Leaving?
Why?
I'd like to travel, and I'd like to explore the country more.
I've always had a hankerin' to see Mount Rushmore.
Right.
Mount Rushmore.
But thanks.
I appreciate it.
I better hit the sack.
I'll see you in the mornin', all right?
- Yes?
- Don't forget the parchment paper.
- The parchment paper?
For what?
- So the cookies don't stick.
On the...
- Did you call Mrs. Barboza?
- No, I didn't.
I'm sorry.
Who's gonna pick up the girls after volleyball practice?
I'll call her right now.
What in the name of God are you doing, Jimmy?
Have you seen the mess he's made out there?
There's flour everywhere.
You don't even wanna know what's in the sink.
Sit there and try and stay out of trouble.
- I'm sorry.
I'm baking...
- Sit!
Give me that.
It's important that you relax.
I will take care of everything.
What are we having for dinner tonight?
Tuna casserole.
The girls love my tuna casserole.
He don't wanna talk to you.
Nozzoli.
What the fuck you think you're doin'?
If you got business with me, then you fuckin' sort it out with me.
Not with my family.
You understand?
My brother is off-limits!
I think that whack in the head caused permanent damage.
He's fine, don't worry.
He's eatin' bennies.
He was washin' 'em down this mornin' with coffee.
That shit'll burn your brain out quick.
- It's just his medication.
- Bullshit.
They were bennies.
You get in there and you tell that fat Guinea fuckin' prick... that I'm not makin' a dime off the waterfront, that he's to lay off my brother, or I will fuckin' come for him.
- You understand?
- You sure you wanna do this?
Get in there.
Define loyalty.
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.
What does loyalty mean to you?
I've always got your back, Michael.
You know that.
You have to stop the suspicion everybody's out to get you.
I'm not out to get you.
Define... loyalty.
Be true to the cause, or die.
What did he say?
What did he fuckin' say?
You're a lying cocksucker.
He knows you are making a bundle off the waterfront.
He also said he'll talk to whoever he wants to talk to, which is me, not you.
Anything else?
If you don't cut him into the waterfront jobs, he's gonna send Bill Vitelloni over to your house to break your neck.
Hey, Decco, you got a minute?
- I'm headin' down to my office.
- Let's just walk and talk.
How's the investigation going?
- It's goin'.
- Any new leads?
- You said you'd leave me alone on this.
- Well, now I want a report.
Well, when I have somethin' to report, I'll find you.
- I heard a rumor.
- What sort of a rumor?
That you've got an informant.
- Wouldn't that be convenient?
- Yes, it would.
Is it true?
No, I don't have an informant.
No informant?
What did I just say?
I don't have an informant.
Keep me posted.
And give my best to Cass.
Sorry.
Old habits die hard.
Yeah, they sure do.
Tommy knows we have an informant.
Does he know who it is?
What difference does it make?
If he know that it's Bob Meara, we are fucked.
But even if he doesn't know who it is, he's not gonna trust anybody, including Bob Meara, so we're fucked.
We're fucked either way!
Thank you so much, state police!
Thank you so fuckin' much, Attorney General!
So what do we do now?
We turn it on 'em.
We rattle Kilpatrick's cage.
Get your coat.
It's a question of quality.
Can providence have a first-rate living city experience?
My answer is yes, it can, if it attracts the right kind of people.
- This is the future, here...
- Mr. Kilpatrick.
- In Providence, Rhode Island.
- I have with me a search warrant authorizing me to seize...
You mind sittin' down?
All financial records, correspondence, e-mails, everything related directly and indirectly to the waterfront
- project.
- Who the fuck are you?
I'm detective Giggs with the Rhode Island state police.
This here's my partner, detective Gillardino.
Excuse me.
Am I being charged with something?
Not yet.
Just give us a couple of days.
We'll have to cross-check the information with the information that was given to us by our informant.
You don't have an informant.
Right.
No, I don't have an informant.
Right?
We were bluffing.
Don't forget the hard drives.
Do you need a hand?
Can you hold Brian for a sec?
I apologize in advance if he drools.
God.
Never let it be said that having a baby doesn't change your life.
I'm so sleep-deprived.
I fell asleep the other day washing the dishes.
And the sex, forget it.
I told Mark he can just go get himself a mistress.
Poor guy.
What I wouldn't give... to just stay in bed late one Sunday, you know?
Readin' the paper... drinkin' coffee.
It's okay.
Thanks.
Come here, you little munchkin.
Are the girls doin' their homework?
It's quiet as a library up there.
- I just felt somethin'.
- Of course you did.
The baby's kicking.
- No.
Somethin' different.
- What kind of thing?
A twinge.
Did it hurt?
Call the doctor.
- Don't call the doctor.
- Jimmy, call the doctor right now.
I just need to get up.
I need to move.
I just need to walk.
Rose, stop it.
I just need to move around, that's all.
Now Dr. Ross said you were to stay in bed.
- Where is everyone?
- In here, honey.
What's wrong?
- She felt a twinge.
- What kind?
I'm fine.
I just need a second.
- Call the doctor, immediately.
- Do not call Dr. Ross!
Here, relax.
I'll fluff your pillows.
Cleopatra's barge.
Nice, right?
Do you wanna give me a hand?
I am calling the doctor right now.
I know you're trying to help, but you're makin' it worse.
You're drivin' me crazy, so just stop it.
No doctor?
No doctor.
Fine.
Whatever you say.
Undies go top drawer left.
Really?
I find it much more convenient to have them top drawer right.
Assuming you're right-handed, which you are, you can just reach right in.
I prefer them top drawer left.
Well, you'll get used to it, and then you'll thank me.
You'll see.
You're fired.
Excuse me?
You are fired.
Please leave my house.
I don't want your help.
Jimmy... can take care of me.
Don't be crazy.
You need me, Eileen.
You need an experienced hand...
Get the fuck out of my house!
I swear to God, she gets more irrational every day.
Yet she gets treated as if having a baby should win her the Nobel Prize.
You don't understand the pressures of motherhood.
Good night.
Stay until Tommy gets back and make sure those girls go to bed.
Keep an eye on Mary-Rose.
She's not to be trusted.
- Kilpatrick talks, we're fucked.
- He's not gonna talk.
Why didn't we have any advance warning?
How come I had to hear about the search warrant of Kilpatrick's records from a reporter?
- Even the C.I.A. has its bad days.
- I thought you had a friendly.
I thought you could control him.
What happened?
I don't know.
Detective Declan Giggs is here.
Send him in.
Thanks for the heads-up, Decco.
I really didn't have a choice.
If word about all this got out, then I have to give up my element of surprise.
I needed to go in there and get Kilpatrick before he had a chance to destroy his records, which I succeeded in doing, you should know.
Did you find anything?
I'm never surprised by the amount of incriminating evidence that people keep on their computers.
Inappropriate love letters... porn sites, sqrrelly business practices.
All sorts of stuff.
But we're... very carefully going over all those records, and,
I think I can say without... without getting into specifics, because it's too early... for that.
I need to double check up on a couple of these things, but I think
I can say we've really found some very nice golden nuggets.
What about Kilpatrick?
Is he talking?
I'll start with him tomorrow.
I'm gonna give him a restless night to ponder his future.
It's really amazing how fear can loosen the tongue.
You should be proud.
This investigation of yours has finally got some teeth.
Jesus...
Speaker!
Call an ambulance!
Come here.
Rescue 94, on-scene.
Transferring Speaker.
20th and Statehouse.
Copy that.
Nice job.
This is not my fault.
You really... hung me out to dry over this one, haven't you?
You were hired because I thought you had my back.
I thought 30 years of friendship meant somethin'.
You never said that.
I didn't think I had to.
You can't trust Nozzoli.
He's convinced you got action in the waterfront.
Who knows what this crazy Guinea's gonna do?
You gotta hit him fast and hard before he decides to do us any harm.
Colin's right.
Let's burn his fuckin' house down.
I'm the one sayin' it, me.
We gotta hit him fast and hard.
Hello, morons of the world.
Nozzoli'd smack us like flies.
You couldn't kill enough of his guys to get ahead.
He's got more manpower, more firepower.
You wanna lose everything 'cause you're pissed off?
'Cause that's what would happen.
You can't beat him.
He's bigger, faster, smarter.
I can't give him jobs I don't have.
Talk to Tommy.
He's gotta help you out in this.
Tell him to give Nozzoli some of the jobs.
- I'm not gonna do it.
- You got no choice.
I want eyes on Nozzoli 24/7, starting' now.
You go with him.
The two of youse.
Keep him out of trouble.
Terry... go wipe the kitchen down.
Hit him fast and hard.
That's the best you can do?
One thing I learned growing up in Belfast was that... if you thought the other guy might be interested in hurting' ya... he was.
You must think...
I'm pretty stupid.
What are you talkin' about?
I'm not fuckin' stupid.
I see what's goin' on.
I like Regina's dress.
It's simple, it's elegant.
It's slutty.
The hem work is sloppy.
- I just wish I liked Barry more.
- Barry?
- Clearly he's the most talented.
- Come on.
He's a snob.
He's so sure of himself.
What's wrong?
Don had a heart attack.
We managed to get him to the hospital though.
Is he alive?
Barely.
The machines are doin' most of the work.
- You okay?
- Fine.
The baby's fine, thanks to Jimmy and Mary-Kate.
Your mother tried to help too, but that's another story.
I gotta get some sleep.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I hope the Speaker's okay.
Thanks, Jimmy.
I still think Regina's got the prettiest dress.
The girls asleep?
Sound asleep, I'm told.
Did you get the construction permit today?
No.
- You really don't wanna move, do you?
- Yeah, I do.
Believe me, I do.
No.
You're stalling', dragging' your feet.
Otherwise, you'd've gotten the permit.
Did you hear me?
My friend had a heart attack.
Be a man and admit you don't wanna live at the shore.
You don't have any idea what I'm doin'.
I'm dealin' with things, would destroy this family.
There won't be any house to build.
There won't be a house to live in.
Nothing.
I don't wanna lose this baby.
I'm sorry.
Come on.
I didn't wake the kids?
They'd sleep through a war.
Eileen okay?
Not really, no.
She's...
It's been a rough night.
You wanna sit down?
I just got a minute.
How's work?
Work's a firestorm.
What's up?
I couldn't find anything out about an informant.
I'm sorry.
I'll keep looking.
Let me know if you do, OK?
Absolutely.
It's good to see you.
I forget what you look like.
We never see each other anymore.
That's your choice.
- Look, Tommy...
- Mike, I gotta get back to Eileen.
Right.
You do your thing.
I'll see you.
As you know, I had a time problem.
I wanted to do a jacket with this...
I came by to see how you're doin'.
I seem to have a talent for getting fired.
Don't worry about it.
Let's be honest.
Eileen's a bitch.
It's hormonal.
I told you.
She can't help it.
Come here.
Come on.
I'm not gonna bite.
There's more to life than babies.
I'll never know what it's like.
We have each other, sweetheart.
We have each other.
I called the salon.
They said you'd be here.
You wanna... take a walk?
I just wanted to come and let you know that...
I'm finally taking down Tommy Caffee.
I mean "down" this time.
All I ever wanted from you was your approval.
You wanna know why?
Because you're right.
There is good.
There is bad.
It's not fucking gray.
It's black and it's white.
Most people, they don't want to admit it.
They don't wanna accept it, because it's too hard.
It's too difficult.
But...
Plus, I always thought if I got your approval, maybe I could get laid.
Best thing for me right now would... be for you to go.
Are you proud of me?
Very.
There you are.
I gotta leave early.
Help the wife pick up some crap for Lucy's birthday party.
Katie went ahead and hired a clown.
Half the neighborhood's gonna be there.
Lucy's so excited, she's pissin' her pants.
It's this Saturday.
You wanna come?
Free cake.
Thanks, though, but I...
I gotta work on the truck.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.
- Where are you?
- In the middle of the woods.
And it's creepy out here.
All kinds of noises and bugs.
Where exactly are you?
You take Squawtuckett off of 114.
Squawtuckett off 114.
Remember that.
Is he there...
Nozzoli?
He's fishin'.
- What?
- He's fishing.
- Some pudgy guy with him.
- What pudgy guy?
How should I know?
I'm comin'.
I'll be there soon.
- I'm gonna go make this good.
- That's a smart play.
'Cause we'll be annihilated, right?
Most likely.
Tommy gonna help you with this?
Deal Nozzoli in on the waterfront contracts?
He's my brother.
Of course he would if I asked him.
I'm not gonna.
I don't wanna drag him into this shit.
How you gonna convince Nozzoli you're not gettin' a piece of the action?
I'm not.
I'm gonna give him the cash equivalent of seven jobs.
From where?
I'm gonna give him all the action from Pawtucket.
- That's a lot of money.
- You have any better ideas?
If not, shut up.
Not easy, is it, my friend?
Running things.
You're my friend now?
If I had half a brain, I wouldn't be.
But, yeah,
I'm your friend.
Shit.
We never met.
Special agent Jarvis at your service.
Couldn't get over your lack of curiosity about Colin Carr and Kath Parry.
Then I realized, you're in denial.
I decided it was my painful job to... help you break through your denial.
Here.
A large whiskey, please.
The good stuff, Terry.
I watched this guy talk on Oprah... about how we need to reduce stress in our lives.
He suggested simple little things like... listenin' to nice music and... lighting' a candle on your desk.
This is the nearest I've to a desk.
Slainte.
Don't let that picture fuck you all up, all right?
They can do anything with photos nowadays.
Where is he?
Come on.
I told you, I don't wanna deal with him.
You deal with him.
- He's fuckin' unstable.
- Look, he's not right in the head, OK?
He doesn't know what he's doin'.
He insulted my generosity.
Fuck him.
Fuck his white trash Irish family.
You deal with him.
I'm not gonna talk to him.
He needs help.
What are you doin'?
They're all taking a huge hit as the full impact of this economic recession makes itself felt.
Pension plans have shriveled by 20% or more.
Overseas, problems continue to mount.
Just last weekend, senator Bob Eastman of Montana returned from a visit to Baghdad with a withering critique of president Bush's policy in Iraq.
You can't just flex your muscles and call it a day.
A foreign policy based on brute force is doomed to failure.
Not in my neighborhood, it ain't.
We can't just round up all the Sunnis and Shiites and proclaim,
- "now you just get along, fellas".
- Wanna bet?
We have to be sensitive to their history.
Americans are gonna have to realize the limits of their power.
That'll be the day we roll over and die.
In other news today...
How's the noggin?
- What do you want?
- Your happiness.
That is my abiding concern.
And I fear for your happiness when I hear the rumors.
What rumors?
The rumors about your pal Colin and your lady friend Kath.
You gonna arrest me, Mr. Policeman, or what?
Answer me this...
Where's Colin right now?
Lookin' for the meanin' of life in...
East Providence.
East Providence?
Really?
- Really.
- What about Kath?
She's with him in East Providence, cleaning' out his ear with her tongue?
You scared me.
Sorry.
New cell phone.
Michael asked me to bring it over.
- And...
- Where is he?
Don't worry about Michael.
And I brought somethin' else for you too.
What is this?
Open it up.
Winter mint, they call it.
Go ahead, smell it.
Are you out of your mind?
What?
You can't give me this.
It's just a candle.
Girls buy themselves candles all the time.
If Michael sees this, and he looks me in the eye, he'll know.
He'll know what?
I'm sorry.
Know what though?
Look, I'm sorry.
It's really sweet.
It smells really good...
Colin, this has to...
This has to stop now.
You know that.
I mean it.
It's not okay.
It sucks, Kath.
Dr. Ross has just decided that the best thing for mom is to stay in bed until the baby is born.
- She's gonna stay in bed for a month?
- That's right.
- It's just a precaution.
- She can't get up to pee?
She can pee.
Is mom gonna die?
No, honey.
Mom's not gonna die.
Is the baby going to die?
- Are you off to work?
- If you don't need me.
How are the girls?
They're fine.
I explained there's nothing to be afraid of.
Did you get the building permit for the new house?
- I'll do it today.
- Don't forget.
I won't.
Look who's the lucky girl who doesn't get to go to work.
If that bed were a beach, you'd be in Bermuda.
Well, it's not a beach, and I wish I could go to work.
That is positively un-American.
You're in good hands.
Call me if you need me.
Stay in bed.
- Thanks, Jimmy.
- Sure, man.
So you spent several months and... tens of thousands of dollars investigating the men who hired you to lead the investigation?
Correct.
It's no wonder you've been avoiding me.
You're out of your mind!
Mr. Attorney general...
I was more concerned about putting you in a tough spot, sir.
Who is this... informant of yours?
I'm afraid that's gonna have to remain confidential.
This is not your mandate.
I'm pulling the plug on this.
I'm sending you back to murder police.
You can't do that.
Watch me.
I was hired by the Speaker of the House of the state of Rhode Island.
He gave me explicit reign to follow my leads wherever they take me.
I answer to him and not to you.
This was nothing but a courtesy.
And one last thought.
If any of this, any of it, gets out...
I will know that it came from someone in this room.
Good afternoon, representative Caffee.
I'm eating.
How come you're not sharin' the waterfront pie?
My cousin, Vinnie Constada, would love to win that water main contract, but he can't get anyone to see him.
Your brother Michael's gettin' plenty of action.
Why not Vinnie?
Michael's got nothin' to do with the waterfront project.
By the way, Vinnie is a very, very, very highly qualified contractor.
You should look the guy up.
He's got a web page and everything.
I can't help you.
The state police have an informant inside the waterfront project.
Your caution is very understandable.
But fair is fair.
Can I tell Vinnie to give you a call?
I said I can't help you.
What are you doin'?
- I thought I saw you in there.
- You're not followin' me?
Followin' you?
Why would I be followin' you?
That's what I'm askin' you.
- Why are you following me?
- I'm gettin' my meds.
What's the matter with you?
Why would you be so paranoid?
Where you goin'?
I'm goin' to pee.
Is that okay?
He's following me now.
Who?
Michael's following me.
- Where?
- Garden city.
- What should I do?
- Just hold on a minute.
Go and talk to him.
Maybe he just wants somethin'.
He's really startin' to freak me out now, OK?
Don't worry, Kath.
It's... because he loves you is all.
You know?
Be nice to him.
He's hardly gonna hurt ya in the middle of a shoppin' center, is he?
I thought we weren't supposed to talk.
We're not.
It's simple.
Greed rules.
Greed is everything.
It's every man for himself.
And that's what matters.
The rest of this all, it's bullshit.
Not everyone's a whack job like you.
- Mother Teresa, for example.
- Mother Teresa is an idiot.
She wasted her life on morons and cripples.
Mother Teresa...
Is Michael here?
He's not here, but we're expectin' him back any moment.
- I'll tell him you stopped by.
- I'm gonna wait.
We were discussin' Mother Teresa.
Moe thinks her life was a waste of time.
You're in the political game.
What do you think?
It's every man for himself.
Am I right?
Yeah, I think it's every man for himself.
Except some men are better than others.
We need to talk.
Alfonse Nozzoli paid me a visit today.
He leaned on me to get his cousin Vinnie a contract on the waterfront project.
He came to you?
He thinks I'm throwin' jobs and you're getting rich off the whole thing.
That fat fuck pushed you around.
I can't believe it.
And he also said the state police had an informant on the inside.
You know anything about that?
An informant?
No.
You think you could find out?
What's goin' on?
You're in trouble?
It'd help me if I knew.
I can look into it.
I'd appreciate it.
How's Eileen?
Can you imagine her lying around in bed all day?
Not really.
I got Jimmy on the job.
I think I should give him a medal.
- Is everything okay with Eileen then?
- I hope so.
Send her my best, will ya?
I will.
- Did you give Kath that new cell phone?
- Yeah, today.
- How'd she like it?
- She liked it fine.
Anything else?
- What do you mean?
- When you gave her the phone, did you chat?
Have a coffee?
Did you catch up on things?
What?
- We chatted for a bit, yeah.
- About what?
This and that.
And then?
Then I left.
Is everything all right?
Yeah.
Good.
Moving?
Moving where?
Caitlin's house in Cranston.
- Cranston?
- It's 10 minutes away, Rose.
- Colander?
- Goodwill.
Ten years ago, you told me... you'd rather be tortured by the Chinese than live in Cranston.
A girl can change her mind, can't she?
These are nice.
Bring 'em, sweetheart.
Listen, Maeve.
You can't just pack up and leave.
This is your whole life here.
You were born in this house.
I don't wanna grow old alone, Rose.
I wanna be with my family.
- Freedom trail spoon?
- Goodwill.
Are you out of your mind?
It's the freedom trail spoon.
We bought this spoon together.
I have one just like it, remember?
How dare you... want to give it away to the goodwill?
Colin, sweetheart.
There's... something I've been meaning to discuss.
What is it?
I want you... to have this house.
- Me?
- Yes.
This house?
Why?
So you'd have a place of your own.
A place to call home.
Space to start a family.
I only need the one small room.
And, of course, I won't get in your way.
But I can help you with the cleaning and the cooking.
Thanks, auntie Rose.
But I can't accept.
You see...
I may be leaving Rhode Island.
Leaving?
Why?
I'd like to travel, and I'd like to explore the country more.
I've always had a hankerin' to see Mount Rushmore.
Right.
Mount Rushmore.
But thanks.
I appreciate it.
I better hit the sack.
I'll see you in the mornin', all right?
- Yes?
- Don't forget the parchment paper.
- The parchment paper?
For what?
- So the cookies don't stick.
On the...
- Did you call Mrs. Barboza?
- No, I didn't.
I'm sorry.
Who's gonna pick up the girls after volleyball practice?
I'll call her right now.
What in the name of God are you doing, Jimmy?
Have you seen the mess he's made out there?
There's flour everywhere.
You don't even wanna know what's in the sink.
Sit there and try and stay out of trouble.
- I'm sorry.
I'm baking...
- Sit!
Give me that.
It's important that you relax.
I will take care of everything.
What are we having for dinner tonight?
Tuna casserole.
The girls love my tuna casserole.
He don't wanna talk to you.
Nozzoli.
What the fuck you think you're doin'?
If you got business with me, then you fuckin' sort it out with me.
Not with my family.
You understand?
My brother is off-limits!
I think that whack in the head caused permanent damage.
He's fine, don't worry.
He's eatin' bennies.
He was washin' 'em down this mornin' with coffee.
That shit'll burn your brain out quick.
- It's just his medication.
- Bullshit.
They were bennies.
You get in there and you tell that fat Guinea fuckin' prick... that I'm not makin' a dime off the waterfront, that he's to lay off my brother, or I will fuckin' come for him.
- You understand?
- You sure you wanna do this?
Get in there.
Define loyalty.
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.
What does loyalty mean to you?
I've always got your back, Michael.
You know that.
You have to stop the suspicion everybody's out to get you.
I'm not out to get you.
Define... loyalty.
Be true to the cause, or die.
What did he say?
What did he fuckin' say?
You're a lying cocksucker.
He knows you are making a bundle off the waterfront.
He also said he'll talk to whoever he wants to talk to, which is me, not you.
Anything else?
If you don't cut him into the waterfront jobs, he's gonna send Bill Vitelloni over to your house to break your neck.
Hey, Decco, you got a minute?
- I'm headin' down to my office.
- Let's just walk and talk.
How's the investigation going?
- It's goin'.
- Any new leads?
- You said you'd leave me alone on this.
- Well, now I want a report.
Well, when I have somethin' to report, I'll find you.
- I heard a rumor.
- What sort of a rumor?
That you've got an informant.
- Wouldn't that be convenient?
- Yes, it would.
Is it true?
No, I don't have an informant.
No informant?
What did I just say?
I don't have an informant.
Keep me posted.
And give my best to Cass.
Sorry.
Old habits die hard.
Yeah, they sure do.
Tommy knows we have an informant.
Does he know who it is?
What difference does it make?
If he know that it's Bob Meara, we are fucked.
But even if he doesn't know who it is, he's not gonna trust anybody, including Bob Meara, so we're fucked.
We're fucked either way!
Thank you so much, state police!
Thank you so fuckin' much, Attorney General!
So what do we do now?
We turn it on 'em.
We rattle Kilpatrick's cage.
Get your coat.
It's a question of quality.
Can providence have a first-rate living city experience?
My answer is yes, it can, if it attracts the right kind of people.
- This is the future, here...
- Mr. Kilpatrick.
- In Providence, Rhode Island.
- I have with me a search warrant authorizing me to seize...
You mind sittin' down?
All financial records, correspondence, e-mails, everything related directly and indirectly to the waterfront
- project.
- Who the fuck are you?
I'm detective Giggs with the Rhode Island state police.
This here's my partner, detective Gillardino.
Excuse me.
Am I being charged with something?
Not yet.
Just give us a couple of days.
We'll have to cross-check the information with the information that was given to us by our informant.
You don't have an informant.
Right.
No, I don't have an informant.
Right?
We were bluffing.
Don't forget the hard drives.
Do you need a hand?
Can you hold Brian for a sec?
I apologize in advance if he drools.
God.
Never let it be said that having a baby doesn't change your life.
I'm so sleep-deprived.
I fell asleep the other day washing the dishes.
And the sex, forget it.
I told Mark he can just go get himself a mistress.
Poor guy.
What I wouldn't give... to just stay in bed late one Sunday, you know?
Readin' the paper... drinkin' coffee.
It's okay.
Thanks.
Come here, you little munchkin.
Are the girls doin' their homework?
It's quiet as a library up there.
- I just felt somethin'.
- Of course you did.
The baby's kicking.
- No.
Somethin' different.
- What kind of thing?
A twinge.
Did it hurt?
Call the doctor.
- Don't call the doctor.
- Jimmy, call the doctor right now.
I just need to get up.
I need to move.
I just need to walk.
Rose, stop it.
I just need to move around, that's all.
Now Dr. Ross said you were to stay in bed.
- Where is everyone?
- In here, honey.
What's wrong?
- She felt a twinge.
- What kind?
I'm fine.
I just need a second.
- Call the doctor, immediately.
- Do not call Dr. Ross!
Here, relax.
I'll fluff your pillows.
Cleopatra's barge.
Nice, right?
Do you wanna give me a hand?
I am calling the doctor right now.
I know you're trying to help, but you're makin' it worse.
You're drivin' me crazy, so just stop it.
No doctor?
No doctor.
Fine.
Whatever you say.
Undies go top drawer left.
Really?
I find it much more convenient to have them top drawer right.
Assuming you're right-handed, which you are, you can just reach right in.
I prefer them top drawer left.
Well, you'll get used to it, and then you'll thank me.
You'll see.
You're fired.
Excuse me?
You are fired.
Please leave my house.
I don't want your help.
Jimmy... can take care of me.
Don't be crazy.
You need me, Eileen.
You need an experienced hand...
Get the fuck out of my house!
I swear to God, she gets more irrational every day.
Yet she gets treated as if having a baby should win her the Nobel Prize.
You don't understand the pressures of motherhood.
Good night.
Stay until Tommy gets back and make sure those girls go to bed.
Keep an eye on Mary-Rose.
She's not to be trusted.
- Kilpatrick talks, we're fucked.
- He's not gonna talk.
Why didn't we have any advance warning?
How come I had to hear about the search warrant of Kilpatrick's records from a reporter?
- Even the C.I.A. has its bad days.
- I thought you had a friendly.
I thought you could control him.
What happened?
I don't know.
Detective Declan Giggs is here.
Send him in.
Thanks for the heads-up, Decco.
I really didn't have a choice.
If word about all this got out, then I have to give up my element of surprise.
I needed to go in there and get Kilpatrick before he had a chance to destroy his records, which I succeeded in doing, you should know.
Did you find anything?
I'm never surprised by the amount of incriminating evidence that people keep on their computers.
Inappropriate love letters... porn sites, sqrrelly business practices.
All sorts of stuff.
But we're... very carefully going over all those records, and,
I think I can say without... without getting into specifics, because it's too early... for that.
I need to double check up on a couple of these things, but I think
I can say we've really found some very nice golden nuggets.
What about Kilpatrick?
Is he talking?
I'll start with him tomorrow.
I'm gonna give him a restless night to ponder his future.
It's really amazing how fear can loosen the tongue.
You should be proud.
This investigation of yours has finally got some teeth.
Jesus...
Speaker!
Call an ambulance!
Come here.
Rescue 94, on-scene.
Transferring Speaker.
20th and Statehouse.
Copy that.
Nice job.
This is not my fault.
You really... hung me out to dry over this one, haven't you?
You were hired because I thought you had my back.
I thought 30 years of friendship meant somethin'.
You never said that.
I didn't think I had to.
You can't trust Nozzoli.
He's convinced you got action in the waterfront.
Who knows what this crazy Guinea's gonna do?
You gotta hit him fast and hard before he decides to do us any harm.
Colin's right.
Let's burn his fuckin' house down.
I'm the one sayin' it, me.
We gotta hit him fast and hard.
Hello, morons of the world.
Nozzoli'd smack us like flies.
You couldn't kill enough of his guys to get ahead.
He's got more manpower, more firepower.
You wanna lose everything 'cause you're pissed off?
'Cause that's what would happen.
You can't beat him.
He's bigger, faster, smarter.
I can't give him jobs I don't have.
Talk to Tommy.
He's gotta help you out in this.
Tell him to give Nozzoli some of the jobs.
- I'm not gonna do it.
- You got no choice.
I want eyes on Nozzoli 24/7, starting' now.
You go with him.
The two of youse.
Keep him out of trouble.
Terry... go wipe the kitchen down.
Hit him fast and hard.
That's the best you can do?
One thing I learned growing up in Belfast was that... if you thought the other guy might be interested in hurting' ya... he was.
You must think...
I'm pretty stupid.
What are you talkin' about?
I'm not fuckin' stupid.
I see what's goin' on.
I like Regina's dress.
It's simple, it's elegant.
It's slutty.
The hem work is sloppy.
- I just wish I liked Barry more.
- Barry?
- Clearly he's the most talented.
- Come on.
He's a snob.
He's so sure of himself.
What's wrong?
Don had a heart attack.
We managed to get him to the hospital though.
Is he alive?
Barely.
The machines are doin' most of the work.
- You okay?
- Fine.
The baby's fine, thanks to Jimmy and Mary-Kate.
Your mother tried to help too, but that's another story.
I gotta get some sleep.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I hope the Speaker's okay.
Thanks, Jimmy.
I still think Regina's got the prettiest dress.
The girls asleep?
Sound asleep, I'm told.
Did you get the construction permit today?
No.
- You really don't wanna move, do you?
- Yeah, I do.
Believe me, I do.
No.
You're stalling', dragging' your feet.
Otherwise, you'd've gotten the permit.
Did you hear me?
My friend had a heart attack.
Be a man and admit you don't wanna live at the shore.
You don't have any idea what I'm doin'.
I'm dealin' with things, would destroy this family.
There won't be any house to build.
There won't be a house to live in.
Nothing.
I don't wanna lose this baby.
I'm sorry.
Come on.
I didn't wake the kids?
They'd sleep through a war.
Eileen okay?
Not really, no.
She's...
It's been a rough night.
You wanna sit down?
I just got a minute.
How's work?
Work's a firestorm.
What's up?
I couldn't find anything out about an informant.
I'm sorry.
I'll keep looking.
Let me know if you do, OK?
Absolutely.
It's good to see you.
I forget what you look like.
We never see each other anymore.
That's your choice.
- Look, Tommy...
- Mike, I gotta get back to Eileen.
Right.
You do your thing.
I'll see you.
As you know, I had a time problem.
I wanted to do a jacket with this...
I came by to see how you're doin'.
I seem to have a talent for getting fired.
Don't worry about it.
Let's be honest.
Eileen's a bitch.
It's hormonal.
I told you.
She can't help it.
Come here.
Come on.
I'm not gonna bite.
There's more to life than babies.
I'll never know what it's like.
We have each other, sweetheart.
We have each other.
I called the salon.
They said you'd be here.
You wanna... take a walk?
I just wanted to come and let you know that...
I'm finally taking down Tommy Caffee.
I mean "down" this time.
All I ever wanted from you was your approval.
You wanna know why?
Because you're right.
There is good.
There is bad.
It's not fucking gray.
It's black and it's white.
Most people, they don't want to admit it.
They don't wanna accept it, because it's too hard.
It's too difficult.
But...
Plus, I always thought if I got your approval, maybe I could get laid.
Best thing for me right now would... be for you to go.
Are you proud of me?
Very.
There you are.
I gotta leave early.
Help the wife pick up some crap for Lucy's birthday party.
Katie went ahead and hired a clown.
Half the neighborhood's gonna be there.
Lucy's so excited, she's pissin' her pants.
It's this Saturday.
You wanna come?
Free cake.
Thanks, though, but I...
I gotta work on the truck.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.
- Where are you?
- In the middle of the woods.
And it's creepy out here.
All kinds of noises and bugs.
Where exactly are you?
You take Squawtuckett off of 114.
Squawtuckett off 114.
Remember that.
Is he there...
Nozzoli?
He's fishin'.
- What?
- He's fishing.
- Some pudgy guy with him.
- What pudgy guy?
How should I know?
I'm comin'.
I'll be there soon.
- I'm gonna go make this good.
- That's a smart play.
'Cause we'll be annihilated, right?
Most likely.
Tommy gonna help you with this?
Deal Nozzoli in on the waterfront contracts?
He's my brother.
Of course he would if I asked him.
I'm not gonna.
I don't wanna drag him into this shit.
How you gonna convince Nozzoli you're not gettin' a piece of the action?
I'm not.
I'm gonna give him the cash equivalent of seven jobs.
From where?
I'm gonna give him all the action from Pawtucket.
- That's a lot of money.
- You have any better ideas?
If not, shut up.
Not easy, is it, my friend?
Running things.
You're my friend now?
If I had half a brain, I wouldn't be.
But, yeah,
I'm your friend.
Shit.
We never met.
Special agent Jarvis at your service.
Couldn't get over your lack of curiosity about Colin Carr and Kath Parry.
Then I realized, you're in denial.
I decided it was my painful job to... help you break through your denial.
Here.
A large whiskey, please.
The good stuff, Terry.
I watched this guy talk on Oprah... about how we need to reduce stress in our lives.
He suggested simple little things like... listenin' to nice music and... lighting' a candle on your desk.
This is the nearest I've to a desk.
Slainte.
Don't let that picture fuck you all up, all right?
They can do anything with photos nowadays.
Where is he?
Come on.
I told you, I don't wanna deal with him.
You deal with him.
- He's fuckin' unstable.
- Look, he's not right in the head, OK?
He doesn't know what he's doin'.
He insulted my generosity.
Fuck him.
Fuck his white trash Irish family.
You deal with him.
I'm not gonna talk to him.
He needs help.
What are you doin'?
STOLE A MOTORCYCLE
When Randy crossed something off my list and I got better, he realized that, while I may be out of the reach of modern medicine,
I wasn't out of the reach of Karma.
The list.
How's Earl gonna pick something from the list?
- All he does is lay there and drool.
- Then I'll pick for him.
How's that any better?
You just stand there and drool.
You're right.
Earl should pick.
Randy and Joy were nervous about me being in a coma, but my mind had a trick for dealing with the stress.
Back when I was a kid and things were bad,
I would escape into the comfortable world of television.
Harriet, what's that kayak doing in the kitchen?
And that's what my mind was doing again.
So while on the outside, my body was laying still, on the inside, I had a life with Billie that was moving along great.
I have some exciting news, but you can't tell Earl.
I'm pregnant.
I knew that!
Delivery boy at the supermarket told me you didn't buy lady pads this month.
You know what, Randy?
I'm gonna surprise Billie by ordering in some of this take-out Chinese food that all these celebrities are talking about.
I'm so glad you met with the guy I recommended.
He is definitely the guy for me.
His hands are warm, and he doesn't rush throught it and make you feel like you're just another number.
He's such a catch.
The girls are gonna be so jealous you got him.
I know, and I was so excited when I left,
I forgot to pay his fee!
His fee?
I think your wife's seeing a gigolo.
Come on, Earl, drool.
I think his mouth is dry.
Maybe we should spit in it.
Shut up.
Here it comes.
"Stole a motorcycle."
Oh, man.
One afternoon, me and Randy were poking around the neighborhood scoping out stuff to steal.
We called it "taking a crime walk."
Oh, check out the hog.
Dibs.
Where is she?
You don't have to worry about it, and I could care less what you do with it.
- You never put anything back.
- You've no respect for anybody's stuff.
I know you lost it.
Listen, I didn't lose the gas tank!
You had it last, because I remember thinking,
"Wow, my father's actually working."
Well, I know it's not up your butt 'cause that's where your head is.
Guys, check it out.
I'm a speed skater.
You think your brother needs another shot to the head, moron.
A motorcycle with the keys in it was the best thing to fall in our laps since Mitzi the stripper passed out on us at Club Chubby.
Once we got the motorcycle, we decided to have some fun.
Life is awesome!
And whenever we were having fun, we loved to add beer.
And rum.
And tequila.
And whatever malt liquor was on sale.
Next thing we knew, it was morning.
Randy, wake up.
We're on a school bus.
What?
How'd we get here?
I don't remember anything from last night.
Probably best if you don't.
Great.
Now you just got to return that motorcycle.
But I have no idea what we did with it.
I was blackout drunk that night.
Too bad Earl's in a coma, 'cause he was just plain ol' wake-up-in-the-school-bus drunk.
He'd remember.
Come on.
Think hard.
Something's coming back.
Oh, it left.
It's coming back.
There it goes again.
It's fast.
It's just a naked lady.
Oh, it's a dude.
I don't want to do this anymore.
While Randy tried to figure out where to find the bike, in my coma mind, I was dealing with problems of my own.
So that's the plan.
I'll pretend to go to work tomorrow, and when this gigolo comes over to see my wife, he'll get a rendez-vous with more than just Billie.
Off to work, honey.
Won't be back till 5:00.
Earl, what are you doing?
!
Surprising you, 'cause you were getting all dolled up expecting some gigolo to come over.
Are you crazy?
The only two things I'm expecting are to see my doctor... and to have your baby.
We're having a baby?
!
My own baby... who'll be my color and actually looks like me.
But wait a minute.
What about Joy saying he's a catch and the others girls are gonna be so jealous you got him?
Because he's so popular, he rarely takes on new patients.
I mean, even the smallest thing can make him say no.
I got him, Earl, and he's a real sicko!
He said he's been seeing our mom for years!
The Hickeys will be right back.
Randy didn't remember what we did with the motorcycle, so he went to see Jasper, who'd been in the paper for surviving more gunshot wounds than 50 Cent.
I remember that day.
It was like 2:30 in the afternoon.
You and Earl came in just brain-dead, butt-ugly wasted.
Sorry about saying "brain-dead" with you brother in the coma.
Turns out me and Randy had spent about an hour trying to convince Jasper to buy the motorcycle that day.
I'm sorry, guys, but I can't resell it.
I think it's wrong to sell something that jeopardizes the customer safety.
What?
You sold hand grenades to a high school football team.
They said that was for a prank.
Hey, how much is the chicken suit?
How's this?
You give me the chain off the motorcycle, and it's yours.
I didn't need the chain.
I just didn't want you driving around Camden all wasted.
I have kids, you know?
I mean, I don't know who they are or if they exist, but I used to have a lot of unprotected sex.
So do you know where we went next?
I know you wanted to wear the chicken suit to nickel wing day at the Crab Shack.
I believe you said, and I quote,
"People would be eating their wings.
Then I would come in and they'd be like
'Oh, God, it's a giant chicken come for revenge!
'"
That sounds like me.
My comedy always has a message.
I have to tell you, Randy.
Doing Earl's list to make him better is genius.
That's what Joy said, too.
Then she called me "dummy," which hurt a little, but it really made me value the moment where she called me "genius."
See?
People love it when I call 'em names!
"Buttwipe, douchebag, dummy."
It's like sprinkles on the ice cream cones of conversation.
I do remember something about that night with the motorcycle.
Honestly, I hoped it would never come up again.
I mistakenly believed you and your brother's silence on the matter meant you felt appropriately ashamed of your behavior.
As it turns out, that afternoon, me and Randy pushed the motorcycle into the Crab Shack and engaged in what my dad calls "general jackassery."
You're eating my baby!
Earl, you guys have got to stop!
The table in the back just passed out from exhaust, and the giant chicken thing is freaking people out!
Don't worry, Crab Man.
I'll stop the chicken.
I know how to speak their language.
Problem solved.
That explains why that sign is there.
Anyway, when you heard the cops were coming, you pushed the bike out and went on the run.
That's the last I saw of you.
Man, one clue at a time.
This is like what someone told me reading a book is like.
Okay, what'd we do next?
I'm not sure, but we should talk to Homeless Joe.
I seem to remember he mentioned seeing you guys do something freaky that night.
Plus, I haven't visited him since he got married to Shopping Card Kim.
I owe him a congratulations.
I don'know anything about a motorcycle.
I saw you at midnight.
You and your brother were driving a tiny little car.
Homeless Joe was kind of right.
Randy was driving a tiny little car.
But I was driving a tiny little plane.
Help!
Help!
Damn it, Randy, pull over!
Pull over!
And as good as the day had been, me and Randy were no longer having fun.
Something had gone terribly wrong.
Son of a bitch!
Time to die!
Earl tried to kill me?
Now, hold on, Randy.
Maybe there's some mistake.
Son, I know what I saw.
I can't vouch for what I heard 'cause there's a beetle living in my ear, but I know what I saw.
I can't believe Earl tried to kill me.
I'm Randy.
Earl wouldn't try to kill Randy.
That'd be like peanut butter trying to kill jelly.
Peanut butter wouldn't kill jam.
They're in the same sandwich.
I can't believe Earl tried to kill me.
We've been brother for I don't know how long and now I find out this?
Hold on a second.
We only have Homeless Joe's word on that, and Homeless Joe has been known to exaggerate the truth.
He's the one who got the town convinced the Carter sisters were witches.
I'm still with Homeless Joe.
If they weren't witches, they should've floated.
You got the superstion backwards, witches float.
Innocent people, like the Carter sisters, sink.
Whatever.
They're gone now.
The point is we need more information.
We can't go after Earl with the same witch-hunt hysteria that sweeps through Camden every two years.
You know what we gotta do?
We gotta work backwards to find out what really happened.
Like when you rewind that videotape to see if Sharon Stone really flashed her undersmile.
She did show her undersmile.
Right.
I'm sure if we rewind the night to where you were before Homeless Joe, we'll find out if Earl showed his undersmile, too.
Metaphorically speaking.
While Randy, Joy, and Darnell went to retrace our steps, well, you know what I was doing.
It's time.
My water broke.
I'll call a plumber in the morning.
My God, your water broke!
Remember, short breaths.
Hurry, Earl!
I think we're getting closer!
Don't worry, we're in the hospital.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Since Edwin the town dwarf had died, the only people around who wore tiny little hats and drove tiny little cars were the Knights of Camden
So Darnell suggested they stop by to ask some questions.
Oh, my God.
Kill me when I'm 50.
Wake up!
It's you.
They'd come to the right place.
It ends up that night Randy had started his way into the Knights of Camden's new member mixer.
Hey, buddy.
Come on in.
We could use a young fellow like you around here.
We're dying off like crickets.
Randy was drunk when he got there, but after an hour of limbo and all-you-can-drink gin Rickies, he was in full party mode.
Then I showed up.
You son of a bitch, I'll kill you!
I got a picture of that night, right here!
It's between the one of Dead Louie and Dead Frank.
So he did try to kill me.
I'm not even sad about it anymore.
I'm angry.
I mean, I'm still kind of sad, but more angry than sad!
Is there a word for that?
There should be.
I'm feeling pretty terr-hurtsible.
Really, really terr-hurtsible.
With a touch of sangry.
Okay, just calm down.
Wrinkles, is there anything else you can tell us about that night, like where they might've come from?
Well, the only other thing I know is, the big guy here had his foot covered in tar and he dragged it all over on our dancefloor.
Does this antenna look familiar?
Looks like panties hanging on it.
Holy crap.
That's the pantenna!
The pantenna used to be a tradition in the trailer park.
After girls hooked up with a guy, they'd shoot their panties at the antenna.
The story was, if they stuck, it was true love.
If they fell, it was likely the clap.
Damn it!
- Bingo!
- Look at that.
More tar foot prints.
Great googly moogly.
There's the bike.
Damn.
People sure do have a lot of sex in this trailer park.
Watch your step.
Those are the clap panties.
I remember what happened.
I remember it all.
Suddenly, the whole night come rushing back to Randy.
After Darnell kicked us out of the Crab Shack, we knew the cops were looking for the stolen bike, so we decided to hide it where no one'd think to look.
On the roof of Deaf Charlie's trailer.
We took the chain off an old chainsaw and put it on the bike.
It wasn't gonna last long, but luckily, we only had to drive 15 feet.
Wish me luck.
Be careful.
I didn't build a very wide ramp.
Earl, you did it!
You made it up the ramp!
I thought for sure you were gonna...
We covered the bike so nobody would see it from below.
Then, I kicked down the ramp, and we planned our escape.
The cops are gonna be looking for a guy, and a giant chicken.
but they never looking for two giant half chickens.
Give me your pants.
Cops are dumb.
Get down!
Get down!
They gotta be here somewhere.
There's yellow fellows everywhere.
Fan out.
Shut up.
I can't help it, Randy.
When I'm nervous and drunk, I can't...
Scotty, I think there's somebody behind the trailer.
Rock, smashes, scissors.
Sucks to be you.
Will you just shut up already?
After about 10 minutes, the cops ran out of stein.
Unfortunately, so did I.
All right.
They're gone.
Let's get out of here.
Oh, God!
I killed him.
I gotta think what to do.
Think what to do.
I gotta make like a banana and split.
Aw!
Damn it!
I finally got to use that word and Earl's too dead to hear it.
It just keeps getting worse.
Randy was scared that now the cops would be out looking for a murdering half chicken, so he ditched the suit to go on the run.
Good-bye, brother!
That son of a bitch killed me.
That's when I broke off the pantenna for a weapon and followed Randy's footprints to the Knights of Camden Hall.
No wonder he tried to kill me.
I deserved it.
I killed him!
I killed him, and I went to a party and played "Try to walk under the stick".
Everyone grieves differently.
No!
No!
I'm a terrible brother!
I should be the one in the coma!
You in a coma?
You wanna go return the motorcycle so we can get it crossed on Earl's list?
Those chopper guys were pretty bad about to get their bike back, but Randy was still feeling rotten.
That's how they stole.
Which one of you jackasses left the keys in the bike?
Well, Earl, we found the motorcycle.
I also found out I tried to kill you first.
I'm so sorry.
I'm a terrible brother.
How'd you get up there?
Oh, I fell a long way.
Well, guest what!
You're an uncle!
We crossed "stole a motorcycle" off your list.
I hope you forgive me.
Billie and the baby are safe.
Now it's your turn.
Grab hold.
He squeezed me!
He squeezed me!
We'd better get the doctor.
I'm gonna keep doing list items until you're all better, Earl.
I love you.
Hugging's good.
I'm gonna keep hugging you all night.
My name is Earl.
When Randy crossed something off my list and I got better... he realized that while I may be out of the reach of modern medicine...
- I wasn't out of the reach ofkarma.
- The list!
How's Earl gonna pick somethin' from the list?
- All he does is lay there and drool.
- Then I'll pick for him.
How's that any better?
You just stand there and drool.
You're right.
Earl should pick.
Randy and Joy were nervous about me being in a coma... but my mind had a trick for dealing with the stress.

And as good as the day had been... me and Randy were no longer having fun.
Something had gone terribly wrong.
# Woke up this morning My liver said to me #
# Come on, boy Let that alcohol be #
- # Go to detox Like father, like son #
- #A.A. Meetings, here I come Yeah, I'm a wreck #
- #Feel like a big piece of trash #
- Son of a bitch!
Aah!
#My whole life's in pieces Everything around me smells like feces #
Time to die!
- Earl tried to kill me?
- Now, hold on, Randy.
Maybe there's some mistake.
Son, I know what I saw.
I can't vouch for what I heard... 'cause there's a beetle living in my ear, but I know what I saw.

Don't worry.
We're in the hospital.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Uh-oh.
Since Edwin, the town dwarf, had died, the only people around... who wore tiny little hats and drove tiny little cars were the Knights of Camden.
So Darnell suggested they stop by to ask some questions.

Oh, hey, buddy.

We could use a young fellow like you around here.
We're dying off like crickets.
Randy was drunk when he got there... but after an hour oflimbo and all-you-can-drink gin rickeys... he was in full party mode.
- Then I showed up.
- #La, la, la, la, limbo #
You son of a bitch!
I'll kill you!
Randy!
Randy!
Randy!
I got a picture of that night right here.
It's between the one of dead Louie and dead Frank.
So he did try to kill me.
I'm not even sad about it anymore.
I'm angry.
I mean, I'm still kinda sad, but more angry than sad.
Is there a word for that?
'Cause there should be!
I'm feeling pretty "terrhurtsible. "
Really, really "terrhurtsible," with a touch of"sangry. "
Just calm down.
Hey, wrinkles, is there anything else you can tell us about that night... like where they might have come from?

- Yeah.
Cops are dumb.
Get down, get down!
All right.
They gotta be here somewhere.
There's yellow feathers everywhere.
Fan out.
Shut up!
I can't help it, Randy.
When I'm nervous and drunk, I get the hic-
Scotty, I think there's somebody behind the trailer.
Rock smashes scissors.
Sucks to be you.
Shh.
Will you just shut up already?
After about 10 minutes, the cops ran out of steam.
Unfortunately, so did I.
All right, they're gone.
Let's get out of here.
Earl!
Earl?
Oh, God!
I killed him.
I killed him.
I gotta think of what to do.
Think of what to do.
I gotta make like a banana and split.
Aw!
Damn it!
I finally got to use that one, and Earl was too dead to hear it.
It just keeps gettin' worse.
Randy was scared that now the cops... would be out looking for a murdering half-chicken... so he ditched the suit to go on the run.
Good-bye, Brother.
That son of a bitch killed me!
That's when I broke off the pantenna for a weapon... and followed Randy's tar-covered footprints to the Knights of Camden hall.
No wonder he tried to kill me.
I deserved it.
I killed him and went to a party with little old men and played "try to walk under the stick!"
- Well, everyone grieves differently.
- No!
No!
I'm a terrible brother.
I should be the one in the coma!
- You in a coma?
- No.
You wanna go return the motorcycle so we can get it crossed off Earl's list?
Yeah.
Those chopper guys were pretty glad to get their bike back... but Randy was still feeling rotten.
That's how they stole it.
Which one of you jackasses left the keys in the bike?
Well, Earl, we found the motorcycle.
I also found out I tried to kill you first.
I'm so sorry.
I'm a terrible brother.
Aww.
Randy?
How'd you get up there?
Oh, I fell a long way.
Well, guess what.
You're an uncle.
Okay, Earl.
We crossed "Stole a motorcycle" off your list.
I hope you forgive me.
Okay, Earl.
Billie and the baby are safe.
Now it's your turn.
Grab hold.
He squeezed me!
He squeezed me!
We better get the doctor.
I'm gonna keep doing list items until you're all better, Earl.
I love you.
Hugging's good.
I'm gonna keep huggin' you all night.
[ Earl Narrating ] /t was nice being'out of my coma and back where / belonged... but / couldn't get Billie off my mind.
/ was pretty sure karma wanted me to f/nd her.
It's official.
There's only two Billy Cunninghams in the phone book... and neither of those guys thinks he's my soul mate.
Billie, Billie, Billie.
Don't you wanna hear what's been going on with us?
Randy was our town crier while you were comatose.
That's actually a clever play on words... in that he both recorded the town happenings and cried a lot.
Read the list, dum-dum.
"l got a notepad. I got a paper cut.
Fire marshal kicked Joy and family out of their sideways trailer."
That's right, Dip Van Winkle.
Trailer's still on its side since you knocked it over... so now we live in the Crab Shack.
I'm tellin' ya', you gotta carry the three.
This is my spelling homework.
/oy, / promise /'ll get your trailer tipped right side up... as soon as I get enough money to rent a crane.
"A raccoon fought a opossum for half a bag of french fries...
"in the motel parking lot.
A fry got left behind. I ate a fry."
- Oh, and I'm a lesbian.
- [ Randy ] Catalina, it's not your turn yet.
Did I just hear Chiquita Banana say she isn't into bananas anymore?
What happened?
Did you get a bad banana?
It wasn't the bananas, it was the trees who waggle them around.
In The Wizard of Oz, the trees threw apples.
Trees are bastards.
All men are bastards.
My father, who gambled me away in a foosball game... and my childhood sweetheart, who convinced me to come to this country only to abandon me.
Thanks to him, now I live a fairy-tale life of a maid and a stripper.
Oh, please. I know what you're up to.
Pretending to be a lesbian will probably double your business at Club Chubby.
When I was in high school, I told my gym teacher I was a lesbian just to get a "B."
She hadn't called my bluff in the shower, I would've gotten an "A."
/'m a real Chapstick lesbian.
The only person I wanna strip for now is Miss Right.
Well, good luck.
I'm looking for my Miss Right too.
Damn, Earl.
You got Frank's car.
You got Frank's trailer.
Now you want Frank's ex?
Why you gotta sleep inside everything that's Frank's?
[ Earl Narrating ] /oy's little insult gave me an idea.
That's how I'll find Billie
- Frank.
ziet's go, Randy.
Finish up your homework, boys.
Crab water's almost cool enough for your bath.
My name is Earl.
[ Earl Narrating ] We found out because of prison overcrowding...
Frank had been sent to a halfway house.
[ Hooting, Whooping, Whistling ]
[ Earl Narrating ] / wasn't looking forward to talking to Frank... seeing how he used to date Billie and he's crazy... but he was my only chance at f/nding her.
Oh, my God.
Hey.
- Oh, my God. lt's good to see you.
- So, how are you?
Hungry.
Really hungry.
They put tranquilizers in our food to keep us down.
I'm starving. l-l actually ate a bar of soap yesterday.
This morning I pooped bubbles.
Guys were running around popping 'em.
lt-lt's crazy in here.
You want a little fruit?
I carry apple slices in my pocket now.
We haven't gotten to that page yet.
I gotta say, you're looking good, Frank.
Strong, healthy.
Beautiful necklace.
Nah, it's not just a necklace.
I learned that the hard way.
- ?
[ "Turkey ln The Straw" Over P.A. ] - Ice cream!
Ice cream!
- [ Electricity Crackling ] - [ Groaning ]
- [ Earl ] Hey, Paco.
- Saludos, Earl, Randy.
I used to deliver for Camden Foreign Foods.
Being Senor zlo Mein sucks, doesn't it?
Yes.
But if you have a job, they take your collar off... and let you out of here for eight hours a day.
Why don't you get a job like Paco?
I refuse to dress like a bullfighting yodeler and dance like a monkey.
Keep eating soap, genius.
Bye.
So, we just, uh, came by to find out how you were doin'.
I thought we were here to find Billie.
Remember?
You said you were scared because Frank used to date her.
You also said that one of us should do all the talking.
It was you.
Go ahead, Earl.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You wanna date Billie?
Yes, and I just want you to know that karma's on my side... so if you attack me, something bad will happen to you.
Aw, you know what?
Don't worry about it.
l-l'm over her anyway.
Really?
You're really over her?
Yeah.
Plus, she's living a good life now, like you.
It'd be like if Mother Theresa started dating that bald guy in the diapers.
What's his name?
Gumby.
Thanks, Frank.
That means a lot.
So, can you help me find Billie?
Yeah, I could do that, but you gotta help me first.
I need a job so I could get outta here every day.
Maybe we can get him a job as a bikini inspector.
I've seen the uniforms on sale at the mall.
Or he could be a beaver hunter, but you might need a license for that.
[ Earl Narrating ] / knew / needed Frank's help... so / went to see if Darnell would be willing to hire him.
He won't even be around to bother you 'cause he'll be helping me find Billie.
Are you sure the boys are okay?
I told them they were bunk beds, and they believed me.
Startin' to realize there's no point in saving up for college.
I'll hire Frank if it's okay with Joy.
The man did point a gun at her belly when she was delivering a baby.
Weren't my baby.
I don't give a crap.
- [ Phone Rings ]
- Oh, come on.
- Who calls a bar after 7:00?
We got kids sleeping.
- [ Ringing Continues ]
[ Earl Narrating ] The next day, Frank was off/cially employed... and pretty excited to get a little taste of freedom.
[ Panting ]
Frank thought the best place to look for Billie was her cousin Jocelyn's.
You have a lot of nerve thinking you can walk in here and ask me for a favor, dirtbag.
Did I mention I may have had sex with Jocelyn... while me and Billie were on a short break?
No, you did not.
Because he's too much of a gentleman.
I'm gonna go for a run.
- So, have you heard from Billie?
- l may have.
Come on,Jocelyn, baby, don't be pissed.
Besides, me and Billie are over.
And you are looking so fine, girl.
You know, she has the most incredible feet.
Go ahead, show him your feet.
ziet him see 'em.
[ zlaughs ] Oh, Frank.
She stayed here for a while after she got kicked out of nursing school for cheating.
Mmm!
There they are.
There is the stuff right there, girl.
Cheatin'?
Billie was living a good life.
My diabetic ass.
That girl's been going nuts.
She stole my rent money, siphoned my gas and then robbed a liquor store on Christmas Day.
/ mean, who holds someone at gunpoint on Jesus'birthday?
Billie hit me on Christmas Day.
She was probably running from the liquor store.
Sounds like your girl's gone back to the dark side.
- Come and take a look at these little sausages.
- They're fantastic.
Uh,Jocelyn, do you have any idea where Billie is now?
She called a week or so ago, needing help.
Same old story.
You can check my caller l.D. if you want.
This little piggy went to the market.
This little piggy stayed home.
-Jocelyn, you remember where this little piggy went?
- [ Giggling ]
[ Earl Narrating ] We didn't know how to trace the caller /.D. number... so we went to the only person we knew who had access to the World Wide Web.
Yeah, it seemed like karma was bringing Billie to me as a reward... but now I realize karma was also bringing me to Billie.
I think I'm supposed to help her get her life back on track.
Karma wants her to be our girlfriend.
Ahh.
That couldn't be more romantic if Manilow sang it in a bubble bath.
- [ Beeps ]
- Oh, oh, here's the number.
zlooks like it's a pay phone.
Hey, wh-what's this Web site you got covered up?
What's a "Dl zlF"?
Oh, uh-uh-uh, that's, uh...
"Dads I'd zlike to Find."
l-l-l've lost touch with the fathers of some of my childhood friends.
- Well, let's check and see if our dad's on there.
- Ohh!
is that really what dads do when mommies aren't around?
[ Earl Narrating ] Kenny gave us the address for the pay phone... so we went there and waited, hoping we'd see Billie.
We decided that me and Frank would watch to the south...
Randy would keep an eye on the north.
Frank, what does Billie like?
Any tips you can give me to help me out?
Well, she was really into my musky scent.
And I used to drive her crazy with this move.
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Women are complicated.
- Stuart?
- Oh, hey, Earl.
It's Stuart Daniels.
Former cop, current bowler.
- He was on my list.
- Hey, I remember you.
Your, uh-Your mother's the police chief, right?
And your sister's that fiery little redheaded cop... that likes to frisk all the way up to the sack.
- ls she seeing' anyone?
- No.
So, what are you doing on my street?
We're lookin' for a girl, Billie Cunningham.
- She hit me with her car.
- Haven't seen her.
[ Earl Narrating ] Turned out, Stuart knew more about Billie than he was saying.
Stuart f/rst met Billie when he hit her with his car.
- [ Groans ] - [ Brakes Squeal ]
Oh, crap.
[ Earl Narrating ] He started visiting her because he was feeling guilty.
[ Man ].' Girlfriend in a coma / know, / know it's serious.'
But as he spent more time with her, he started to feel other things.
Stuart had once hit a dog, brought it home and nursed it back to health... and he thought if the dog grew to love him, why couldn't Billie?
And f/nally, Billie woke up.
So, no one knows who hit me?
Total mystery.
And since you don't remember, I guess we'll never know.
No, the only thing I remember is hitting Earl.
- ls he okay?
- l'm the one who found you.
I've been watching over you.
Do you need a place to stay?
I've got my own room.
- ls Earl okay?
- Uh, what if he was?
I mean, how would you feel?
- Happy.
- But me
- How would you feel about me?
Would you stay with me?
- l don't even know you.
- Right, right.
Earl's dead.
You killed him.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
[ Earl Narrating ] Stuart told Billie she was in trouble... and the cops had been coming every day, waiting to ask her questions.
And, believing him, she let him sneak her out of the hospital.
He squeezed me!
He squeezed me!
Eventually, she got away from Stuart long enough to make a phone call.
Jocelyn, you gotta help me.
I'm sure the cops have been there lookin' for me.
I'm staying with this really creepy guy.
He wears swim trunks in the shower.
And a baseball hat.
Good luck finding that girl.
I'll keep an eye out for her. I have to go.
I have some lettuce I gotta put in the crisper.
The cops are right outside looking for you.
We gotta move.
[ Earl Narrating ] After two long days of staking out Billie's pay phone... we f/nally caught a break.
Unfortunately, it was a bad break.
While we were f/guring out what to do next...
Stuart and Billie had already settled into their new hiding place.
Oh, hello.
Did someone order towels?
Sure.
You could just put 'em right there.
Hi. I'm Catalina.
- And you are-
- Uh, Roxanne.
Roxanne.
You look like you have some tangles in the back.
Would you like me to-
Oh, this is nice.
Two girls hanging out... brushing each other's hair...
like God intended.
[ Man ].' When / get that feelin' / want sexual healin'.'
[ Sniffs ]
.'Sexual healing.'
- Did you just lick my neck?
- Yes.
No.
Maybe.
- lt was a bug.
Did you like it?
- .'So f/ne.'
Think I'm just gonna go get my clothes on now.
I'm probably coming on too strong.
I'm a new lesbian.
Please call.
.' When / get this feelin'.'.'
Hey, you're that bowling guy my friend Earl helped.
He lives two doors down.
I'll let him know you're here.
Hey, Billie, I just saw the cops outside.
We gotta move.
- Do I have time to get dressed?
- Yes.
But no bra and panties.
[ Earl Narrating ] / didn't know what to do next... but /'d never been more sure karma wanted me and Billie to be together.
She's robbing liquor stores on Christmas.
I gotta find her.
- Not just for me.
Her life's outta control.
- [ Darnell Gargles, Spits ]
Very interesting, Earl.
How's that crane rental coming?
Hook me up, Darnell.
Uh!
Damn it, Darnell!
You hit the tonic button.
Now I gotta add some gin just to make it taste right.
So what are we gonna do now, Earl?
Where are we gonna f/nd her?
- l don't know.
- Why don't you ask karma?
What do I do now, karma?
How do I find her?
- [ Phone Rings ] - [ Gasps ]
Crab Shack/Turner residence.
It's for you.
- Hello?
- l've got your girl.
Get over here fast.
[ Earl Narrating ] Stuart and Kenny had a unique friendship... and apparently Stuart felt like Kenny's would be a safe hiding place.
Hi, Stuart.
- Oh, who's your ugly friend?
- This is, uh, Roxanne.
Stuart told Kenny he was doing some undercover police work for his mom... and "Roxanne"was a witness in an upcoming murder trial.
[ Grunting ]
Just say something.
We're live on my blog.
- Hello, Kenny's friends.
- See?
I told you he was funny.
Stuart.
Mom's here.
is this really the plan?
Am I supposed to just sit around while you two blog each other?
Well!
What a little mouth on her.
Kenny, can you keep a secret?
is it about something you tried in college?
[ Earl Narrating ] So Stuart told him about Billie... and Kenny couldn't pass up the chance to make their threesome a twosome.
There she is.
How's my breath?
Really warm.
[ Earl Narrating ] Seein'Billie took my really warm breath away.
Unfortunately, seein'Billie seemed to have the same effect on Frank.
/ should've known as soon as he heard Billie was bad again, he'd want her back.
- [ Car Door Closes ]
- Come on.
- ziet's go get that woman.
- Uh, for me.
Of course for you.
If you're nervous, I could go in there and talk to her first.
- That's really nice of you.
- Yeah.
Yeah, well, I'm a really nice guy.
You know, / just- / just realized / can't talk to Billie now.
I gotta go home, get cleaned up... maybe write down what I wanna say.
That, sir, is a great idea.
- [ zlaughs ]
- We'll both come back tomorrow.
Well, I guess I should be gettin' you back to the halfway house.
And again, thank you for your help... my loyal, honest friend.
Fire him.
Fire the bastard now.
[ Earl Narrating ] The next morning, Frank waited to be released for work... but nobody unlocked him.
Hey, don't forget to unlock me.
- You got fired, champ.
- Aah.
Now who looks ridiculous?
Okay, still me.
But at least I, Paco, get to leave.
Bye.
[ Earl Narrating ] / thought about goin' to Billie's right after / dropped Frank off... but / realized / only had one shot to convince Billie she was my soul mate.
/ wanted to make sure / got it right.
"And even though most of those words were written by Bret Michaels in the '80s... they're comin' straight from my heart."
- What do you think?
- l think she's gonna lo
- Bird!
[ Squawks ]
[ Earl Narrating ] /t's not every day you tell a woman you're meant to be together... but / felt surprisingly calm.
- Everything in my life was f/nally comin'together.
- [ Grunts ]
Billie's mine!
You can't have her!
Karma wants us together, Frank.
You can't stop this.
Yeah?
Eat poo, backstabber.
[ Earl Narrating ] While / had my hands full outside, Billie was in a battle ofher own.
I need to go on the run by myself, and I'm gonna need money.
So I'm robbin' you, Kenny.
I wanna be up-front about that.
Billie, please. ziet's be reasonable.
Think about all I've done for you.
Just like a woman.
I'll bet she's on her period.
- Tie yourselves up.
- l'll-l'll do it.
Billie, where are you gonna find a guy who cares about you as much as I do?
I don't need anyone to care about me.
I can take care of myself.
There's not a lot of rope here. I know. I'll tie us together.
Face-to-face is probably safest.
- Billie, please. ziet's think about-
- She is over you.
- Can you put in that Moby CD on your way out?
- You can't go outside, Billie.
The cops are after you.
You murdered Earl Hickey.
- Earl?
- Not my day.
- Wait. I thought I murdered you.
- l was just in a coma.
But it was beautiful there.
In my mind, I saw you every day, and we had a kid and a theme song.
Why are they tied up?
Billie, I love you.
And before you decide which one of us you wanna kiss... you should know that not five minutes ago, Earl ate poo right outside.
What is going on?
Karma brought us together.
That's why you hit me.
We're supposed to be together.
/ hit her too.
Maybe karma brought us together.
- Wait.
You're the one that hit me?
- l was gonna tell you.
Shut up and press tighter against me.
It's the only way we're gonna survive this thing.
There's even a $1 00,000 insurance settlement waiting for you.
All you have to do is sign a form.
Thought we could use it to get married and buy a house.
- Hello, lover.
Your getaway car is here.
- l don't believe this.
- What are you doing here?
- l'm in love with her.
- [ Catalina ] /'m in love with her.
- So am I.
- Yeah, me too. [ Groans ] - [ Electricity Crackles ] zlook, Billie, this isn't how I wanted things to go.
I came here wearing a clean shirt and holding flowers.
And I was supposed to be the only person in the room who loved you.
Oh, whatever. /'m the only person in the room who really knows you.
Who was there when your Aunt What's-her-name died?
- You mean my mom?
- Yeah, her.
Billie, karma brought us together for a reason.
I went back to my old ways.
You went back to your old ways.
We both got hit.
Karma wants us to be good.
But I think we're supposed to be good together.
Or we could be bad together.
I learned things in prison that will blow your mind.
Billie, how else can you explain it?
When we both lost our way, we found each other.
I'm sorry, Frank.
I can't go with you.
Or you.
And certainly not you.
Because I'm supposed to be with you.
Fine.
Fine.
Well, you know, you should know... that you're gonna be sayin'bye to the best thing you ever had.
Aw, who am I kidding?
Even I don't believe that.
Hey, best of luck to youse, all right?
This isn't the way I thought it would end.
I thought it would end with our naked breasts pressed together... our long, smooth legs intertwined.
Barf.
[ Footsteps Receding ]
[ Snifflng ]
- You smell great.
- Oh, yeah.
Frank must have sweated on me when we were fighting.
No, it's not him.
It's you.
[ Earl Narrating ] Me and Billie had f/nally found each other... but we weren't the only ones karma was lookin'out for.
- [ Footsteps Receding ] - l'm gonna die alone in my mother's house.
Or we could die in each other's arms as old men... living in Boca Raton, surrounded byJack Russell terriers.
I loveJack Russell terriers.
[ Earl Narrating ] And karma wasn't only connecting new lovers... it was reconnecting old ones-
Catalina!
- Catalina!
- Paco!
[ Man ] .'Lord Almighty.'
- like Catalina and her childhood sweetheart- - .'/ feel my temperature rising.' and a convict and his plus-sized lover.
- [ Electrical Crackling ] - [ Both Moaning ]
And Billie did use that $ 1 00,000 from Stuart's insurance to get married... but not to Stuart.
For the third time, I got hitched... to a woman I hardly knew.
But much like f/fth grade, / think the third time, / got it right.
.' Your kisses lift me higher.'
.'Like the sweet song of a choir.'
Finally life was just where karma wanted it... and where / wanted it too.
.'/'m just a hunk a hunk ofburnin'love.'.'
Who am I?
You sure you want to know?
Truth is, I'm a nobody.
Actually, I'm worse than a nobody.
I'm this guy.
Stop!
Stop the bus!
The story of my life is not for the faint of heart.
Thanks.
But, like any story worth telling, it's all about a girl.
Not that girl.
- Hey.
Hi.
- I don't think that is a girl.
No, it's about this girl...
Jill Johnson.
Ever since I can remember I've been in love with her, but she barely knows I exist.
Yo, Rick!
Yo, come here, man!
I got you a seat down here.
What's...
I'll call y'all back.
Everybody, bye.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, Trey.
Dude, I'm so psyched for this class trip.
We about to see some real serious cutting-edge shit.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yo, you got any C batteries on you?
AAs?
Got that new sandwich from Sony in my backpack.
Wi-Fi... mmm!
Yo!
You got to forget about her, dawg.
Look look.
Let me show you something.
She not even looking at you.
If I could just tell her how I feel.
Look, Rick, I already told you... you never gonna get with Jill, all right?
Seriously, she hangs out with the popular crew, and nobody messes around outside their group, man.
Come on, that crew stuff isn't real.
The hell it ain't.
Look around, Rick.
- Look, you got your jocks...
- Get the ball, man.
...nerds, emos,
Frodos, the Scarface society the sexual predators.
- Yeah.
- Of course you got the Rick punchers.
- The who?
- Oh!
- Yeah, they new.
But you know what?
Who cares?
'Cause we got our own crew...
me and you.
Thanks, Trey.
You're the best, man.
- Am I in?
- No.
Come on.
Hey, it's me and you, baby.
The two of us against the world.
You hear me?
You look good today.
I like your hair.
I'm gonna show you something nasty I downloaded.
Don't tell nobody.
Welcome to Amalgamated.
I'm Dr. Strom, head of the research department...
- Come on, man.
- ... where we create the future today.
And now I'd like to show you our crown jewel.
The Amalgamated animal genetics lab.
Go ahead, explore.
Yo yo.
Come on, Rick.
Man, check this out.
All of our animals are genetically engineered and each of them has...
Oh, you're so pretty.
Hi, birdie.
Hi.
Hi.
- She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Yes, she is.
Uh, I'm gonna take a picture of her for the school newspaper.
Our only rules:
Don't feed the animals and please, no flash photography.
Some of our genetically- engineered animals are a little sensitive to light.
It flew away.
Uh... whoo-hoo.
What the F, loser?
- Get him, Lance.
- Come on, Lance.
- Leave him alone.
- I don't think so.
Is there a problem, Lance?
No.
No problem, Uncle Lou.
Mr. Landers!
Students, this is Lou Landers, visionary scientist and C.E.O. of Amalgamated.
Well, I'm just a businessman now.
The future of science belongs to all of you.
Please, enjoy the tour.
Are you okay?
Yes, this is healthy-cough blood.
Rick Riker.
You're not Blaine and Julia Riker's son, are you?
- I am.
- Ah.
Good people.
- How are they?
- They died violently nine years ago.
But otherwise okay?
Yes, thank you.
I live with my aunt and uncle now.
Well, you seem like a real chip off the old block.
Let's hope you're not violently murdered too.
That's for making me look stupid.
Next time I hurt you.
Yeah.
You the man, Lance.
Our work with these animals has helped us develop new antibiotics, advanced pesticides and a powerful new pheromone which drives animals to mate called compound H2O9.
It's a strong sexual attractant.
A single drop is enough to arouse any animal.
We plan on using it to breed endangered species.
A special and indeed often overlooked...
Our most-promising research is with these dragonflies.
For example, this dragonfly's skin has a hard, armor-like exoskeleton to defend against...
And this species of dragonfly has enormous strength for its size.
It can lift vast amounts.
More than it's body weight.
And here we've injected the DNA from all three species into seven new genetically-enhanced super dragonflies.
But there's only six in there.
Well, one missing dragonfly is the least of my concerns.
I lost six tigers alone last month.
This area is where we keep our livestock.
Aren't you going to do something?
Soon as I get this up on YouTube.
I see.
Ye... well, yes, I understand.
Thank you for the call.
That was the principal.
Rick walked off a class trip.
After all the parenting you've done, he's still so troubled.
Why do you think that is, Albert?
I have no idea, Lucille.
I have taught him everything I know about being a man.
And a good man you are after all these years of marriage.
It's like we first met.
Sure, you're a little older.
Your hair's grey.
You have crow's feet.
It takes you an hour to pee.
Your thighs look like cottage cheese someone threw up on a hot sidewalk.
And you've always had a tiny penis.
Well... what does it matter when you're in love?
Oh, Rick.
We were wondering where you were.
It's so late.
About time you got home.
Your aunt was getting worried.
You can sleep late in the morning, but don't forget to feed the fish.
Attaboy.
I don't know.
Something just doesn't seem quite right with him today.
Teenagers.
I'll talk to him.
Rough day, huh?
Well, I won't lie to you.
Puberty is a difficult time in a young man's life.
Now this book may explain what's happening.
Let's see.
There are mood swings, fluid retention, and once a month you'll bleed from your vagina.
This may be the wrong book.
What's important is that you're on the verge of adulthood.
Here... take a drink.
Ah, the rituals of manhood.
Today you have your first beer, and tomorrow we'll circumcise you.
I'm losing patience, Dr. Strom.
Please, sir, if you could just wait a few minutes...
I've waited long enough for this egomaniac.
We're the board of directors.
Our time is valuable.
Not as valuable as mine, Mr. Carlson.
You see, I have a terminal illness.
I've been fighting it for years, but the disease has ravaged my organs.
As of this moment, I have one hour left to live.
It was on sale.
Gentlemen, if you're ready, allow me to show you the future.
What the hell is that?
An innovation...
thank you... that will not only save my life but the life of this company.
For too long we've scraped out profits from pills and injections.
The real prize is the total cure.
A device that can alter DNA and restore the body to perfect health.
- You're crazy.
- No.
Crazy is hearing voices, talking to cats, dating Paula Abdul.
I'm not crazy.
I'm a visionary!
Sir.
Sir, the machine's never been fully tested.
If something should go wrong...
- Start the machine!
- Yes, sir.
Plasma level is steady.
Genetic modification's at optimum levels!
Sir, the core is overheating.
We have to abort!
Did it work?
I'm so sorry.
Well, well, well.
I want you to know what a joy it will be running this company without you in the way.
Let go.
Let me go.
Gentlemen, I think it's time we made some personnel changes.
No, get away!
Oh.
How long was I asleep?
Five days.
Wait.
Wha...
Oh, Dad.
I thought you'd live forever.
Breakfast, Rick!
I'll be right down!
If I can have your attention.
We are delighted to have as guest judge the foremost scientist in the world.
He's a visiting professor at Empire City University where he's working with the rare element cerillium.
I am so proud to welcome Dr. Stephen Hawking.
Thank you for that warm welcome.
I have a disease that has paralyzed me.
I cannot walk and I use this computer to speak.
But I am not depressed, because I have the gift of knowledge.
That's a lie.
I think about suicide every day.
But you should all be happy with your lives.
You can walk, talk, wipe your own asses and then there's all the sex.
I haven't had sex in years.
My nurse is a lesbian, and not the hot kind.
Hey, anyone want to get high?
I've got some hash with me.
White guy in the dreads, you know what I'm talking about.
Anyone?
Anyone?
Pussies!
Watch where you're going in slo-mo, dipshit.
- Pfft.
- Yeah.
Go to her, stupid.
Tell her how you feel.
Yow.
Uh... he did it.
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Get him, Lance!
- Lance, stop it.
- Kick his ass, Lance!
Fight fight fight!
Damn!
Get... get off me!
Ow ow.
Shit shit shit shit.
Stop!
Stop!
Hey!
Get out of the way!
No brakes!
Get out of the way!
Ma'am, look out!
- How did you...
- I can't believe it.
- You just saved that old lady's life.
- Amazing.
I...
I guess.
If I hadn't pushed her out of the way, she would've die... ah!
You should be really proud of yourself.
You're some kind of hero.
If you could excuse me.
There we go.
Awfully nice of you to help me out here, Trey.
Oh, no problem.
I'm waiting on Rick, anyway, so...
My God.
How did you do that?
Uh, it's easier than it looks.
No, I don't think so.
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
All right.
Well, there is something, okay?
But you have to keep it a secret.
I think I have...
superpowers.
I find that hard to believe.
All right, all right, how about this?
Go ahead and throw as many punches as you want.
I bet you 100 bucks you don't land one.
Easy money.
What else can you do?
I don't know.
I...
I was bitten by a dragonfly.
Well, some dragonflies have armored skin.
I wonder if my skin is...
Well, good thing that worked.
So you do have superpowers.
We could be a team!
We gonna get fame, money...
- Don't forget the bitches.
- There's not gonna be fame and there's not gonna be bitches, okay?
I didn't ask for any of this.
I just wanna be like everybody else.
That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
You're not my father.
But I love you like your father did.
I believe in you like your father did.
I had sex with your mother just like your father did.
Huh.
You'll never understand me.
Never.
That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
What a great performance.
Well, Rick, did you enjoy the opera?
Son, is something troubling you?
It's so unfair.
They have nothing.
I want to change things.
And you will.
One day, Rick, people will look to you to be a hero.
When that day comes, will you be ready?
Give me your wallet.
That too.
Blaine's voice:
People will look to you to be a hero.
When that day comes, will you be ready?
Rick!
Rick, please!
- Dad!
- Oh, Rick, I'm dying.
- No!
- Don't worry.
My brother Albert will take you in.
Rick, the money, it's all yours now.
Sell all shares of a small company called Google.
It's worthless.
Invest heavily in Enron.
Rick, I have something for you.
Reach into my coat pocket.
The other coat pocket.
God!
That ring was my father's and his father's before him.
Earn it, Rick.
Be a hero.
Claim your... destiny.
Dad!
I'm no superhero.
I'm nobody!
- Are you okay?
- What, you heard that?
You're nothing but an ugly, ungrateful little whore!
Just like your mother!
- Who was that?
- My mother.
Listen, about what happened at school this morning, I...
You really freaked us out.
I'm really going through a tough time right now.
Me too.
My parents, they want me to go to college, but I want to be a dancer.
I believe in you.
You really do, don't you?
I wish I could say the same for Lance.
I don't know.
Is he the right one or am I just dating him to rebel against my father?
He doesn't want any boy near me.
That's why he installed the electrified fence.
Well, we'll see.
You can't run from your destiny.
- Right?
- Right.
- Jill, let's go!
- Nice car.
Maybe one day you could take me for a ride in your car.
Uh...
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, definitely.
Oh.
Lovebirds.
Rick, this is Professor Xavier.
Your powers are growing, but you can't control it.
It's important that you... become a hero...
train yourself to fly in your ass because squatting on a glass table two girls...
one cup...
You know what to do.
- This shouldn't take long.
- Well, I'll be waiting right here.
I've reviewed your request for a loan, Mr. Riker, but with no job, no credit history,
I'm afraid I have to say no.
But what about this?
That was last month.
This new promotion's proving quite popular.
Look, I need to buy a car.
Frankly, Mr. Riker, you're the worst applicant we've ever had.
Thanks for the loan, Mr. Thompson.
This is a good boy.
There must be something I could do.
Ma'am... rubbing my crotch under the desk won't change my mind.
I'm not rubbing your crotch.
I really need that car.
I don't see how that's my problem.
This is a robbery!
Nobody move!
Everybody stay down!
Stay down!
- Get down.
- Come on, Lady!
Hurry it up!
- Oh.
- Come on, move it!
Oh, hey, I made the same mistake before when I came in.
Thanks.
You idiot!
You let him get away with our money!
I don't see how that's my problem.
Let me through.
Let me through.
Oh, thank God.
I thought something terrible had happened.
Well, an old guy did get shot over there.
Uncle Albert!
Just try to breathe.
I can't.
You're kneeling on my balls.
Oh, sorry.
Rick, listen.
With great power comes...
Great responsibility?
I was gonna stick with bitches, but if you want to be a virgin for the rest of your life...
Uncle Albert!
My balls!
Oh, God.
Mr. Landers!
Oh no.
Okay.
Hide the body.
Yeah.
Get in!
Yah!
Yah!
Okay, I come back.
Jill?
I came as soon as I heard.
- This is all my fault.
- Rick, it was an armed robbery.
There was nothing you could've done.
I could've stopped that guy before he shot my uncle.
- Rick Riker?
- Yes?
Dr. Whitby.
What brought you here today?
- My uncle.
- Your uncle brought you?
- No, he's gravely injured.
- Well, then he shouldn't be driving.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to perform a breast exam.
Doctor, please.
Is my uncle gonna survive?
Well, I'm not a betting man, but if you want to put some money on it,
- I'll take "dead in a week."
- Oh my God!
No, it's all right.
It's a normal emotional reaction, but this should take the edge off of it.
Here we go.
Nice and easy.
- That's your vein.
- Yes, I know.
First my parents and now this?
I'm nothing but a screw-up.
Yes, your life has been a testament to that.
But your uncle believed in you and so do I.
It's never too late to become the person you're meant to be.
Rick.
Rick.
Hello, Rick.
Who are you and how do you know my name?
- I'm a psychic.
- Prove it.
Think of any number between one and a million and I'll tell you what it is.
- Nine.
- Not out loud, dumbass!
Follow me...
My name is Professor Xavier, and this is my school.
I started it to help people with special talents like yours.
Our students here learn to harness their incredible talents.
and use them to advance the common good.
Here we have children who can walk through walls.
We have children who think they can walk through walls.
Some faces may be familiar, like Wolverine.
Other mutants you probably didn't know existed, like Sneezo.
Most of our students are born with their powers.
Some, like you, gain them later in life.
- Oh, is that...
- Yes, it is.
When he came to this school, he weighed 130 Ibs.
Take enough roids, you could do anything.
Back up off those pills, Barry!
- Why have you brought me here?
- Because you have the potential
- to be the best.
- But I can't even fly.
Once you understand the true nature of heroism, you will fly.
But first I must teach you the secret to becoming a superhero.
Hey, Storm!
You look like you putting on a little weight.
So, Professor, about this secret...
- Well, you see...
- Xavier!
- Aw, shit.
- Well?
You wanna explain why I found her hiding in your closet?
But, pumpkin, I don't see nobody.
- Oh, you don't?
- Ow!
Invisible Girl?
Apparently not invisible enough.
If you knew how to take care of your man, maybe this wouldn't have happened.
- No, she didn't.
- Oh, this bitch is crazy.
I'm gonna have to whip your ass.
- You don't say no disrespectful...
- What are you gonna do, baldy?
I'm everywhere, sweet cheeks.
- That all you got?
- Yeah!
Now what?
Now how about that, Invisi-bitch?
Yeah, whatever.
I'm out of here.
How could you do this to me?
To your kids?
To your newborn baby?
How do I know that baby's even mine?
Because he can do this.
Shit!
Aw, man.
Now I'm never gonna know the secret to becoming a superhero.
You wanna know the secret?
Come close.
Make a costume, shithead!
I swear to God.
They get dumber and dumber every year.
A costume.
Rick, you, uh...
Oh my God.
Damn!
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!
I love the mask.
How you breathe in it though?
What's that sound?
You put some kind of air intake in the mask.
Boy, you better...
now I'm assuming that the material is see-through, right?
Yeah, dude, I'ma tell you something.
Rick, this is good.
I'm impressed.
Like really impressed.
Hey, that's my spot.
You're sitting on my gargoyle.
Move it.
- Excuse me?
- What are you even doing here?
I'm looking seriously out over the city
Well, that's what I do here.
So if you're not moving,
I guess we're gonna have to share.
Uh, okay, fine.
- Uh, I can't perch like this.
- God, me neither.
- What's your name?
- John Storm.
Dragonfly.
So what's your power?
What's my power?
Stand back.
- Flame on!
- Whoa!
Huh?
I'm on fire!
Get a blanket or something!
Holy shit!
It's not working!
Get the fire extinguisher!
Ah!
No!
Ah!
God!
You idiot, stop!
What's wrong with you?
Sorry, my bad.
Rick, once you understand the true nature of heroism, you will fly.
Shit.
This Dragonfly, he's not even a hero.
He's not...
I have...
I have...
I have just a...
I have...
He can't...
he can't even fly.
The Dragonfly can't even fly!
I can fly, okay?
I can fly.
This just in:
Tom Cruise is dead.
Strom, do you have my test results?
I'm afraid you have to kill each day to live each day.
unless you had some cerillium.
Take a look.
Hawking's lab is in the physics building.
I could just walk right in.
You're going to steal cerillium?
No, not me.
But perhaps there's someone inside me.
Someone who will, at any cost, survive!
Oh, glass in my eye.
Glass in my eye!
- Does it hurt?
- Uh, yeah, it hurts.
Well, if you could spread...
spread them with your fingers.
Push your lids with your fingers.
- Two... two... two fingers.
- Are your fingers clean?
That's it.
And roll your eyeball around.
- And push it.
- I'm rolling it!
Dig it out with another piece of glass.
Are you fricking insane?
I'll get the tweezers.
Read about the Dragonfly, world's greatest hero.
- Right here?
- Right here, yup.
Read all about it.
No, you listen to me!
I want that story on my desk or you're fired!
Who the hell are you?
I was wondering if you've got a job opening for...
Job?
!
How dare you come in here and ask me for a job?
I'm the editor in chief!
I know the mayor of Venus!
Hamburgers can see the future!
- Rosie O'Donnell...
- Sorry about this.
We share the building with a mental hospital.
Bad news, boss.
We're nowhere on those Dragonfly photos.
Damn.
Those were tomorrow's lead.
What about these?
Wow!
it's almost like you're the Dragonfly.
Uh, no no no.
See?
Look.
Now that's photography.
Just heard on the scanner, some kind of police standoff at Empire University.
We'll need photos.
Kid, I want you to...
Where'd he go?
Come on, let's go!
This is the chief of police.
We have the building surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.
What the hell is that?
I am the Hourglass.
And your time is up.
It's useless to resist.
I'll fight you to my last breath.
Like the sands of time I am unceasing and relentless.
Evil never triumphs, Hourglass.
You'll pay for your crimes and justice will be... stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Are you okay?
No.
Titanium blades.
They cut through diamonds.
I'm not wearing any diamonds.
I wish I could stay longer, Dragonfly.
But I just don't have the time.
Titanium blades.
Looks like someone found your weakness.
It's not my weakness.
I'm sorry, I forgot.
Your weakness is you can't fly.
Maybe if you had a partner.
I don't need help.
I'm fine all by myself.
She means a lot to you, doesn't she?
What?
Oh, no.
I mean, she's with someone else.
Well, maybe that's for the best.
After all, it could be dangerous, you know, being the girlfriend of the Dragonfly.
I don't know what to do, Aunt Lucille.
- I love her.
- So be it.
But remember, to get to you your enemies will attack the people you care for the most.
Be careful not to hurt the ones you love.
Whoever this Dragonfly is, he's in over his head.
We don't need so-called superheroes.
What Empire City needs is more cops.
And a Hooters.
Jill!
Rick?
I heard you were auditioning for a part so...
Oh, they're beautiful.
God, you are so supportive.
Why can't Lance be more like you?
There's something you're not telling me, isn't there?
Something secret.
Something locked away deep inside.
Well, there is...
Lucille's voice:
Keep your identity a secret, Rick.
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!
Once a month you'll bleed from you vagina.
I... nothing.
Nothing?
Well, I should go.
You're a good friend.
Hey, check this out.
Oh, shit.
- Let's go.
- Get her.
Oh God, it hurts.
It hurts.
Please stop!
I'm begging you!
Wait!
- Where are you?
- Behind you.
You saved my life.
Do I get to thank you?
Go.
Be a hero.
It looks like you're planning a mass murder.
Would you like help?
I'm so happy that you and your boyfriend are spending Thanksgiving with us.
Of course, Lucille.
You need support at a time like this.
Yes, I miss seeing my Albert each morning.
You know, 50 years of marriage creates quite a bond.
I wish I knew love like that.
Oh, you will, dear.
You just have to follow your heart.
That's the thing.
I don't know if I can.
Oh, Jill.
If you can't trust yourself who can you trust?
I know.
But what if my heart is telling me to be with someone
I can't be with?
It's not just any guy.
It's the... forget it.
You'll think I'm crazy.
No, of course not.
You can tell me anything.
I'm very good at keeping secrets.
You'll think it's ridiculous, but... it's the Drag...
- I'll get it.
- Thank you.
Hey, babe.
Oh, I forgot to tell you I kinda invited my uncle.
- Your uncle?
- What?
Set another plate.
Well, okay.
I guess.
Miss Johnson.
Please, excuse my nephew's poor manners.
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Adams, I'm Lou Landers.
I hope this isn't too much of an imposition.
Oh, of course not.
There's always room for one more.
Thank you.
It's just Thanksgiving is for family.
Lance is the only family I have.
- I never married.
- Fruitcake?
Nope, just never met the right woman.
Ah, yes, Lance told me Rick Riker was your neighbor.
Where is Rick?
That's odd.
I thought he was out.
I'll go check on him.
Please, you're busy.
Allow me.
Thank you.
Upstairs, second door to the right.
Rick?
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, Mr. Landers.
Rick.
No, you're just on time.
Everybody, take your seat.
Not till we say grace.
Jesus!
Amen.
Please start, everyone.
This all looks so delicious, Lucille.
We have Rick to thank for it.
Ever since Albert...
Rick has been supporting me with his new job.
New job?
You didn't tell me.
Oh well, I'm sort of the Dragonfly's unofficial photographer.
What happened to your arm?
Uh... a bike messenger knocked me down.
I see your wrist is bandaged.
Yes, I burned it on some hot coffee.
And you have a cut on your lip.
Uh... my crackpipe broke.
You have a scratch on your neck.
Yes, I... met a girl on Craigslist.
And you have a bruise on your neck.
I... met a guy on Craigslist.
I'm sorry, Lance.
We have to go.
- Why?
- I... shat my pants.
I'll drive.
- Thanks for helping clean up.
- Of course.
Poor thing's so tired.
Yeah, well, you know old folks after a big meal.
So... you know the Dragonfly?
Uh... yeah, I guess.
You could sorta say we're close.
Has he...
has he ever asked about me?
Um, yeah.
- Yeah, once.
- What did you tell him?
Well, I said...
I told him...
I told him, "The thing about Jill is... when you look in her eyes and she looks back in yours... you know that you'd do anything anything to be a better person than you are.
So that... if you were ever lucky enough to be with her, you could earn every second of her perfect... grace, and her limitless beauty... and her unending love.
- Don't cry.
- I'm not.
My eyes are burning.
Rick, I want you to know that was the most beautiful thing anyone's ever said to me.
- Scented candle?
- Thank you.
Rick, I'm so confused, and yet...
I know exactly what I want.
Sorry to drop in uninvited.
It's okay.
We were hoping someone would open a window.
It was getting stuffy in here.
So this is the lair of the Dragonfly.
- How did you...
- No no no,
I'm not here to fight you.
I've got... thousands of other people I plan to kill.
This little visit is just to show you who'll get hurt if you get in my way.
Never!
Time to go.
The woman, Lucille Adams of East Empire City,
- was badly injured.
- How was she injured?
- Badly.
- What about the Dragonfly?
All I can tell you is this:
he didn't save anyone tonight.
Doctor, how is she?
I'm afraid your aunt's taken a turn for the worse.
She can't speak, she can't walk, she had no control over her bowels.
That's... that's awful.
I know.
I went ahead and set up a MySpace page for her under "crazy shit machine."
She already has 40 friends.
Wait a minute.
That's somebody else's aunt.
Your aunt has no problem with her bowels...
- Oh, thank God.
- ...because she's dead.
I'm truly sorry, Rick, but there is a silver lining.
Your uncle came out of his coma this morning.
He did?
Yes, but you mustn't tell him about your aunt just yet.
He's in a delicate mental state.
The slightest bit of bad news could send him spiraling right back into a coma.
I understand.
Mr. Adams, you have a visitor.
- Is it Lucille?
- No, sir, it's not your dead wife.
It's your nephew Rick.
Remember, no bad news.
Now, sir, here you go.
This is my bill.
- You did surgery on me?
- Yes, sir, we confused you with one of our sex-change patients, but don't worry, we didn't remove your penis.
We did cut your testicles off, but, well, since your wife's dead, you won't be needing them anyway.
You just want to keep his spirits up.
He'll land on his feet in no time.
We are gathered today to say goodbye
- to Lucille Adams.
- Goodbye!
And now the eulogy.
It's tragic to think this is the last time that I can look upon my wife's face.
God, Lucille!
How could you take her from me?
I can't live without her!
Lucille!
Snookie lumps!
I'm sorry, there's been a terrible mistake.
This is your wife.
She is this man's wife.
Give me five minutes.
- Uncle Albert!
- I'm not finished.
You're one lucky guy.
Now... where's Lucille?
Ah, Lucille!
I do have this coupon for a cremation.
Rick?
I am so sorry for your loss.
What is it?
I know I said some things, but now more than ever, I realize... we can never be together.
I don't believe you.
You love me, Rick.
I know you do.
Jill, trust me.
I'm telling you this for your own good.
I don't love you.
You're no longer in my five.
How could you?
# When I was young #
# I never needed anyone #
# Makin' love was just for fun #
# Those days are gone #
# All by myself #
# Don't wanna be #
# All by myself #
# Anymore #
# All by myself #
# Don't wanna be #
# All by myself. #
You can't keep getting lucky, man.
You only beat me by two strokes this time.
And the back nine is what killed.
Oh my God!
- Look at this place.
- Yo, what are you doing, man?
You gotta pull yourself together, dude.
What's the point?
Look at you...
eating junk food, wearing fake beards, and we found your costume in the garbage outside.
Yeah, well, I'm not the Dragonfly anymore.
But you said the Hourglass was going to kill thousands of people.
I told you I'm no hero.
All right?
Aunt Lucille's dead,
I've rejected the only girl I've ever loved and I can't even fly.
I wish I'd never been bitten by that stupid dragonfly.
And maybe your father shouldn't have given you this after all.
Look at the words your ancestors inscribed in that ring.
"Honor, valor, sacrifice, duty, commitment, bravery, justice, integrity, brotherhood, self-esteem, low prices, affordable housing, loose-fitting pants, cheap internet porn."
The rest is in Latin.
Rick, the hero's path is dangerous.
You may fail or you may fly.
All that matters is that you do it for the best of reasons.
Helping others, Rick, that's what makes you a real hero.
Maybe you're right, but even if I wanted to stop the Hourglass,
I wouldn't know where to start.
I mean, where's he gonna find thousands of people in one place?
Look.
Reporting here live from the Empire City convention center where thousands of people are in one place, but none of them more important than the attendees of the World Humanity Awards.
I'll drive.
Well, that shortcut through the playground... sure saved us some time.
You go ahead,
I'll find a place to park.
Mister, please stop!
Each year the World Humanity Awards are held to honor the greatest achievements on behalf of all humanity.
This gala event is expected to draw the world's most prestigious leaders to Empire City.
- Excuse us, excuse us!
- "Empire City Times."
Damn!
Look, there go Prince Charles.
And Nelson Mandela.
Nelson!
Hey, I was in jail too, man.
One of the guests here is the Hourglass.
But which one?
Thank you so much for inviting us, Mr. Landers.
Well, when you're being honored by the world, you want your family with you.
Perhaps one day, you could be part of our family too.
Ladies and gentlemen, our first award is for the medical breakthrough of the year.
For his company's pioneering work in the field of feminine hygiene
I award Lou Landers douchebag of the year.
# Douchebag #
# He's the douchebag of the year #
# Now ain't he great, folks?
#
# Ain't he grand?
The douchebag of the year. #
# Douchebag #
# He's Mr. Douchebag of the year #
# Look at him smile, look at him shine #
# He's the douchebag of, the douchebag of the year. #
Hold up the douchebag!
Hold up the douchebag, sir.
Stop right there, Landers.
Mr. Riker.
So... you know.
You're damn right I do.
Someone in this auditorium is the Hourglass.
I need your help to figure out who it is.
Now the Hourglass could be anyone... a guest of honor... maybe even a stagehand.
This may be nothing, but I did see a man with what looked like a canister of cerillium.
Who?
This year's lifetime achievement award...
Him.
...goes to one of the world's greatest souls,
His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.
This man isn't who you think he is, he's the Hourglass.
No no, I'm a man of peace.
Shut up!
You're plotting to kill all these people and I can prove it.
Show the world the armor you're hiding under these robes.
You can't fool me, Hourglass.
You're packing 10 Ibs of Cerillium under there.
What?
Take him down.
Tutu.
Peace!
Pea...
Shit shit shit shit shit.
You!
You're the Hourglass.
Hourglass!
- Hero con?
- It's a convention for people who like to dress up as their favorite heroes and villains.
- By the way, your costume sucks.
- Out of my way!
Hourglass, you'll never get away with this!
Forget it, Dragonfly.
You're too late.
Run!
Yeah.
Goodbye... little fly.
Dragonfly!
No!
My eye!
Dragonfly, you must stop the Hourglass.
I can't.
I can't fly.
If there is one lesson my life can teach, it is that the spirit is stronger than the body.
The hero comes from within.
Those are Celine Dion lyrics.
Whatever.
It's still true.
You're right.
It's working.
Sorry.
Watch, Dragonfly, as your city dies.
Where... am I?
You're with me, your lover.
Dragonfly!
No.
- No.
- Only now do you understand.
Oh, come...
Aha!
I need you to yank this off.
Yeah.
There's not enough time.
Oh fuck.
- It's over.
- Dragonfly!
Jill!
Gotcha.
Rick?
You didn't think I'd let anything happen to the girl I love, did you?
Well, we're still falling.
Damn it!
If only I could fly.
Maybe I wasn't cut out to be a hero.
You know, maybe I was meant to have a normal job... an accountant, a gym teacher.
- This is a really tall building.
- Rick!
I don't care what happens anymore.
If I die, I die happily in your arms.
You're my hero, Rick Riker, and I love you.
Yes!
Oh, thank God!
We only have 50 stories left.
Hang on.
Thank you, Dragonfly.
Because of you, our city is safe at last.
- You said it, Dr. Hawking.
- Shit!
It's a happy ending for us all.
Let's go get some dinner.
I'm buying.
Who am I?
I'm Rick Riker.
I'm the Dragonfly.
And as long as there's crime and injustice
I will forever be a superhero...
I am the Hourglass!

Stop!
Stop the bus!
The story of my life is not for the faint of heart.
Thanks.
But, like any story worth telling, it's all about a girl.
Not that girl.
- Hey.
Hi.
- I don't think that is a girl.
No, it's about this girl...
Jill Johnson.
Ever since I can remember I've been in love with her, but she barely knows I exist.
Yo, Rick!
Yo, come here, man!
I got you a seat down here.
What's...
I'll call y'all back.
Everybody, bye.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, Trey.
Dude, I'm so psyched for this class trip.
We about to see some real serious cutting-edge shit.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yo, you got any C batteries on you?
AAs?
Got that new sandwich from Sony in my backpack.
Wi-Fi... mmm!
Yo!
You got to forget about her, dawg.
Look look.
Let me show you something.
She not even looking at you.
If I could just tell her how I feel.
Look, Rick, I already told you... you never gonna get with Jill, all right?
Seriously, she hangs out with the popular crew, and nobody messes around outside their group, man.
Come on, that crew stuff isn't real.
The hell it ain't.
Look around, Rick.
- Look, you got your jocks...
- Get the ball, man.
...nerds, emos,
Frodos, the Scarface society the sexual predators.
- Yeah.
- Of course you got the Rick punchers.
- The who?
- Oh!
- Yeah, they new.
Mm-hmm.
But you know what?
Who cares?
'Cause we got our own crew...
me and you.
Thanks, Trey.
You're the best, man.
- Am I in?
- No.
Come on.
Hey, it's me and you, baby.
The two of us against the world.
You hear me?
You look good today.
I like your hair.
I'm gonna show you something nasty I downloaded.
Don't tell nobody.
Welcome to Amalgamated.
I'm Dr. Strom, head of the research department...
- Come on, man.
...where we create the future today.
And now I'd like to show you our crown jewel.
The Amalgamated animal genetics lab.
Whoa.
Go ahead, explore.
Yo yo.
Come on, Rick.
Man, check this out.
All of our animals are genetically engineered and each of them has...
Oh, you're so pretty.
Hi, birdie.
Hi.
Hi.
- She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Yes, she is.
Uh, I'm gonna take a picture of her for the school newspaper.
Our only rules:
Don't feed the animals and please, no flash photography.
Some of our genetically- engineered animals are a little sensitive to light.
It flew away.
Uh... whoo-hoo.
What the F, loser?
Get him, Lance.
- Come on, Lance.
- Leave him alone.
- I don't think so.
Is there a problem, Lance?
No.
No problem, Uncle Lou.
Mr. Landers!
Students, this is Lou Landers, visionary scientist and C.E.O. of Amalgamated.
Well, I'm just a businessman now.
The future of science belongs to all of you.
Please, enjoy the tour.
Are you okay?
Yes, this is healthy-cough blood.
Rick Riker.
You're not Blaine and Julia Riker's son, are you?
- I am.
- Ah.
Good people.
- How are they?
- They died violently nine years ago.
But otherwise okay?
Yes, thank you.
I live with my aunt and uncle now.
Well, you seem like a real chip off the old block.
Let's hope you're not violently murdered too.
That's for making me look stupid.
Next time I hurt you.
Yeah.
You the man, Lance.
Our work with these animals has helped us develop new antibiotics, advanced pesticides and a powerful new pheromone which drives animals to mate called compound H2O0.
It's a strong sexual attractant.
A single drop is enough to arouse any animal.
We plan on using it to breed endangered species.
A special and indeed often overlooked...
Our most-promising research is with these dragonflies.
For example, this dragonfly's skin has a hard, armor-like exoskeleton to defend against...
And this species of dragonfly has enormous strength for its size.
It can lift vast amounts.
More than it's body weight.
And here we've injected the DNA from all three species into seven new genetically-enhanced super dragonflies.
But there's only six in there.
Well, one missing dragonfly is the least of my concerns.
I lost six tigers alone last month.
Ah!
This area is where we keep our livestock.
Ohh.
Aren't you going to do something?
Soon as I get this up on YouTube.
I see.
Ye... well, yes, I understand.
Thank you for the call.
That was the principal.
Rick walked off a class trip.
After all the parenting you've done, he's still so troubled.
Why do you think that is, Albert?
I have no idea, Lucille.
I have taught him everything I know about being a man.
And a good man you are after all these years of marriage.
It's like we first met.
Sure, you're a little older.
Your hair's grey.
You have crow's feet.
It takes you an hour to pee.
Your thighs look like cottage cheese someone threw up on a hot sidewalk.
And you've always had a tiny penis.
Well... what does it matter when you're in love?
Oh, Rick.
We were wondering where you were.
It's so late.
About time you got home.
Your aunt was getting worried.
You can sleep late in the morning, but don't forget to feed the fish.
Attaboy.
I don't know.
Something just doesn't seem quite right with him today.
Teenagers.
I'll talk to him.
Rough day, huh?
Well, I won't lie to you.
Puberty is a difficult time in a young man's life.
Now this book may explain what's happening.
Let's see.
There are mood swings, fluid retention, and once a month you'll bleed from your vagina.
This may be the wrong book.
What's important is that you're on the verge of adulthood.
Here...
take a drink.
Ah, the rituals of manhood.
Today you have your first beer, and tomorrow we'll circumcise you.
I'm losing patience, Dr. Strom.
Please, sir, if you could just wait a few minutes...
I've waited long enough for this egomaniac.
We're the board of directors.
Our time is valuable.
Not as valuable as mine, Mr. Carlson.
You see, I have a terminal illness.
I've been fighting it for years, but the disease has ravaged my organs.
As of this moment, I have one hour left to live.
It was on sale.
Gentlemen, if you're ready, allow me to show you the future.
Strom.
From the...
lift it ov...
lift it over!
What the hell is that?
An innovation...
thank you... that will not only save my life but the life of this company.
For too long we've scraped out profits from pills and injections.
The real prize is the total cure.
A device that can alter DNA and restore the body to perfect health.
- You're crazy.
- No.
Crazy is hearing voices, talking to cats, dating Paula Abdul.
I'm not crazy.
I'm a visionary!
Sir.
Sir, the machine's never been fully tested.
If something should go wrong...
- Start the machine!
- Yes, sir.
Plasma level is steady.
Genetic modification's at optimum levels!
Sir, the core is overheating.
- Ah!
- We have to abort!
Did it work?
I'm so sorry.
Well, well, well.
I want you to know what a joy it will be running this company without you in the way.
Let go.
Let me go.
Gentlemen, I think it's time we made some personnel changes.
No, stay away!
Oh.
How long was I asleep?
Five days.
Huh.
Wait.
Wha...
Oh, Dad.
I thought you'd live forever.
Oh.
Breakfast, Rick!
I'll be right down!
Oh!
If I can have your attention.
We are delighted to have as guest judge the foremost scientist in the world.
He's a visiting professor at Empire City University where he's working with the rare element cerillium.
I am so proud to welcome Dr. Stephen Hawking.
Thank you for that warm welcome.
I have a disease that has paralyzed me.
I cannot walk and I use this computer to speak.
But I am not depressed, because I have the gift of knowledge.
That's a lie.
I think about suicide every day.
But you should all be happy with your lives.
You can walk, talk, wipe your own asses and then there's all the sex.
I haven't had sex in years.
My nurse is a lesbian, and not the hot kind.
Hey, anyone want to get high?
- I've got some hash with me.
- No way.
White guy in the dreads, you know what I'm talking about.
Can I get a what what?
Holla.
I've got a stiff pole for your sweet hole.
Anyone?
Anyone?
Pussies.
Dr. Hawking, I am such a fan.
I'd love to show you my project on supernovas.
You have an incredible ass stromony career ahead of you.
Wait, where's Saturn?
I'd hate to lose my father's bowling ball.
There it is.
Great reflexes.
You have very manly hands.
So do you.
I'm gonna go find a spot for my project.
Yeah, okay.
Watch where you're going in slo-mo, dipshit.
- Pfft.
- Yeah.
Go to her, stupid.
Tell her how you feel.
Yow.
Any day.
Uh... he did it.
Ow!
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Get him, Lance!
- Lance, stop it.
- Kick his ass, Lance!
Fight fight fight!
- Let's see what you got.
- Fucking break him!
Whoa!
Oh!
Damn!
Ooh!
Get off!
Get... get off me!
Yah!
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
Shit shit shit shit.
# Oh no, you didn't, didn't #
- # Oh no, you didn't # - # Oh yes, we did #
# Oh no, you didn't, didn't, Oh no, you didn't #
- # Oh yeah, we did # - # Oh no, you didn't, didn't #
- # Oh no, you didn't # - # Oh yes, we did. #
Stop!
Stop!
Hey!
Get out of the way!
No brakes!
Get out of the way!
Ma'am, look out!
Are you okay?
- How did you...
- I can't believe it.
- You just saved that old lady's life.
- Amazing.
I...
I guess.
If I hadn't pushed her out of the way, she would've die... ah!
You should be really proud of yourself.
You're some kind of hero.
If you could excuse me.
There we go.
Awfully nice of you to help me out here, Trey.
Oh, no problem.
I'm waiting on Rick, anyway, so...
Ooh.
My God.
How did you do that?
Uh, it's easier than it looks.
No, I don't think so.
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
All right.
Well, there is something, okay?
But you have to keep it a secret.
I think I have...
superpowers.
I find that hard to believe.
All right, all right, how about this?
Go ahead and throw as many punches as you want.
I bet you 100 bucks you don't land one.
Easy money.
What else can you do?
I don't know.
I...
I was bitten by a dragonfly.
Well, some dragonflies have armored skin.
I wonder if my skin is...
Well, good thing that worked.
So you do have superpowers.
We could be a team!
We gonna get fame, money...
- Don't forget the bitches.
- There's not gonna be fame and there's not gonna be bitches, okay?
I didn't ask for any of this.
I just wanna be like everybody else.
That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
You're not my father.
But I love you like your father did.
I believe in you like your father did.
I had sex with your mother just like your father did.
Huh.
You'll never understand me.
Never.
That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
What a great performance.
Well, Rick, did you enjoy the opera?
Son, is something troubling you?
It's so unfair.
They have nothing.
Why do we have $2 billion?
Well, your grandfather left us $3 billion and I made some bad investments.
But that's nothing for you to worry about.
But I want to change things.
And you will.
Five generations of Rikers have worked hard to make this city great.
One day, Rick, people will look to you to be a hero.
When that day comes, will you be ready?
Give me your wallet.
That too.
People will look to you to be a hero.
When that day comes, will you be ready?
Rick!
Ah!
Ow!
Huh?
Ah!
Rick, please!
Ah!
- Dad!
- Oh, Rick, I'm dying.
- No!
- Don't worry.
My brother Albert will take you in.
Rick, the money, it's all yours now.
Sell all shares of a small company called Google.
It's worthless.
Invest heavily in Enron.
Rick, I have something for you.
Reach into my coat pocket.
The other coat pocket.
God!
That ring was my father's and his father's before him.
Earn it, Rick.
Be a hero.
Claim your...
- destiny.
Dad!
I'm no superhero.
I'm nobody!
Ah!
Shut up back there!
I'm gonna kill you!
- Are you okay?
- What, you heard that?
You're nothing but an ugly, ungrateful little whore!
Just like your mother!
- Who was that?
- My mother.
Listen, about what happened at school this morning, I...
You really freaked us out.
I'm really going through a tough time right now.
Me too.
My parents, they want me to go to college, but I want to be a dancer.
I believe in you.
You really do, don't you?
I wish I could say the same for Lance.
I don't know.
Is he the right one or am I just dating him to rebel against my father?
He doesn't want any boy near me.
That's why he installed the electrified fence.
Well, we'll see.
You can't run from your destiny.
- Right?
- Right.
- Jill, let's go!
- Nice car.
Maybe one day you could take me for a ride in your car.
Uh...
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, definitely.
Oh.
Lovebirds.
Rick, this is Professor Xavier.
Your powers are growing, but you can't control it.
It's important that you... become a hero...
train yourself to fly in your ass because squatting on a glass table two girls...
one cup...
You know what to do.
- This shouldn't take long.
- Well, I'll be waiting right here.
Hello, Mr. Bailey.
I've reviewed your request for a loan, Mr. Riker, but with no job, no credit history,
I'm afraid I have to say no.
But what about this?
That was last month.
This new promotion's proving quite popular.
Look, I need to buy a car.
Frankly, Mr. Riker, you're the worst applicant we've ever had.
Thanks for the loan, Mr. Thompson.
This is a good boy.
There must be something I could do.
Ma'am... rubbing my crotch under the desk won't change my mind.
I'm not rubbing your crotch.
I really need that car.
I don't see how that's my problem.
This is a robbery!
Nobody move!
Everybody stay down!
Stay down!
- Get down.
- Come on, Lady!
Hurry it up!
- Oh.
- Come on, move it!
Oh, hey, I made the same mistake before when I came in.
Thanks.
You idiot!
You let him get away with our money!
I don't see how that's my problem.
- Oh, man!
- Wow.
Come over here!
You've got to see this.
Let me through.
Let me through.
Oh, thank God.
I thought something terrible had happened.
Well, an old guy did get shot over there.
Uncle Albert!
Just try to breathe.
I can't.
You're kneeling on my balls.
Oh, sorry.
Rick, listen.
With great power comes...
Great responsibility?
I was gonna stick with bitches, but if you want to be a virgin for the rest of your life...
Uncle Albert!
My balls!
Very good.
Oh, God.
Mr. Landers!
Oh no.
Okay.
Hide the body.
Hide the body.
Yeah.
Get in!
Yah!
Yah!
Okay, I come back.
Jill?
I came as soon as I heard.
- Where's Aunt Lucille?
- She's at home under heavy sedation.
They made her watch three hours of women's basketball.
- This is all my fault.
- Rick, it was an armed robbery.
There was nothing you could've done.
I could've stopped that guy before he shot my uncle.
Then there is blood on your hands.
But that's not important.
All that matters is that you're here for him now.
- Rick Riker?
- Yes?
Dr. Whitby.
I've run some tests.
I'm afraid I have bad news.
What is it?
I have an impacted colon.
Whew.
What a night.
Now what brought you here today?
- My uncle.
- Your uncle brought you?
- No, he's gravely injured.
- Well, then he shouldn't be driving.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to perform a breast exam.
Doctor, please.
Is my uncle gonna survive?
Well, I don't know.
We should probably have a look.
Hard to say.
Yup, pretty deep coma.
Is he gonna be okay?
Well, I'm not a betting man, but if you want to put some money on it,
- I'll take "dead in a week."
- Oh my God!
No, it's all right.
It's a normal emotional reaction, but this should take the edge off of it.
Here we go.
Nice and easy.
- That's your vein.
- Yes, I know.
First my parents and now this?
I'm nothing but a screw-up.
Yes, your life has been a testament to that.
But your uncle believed in you and so do I.
It's never too late to become the person you're meant to be.
Rick.
Rick.
Rick.
Hello, Rick.
Who are you and how do you know my name?
- I'm a psychic.
- Prove it.
Think of any number between one and a million and I'll tell you what it is.
- Nine.
- Not out loud, dumbass!
Follow me... you dumb son of a bitch.
My name is Professor Xavier, and this is my school.
I started it to help people with special talents like yours.
Our students here learn to harness their incredible talents.
and use them to advance the common good.
Ah!
Ow.
Here we have children who can walk through walls.
We have children who think they can walk through walls.
Some faces may be familiar, like Wolverine.
Other mutants you probably didn't know existed, like Sneezo.
Most of our students are born with their powers.
Some, like you, gain them later in life.
- Oh, is that...
- Yes, it is.
When he came to this school, he weighed 130 lbs.
Take enough roids, you could do anything.
Back up off those pills, Barry!
- Why have you brought me here?
- Because you have the potential
- to be the best.
- But I can't even fly.
Once you understand the true nature of heroism, you will fly.
But first I must teach you the secret to becoming a superhero.
Hey, Storm!
You look like you putting on a little weight.
Ah!
Oh!
So, Professor, about this secret...
- Well, you see...
- Xavier!
- Aw, shit.
- Well?
You wanna explain why I found her hiding in your closet?
But, pumpkin, I don't see nobody.
- Oh, you don't?
- Ow!
Invisible Girl?
Apparently not invisible enough.
If you knew how to take care of your man, maybe this wouldn't have happened.
- No, she didn't.
- Oh, this bitch is crazy.
I'm gonna have to whip your ass.
- You don't say no disrespectful...
- What are you gonna do, baldy?
I'm everywhere, sweet cheeks.
- Whoa!
- Ow!
- That all you got?
- Yeah!
Now what?
Now how about that, Invisi-bitch?
Yeah, whatever.
I'm out of here.
I'm sure gonna miss her.
She was crazy in the sack.
Biting, scratching, panting, tongue all over the place.
Wasn't me, asshole.
Come on, Spanky.
I didn't even know she had a dog.
Still some of the best sex I ever had.
How could you do this to me?
To your kids?
To your newborn baby?
How do I know that baby's even mine?
Because he can do this.
Shit!
Ah!
Aw, man.
Now I'm never gonna know the secret to becoming a superhero.
You wanna know the secret?
Come close.
Make a costume, shithead!
I swear to God.
They get dumber and dumber every year.
A costume.
Rick, you, uh...
Oh my God.
Damn!
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!
I love the mask.
How you breathe in it though?
What's that sound?
You put some kind of air intake in the mask.
Boy, you better...
now I'm assuming that the material is see-through, right?
Yeah, dude, I'ma tell you something.
Rick, this is good.
I'm impressed.
Like really impressed.
Hey, that's my spot.
You're sitting on my gargoyle.
Move it.
- Excuse me?
- What are you even doing here?
I'm looking seriously out over the city in a squatting position.
Well, that's what I do here.
So if you're not moving,
I guess we're gonna have to share.
Uh, okay, fine.
I actually usually perch in the front.
Oh, all right.
Well, here, you've got to go around.
- Okay, wait.
- Just turn this way.
Here we go.
- Dude!
- You're right, I'm sorry.
Relax.
- Okay okay.
- Okay okay.
- Uh, I can't perch like this.
- God, me neither.
- What's your name?
- John Storm.
Dragonfly.
So what's your power?
What's my power?
Stand back.
- Flame on!
- Whoa!
Huh?
I'm on fire!
Get a blanket or something!
Holy shit!
It's not working!
Get the fire extinguisher!
Ah!
No!
Ah!
God!
You idiot, stop!
What's wrong with you?
Sorry, my bad.
Rick, once you understand the true nature of heroism, you will fly.
Shit.
This Dragonfly, he's not even a hero.
He's not...
I have...
I have...
I have just a...
I have...
He can't...
he can't even fly.
The Dragonfly can't even fly!
I can fly, okay?
I can fly.
This just in:
Tom Cruise is dead.
World's most powerful man.
I have a feeling you might disagree with that.
Strom, do you have my test results?
Yes, sir.
Whatever you're doing to your... victims, rejuvenates you.
But only for 24 hours.
Hmmm.
What if I killed 28 people in one session?
Would that give me a month to live?
If it were February, yes.
But only if your cells could absorb that much energy at once, and they can't.
I'm afraid you have to kill each day to live each day.
Still a slave to the tyranny of time.
There must be some answer.
There isn't.
Unless... unless you had some cerillium.
Then you could create a device powerful enough to draw the life-force out of thousands of people and enhance your own cellular capacity.
Strom, you're a genius.
Wikipedia.
But that's not important.
What is important is that you don't have any cerillium.
Besides, it's immoral.
We don't do that sort of thing.
We're a pharmaceutical company.
Wait a minute.
Take a look.
Hawking's lab is in the physics building.
I could just walk right in.
You're going to steal cerillium?
No, not me.
I'm a law abiding citizen.
But perhaps there's someone inside me.
Someone unfettered by the rule of law.
Someone who will, at any cost, survive!
Ow!
Oh, glass in my eye.
Glass in my eye!
- Does it hurt?
- Uh, yeah, it hurts.
Well, if you could spread...
spread them with your fingers.
Push your lids with your fingers.
- Two... two... two fingers.
- Are your fingers clean?
That's it.
And roll your eyeball around.
- And push it.
- I'm rolling it!
Dig it out with another piece of glass.
Are you fricking insane?
I'll get the tweezers.
Read about the Dragonfly, world's greatest hero.
- Right here?
- Right here, yup.
Read all about it.
No, you listen to me!
I want that story on my desk or you're fired!
Who the hell are you?
I was wondering if you've got a job opening for...
Job?
!
How dare you come in here and ask me for a job?
I'm the editor in chief!
I know the mayor of Venus!
Hamburgers can see the future!
- Rosie O'Donnell...
- Sorry about this.
We share the building with a mental hospital.
Bad news, boss.
We're nowhere on those Dragonfly photos.
Damn.
Those were tomorrow's lead.
What about these?
Wow!
it's almost like you're the Dragonfly.
Uh, no no no.
See?
Look.
Now that's photography.
Just heard on the scanner, some kind of police standoff at Empire University.
We'll need photos.
Kid, I want you to...
Where'd he go?
Come on, let's go!
This is the chief of police.
We have the building surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.
What the hell is that?
I am the Hourglass.
And your time is up.
Get him, Dragonfly.
It's over, Hourglass.
No, Dragonfly.
It's just begun!
It's useless to resist.
I'll fight you to my last breath.
Like the sands of time I am unceasing and relentless.
Evil never triumphs, Hourglass.
You'll pay for your crimes and justice will... stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Are you okay?
No.
Titanium blades.
They cut through diamonds.
I'm not wearing any diamonds.
Ooh, ow!
Ow!
I wish I could stay longer, Dragonfly.
But I just don't have the time.
Whoever this Dragonfly is, he's in over his head.
We don't need so-called superheroes.
What Empire City needs is more cops.
And a Hooters.
Titanium blades.
Looks like someone found your weakness.
It's not my weakness.
I'm sorry, I forgot.
Your weakness is you can't fly.
Maybe if you had a partner.
I don't need help.
I'm fine all by myself.
She means a lot to you, doesn't she?
What?
Oh, no.
I mean, she's with someone else.
Well, maybe that's for the best.
After all, it could be dangerous, you know, being the girlfriend of the Dragonfly.
I don't know what to do, Aunt Lucille.
- I love her.
- So be it.
But remember, to get to you your enemies will attack the people you care for the most.
Be careful not to hurt the ones you love.
And shave your pubes.
No one wants to go down on a tumbleweed.
Jill!
Rick?
I heard you were auditioning for a part so...
Oh, they're beautiful.
God, you are so supportive.
Why can't Lance be more like you?
There's something you're not telling me, isn't there?
Something secret.
Something locked away deep inside.
It was summer camp.
We had to share a shower.
You trip and fall with your mouth open on one guys...
No!
I mean, in here.
Well, there is...
Keep your identity a secret, Rick.
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!
Once a month you'll bleed from you vagina.
I... nothing.
Nothing?
Well, I should go.
You're a good friend.
Hey, check this out.
Hey, check this out.
Oh, shit.
- Let's go.
- Get her.
Oh God, it hurts.
It hurts.
Please stop!
I'm begging you!
Wait!
- Where are you?
- Behind you.
You saved my life.
Do I get to thank you?
Go.
Be a hero.
Yeah.
It looks like you're planning a mass murder.
Would you like help?
Paper clip guy.
I'm so happy that you and your boyfriend are spending Thanksgiving with us.
Of course, Lucille.
You need support at a time like this.
Yes, I miss seeing my Albert each morning.
You know, 50 years of marriage creates quite a bond.
I wish I knew love like that.
Oh, you will, dear.
You just have to follow your heart.
That's the thing.
I don't know if I can.
Oh, Jill.
If you can't trust yourself who can you trust?
I know.
But what if my heart is telling me to be with someone
I can't be with?
It's not just any guy.
It's the... forget it.
You'll think I'm crazy.
No, of course not.
You can tell me anything.
I'm very good at keeping secrets.
You'll think it's ridiculous, but... it's the Drag...
- I'll get it.
- Thank you.
Hey, babe.
Oh, I forgot to tell you I kinda invited my uncle.
- Your uncle?
- What?
Set another plate.
Well, okay.
I guess.
Miss Johnson.
Please, excuse my nephew's poor manners.
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Adams, I'm Lou Landers.
I hope this isn't too much of an imposition.
Oh, of course not.
There's always room for one more.
Thank you.
It's just Thanksgiving is for family.
Lance is the only family I have.
- I never married.
- Fruitcake?
Nope, just never met the right woman.
Ah, yes, Lance told me Rick Riker was your neighbor.
Where is Rick?
That's odd.
I thought he was out.
I'll go check on him.
Please, you're busy.
Allow me.
Thank you.
Upstairs, second door to the right.
Rick?
Hmmm.
Hmmm.
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, Mr. Landers.
Rick.
No, you're just on time.
Everybody, take your seat.
Ohhh.
Ah ah ah!
Not till we say grace.
Jesus!
Amen.
Please start, everyone.
This all looks so delicious, Lucille.
We have Rick to thank for it.
Ever since Albert...
Rick has been supporting me with his new job.
New job?
You didn't tell me.
Oh well, I'm sort of the Dragonfly's unofficial photographer.
What happened to your arm?
Uh... a bike messenger knocked me down.
I see your wrist is bandaged.
Yes, I burned it on some hot coffee.
And you have a cut on your lip.
Uh... my crackpipe broke.
You have a scratch on your neck.
Yes, I... met a girl on Craigslist.
And you have a bruise on your neck.
I... met a guy on Craigslist.
I'm sorry, Lance.
We have to go.
- Why?
- I... shat my pants.
I'll drive.
- Thanks for helping clean up.
- Of course.
Poor thing's so tired.
Yeah, well, you know old folks after a big meal.
So... you know the Dragonfly?
Uh... yeah, I guess.
You could sorta say we're close.
Has he...
has he ever asked about me?
Um, yeah.
- Yeah, once.
- What did you tell him?
Well, I said...
I told him...
I told him, "The thing about Jill is... when you look in her eyes and she looks back in yours...
- you know that you'd do anything anything to be a better person than you are.
So that...
- if you were ever lucky enough to be with her, you could earn every second of her perfect...
- grace, and her limitless beauty...
- and her unending love.
- Don't cry.
- I'm not.
My eyes are burning.
Rick, I want you to know that was the most beautiful thing anyone's ever said to me.
- Scented candle?
- Thank you.
Rick, I'm so confused, and yet...
- I know exactly what I want.
Sorry to drop in uninvited.
It's okay.
We were hoping someone would open a window.
It was getting stuffy in here.
So this is the lair of the Dragonfly.
- How did you...
- No no no,
I'm not here to fight you.
I've got thousands of other people I plan to kill.
This little visit is just to show you who'll get hurt if you get in my way.
Never!
Time to go.
The woman, Lucille Adams of East Empire City,
- was badly injured.
- How was she injured?
- Badly.
- What about the Dragonfly?
All I can tell you is this:
he didn't save anyone tonight.
Doctor, how is she?
I'm afraid your aunt's taken a turn for the worse.
She can't speak, she can't walk, she had no control over her bowels.
That's... that's awful.
I know.
I went ahead and set up a MySpace page for her under "crazy shit machine."
She already has 40 friends.
Wait a minute.
That's somebody else's aunt.
Your aunt has no problem with her bowels...
- Oh, thank God.
...because she's dead.
I'm truly sorry, Rick, but there is a silver lining.
Your uncle came out of his coma this morning.
He did?
Yes, but you mustn't tell him about your aunt just yet.
He's in a delicate mental state.
The slightest bit of bad news could send him spiraling right back into a coma.
I understand.
Mr. Adams, you have a visitor.
- Is it Lucille?
- No, sir, it's not your dead wife.
It's your nephew Rick.
Remember, no bad news.
Now, sir, here you go.
This is my bill.
- You did surgery on me?
- Yes, sir, we confused you with one of our sex-change patients, but don't worry, we didn't remove your penis.
We did cut your testicles off, but, well, since your wife's dead, you won't be needing them anyway.
You just want to keep his spirits up.
He'll land on his feet in no time.
We are gathered today to say goodbye
- to Lucille Adams.
- Goodbye!
And now the eulogy.
It's tragic to think this is the last time that I can look upon my wife's face.
God, Lucille!
How could you take her from me?
I can't live without her!
Ahhh!
Lucille!
Snookie lumps!
I'm sorry, there's been a terrible mistake.
- This is your wife.
- Ah!
She is this man's wife.
Give me five minutes.
- Uncle Albert!
- I'm not finished.
You're one lucky guy.
Now... where's Lucille?
Ah, Lucille!
I do have this coupon for a cremation.
Rick?
I am so sorry for your loss.
What is it?
I know I said some things, but now more than ever, I realize... we can never be together.
I don't believe you.
You love me, Rick.
I know you do.
Jill, trust me.
I'm telling you this for your own good.
I don't love you.
You're no longer in my five.
How could you?
# When I was young #
# I never needed anyone #
# Makin' love was just for fun #
# Those days are gone #
# All by myself #
# Don't wanna be #
# All by myself #
# Anymore #
# All by myself #
# Don't wanna be #
# All by myself. #
# Anymore #
# All by myself #
# Don't want to be #
# All by myself #
# Anymore #
# All by myself. #
You can't keep getting lucky, man.
You only beat me by two strokes this time.
And the back nine is what killed.
Oh my God!
- Look at this place.
- Yo, what are you doing, man?
You gotta pull yourself together, dude.
What's the point?
Look at you...
eating junk food, wearing fake beards, and we found your costume in the garbage outside.
Yeah, well, I'm not the Dragonfly anymore.
But you said the Hourglass was going to kill thousands of people.
I told you I'm no hero.
All right?
Aunt Lucille's dead,
I've rejected the only girl I've ever loved and I can't even fly.
I wish I'd never been bitten by that stupid dragonfly.
And maybe your father shouldn't have given you this after all.
Look at the words your ancestors inscribed in that ring.
"Honor, valor, sacrifice, duty, commitment, bravery, justice, integrity, brotherhood, self-esteem, low prices, affordable housing, loose-fitting pants, cheap internet porn."
The rest is in Latin.
Rick, the hero's path is dangerous.
You may fail or you may fly.
All that matters is that you do it for the best of reasons.
Helping others, Rick, that's what makes you a real hero.
Maybe you're right, but even if I wanted to stop the Hourglass,
I wouldn't know where to start.
I mean, where's he gonna find thousands of people in one place?
Look.
Reporting here live from the Empire City convention center where thousands of people are in one place, but none of them more important than the attendees of the World Humanity Awards.
I'll drive.
Well, that shortcut through the playground sure saved us some time.
You go ahead,
I'll find a place to park.
Mister, please stop!
Each year the World Humanity Awards are held to honor the greatest achievements on behalf of all humanity.
This gala event is expected to draw the world's most prestigious leaders to Empire City.
- Excuse us, excuse us!
- "Empire City Times."
Damn!
Look, there go Prince Charles.
And Nelson Mandela.
Nelson!
Hey, I was in jail too, man.
One of the guests here is the Hourglass.
But which one?
Thank you so much for inviting us, Mr. Landers.
Well, when you're being honored by the world, you want your family with you.
Perhaps one day, you could be part of our family too.
Ladies and gentlemen, our first award is for the medical breakthrough of the year.
For his company's pioneering work in the field of feminine hygiene
I award Lou Landers douchebag of the year.
# Douchebag #
# He's the douchebag of the year #
# Now ain't he great, folks?
#
# Ain't he grand?
The douchebag of the year. #
# Douchebag #
# He's Mr. Douchebag of the year #
# Look at him smile, look at him shine #
# He's the douchebag of, the douchebag of the year. #
Hold up the douchebag!
Hold up the douchebag, sir.
Stop right there, Landers.
Mr. Riker.
So... you know.
You're damn right I do.
Someone in this auditorium is the Hourglass.
I need your help to figure out who it is.
Now the Hourglass could be anyone... a guest of honor... maybe even a stagehand.
This may be nothing, but I did see a man with what looked like a canister of cerillium.
Who?
- This year's lifetime achievement award...
- Him.
...goes to one of the world's greatest souls,
His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.
This man isn't who you think he is, he's the Hourglass.
No no, I'm a man of peace.
Shut up!
You're plotting to kill all these people and I can prove it.
Show the world the armor you're hiding under these robes.
You can't fool me, Hourglass.
You're packing 10 lbs of Cerillium under there.
- What?
- Ahh!
Take him down.
Tutu.
Peace!
Pea...
Shit shit shit shit shit.
You!
You're the Hourglass.
It's a pity you saw that, my dear.
Perhaps this will help you forget.
What are you doing?
Take me.
Hourglass!
- Hero con?
- It's a convention for people who like to dress up as their favorite heroes and villains.
- By the way, your costume sucks.
- Out of my way!
Excuse me, there is a line.
No, you're killing him all wrong.
It's like this.
Better.
Oh, shit.
Hourglass, you'll never get away with this!
Forget it, Dragonfly.
You're too late.
Run!
Yeah.
Goodbye... little fly.
Dragonfly!
- No!
- Ahhh!
My eye!
So, are you gonna keep the body, or...
Eh.
Dragonfly, you must stop the Hourglass.
I can't.
I can't fly.
If there is one lesson my life can teach, it is that the spirit is stronger than the body.
The hero comes from within.
Those are Celine Dion lyrics.
Whatever.
It's still true.
You're right.
It's working.
Sorry.
Watch, Dragonfly, as your city dies.
Where... am I?
You're with me, your lover.
Dragonfly!
No.
- No.
- Only now do you understand.
Oh, come...
Aha!
I need you to jerk this off.
Yeah.
There's not enough time.
Oh fuck.
- It's over.
- Dragonfly!
Jill!
Gotcha.
- Rick?
- You didn't think I'd let anything happen to the girl I love, did you?
Well, we're still falling.
Damn it!
If only I could fly.
Maybe I wasn't cut out to be a hero.
You know, maybe I was meant to have a normal job... an accountant, a gym teacher.
- This is a really tall building.
- Rick!
I don't care what happens anymore.
If I die, I die happily in your arms.
You're my hero, Rick Riker, and I love you.
Yes!
Oh, thank God!
We only have 50 stories left.
Hang on.
Thank you, Dragonfly.
Because of you, our city is safe at last.
- You said it, Dr. Hawking.
- Shit!
It's a happy ending for us all.
Let's go get some dinner.
I'm buying.
Who am I?
I'm Rick Riker.
I'm the Dragonfly.
And as long as there's crime and injustice
I will forever be a superhero...
I am the Hourglass!

Subtitles by LeapinLar
Though Republic victories outnumber their losses, the Jedi have been unable to stop
Separatist advances in the Outer Rim.
The ever-elusive General Grievous stays one step ahead of his opponents.
With thousands of droid armies at his command, the Jedi can never predict where Grievous will strike next until now.
Stand by.
Grievous is boarding.
- Status report.
- There's too many of them.
Get yourselves to the escape pods.
I will deal with Grievous here.
But, sir, they're commando droids.
That does not matter, Captain.
Now go.
Jedi.
Grievous.
Eeth Koth, isn't it?
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
Your reputation precedes you, General.
Reputation of a coward...
and a murderer.
Murederer?
Is it murder to rip the galaxy of you Jedi filth?
Greetings, Jedi, it would seem, once again, one of your order has lost his way and even better, a leading member of your Jedi Council.
Listen to me, Jedi,
I do not care about your politics.
I do not care about your Republic.
I only live to see you die.
But death will not come so easily for Master Koth.
I will make him suffer endlessly because I know that is more painful for you all.
He's a monster.
Away with the younglings.
Much there is to discuss.
It's time somebody finally put an end to that monster.
On that, agreed we are.
How to find him, the question remains.
After engaging Grievous, we lost contact with Master Koth.
He could be anywhere.
Commander Wolffe has found a message in the holo transmission.
Play back the message.
Look.
Hand signals.
I admit my skills are rusty, but...
Saleucami system, sector J-19.
Zero-eight, zero-five, two-nine.
Saleucami?
But intelligence reported Grievous has no ships near that sector.
But so often inaccurate our intelligence is.
I shall go.
So will I.
And I.
Are you ready?
Ready and waiting.
I shall engage the Separatist fleet and send you the coordinates of Grievous' command ship.
Just make sure you get it right.
I always do.
How do you plan on getting Grievous aboard your ship?
Not to worry.
The good General and I have a history.
I'm sure he'll want to even the score face-to-face.
Meanwhile, we'll jump in undetected and board the command ship.
If Master Koth is still alive, you will find him.
Hopefully, by the end of this mission, we will have saved Master Koth and captured General Grievous.
Sir, we have entered the Saleucami system.
Begin preparations for our landing.
Yes, my lord.
There are several ships coming out of hyperspace.
Are they Republic or Separatist?
Republic.
Three cruiser-class, four escort-class.
You see?
Your compassionate friends have come to rescue you, just as I knew they would.
One of the Republic ships is hailing us, my lord.
Put him through.
General, I knew one day I'd catch up to you.
Kenobi!
What a surprise.
I assume you are here to bring me to justice.
You know me too well.
Indeed, I do.
Prepare to fire all cannons.
And be alert.
Where there is Kenobi, you will always find Skywalker not far behind.
The enemy ships are faster and more maneuverable.
I suggest caution.
Draw them in.
I want to board that vessel.
I shall kill Kenobi face-to-face.
We certainly have his attention.
Admiral Yularen, keep Grievous' fleet occupied so Anakin's arrival is undetected.
Yes, General.
Commence attack.
All ships fire at will.
Yes, sir.
We're moving in.
Commander Cody, do you have the exact coordinates of the command ship yet?
We're patching them through now, sir.
We are receiving the coordinates from General Kenobi.
How close are you going to jump in next to Grievous' ship?
Pretty close.
Buckle up, boys.
Define "pretty close."
Close enough to get the job done.
Get me a tractor beam lock on Kenobi's ship and prepare a boarding party.
Tractor beam has us, sir.
Shall we fire on the source?
No, Cody.
Let them think they have us.
We need a diversion for Anakin.
Coming out of hyperspace.
Hang on.
Primary power down.
So, was that close enough for you?
Any closer, and we'd be flying down hallways.
Next time.
Coast is clear, Rex.
Copy that, sir.
Stay here and guard the entrance.
This may be our only way out.
Skywalker, Master Koth is located on the bridge.
This way.
Remember, we need to keep Grievous on this ship until General Skywalker is clear.
Kenobi.
How we doing?
We are close.
So, Kenobi, is everything going as planned?
That depends on your point of view, General.
You wouldn't come here without a plan, and you wouldn't come alone.
Tell me, do you think Skywalker has rescued Master Koth yet?
Surprise.
Not exactly.
At least, they're not destroyer droids.
The General's description of your tactics have been 100% accurate today.
Very impressive, even by my standards.
Your plans have come to ruination, Jedi.
I hear a lot of talking, General, but in the final accounting, what does all the talk get you?
A futile quest for power, a mutilated body, and your place as Dooku's errand boy.
I'm no errand boy.
I am not in this war for Dooku's politics.
I am the leader of the most powerful droid army the galaxy has ever seen.
An army with no loyalty, no spirit, just programming.
Why do you need to show all your power?
What have you to gain?
The future, a future where there are no Jedi.
The story of Obi-Wan Kenobi ends here.
One more step, and your friend will die.
Your friends shall die, Kenobi, and you shall soon follow.
Got to get it...
Behind you.
I see you got my message.
Where's Grievous?
If everything's gone according to plan, he's on board Obi-Wan's ship.
He's been captured?
If we can cut off his escape, there's a good chance of that.
Surrender, General.
Never!
I hope you've rescued Master Koth, because Grievous is headed back to his ship.
You both go.
I'll make it back.
I'll be fine.
I'll have to disagree with you on that one.
Master Gallia, you go ahead.
I'll get Eeth back to the shuttle.
May the Force by with you.
Get back to the bridge.
We need to detach before Grievous jumps ship.
Cody, come in.
- Yes, sir.
- Grievous is heading your way.
Open fire on the Republic ship.
Target their engines.
But, sir, the ships are still attached.
It doesn't matter.
Prepare all troops for our landing on Saleucami.
The circuits are fried.
We have no controls.
I can't even get the engines online.
We've lost our stabilizers.
I can't hold her steady.
Until we meet again, Kenobi.
Hurry.
We can still catch him.
Obi-Wan, Anakin's leaving.
We'll be trapped on the ship.
Anakin, come in.
We're in a bit of a spot, and we need a way off of Grievous' ship.
There's a large hangar near your position.
Make your way there, and I'll pick you up.
All droids to the landing craft.
Get to your stations.
We're going to detach.
Prepare to launch.
The reactor's been breached.
I can't lock it down!
Here we go.
Anakin, get me Admiral Yularen.
Several craft detached from Grievous' ship and attempted to land on Saleucami.
Then we'll have to land and follow them.
Prepare the tanks.
Yes, sir.
There must be several landing sites.
It may be hard to locate the good General.
You'll have to command the space battle while Rex, Cody, and I head to the surface.
You sure you can handle this on your own?
I think I can manage.
I'll get Master Koth to a medical frigate.
You all took a great risk rescuing me.
You're welcome, Master Koth.
Since you divided your forces,
Grievous is still at large.
I would have gladly given my life if it meant bringing that monster to justice!
At least we all live to fight another day.
Fugitive!
Though the Republic has won many decisive battles against the Separatist army in the Outer Rim, the Jedi have failed to capture the elusive General Grievous.
After specifically targeting members of the Jedi Council, a trap was set, but following a fierce confrontation, the droid General managed to escape to the surface of the planet Saleucami.
Now the chase is on as General Kenobi leads a squadron of clone troopers and closes in on his target.
We must find a way off this planet before they find us.
We need to hurry and find an escape pod.
Instead of scattering our troops looking for all the escape pods, we shall head towards the wreckage of the landing transport first.
Contact the fleet.
Our transmitter is destroyed.
There is only one escape pod that survived.
We must get there as quickly as possible.
Let's hope the transmitter is still intact.
Now, find me some transportation.
Sir, the cruiser's returned to orbit.
Any sign of Grievous?
I believe we've found Grievous' ship.
Power low.
Shutting down.
I can't go on.
Sir, we need to get our power recharged.
Not this again!
How could your power cells be so depleted?
You would not let us ride on one of those creatures with you, sir.
If you would allow us to close down for a few...
Any more complaints?
I don't think so.
That's what I thought.
Now let's find that pod.
Yikes.
Normalizing intakes are still warm.
This couldn't have happened too long ago.
The crew compartment's almost entirely destroyed.
We'll split into teams.
Rex, take Jesse, Hardcase, and Kix
- and search those wetlands.
- Yes, sir.
Cody, you, Crys, and I will pick it up from here.
And Rex, if you get a visual on Grievous, contact us before you engage.
- Rex is a smart man.
- Indeed.
Always thinking on his feet.
These droids are too gone to give us any good intel.
Here's one!
Let's load the droid in the tank.
We'll inspect it on the go.
In range.
Take the shot.
Protect the Captain.
Commando droids.
Jesse, you better get back here.
What do you have?
We've broken the access codes and powered up the droid's guidance system.
According to his memory logs, he fired the emergency thrusters on the escape pod to avoid a mid-air collision.
- Collision with what?
- Another escape pod.
There was no time to correct for the steeper glide path, which is why this droid's pod crashed.
Can you pinpoint the landing zone for the other pod?
I can put us within two to three klicks of it, sir.
Alert the men.
We've picked up the scent.
How bad?
Pretty bad.
I need to remove his armor to see the full extent of the damage.
Those snipers might have called for backup.
Unless we want to start getting picked off one by one, we should find a better cover first.
Wait a minute.
Those critters are domesticated.
I think we're on farmland, and where there's a farm, there's a usually a farmer.
Let's find his homestead.
We want no trouble here.
Easy with that weapon, ma'am.
We're here as friends.
- State your business.
- Our Captain's been hurt.
We need...
- I'm no doctor, so just...
- We have a medic, ma'am.
We just need a place to tend him overnight.
- Who's...
- Get back inside, both you.
Mom.
There are some benches out back in the barn.
- It's the best I can do.
- That'll be fine, ma'am.
What?
What happened?
Commando droids took a potshot.
That would've gone through your heart had it been two inches to the left.
I can't move my arm.
- You have some nerve damage.
- Understood.
Now patch me up and let's get on with it.
Sir, you're in no condition.
It will heal, but it'll take time.
We're getting under way, Kix.
That's an order.
Sir, as the team medic, when it comes to the health of the men, including you,
I outrank everyone.
So, I respectfully order you, sir, to get some...
Excuse me.
- If there's not enough...
- That's plenty.
- Thank you...
- Suu.
I told you to stay in the house.
I couldn't help it, mom.
It got away.
You look like my daddy.
Don't bother the soldier.
- Now get inside with your brother.
- Yes, mom.
My husband is away delivering our first harvest.
Do you require anything else?
Resume the search without me.
You're in command.
I'll be fine.
There's our escape pod.
Any sign of Grievous?
It looks deserted.
He must be heading to a second escape pod.
- Captain Rex, come in, please.
- It's Jesse, sir.
- Rex was injured.
- What's his condition?
He'll be fine, but we had to find him shelter tonight.
Grievous is on the move.
We're headed to the west.
Swing around and we can meet up at the final escape pod.
We're going to need all the firepower we can muster.
Roger that, sir.
We're speeding towards you.
We should be there by now!
We are, sir, there.
Almost.
You had better be interpreting the coordinates correctly.
We're almost there, sir.
One klick out.
Straight ahead.
I'm losing power.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
You're a clone.
So...
I see the war has finally made its way out here, and I guess I can expect a visit from some droids soon.
What's your number and rank?
My name is Lawquane.
Cut Lawquane.
And I'm just a simple farmer.
You're a deserter.
I like to think I'm merely exercising my freedom to choose:
to choose not to kill for a living.
That is not your choice to make.
You swore an oath to the Republic.
You have a duty.
I have a duty, you're right.
But it's to my family.
Does that count, or do you still plan to turn me in?
- Do I have a choice?
- Daddy!
You're home!
Look what I drew you, dad!
That's great, Jek.
I see you two have met.
He looks just like you, daddy.
I told him.
You did.
I was just making our guest, Captain...
What's your number?
I also have a name, believe it or not.
He was injured.
His men brought him here.
I told him he could stay just for the night.
Of course he can.
We never turn away those in need, do we?
No, we always help anyone we can.
Right.
You look hungry, Rex.
No, I'm fine.
I'll stay here.
- You have to eat with us.
Please.
- Please?
They're never going to stop till you say yes.
All right.
I'll join you.
You and I may be clones, but we're still individuals.
You have a name rather than a number, Captain.
Why is that?
Perhaps our leaders feel it's a more efficient way of distinguishing us.
More efficient than a number?
I doubt the Kaminoans think that way.
Still, a name has to make you feel unique, especially in an army where everyone looks like you and talks...
Actually, I never really thought about it.
Yes, you have.
How would you know?
Because I'm as close to you as any life-form can be.
I've seen how you look at my family, our home.
Come on, Rex, admit it.
You've thought about what your life could look like if you were to also leave the army, choose the life you want.
What if I am choosing the life I want?
What if I'm staying in the army because it's meaningful to me?
And how is it meaningful?
Because I'm part of the most pivotal moment in the history of the Republic.
If we fail, then our children and their children could be forced to live under an evil I can't well imagine.
If you were to have children, of course, but... that would be against the rules, wouldn't it?
Isn't that what somebody programmed you to believe, Captain?
No, Cut.
It's simply what I believe.
It doesn't matter if it's my children or other people's children.
Does that meet with your approval?
Perfectly.
To each his own.
That's what I always say.
What does that mean, daddy?
It means you can do anything with your life that you want to.
- How are you doing, Jesse?
- Closing in, sir.
We have a visual.
Very well.
We'll meet you in the middle.
Is your transmitter working?
I don't know.
I haven't used it yet.
All right.
I'll check on it.
Stupid battle droids.
Sir, you made it.
Get back in the pod and send out a distress signal towards the rest of our fleet.
We need to get a shuttle down here immediately.
Roger, roger.
But I must inform you, sir, there are multiple life-forms approaching from the east and west.
Battle positions!
Good move.
Very good move.
So what was it?
What made me decide to leave the corps?
Shortly after the battle of Geonosis, our troop transport got caught between two Separatist gunships.
They fired at us with everything they had.
We crashed.
Most of us were either dead or severely injured.
So when they started working their way through the wounded, killing us off,
I knew there was no hope.
I ran.
It still haunts me.
I'm sorry.
It's the day I felt my life didn't have any meaning.
Everyone I cared about, my team, was gone.
I was just another expendable clone waiting for my turn to be slaughtered in a war that made no sense to me.
Can you understand that, Rex?
I've been in countless battles and lost many brothers.
They were my family.
My home.
Daddy, we finished our chores.
- Can we go outside and play?
- Please?
Okay, only for a few minutes.
Thank you, daddy.
Come on, Jek.
And keep the house in view.
We will.
You have wonderful children.
I know you think I'm a coward, Rex, but believe me,
I'll fight to my last breath to keep them safe.
Fire!
Tank two!
Port side!
Great shot!
Where is that ship?
Shaeeah?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Stop fooling around.
You are not funny.
Am too.
Look.
In the field.
What is it?
It wasn't there before.
It's some kind of spaceship, I think.
Hello?
Do you think somebody's in there?
I didn't do it.
You did.
Monsters!
- What's wrong?
- Monsters.
They're chasing us.
What monsters?
Honey, where?
They hatched from the big egg in the field.
This is not good.
I count 20.
Cut, what's out there?
Commando droids.
What are they doing?
- Suu, get the kids upstairs.
- Come.
Come now.
What weapons do you have?
We can catch them in a cross fire.
You take that corner.
No, Captain.
With respect, you're not in charge here.
I can be useful.
You're injured.
You have only one good arm.
But I can fight.
So can I.
Rex, I need you to be the last line of defense for my family.
I'll take care of them.
Thank you.
Finally!
General Grievous, sir.
We see you below us.
Are you ready to depart?
Concentrate your fire on that ship.
They're shooting at us.
Coming back around.
Sir, that ship's coming around for another landing attempt.
Keep firing.
Don't let that ship land.
The guns are overheated!
Always something.
Cody, Jesse, cover me.
General, behind you!
They're coming for you!
Daddy?
I'm okay.
It's over.
Forget trying to land!
Fire the engines.
Jedi scum.
Are you all right, sir?
We're right back where we started.
Call the cruisers.
- See if they can stop that ship.
- Right away, sir.
And tell them to send someone to pick us up.
All right,
- that should do it.
- Captain Rex.
Are you going to turn in my husband?
I'm sorry, Suu.
It's my duty, but in my condition, I probably won't remember any of this.
Thank you.
You're still a deserter, Cut, but you're certainly not a coward.
Captain Rex, are you still with us?
Yes, General Kenobi.
I'm still with you and thankfully on the mend, sir.
That's great news.
We certainly missed you at the party.
Sorry, sir.
I had to attend one of my own.
Can't wait to hear about it.
We're standing by.
You're welcome to stay, Rex.
This is your home, Cut.
My family is elsewhere.
Stop!
Stop the bus!
The story of my life is not for the faint of heart.
Thanks.
But, like any story worth telling, it's all about a girl.
Not that girl.
- Hey.
Hi.
- I don't think that is a girl.
No, it's about this girl...
Jill Johnson.
Ever since I can remember I've been in love with her, but she barely knows I exist.
Yo, Rick!
Yo, come here, man!
I got you a seat down here.
What's...
I'll call y'all back.
Everybody, bye.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, Trey.
Dude, I'm so psyched for this class trip.
We about to see some real serious cutting-edge shit.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yo, you got any C batteries on you?
AAs?
Got that new sandwich from Sony in my backpack.
Wi-Fi... mmm!
Yo!
You got to forget about her, dawg.
Look look.
Let me show you something.
She not even looking at you.
If I could just tell her how I feel.
Look, Rick, I already told you... you never gonna get with Jill, all right?
Seriously, she hangs out with the popular crew, and nobody messes around outside their group, man.
Come on, that crew stuff isn't real.
The hell it ain't.
Look around, Rick.
- Look, you got your jocks...
- Get the ball, man.
...nerds, emos,
Frodos, the Scarface society the sexual predators.
- Yeah.
- Of course you got the Rick punchers.
- The who?
- Oh!
- Yeah, they new.
Mm-hmm.
But you know what?
Who cares?
'Cause we got our own crew...
me and you.
Thanks, Trey.
You're the best, man.
- Am I in?
- No.
Come on.
Hey, it's me and you, baby.
The two of us against the world.
You hear me?
You look good today.
I like your hair.
I'm gonna show you something nasty I downloaded.
Don't tell nobody.
Welcome to Amalgamated.
I'm Dr. Strom, head of the research department...
- Come on, man.
...where we create the future today.
And now I'd like to show you our crown jewel.
The Amalgamated animal genetics lab.
Whoa.
Go ahead, explore.
Yo yo.
Come on, Rick.
Man, check this out.
All of our animals are genetically engineered and each of them has...
Oh, you're so pretty.
Hi, birdie.
Hi.
Hi.
- She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Yes, she is.
Uh, I'm gonna take a picture of her for the school newspaper.
Our only rules:
Don't feed the animals and please, no flash photography.
Some of our genetically- engineered animals are a little sensitive to light.
It flew away.
Uh... whoo-hoo.
What the F, loser?
Get him, Lance.
- Come on, Lance.
- Leave him alone.
- I don't think so.
Is there a problem, Lance?
No.
No problem, Uncle Lou.
Mr. Landers!
Students, this is Lou Landers, visionary scientist and C.E.O. of Amalgamated.
Well, I'm just a businessman now.
The future of science belongs to all of you.
Please, enjoy the tour.
Are you okay?
Yes, this is healthy-cough blood.
Rick Riker.
You're not Blaine and Julia Riker's son, are you?
- I am.
- Ah.
Good people.
- How are they?
- They died violently nine years ago.
But otherwise okay?
Yes, thank you.
I live with my aunt and uncle now.
Well, you seem like a real chip off the old block.
Let's hope you're not violently murdered too.
That's for making me look stupid.
Next time I hurt you.
Yeah.
You the man, Lance.
Our work with these animals has helped us develop new antibiotics, advanced pesticides and a powerful new pheromone which drives animals to mate called compound H2O0.
It's a strong sexual attractant.
A single drop is enough to arouse any animal.
We plan on using it to breed endangered species.
A special and indeed often overlooked...
Our most-promising research is with these dragonflies.
For example, this dragonfly's skin has a hard, armor-like exoskeleton to defend against...
And this species of dragonfly has enormous strength for its size.
It can lift vast amounts.
More than it's body weight.
And here we've injected the DNA from all three species into seven new genetically-enhanced super dragonflies.
But there's only six in there.
Well, one missing dragonfly is the least of my concerns.
I lost six tigers alone last month.
Ah!
This area is where we keep our livestock.
Ohh.
Aren't you going to do something?
Soon as I get this up on YouTube.
I see.
Ye... well, yes, I understand.
Thank you for the call.
That was the principal.
Rick walked off a class trip.
After all the parenting you've done, he's still so troubled.
Why do you think that is, Albert?
I have no idea, Lucille.
I have taught him everything I know about being a man.
And a good man you are after all these years of marriage.
It's like we first met.
Sure, you're a little older.
Your hair's grey.
You have crow's feet.
It takes you an hour to pee.
Your thighs look like cottage cheese someone threw up on a hot sidewalk.
And you've always had a tiny penis.
Well... what does it matter when you're in love?
Oh, Rick.
We were wondering where you were.
It's so late.
About time you got home.
Your aunt was getting worried.
You can sleep late in the morning, but don't forget to feed the fish.
Attaboy.
I don't know.
Something just doesn't seem quite right with him today.
Teenagers.
I'll talk to him.
Rough day, huh?
Well, I won't lie to you.
Puberty is a difficult time in a young man's life.
Now this book may explain what's happening.
Let's see.
There are mood swings, fluid retention, and once a month you'll bleed from your vagina.
This may be the wrong book.
What's important is that you're on the verge of adulthood.
Here...
take a drink.
Ah, the rituals of manhood.
Today you have your first beer, and tomorrow we'll circumcise you.
I'm losing patience, Dr. Strom.
Please, sir, if you could just wait a few minutes...
I've waited long enough for this egomaniac.
We're the board of directors.
Our time is valuable.
Not as valuable as mine, Mr. Carlson.
You see, I have a terminal illness.
I've been fighting it for years, but the disease has ravaged my organs.
As of this moment, I have one hour left to live.
It was on sale.
Gentlemen, if you're ready, allow me to show you the future.
Strom.
From the...
lift it ov...
lift it over!
What the hell is that?
An innovation...
thank you... that will not only save my life but the life of this company.
For too long we've scraped out profits from pills and injections.
The real prize is the total cure.
A device that can alter DNA and restore the body to perfect health.
- You're crazy.
- No.
Crazy is hearing voices, talking to cats, dating Paula Abdul.
I'm not crazy.
I'm a visionary!
Sir.
Sir, the machine's never been fully tested.
If something should go wrong...
- Start the machine!
- Yes, sir.
Plasma level is steady.
Genetic modification's at optimum levels!
Sir, the core is overheating.
- Ah!
- We have to abort!
Did it work?
I'm so sorry.
Well, well, well.
I want you to know what a joy it will be running this company without you in the way.
Let go.
Let me go.
Gentlemen, I think it's time we made some personnel changes.
No, stay away!
Oh.
How long was I asleep?
Five days.
Huh.
Wait.
Wha...
Oh, Dad.
I thought you'd live forever.
Oh.
Breakfast, Rick!
I'll be right down!
Oh!
If I can have your attention.
We are delighted to have as guest judge the foremost scientist in the world.
He's a visiting professor at Empire City University where he's working with the rare element cerillium.
I am so proud to welcome Dr. Stephen Hawking.
Thank you for that warm welcome.
I have a disease that has paralyzed me.
I cannot walk and I use this computer to speak.
But I am not depressed, because I have the gift of knowledge.
That's a lie.
I think about suicide every day.
But you should all be happy with your lives.
You can walk, talk, wipe your own asses and then there's all the sex.
I haven't had sex in years.
My nurse is a lesbian, and not the hot kind.
Hey, anyone want to get high?
- I've got some hash with me.
- No way.
White guy in the dreads, you know what I'm talking about.
Can I get a what what?
Holla.
I've got a stiff pole for your sweet hole.
Anyone?
Anyone?
Pussies.
Dr. Hawking, I am such a fan.
I'd love to show you my project on supernovas.
You have an incredible ass stromony career ahead of you.
Wait, where's Saturn?
I'd hate to lose my father's bowling ball.
There it is.
Great reflexes.
You have very manly hands.
So do you.
I'm gonna go find a spot for my project.
Yeah, okay.
Watch where you're going in slo-mo, dipshit.
- Pfft.
- Yeah.
Go to her, stupid.
Tell her how you feel.
Yow.
Any day.
Uh... he did it.
Ow!
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Get him, Lance!
- Lance, stop it.
- Kick his ass, Lance!
Fight fight fight!
- Let's see what you got.
- Fucking break him!
Whoa!
Oh!
Damn!
Ooh!
Get off!
Get... get off me!
Yah!
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
Shit shit shit shit.
# Oh no, you didn't, didn't #
- # Oh no, you didn't # - # Oh yes, we did #
# Oh no, you didn't, didn't, Oh no, you didn't #
- # Oh yeah, we did # - # Oh no, you didn't, didn't #
- # Oh no, you didn't # - # Oh yes, we did. #
Stop!
Stop!
Hey!
Get out of the way!
No brakes!
Get out of the way!
Ma'am, look out!
Are you okay?
- How did you...
- I can't believe it.
- You just saved that old lady's life.
- Amazing.
I...
I guess.
If I hadn't pushed her out of the way, she would've die... ah!
You should be really proud of yourself.
You're some kind of hero.
If you could excuse me.
There we go.
Awfully nice of you to help me out here, Trey.
Oh, no problem.
I'm waiting on Rick, anyway, so...
Ooh.
My God.
How did you do that?
Uh, it's easier than it looks.
No, I don't think so.
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
All right.
Well, there is something, okay?
But you have to keep it a secret.
I think I have...
superpowers.
I find that hard to believe.
All right, all right, how about this?
Go ahead and throw as many punches as you want.
I bet you 100 bucks you don't land one.
Easy money.
What else can you do?
I don't know.
I...
I was bitten by a dragonfly.
Well, some dragonflies have armored skin.
I wonder if my skin is...
Well, good thing that worked.
So you do have superpowers.
We could be a team!
We gonna get fame, money...
- Don't forget the bitches.
- There's not gonna be fame and there's not gonna be bitches, okay?
I didn't ask for any of this.
I just wanna be like everybody else.
That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
You're not my father.
But I love you like your father did.
I believe in you like your father did.
I had sex with your mother just like your father did.
Huh.
You'll never understand me.
Never.
That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
What a great performance.
Well, Rick, did you enjoy the opera?
Son, is something troubling you?
It's so unfair.
They have nothing.
Why do we have $2 billion?
Well, your grandfather left us $3 billion and I made some bad investments.
But that's nothing for you to worry about.
But I want to change things.
And you will.
Five generations of Rikers have worked hard to make this city great.
One day, Rick, people will look to you to be a hero.
When that day comes, will you be ready?
Give me your wallet.
That too.
People will look to you to be a hero.
When that day comes, will you be ready?
Rick!
Ah!
Ow!
Huh?
Ah!
Rick, please!
Ah!
- Dad!
- Oh, Rick, I'm dying.
- No!
- Don't worry.
My brother Albert will take you in.
Rick, the money, it's all yours now.
Sell all shares of a small company called Google.
It's worthless.
Invest heavily in Enron.
Rick, I have something for you.
Reach into my coat pocket.
The other coat pocket.
God!
That ring was my father's and his father's before him.
Earn it, Rick.
Be a hero.
Claim your...
- destiny.
Dad!
I'm no superhero.
I'm nobody!
Ah!
Shut up back there!
I'm gonna kill you!
- Are you okay?
- What, you heard that?
You're nothing but an ugly, ungrateful little whore!
Just like your mother!
- Who was that?
- My mother.
Listen, about what happened at school this morning, I...
You really freaked us out.
I'm really going through a tough time right now.
Me too.
My parents, they want me to go to college, but I want to be a dancer.
I believe in you.
You really do, don't you?
I wish I could say the same for Lance.
I don't know.
Is he the right one or am I just dating him to rebel against my father?
He doesn't want any boy near me.
That's why he installed the electrified fence.
Well, we'll see.
You can't run from your destiny.
- Right?
- Right.
- Jill, let's go!
- Nice car.
Maybe one day you could take me for a ride in your car.
Uh...
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, definitely.
Oh.
Lovebirds.
Rick, this is Professor Xavier.
Your powers are growing, but you can't control it.
It's important that you... become a hero...
train yourself to fly in your ass because squatting on a glass table two girls...
one cup...
You know what to do.
- This shouldn't take long.
- Well, I'll be waiting right here.
Hello, Mr. Bailey.
I've reviewed your request for a loan, Mr. Riker, but with no job, no credit history,
I'm afraid I have to say no.
But what about this?
That was last month.
This new promotion's proving quite popular.
Look, I need to buy a car.
Frankly, Mr. Riker, you're the worst applicant we've ever had.
Thanks for the loan, Mr. Thompson.
This is a good boy.
There must be something I could do.
Ma'am... rubbing my crotch under the desk won't change my mind.
I'm not rubbing your crotch.
I really need that car.
I don't see how that's my problem.
This is a robbery!
Nobody move!
Everybody stay down!
Stay down!
- Get down.
- Come on, Lady!
Hurry it up!
- Oh.
- Come on, move it!
Oh, hey, I made the same mistake before when I came in.
Thanks.
You idiot!
You let him get away with our money!
I don't see how that's my problem.
- Oh, man!
- Wow.
Come over here!
You've got to see this.
Let me through.
Let me through.
Oh, thank God.
I thought something terrible had happened.
Well, an old guy did get shot over there.
Uncle Albert!
Just try to breathe.
I can't.
You're kneeling on my balls.
Oh, sorry.
Rick, listen.
With great power comes...
Great responsibility?
I was gonna stick with bitches, but if you want to be a virgin for the rest of your life...
Uncle Albert!
My balls!
Very good.
Oh, God.
Mr. Landers!
Oh no.
Okay.
Hide the body.
Hide the body.
Yeah.
Get in!
Yah!
Yah!
Okay, I come back.
Jill?
I came as soon as I heard.
- Where's Aunt Lucille?
- She's at home under heavy sedation.
They made her watch three hours of women's basketball.
- This is all my fault.
- Rick, it was an armed robbery.
There was nothing you could've done.
I could've stopped that guy before he shot my uncle.
Then there is blood on your hands.
But that's not important.
All that matters is that you're here for him now.
- Rick Riker?
- Yes?
Dr. Whitby.
I've run some tests.
I'm afraid I have bad news.
What is it?
I have an impacted colon.
Whew.
What a night.
Now what brought you here today?
- My uncle.
- Your uncle brought you?
- No, he's gravely injured.
- Well, then he shouldn't be driving.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to perform a breast exam.
Doctor, please.
Is my uncle gonna survive?
Well, I don't know.
We should probably have a look.
Hard to say.
Yup, pretty deep coma.
Is he gonna be okay?
Well, I'm not a betting man, but if you want to put some money on it,
- I'll take "dead in a week."
- Oh my God!
No, it's all right.
It's a normal emotional reaction, but this should take the edge off of it.
Here we go.
Nice and easy.
- That's your vein.
- Yes, I know.
First my parents and now this?
I'm nothing but a screw-up.
Yes, your life has been a testament to that.
But your uncle believed in you and so do I.
It's never too late to become the person you're meant to be.
Rick.
Rick.
Rick.
Hello, Rick.
Who are you and how do you know my name?
- I'm a psychic.
- Prove it.
Think of any number between one and a million and I'll tell you what it is.
- Nine.
- Not out loud, dumbass!
Follow me... you dumb son of a bitch.
My name is Professor Xavier, and this is my school.
I started it to help people with special talents like yours.
Our students here learn to harness their incredible talents.
and use them to advance the common good.
Ah!
Ow.
Here we have children who can walk through walls.
We have children who think they can walk through walls.
Some faces may be familiar, like Wolverine.
Other mutants you probably didn't know existed, like Sneezo.
Most of our students are born with their powers.
Some, like you, gain them later in life.
- Oh, is that...
- Yes, it is.
When he came to this school, he weighed 130 lbs.
Take enough roids, you could do anything.
Back up off those pills, Barry!
- Why have you brought me here?
- Because you have the potential
- to be the best.
- But I can't even fly.
Once you understand the true nature of heroism, you will fly.
But first I must teach you the secret to becoming a superhero.
Hey, Storm!
You look like you putting on a little weight.
Ah!
Oh!
So, Professor, about this secret...
- Well, you see...
- Xavier!
- Aw, shit.
- Well?
You wanna explain why I found her hiding in your closet?
But, pumpkin, I don't see nobody.
- Oh, you don't?
- Ow!
Invisible Girl?
Apparently not invisible enough.
If you knew how to take care of your man, maybe this wouldn't have happened.
- No, she didn't.
- Oh, this bitch is crazy.
I'm gonna have to whip your ass.
- You don't say no disrespectful...
- What are you gonna do, baldy?
I'm everywhere, sweet cheeks.
- Whoa!
- Ow!
- That all you got?
- Yeah!
Now what?
Now how about that, Invisi-bitch?
Yeah, whatever.
I'm out of here.
I'm sure gonna miss her.
She was crazy in the sack.
Biting, scratching, panting, tongue all over the place.
Wasn't me, asshole.
Come on, Spanky.
I didn't even know she had a dog.
Still some of the best sex I ever had.
How could you do this to me?
To your kids?
To your newborn baby?
How do I know that baby's even mine?
Because he can do this.
Shit!
Ah!
Aw, man.
Now I'm never gonna know the secret to becoming a superhero.
You wanna know the secret?
Come close.
Make a costume, shithead!
I swear to God.
They get dumber and dumber every year.
A costume.
Rick, you, uh...
Oh my God.
Damn!
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!
I love the mask.
How you breathe in it though?
What's that sound?
You put some kind of air intake in the mask.
Boy, you better...
now I'm assuming that the material is see-through, right?
Yeah, dude, I'ma tell you something.
Rick, this is good.
I'm impressed.
Like really impressed.
Hey, that's my spot.
You're sitting on my gargoyle.
Move it.
- Excuse me?
- What are you even doing here?
I'm looking seriously out over the city in a squatting position.
Well, that's what I do here.
So if you're not moving,
I guess we're gonna have to share.
Uh, okay, fine.
I actually usually perch in the front.
Oh, all right.
Well, here, you've got to go around.
- Okay, wait.
- Just turn this way.
Here we go.
- Dude!
- You're right, I'm sorry.
Relax.
- Okay okay.
- Okay okay.
- Uh, I can't perch like this.
- God, me neither.
- What's your name?
- John Storm.
Dragonfly.
So what's your power?
What's my power?
Stand back.
- Flame on!
- Whoa!
Huh?
I'm on fire!
Get a blanket or something!
Holy shit!
It's not working!
Get the fire extinguisher!
Ah!
No!
Ah!
God!
You idiot, stop!
What's wrong with you?
Sorry, my bad.
Rick, once you understand the true nature of heroism, you will fly.
Shit.
This Dragonfly, he's not even a hero.
He's not...
I have...
I have...
I have just a...
I have...
He can't...
he can't even fly.
The Dragonfly can't even fly!
I can fly, okay?
I can fly.
This just in:
Tom Cruise is dead.
World's most powerful man.
I have a feeling you might disagree with that.
Strom, do you have my test results?
Yes, sir.
Whatever you're doing to your... victims, rejuvenates you.
But only for 24 hours.
Hmmm.
What if I killed 28 people in one session?
Would that give me a month to live?
If it were February, yes.
But only if your cells could absorb that much energy at once, and they can't.
I'm afraid you have to kill each day to live each day.
Still a slave to the tyranny of time.
There must be some answer.
There isn't.
Unless... unless you had some cerillium.
Then you could create a device powerful enough to draw the life-force out of thousands of people and enhance your own cellular capacity.
Strom, you're a genius.
Wikipedia.
But that's not important.
What is important is that you don't have any cerillium.
Besides, it's immoral.
We don't do that sort of thing.
We're a pharmaceutical company.
Wait a minute.
Take a look.
Hawking's lab is in the physics building.
I could just walk right in.
You're going to steal cerillium?
No, not me.
I'm a law abiding citizen.
But perhaps there's someone inside me.
Someone unfettered by the rule of law.
Someone who will, at any cost, survive!
Ow!
Oh, glass in my eye.
Glass in my eye!
- Does it hurt?
- Uh, yeah, it hurts.
Well, if you could spread...
spread them with your fingers.
Push your lids with your fingers.
- Two... two... two fingers.
- Are your fingers clean?
That's it.
And roll your eyeball around.
- And push it.
- I'm rolling it!
Dig it out with another piece of glass.
Are you fricking insane?
I'll get the tweezers.
Read about the Dragonfly, world's greatest hero.
- Right here?
- Right here, yup.
Read all about it.
No, you listen to me!
I want that story on my desk or you're fired!
Who the hell are you?
I was wondering if you've got a job opening for...
Job?
!
How dare you come in here and ask me for a job?
I'm the editor in chief!
I know the mayor of Venus!
Hamburgers can see the future!
- Rosie O'Donnell...
- Sorry about this.
We share the building with a mental hospital.
Bad news, boss.
We're nowhere on those Dragonfly photos.
Damn.
Those were tomorrow's lead.
What about these?
Wow!
it's almost like you're the Dragonfly.
Uh, no no no.
See?
Look.
Now that's photography.
Just heard on the scanner, some kind of police standoff at Empire University.
We'll need photos.
Kid, I want you to...
Where'd he go?
Come on, let's go!
This is the chief of police.
We have the building surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.
What the hell is that?
I am the Hourglass.
And your time is up.
Get him, Dragonfly.
It's over, Hourglass.
No, Dragonfly.
It's just begun!
It's useless to resist.
I'll fight you to my last breath.
Like the sands of time I am unceasing and relentless.
Evil never triumphs, Hourglass.
You'll pay for your crimes and justice will... stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Are you okay?
No.
Titanium blades.
They cut through diamonds.
I'm not wearing any diamonds.
Ooh, ow!
Ow!
I wish I could stay longer, Dragonfly.
But I just don't have the time.
Whoever this Dragonfly is, he's in over his head.
We don't need so-called superheroes.
What Empire City needs is more cops.
And a Hooters.
Titanium blades.
Looks like someone found your weakness.
It's not my weakness.
I'm sorry, I forgot.
Your weakness is you can't fly.
Maybe if you had a partner.
I don't need help.
I'm fine all by myself.
She means a lot to you, doesn't she?
What?
Oh, no.
I mean, she's with someone else.
Well, maybe that's for the best.
After all, it could be dangerous, you know, being the girlfriend of the Dragonfly.
I don't know what to do, Aunt Lucille.
- I love her.
- So be it.
But remember, to get to you your enemies will attack the people you care for the most.
Be careful not to hurt the ones you love.
And shave your pubes.
No one wants to go down on a tumbleweed.
Jill!
Rick?
I heard you were auditioning for a part so...
Oh, they're beautiful.
God, you are so supportive.
Why can't Lance be more like you?
There's something you're not telling me, isn't there?
Something secret.
Something locked away deep inside.
It was summer camp.
We had to share a shower.
You trip and fall with your mouth open on one guys...
No!
I mean, in here.
Well, there is...
Keep your identity a secret, Rick.
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!
Once a month you'll bleed from you vagina.
I... nothing.
Nothing?
Well, I should go.
You're a good friend.
Hey, check this out.
Hey, check this out.
Oh, shit.
- Let's go.
- Get her.
Oh God, it hurts.
It hurts.
Please stop!
I'm begging you!
Wait!
- Where are you?
- Behind you.
You saved my life.
Do I get to thank you?
Go.
Be a hero.
Yeah.
It looks like you're planning a mass murder.
Would you like help?
Paper clip guy.
I'm so happy that you and your boyfriend are spending Thanksgiving with us.
Of course, Lucille.
You need support at a time like this.
Yes, I miss seeing my Albert each morning.
You know, 50 years of marriage creates quite a bond.
I wish I knew love like that.
Oh, you will, dear.
You just have to follow your heart.
That's the thing.
I don't know if I can.
Oh, Jill.
If you can't trust yourself who can you trust?
I know.
But what if my heart is telling me to be with someone
I can't be with?
It's not just any guy.
It's the... forget it.
You'll think I'm crazy.
No, of course not.
You can tell me anything.
I'm very good at keeping secrets.
You'll think it's ridiculous, but... it's the Drag...
- I'll get it.
- Thank you.
Hey, babe.
Oh, I forgot to tell you I kinda invited my uncle.
- Your uncle?
- What?
Set another plate.
Well, okay.
I guess.
Miss Johnson.
Please, excuse my nephew's poor manners.
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Adams, I'm Lou Landers.
I hope this isn't too much of an imposition.
Oh, of course not.
There's always room for one more.
Thank you.
It's just Thanksgiving is for family.
Lance is the only family I have.
- I never married.
- Fruitcake?
Nope, just never met the right woman.
Ah, yes, Lance told me Rick Riker was your neighbor.
Where is Rick?
That's odd.
I thought he was out.
I'll go check on him.
Please, you're busy.
Allow me.
Thank you.
Upstairs, second door to the right.
Rick?
Hmmm.
Hmmm.
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, Mr. Landers.
Rick.
No, you're just on time.
Everybody, take your seat.
Ohhh.
Ah ah ah!
Not till we say grace.
Jesus!
Amen.
Please start, everyone.
This all looks so delicious, Lucille.
We have Rick to thank for it.
Ever since Albert...
Rick has been supporting me with his new job.
New job?
You didn't tell me.
Oh well, I'm sort of the Dragonfly's unofficial photographer.
What happened to your arm?
Uh... a bike messenger knocked me down.
I see your wrist is bandaged.
Yes, I burned it on some hot coffee.
And you have a cut on your lip.
Uh... my crackpipe broke.
You have a scratch on your neck.
Yes, I... met a girl on Craigslist.
And you have a bruise on your neck.
I... met a guy on Craigslist.
I'm sorry, Lance.
We have to go.
- Why?
- I... shat my pants.
I'll drive.
- Thanks for helping clean up.
- Of course.
Poor thing's so tired.
Yeah, well, you know old folks after a big meal.
So... you know the Dragonfly?
Uh... yeah, I guess.
You could sorta say we're close.
Has he...
has he ever asked about me?
Um, yeah.
- Yeah, once.
- What did you tell him?
Well, I said...
I told him...
I told him, "The thing about Jill is... when you look in her eyes and she looks back in yours...
- you know that you'd do anything anything to be a better person than you are.
So that...
- if you were ever lucky enough to be with her, you could earn every second of her perfect...
- grace, and her limitless beauty...
- and her unending love.
- Don't cry.
- I'm not.
My eyes are burning.
Rick, I want you to know that was the most beautiful thing anyone's ever said to me.
- Scented candle?
- Thank you.
Rick, I'm so confused, and yet...
- I know exactly what I want.
Sorry to drop in uninvited.
It's okay.
We were hoping someone would open a window.
It was getting stuffy in here.
So this is the lair of the Dragonfly.
- How did you...
- No no no,
I'm not here to fight you.
I've got thousands of other people I plan to kill.
This little visit is just to show you who'll get hurt if you get in my way.
Never!
Time to go.
The woman, Lucille Adams of East Empire City,
- was badly injured.
- How was she injured?
- Badly.
- What about the Dragonfly?
All I can tell you is this:
he didn't save anyone tonight.
Doctor, how is she?
I'm afraid your aunt's taken a turn for the worse.
She can't speak, she can't walk, she had no control over her bowels.
That's... that's awful.
I know.
I went ahead and set up a MySpace page for her under "crazy shit machine."
She already has 40 friends.
Wait a minute.
That's somebody else's aunt.
Your aunt has no problem with her bowels...
- Oh, thank God.
...because she's dead.
I'm truly sorry, Rick, but there is a silver lining.
Your uncle came out of his coma this morning.
He did?
Yes, but you mustn't tell him about your aunt just yet.
He's in a delicate mental state.
The slightest bit of bad news could send him spiraling right back into a coma.
I understand.
Mr. Adams, you have a visitor.
- Is it Lucille?
- No, sir, it's not your dead wife.
It's your nephew Rick.
Remember, no bad news.
Now, sir, here you go.
This is my bill.
- You did surgery on me?
- Yes, sir, we confused you with one of our sex-change patients, but don't worry, we didn't remove your penis.
We did cut your testicles off, but, well, since your wife's dead, you won't be needing them anyway.
You just want to keep his spirits up.
He'll land on his feet in no time.
We are gathered today to say goodbye
- to Lucille Adams.
- Goodbye!
And now the eulogy.
It's tragic to think this is the last time that I can look upon my wife's face.
God, Lucille!
How could you take her from me?
I can't live without her!
Ahhh!
Lucille!
Snookie lumps!
I'm sorry, there's been a terrible mistake.
- This is your wife.
- Ah!
She is this man's wife.
Give me five minutes.
- Uncle Albert!
- I'm not finished.
You're one lucky guy.
Now... where's Lucille?
Ah, Lucille!
I do have this coupon for a cremation.
Rick?
I am so sorry for your loss.
What is it?
I know I said some things, but now more than ever, I realize... we can never be together.
I don't believe you.
You love me, Rick.
I know you do.
Jill, trust me.
I'm telling you this for your own good.
I don't love you.
You're no longer in my five.
How could you?
# When I was young #
# I never needed anyone #
# Makin' love was just for fun #
# Those days are gone #
# All by myself #
# Don't wanna be #
# All by myself #
# Anymore #
# All by myself #
# Don't wanna be #
# All by myself. #
# Anymore #
# All by myself #
# Don't want to be #
# All by myself #
# Anymore #
# All by myself. #
You can't keep getting lucky, man.
You only beat me by two strokes this time.
And the back nine is what killed.
Oh my God!
- Look at this place.
- Yo, what are you doing, man?
You gotta pull yourself together, dude.
What's the point?
Look at you...
eating junk food, wearing fake beards, and we found your costume in the garbage outside.
Yeah, well, I'm not the Dragonfly anymore.
But you said the Hourglass was going to kill thousands of people.
I told you I'm no hero.
All right?
Aunt Lucille's dead,
I've rejected the only girl I've ever loved and I can't even fly.
I wish I'd never been bitten by that stupid dragonfly.
And maybe your father shouldn't have given you this after all.
Look at the words your ancestors inscribed in that ring.
"Honor, valor, sacrifice, duty, commitment, bravery, justice, integrity, brotherhood, self-esteem, low prices, affordable housing, loose-fitting pants, cheap internet porn."
The rest is in Latin.
Rick, the hero's path is dangerous.
You may fail or you may fly.
All that matters is that you do it for the best of reasons.
Helping others, Rick, that's what makes you a real hero.
Maybe you're right, but even if I wanted to stop the Hourglass,
I wouldn't know where to start.
I mean, where's he gonna find thousands of people in one place?
Look.
Reporting here live from the Empire City convention center where thousands of people are in one place, but none of them more important than the attendees of the World Humanity Awards.
I'll drive.
Well, that shortcut through the playground sure saved us some time.
You go ahead,
I'll find a place to park.
Mister, please stop!
Each year the World Humanity Awards are held to honor the greatest achievements on behalf of all humanity.
This gala event is expected to draw the world's most prestigious leaders to Empire City.
- Excuse us, excuse us!
- "Empire City Times."
Damn!
Look, there go Prince Charles.
And Nelson Mandela.
Nelson!
Hey, I was in jail too, man.
One of the guests here is the Hourglass.
But which one?
Thank you so much for inviting us, Mr. Landers.
Well, when you're being honored by the world, you want your family with you.
Perhaps one day, you could be part of our family too.
Ladies and gentlemen, our first award is for the medical breakthrough of the year.
For his company's pioneering work in the field of feminine hygiene
I award Lou Landers douchebag of the year.
# Douchebag #
# He's the douchebag of the year #
# Now ain't he great, folks?
#
# Ain't he grand?
The douchebag of the year. #
# Douchebag #
# He's Mr. Douchebag of the year #
# Look at him smile, look at him shine #
# He's the douchebag of, the douchebag of the year. #
Hold up the douchebag!
Hold up the douchebag, sir.
Stop right there, Landers.
Mr. Riker.
So... you know.
You're damn right I do.
Someone in this auditorium is the Hourglass.
I need your help to figure out who it is.
Now the Hourglass could be anyone... a guest of honor... maybe even a stagehand.
This may be nothing, but I did see a man with what looked like a canister of cerillium.
Who?
- This year's lifetime achievement award...
- Him.
...goes to one of the world's greatest souls,
His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.
This man isn't who you think he is, he's the Hourglass.
No no, I'm a man of peace.
Shut up!
You're plotting to kill all these people and I can prove it.
Show the world the armor you're hiding under these robes.
You can't fool me, Hourglass.
You're packing 10 lbs of Cerillium under there.
- What?
- Ahh!
Take him down.
Tutu.
Peace!
Pea...
Shit shit shit shit shit.
You!
You're the Hourglass.
It's a pity you saw that, my dear.
Perhaps this will help you forget.
What are you doing?
Take me.
Hourglass!
- Hero con?
- It's a convention for people who like to dress up as their favorite heroes and villains.
- By the way, your costume sucks.
- Out of my way!
Excuse me, there is a line.
No, you're killing him all wrong.
It's like this.
Better.
Oh, shit.
Hourglass, you'll never get away with this!
Forget it, Dragonfly.
You're too late.
Run!
Yeah.
Goodbye... little fly.
Dragonfly!
- No!
- Ahhh!
My eye!
So, are you gonna keep the body, or...
Eh.
Dragonfly, you must stop the Hourglass.
I can't.
I can't fly.
If there is one lesson my life can teach, it is that the spirit is stronger than the body.
The hero comes from within.
Those are Celine Dion lyrics.
Whatever.
It's still true.
You're right.
It's working.
Sorry.
Watch, Dragonfly, as your city dies.
Where... am I?
You're with me, your lover.
Dragonfly!
No.
- No.
- Only now do you understand.
Oh, come...
Aha!
I need you to jerk this off.
Yeah.
There's not enough time.
Oh fuck.
- It's over.
- Dragonfly!
Jill!
Gotcha.
- Rick?
- You didn't think I'd let anything happen to the girl I love, did you?
Well, we're still falling.
Damn it!
If only I could fly.
Maybe I wasn't cut out to be a hero.
You know, maybe I was meant to have a normal job... an accountant, a gym teacher.
- This is a really tall building.
- Rick!
I don't care what happens anymore.
If I die, I die happily in your arms.
You're my hero, Rick Riker, and I love you.
Yes!
Oh, thank God!
We only have 50 stories left.
Hang on.
Thank you, Dragonfly.
Because of you, our city is safe at last.
- You said it, Dr. Hawking.
- Shit!
It's a happy ending for us all.
Let's go get some dinner.
I'm buying.
Who am I?
I'm Rick Riker.
I'm the Dragonfly.
And as long as there's crime and injustice
I will forever be a superhero...
I am the Hourglass!
# Darkness has found you, evil surrounds you #

# I'm here to save you?

Stop!
Stop the bus!
The story of my life is not for the faint of heart.
Thanks.
But, like any story worth telling, it's all about a girl.
Not that girl.
- Hey.
Hi.
- I don't think that is a girl.
No, it's about this girl...
Jill Johnson.
Ever since I can remember I've been in love with her, but she barely knows I exist.
Yo, Rick!
Yo, come here, man!
I got you a seat down here.
What's...
I'll call y'all back.
Everybody, bye.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, Trey.
Dude, I'm so psyched for this class trip.
We about to see some real serious cutting-edge shit.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yo, you got any C batteries on you?
AAs?
Got that new sandwich from Sony in my backpack.
Wi-Fi... mmm!
Yo!
You got to forget about her, dawg.
Look look.
Let me show you something.
She not even looking at you.
If I could just tell her how I feel.
Look, Rick, I already told you... you never gonna get with Jill, all right?
Seriously, she hangs out with the popular crew, and nobody messes around outside their group, man.
Come on, that crew stuff isn't real.
The hell it ain't.
Look around, Rick.
- Look, you got your jocks...
- Get the ball, man.
...nerds, emos,
Frodos, the Scarface society the sexual predators.
- Yeah.
- Of course you got the Rick punchers.
- The who?
- Oh!
- Yeah, they new.
Mm-hmm.
But you know what?
Who cares?
'Cause we got our own crew...
me and you.
Thanks, Trey.
You're the best, man.
- Am I in?
- No.
Come on.
Hey, it's me and you, baby.
The two of us against the world.
You hear me?
You look good today.
I like your hair.
I'm gonna show you something nasty I downloaded.
Don't tell nobody.
Welcome to Amalgamated.
I'm Dr. Strom, head of the research department...
- Come on, man.
...where we create the future today.
And now I'd like to show you our crown jewel.
The Amalgamated animal genetics lab.
Whoa.
Go ahead, explore.
Yo yo.
Come on, Rick.
Man, check this out.
All of our animals are genetically engineered and each of them has...
Oh, you're so pretty.
Hi, birdie.
Hi.
Hi.
- She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Yes, she is.
Uh, I'm gonna take a picture of her for the school newspaper.
Our only rules:
Don't feed the animals and please, no flash photography.
Some of our genetically- engineered animals are a little sensitive to light.
It flew away.
Uh... whoo-hoo.
What the F, loser?
Get him, Lance.
- Come on, Lance.
- Leave him alone.
- I don't think so.
Is there a problem, Lance?
No.
No problem, Uncle Lou.
Mr. Landers!
Students, this is Lou Landers, visionary scientist and C.E.O. of Amalgamated.
Well, I'm just a businessman now.
The future of science belongs to all of you.
Please, enjoy the tour.
Are you okay?
Yes, this is healthy-cough blood.
Rick Riker.
You're not Blaine and Julia Riker's son, are you?
- I am.
- Ah.
Good people.
- How are they?
- They died violently nine years ago.
But otherwise okay?
Yes, thank you.
I live with my aunt and uncle now.
Well, you seem like a real chip off the old block.
Let's hope you're not violently murdered too.
That's for making me look stupid.
Next time I hurt you.
Yeah.
You the man, Lance.
Our work with these animals has helped us develop new antibiotics, advanced pesticides and a powerful new pheromone which drives animals to mate called compound H2O0.
It's a strong sexual attractant.
A single drop is enough to arouse any animal.
We plan on using it to breed endangered species.
A special and indeed often overlooked...
Our most-promising research is with these dragonflies.
For example, this dragonfly's skin has a hard, armor-like exoskeleton to defend against...
And this species of dragonfly has enormous strength for its size.
It can lift vast amounts.
More than it's body weight.
And here we've injected the DNA from all three species into seven new genetically-enhanced super dragonflies.
But there's only six in there.
Well, one missing dragonfly is the least of my concerns.
I lost six tigers alone last month.
Ah!
This area is where we keep our livestock.
Ohh.
Aren't you going to do something?
Soon as I get this up on YouTube.
I see.
Ye... well, yes, I understand.
Thank you for the call.
That was the principal.
Rick walked off a class trip.
After all the parenting you've done, he's still so troubled.
Why do you think that is, Albert?
I have no idea, Lucille.
I have taught him everything I know about being a man.
And a good man you are after all these years of marriage.
It's like we first met.
Sure, you're a little older.
Your hair's grey.
You have crow's feet.
It takes you an hour to pee.
Your thighs look like cottage cheese someone threw up on a hot sidewalk.
And you've always had a tiny penis.
Well... what does it matter when you're in love?
Oh, Rick.
We were wondering where you were.
It's so late.
About time you got home.
Your aunt was getting worried.
You can sleep late in the morning, but don't forget to feed the fish.
Attaboy.
I don't know.
Something just doesn't seem quite right with him today.
Teenagers.
I'll talk to him.
Rough day, huh?
Well, I won't lie to you.
Puberty is a difficult time in a young man's life.
Now this book may explain what's happening.
Let's see.
There are mood swings, fluid retention, and once a month you'll bleed from your vagina.
This may be the wrong book.
What's important is that you're on the verge of adulthood.
Here...
take a drink.
Ah, the rituals of manhood.
Today you have your first beer, and tomorrow we'll circumcise you.
I'm losing patience, Dr. Strom.
Please, sir, if you could just wait a few minutes...
I've waited long enough for this egomaniac.
We're the board of directors.
Our time is valuable.
Not as valuable as mine, Mr. Carlson.
You see, I have a terminal illness.
I've been fighting it for years, but the disease has ravaged my organs.
As of this moment, I have one hour left to live.
It was on sale.
Gentlemen, if you're ready, allow me to show you the future.
Strom.
From the...
lift it ov...
lift it over!
What the hell is that?
An innovation...
thank you... that will not only save my life but the life of this company.
For too long we've scraped out profits from pills and injections.
The real prize is the total cure.
A device that can alter DNA and restore the body to perfect health.
- You're crazy.
- No.
Crazy is hearing voices, talking to cats, dating Paula Abdul.
I'm not crazy.
I'm a visionary!
Sir.
Sir, the machine's never been fully tested.
If something should go wrong...
- Start the machine!
- Yes, sir.
Plasma level is steady.
Genetic modification's at optimum levels!
Sir, the core is overheating.
- Ah!
- We have to abort!
Did it work?
I'm so sorry.
Well, well, well.
I want you to know what a joy it will be running this company without you in the way.
Let go.
Let me go.
Gentlemen, I think it's time we made some personnel changes.
No, stay away!
Oh.
How long was I asleep?
Five days.
Huh.
Wait.
Wha...
Oh, Dad.
I thought you'd live forever.
Oh.
Breakfast, Rick!
I'll be right down!
Oh!
If I can have your attention.
We are delighted to have as guest judge the foremost scientist in the world.
He's a visiting professor at Empire City University where he's working with the rare element cerillium.
I am so proud to welcome Dr. Stephen Hawking.
Thank you for that warm welcome.
I have a disease that has paralyzed me.
I cannot walk and I use this computer to speak.
But I am not depressed, because I have the gift of knowledge.
That's a lie.
I think about suicide every day.
But you should all be happy with your lives.
You can walk, talk, wipe your own asses and then there's all the sex.
I haven't had sex in years.
My nurse is a lesbian, and not the hot kind.
Hey, anyone want to get high?
- I've got some hash with me.
- No way.
White guy in the dreads, you know what I'm talking about.
Can I get a what what?
Holla.
I've got a stiff pole for your sweet hole.
Anyone?
Anyone?
Pussies.
Dr. Hawking, I am such a fan.
I'd love to show you my project on supernovas.
You have an incredible ass stromony career ahead of you.
Wait, where's Saturn?
I'd hate to lose my father's bowling ball.
There it is.
Great reflexes.
You have very manly hands.
So do you.
I'm gonna go find a spot for my project.
Yeah, okay.
Watch where you're going in slo-mo, dipshit.
- Pfft.
- Yeah.
Go to her, stupid.
Tell her how you feel.
Yow.
Any day.
Uh... he did it.
Ow!
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Get him, Lance!
- Lance, stop it.
- Kick his ass, Lance!
Fight fight fight!
- Let's see what you got.
- Fucking break him!
Whoa!
Oh!
Damn!
Ooh!
Get off!
Get... get off me!
Yah!
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
Shit shit shit shit.
# Oh no, you didn't, didn't #
- # Oh no, you didn't # - # Oh yes, we did #
# Oh no, you didn't, didn't, Oh no, you didn't #
- # Oh yeah, we did # - # Oh no, you didn't, didn't #
- # Oh no, you didn't # - # Oh yes, we did. #
Stop!
Stop!
Hey!
Get out of the way!
No brakes!
Get out of the way!
Ma'am, look out!
Are you okay?
- How did you...
- I can't believe it.
- You just saved that old lady's life.
- Amazing.
I...
I guess.
If I hadn't pushed her out of the way, she would've die... ah!
You should be really proud of yourself.
You're some kind of hero.
If you could excuse me.
There we go.
Awfully nice of you to help me out here, Trey.
Oh, no problem.
I'm waiting on Rick, anyway, so...
Ooh.
My God.
How did you do that?
Uh, it's easier than it looks.
No, I don't think so.
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
All right.
Well, there is something, okay?
But you have to keep it a secret.
I think I have...
superpowers.
I find that hard to believe.
All right, all right, how about this?
Go ahead and throw as many punches as you want.
I bet you 100 bucks you don't land one.
Easy money.
What else can you do?
I don't know.
I...
I was bitten by a dragonfly.
Well, some dragonflies have armored skin.
I wonder if my skin is...
Well, good thing that worked.
So you do have superpowers.
We could be a team!
We gonna get fame, money...
- Don't forget the bitches.
- There's not gonna be fame and there's not gonna be bitches, okay?
I didn't ask for any of this.
I just wanna be like everybody else.
That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
You're not my father.
But I love you like your father did.
I believe in you like your father did.
I had sex with your mother just like your father did.
Huh.
You'll never understand me.
Never.
That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
What a great performance.
Well, Rick, did you enjoy the opera?
Son, is something troubling you?
It's so unfair.
They have nothing.
Why do we have $2 billion?
Well, your grandfather left us $3 billion and I made some bad investments.
But that's nothing for you to worry about.
But I want to change things.
And you will.
Five generations of Rikers have worked hard to make this city great.
One day, Rick, people will look to you to be a hero.
When that day comes, will you be ready?
Give me your wallet.
That too.
People will look to you to be a hero.
When that day comes, will you be ready?
Rick!
Ah!
Ow!
Huh?
Ah!
Rick, please!
Ah!
- Dad!
- Oh, Rick, I'm dying.
- No!
- Don't worry.
My brother Albert will take you in.
Rick, the money, it's all yours now.
Sell all shares of a small company called Google.
It's worthless.
Invest heavily in Enron.
Rick, I have something for you.
Reach into my coat pocket.
The other coat pocket.
God!
That ring was my father's and his father's before him.
Earn it, Rick.
Be a hero.
Claim your...
- destiny.
Dad!
I'm no superhero.
I'm nobody!
Ah!
Shut up back there!
I'm gonna kill you!
- Are you okay?
- What, you heard that?
You're nothing but an ugly, ungrateful little whore!
Just like your mother!
- Who was that?
- My mother.
Listen, about what happened at school this morning, I...
You really freaked us out.
I'm really going through a tough time right now.
Me too.
My parents, they want me to go to college, but I want to be a dancer.
I believe in you.
You really do, don't you?
I wish I could say the same for Lance.
I don't know.
Is he the right one or am I just dating him to rebel against my father?
He doesn't want any boy near me.
That's why he installed the electrified fence.
Well, we'll see.
You can't run from your destiny.
- Right?
- Right.
- Jill, let's go!
- Nice car.
Maybe one day you could take me for a ride in your car.
Uh...
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, definitely.
Oh.
Lovebirds.
Rick, this is Professor Xavier.
Your powers are growing, but you can't control it.
It's important that you... become a hero...
train yourself to fly in your ass because squatting on a glass table two girls...
one cup...
You know what to do.
- This shouldn't take long.
- Well, I'll be waiting right here.
Hello, Mr. Bailey.
I've reviewed your request for a loan, Mr. Riker, but with no job, no credit history,
I'm afraid I have to say no.
But what about this?
That was last month.
This new promotion's proving quite popular.
Look, I need to buy a car.
Frankly, Mr. Riker, you're the worst applicant we've ever had.
Thanks for the loan, Mr. Thompson.
This is a good boy.
There must be something I could do.
Ma'am... rubbing my crotch under the desk won't change my mind.
I'm not rubbing your crotch.
I really need that car.
I don't see how that's my problem.
This is a robbery!
Nobody move!
Everybody stay down!
Stay down!
- Get down.
- Come on, Lady!
Hurry it up!
- Oh.
- Come on, move it!
Oh, hey, I made the same mistake before when I came in.
Thanks.
You idiot!
You let him get away with our money!
I don't see how that's my problem.
- Oh, man!
- Wow.
Come over here!
You've got to see this.
Let me through.
Let me through.
Oh, thank God.
I thought something terrible had happened.
Well, an old guy did get shot over there.
Uncle Albert!
Just try to breathe.
I can't.
You're kneeling on my balls.
Oh, sorry.
Rick, listen.
With great power comes...
Great responsibility?
I was gonna stick with bitches, but if you want to be a virgin for the rest of your life...
Uncle Albert!
My balls!
Very good.
Oh, God.
Mr. Landers!
Oh no.
Okay.
Hide the body.
Hide the body.
Yeah.
Get in!
Yah!
Yah!
Okay, I come back.
Jill?
I came as soon as I heard.
- Where's Aunt Lucille?
- She's at home under heavy sedation.
They made her watch three hours of women's basketball.
- This is all my fault.
- Rick, it was an armed robbery.
There was nothing you could've done.
I could've stopped that guy before he shot my uncle.
Then there is blood on your hands.
But that's not important.
All that matters is that you're here for him now.
- Rick Riker?
- Yes?
Dr. Whitby.
I've run some tests.
I'm afraid I have bad news.
What is it?
I have an impacted colon.
Whew.
What a night.
Now what brought you here today?
- My uncle.
- Your uncle brought you?
- No, he's gravely injured.
- Well, then he shouldn't be driving.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to perform a breast exam.
Doctor, please.
Is my uncle gonna survive?
Well, I don't know.
We should probably have a look.
Hard to say.
Yup, pretty deep coma.
Is he gonna be okay?
Well, I'm not a betting man, but if you want to put some money on it,
- I'll take "dead in a week."
- Oh my God!
No, it's all right.
It's a normal emotional reaction, but this should take the edge off of it.
Here we go.
Nice and easy.
- That's your vein.
- Yes, I know.
First my parents and now this?
I'm nothing but a screw-up.
Yes, your life has been a testament to that.
But your uncle believed in you and so do I.
It's never too late to become the person you're meant to be.
Rick.
Rick.
Rick.
Hello, Rick.
Who are you and how do you know my name?
- I'm a psychic.
- Prove it.
Think of any number between one and a million and I'll tell you what it is.
- Nine.
- Not out loud, dumbass!
Follow me... you dumb son of a bitch.
My name is Professor Xavier, and this is my school.
I started it to help people with special talents like yours.
Our students here learn to harness their incredible talents.
and use them to advance the common good.
Ah!
Ow.
Here we have children who can walk through walls.
We have children who think they can walk through walls.
Some faces may be familiar, like Wolverine.
Other mutants you probably didn't know existed, like Sneezo.
Most of our students are born with their powers.
Some, like you, gain them later in life.
- Oh, is that...
- Yes, it is.
When he came to this school, he weighed 130 lbs.
Take enough roids, you could do anything.
Back up off those pills, Barry!
- Why have you brought me here?
- Because you have the potential
- to be the best.
- But I can't even fly.
Once you understand the true nature of heroism, you will fly.
But first I must teach you the secret to becoming a superhero.
Hey, Storm!
You look like you putting on a little weight.
Ah!
Oh!
So, Professor, about this secret...
- Well, you see...
- Xavier!
- Aw, shit.
- Well?
You wanna explain why I found her hiding in your closet?
But, pumpkin, I don't see nobody.
- Oh, you don't?
- Ow!
Invisible Girl?
Apparently not invisible enough.
If you knew how to take care of your man, maybe this wouldn't have happened.
- No, she didn't.
- Oh, this bitch is crazy.
I'm gonna have to whip your ass.
- You don't say no disrespectful...
- What are you gonna do, baldy?
I'm everywhere, sweet cheeks.
- Whoa!
- Ow!
- That all you got?
- Yeah!
Now what?
Now how about that, Invisi-bitch?
Yeah, whatever.
I'm out of here.
I'm sure gonna miss her.
She was crazy in the sack.
Biting, scratching, panting, tongue all over the place.
Wasn't me, asshole.
Come on, Spanky.
I didn't even know she had a dog.
Still some of the best sex I ever had.
How could you do this to me?
To your kids?
To your newborn baby?
How do I know that baby's even mine?
Because he can do this.
Shit!
Ah!
Aw, man.
Now I'm never gonna know the secret to becoming a superhero.
You wanna know the secret?
Come close.
Make a costume, shithead!
I swear to God.
They get dumber and dumber every year.
A costume.
Rick, you, uh...
Oh my God.
Damn!
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!
I love the mask.
How you breathe in it though?
What's that sound?
You put some kind of air intake in the mask.
Boy, you better...
now I'm assuming that the material is see-through, right?
Yeah, dude, I'ma tell you something.
Rick, this is good.
I'm impressed.
Like really impressed.
Hey, that's my spot.
You're sitting on my gargoyle.
Move it.
- Excuse me?
- What are you even doing here?
I'm looking seriously out over the city in a squatting position.
Well, that's what I do here.
So if you're not moving,
I guess we're gonna have to share.
Uh, okay, fine.
I actually usually perch in the front.
Oh, all right.
Well, here, you've got to go around.
- Okay, wait.
- Just turn this way.
Here we go.
- Dude!
- You're right, I'm sorry.
Relax.
- Okay okay.
- Okay okay.
- Uh, I can't perch like this.
- God, me neither.
- What's your name?
- John Storm.
Dragonfly.
So what's your power?
What's my power?
Stand back.
- Flame on!
- Whoa!
Huh?
I'm on fire!
Get a blanket or something!
Holy shit!
It's not working!
Get the fire extinguisher!
Ah!
No!
Ah!
God!
You idiot, stop!
What's wrong with you?
Sorry, my bad.
Rick, once you understand the true nature of heroism, you will fly.
Shit.
This Dragonfly, he's not even a hero.
He's not...
I have...
I have...
I have just a...
I have...
He can't...
he can't even fly.
The Dragonfly can't even fly!
I can fly, okay?
I can fly.
This just in:
Tom Cruise is dead.
World's most powerful man.
I have a feeling you might disagree with that.
Strom, do you have my test results?
Yes, sir.
Whatever you're doing to your... victims, rejuvenates you.
But only for 24 hours.
Hmmm.
What if I killed 28 people in one session?
Would that give me a month to live?
If it were February, yes.
But only if your cells could absorb that much energy at once, and they can't.
I'm afraid you have to kill each day to live each day.
Still a slave to the tyranny of time.
There must be some answer.
There isn't.
Unless... unless you had some cerillium.
Then you could create a device powerful enough to draw the life-force out of thousands of people and enhance your own cellular capacity.
Strom, you're a genius.
Wikipedia.
But that's not important.
What is important is that you don't have any cerillium.
Besides, it's immoral.
We don't do that sort of thing.
We're a pharmaceutical company.
Wait a minute.
Take a look.
Hawking's lab is in the physics building.
I could just walk right in.
You're going to steal cerillium?
No, not me.
I'm a law abiding citizen.
But perhaps there's someone inside me.
Someone unfettered by the rule of law.
Someone who will, at any cost, survive!
Ow!
Oh, glass in my eye.
Glass in my eye!
- Does it hurt?
- Uh, yeah, it hurts.
Well, if you could spread...
spread them with your fingers.
Push your lids with your fingers.
- Two... two... two fingers.
- Are your fingers clean?
That's it.
And roll your eyeball around.
- And push it.
- I'm rolling it!
Dig it out with another piece of glass.
Are you fricking insane?
I'll get the tweezers.
Read about the Dragonfly, world's greatest hero.
- Right here?
- Right here, yup.
Read all about it.
No, you listen to me!
I want that story on my desk or you're fired!
Who the hell are you?
I was wondering if you've got a job opening for...
Job?
!
How dare you come in here and ask me for a job?
I'm the editor in chief!
I know the mayor of Venus!
Hamburgers can see the future!
- Rosie O'Donnell...
- Sorry about this.
We share the building with a mental hospital.
Bad news, boss.
We're nowhere on those Dragonfly photos.
Damn.
Those were tomorrow's lead.
What about these?
Wow!
it's almost like you're the Dragonfly.
Uh, no no no.
See?
Look.
Now that's photography.
Just heard on the scanner, some kind of police standoff at Empire University.
We'll need photos.
Kid, I want you to...
Where'd he go?
Come on, let's go!
This is the chief of police.
We have the building surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.
What the hell is that?
I am the Hourglass.
And your time is up.
Get him, Dragonfly.
It's over, Hourglass.
No, Dragonfly.
It's just begun!
It's useless to resist.
I'll fight you to my last breath.
Like the sands of time I am unceasing and relentless.
Evil never triumphs, Hourglass.
You'll pay for your crimes and justice will... stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Are you okay?
No.
Titanium blades.
They cut through diamonds.
I'm not wearing any diamonds.
Ooh, ow!
Ow!
I wish I could stay longer, Dragonfly.
But I just don't have the time.
Whoever this Dragonfly is, he's in over his head.
We don't need so-called superheroes.
What Empire City needs is more cops.
And a Hooters.
Titanium blades.
Looks like someone found your weakness.
It's not my weakness.
I'm sorry, I forgot.
Your weakness is you can't fly.
Maybe if you had a partner.
I don't need help.
I'm fine all by myself.
She means a lot to you, doesn't she?
What?
Oh, no.
I mean, she's with someone else.
Well, maybe that's for the best.
After all, it could be dangerous, you know, being the girlfriend of the Dragonfly.
I don't know what to do, Aunt Lucille.
- I love her.
- So be it.
But remember, to get to you your enemies will attack the people you care for the most.
Be careful not to hurt the ones you love.
And shave your pubes.
No one wants to go down on a tumbleweed.
Jill!
Rick?
I heard you were auditioning for a part so...
Oh, they're beautiful.
God, you are so supportive.
Why can't Lance be more like you?
There's something you're not telling me, isn't there?
Something secret.
Something locked away deep inside.
It was summer camp.
We had to share a shower.
You trip and fall with your mouth open on one guys...
No!
I mean, in here.
Well, there is...
Keep your identity a secret, Rick.
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!
Once a month you'll bleed from you vagina.
I... nothing.
Nothing?
Well, I should go.
You're a good friend.
Hey, check this out.
Hey, check this out.
Oh, shit.
- Let's go.
- Get her.
Oh God, it hurts.
It hurts.
Please stop!
I'm begging you!
Wait!
- Where are you?
- Behind you.
You saved my life.
Do I get to thank you?
Go.
Be a hero.
Yeah.
It looks like you're planning a mass murder.
Would you like help?
Paper clip guy.
I'm so happy that you and your boyfriend are spending Thanksgiving with us.
Of course, Lucille.
You need support at a time like this.
Yes, I miss seeing my Albert each morning.
You know, 50 years of marriage creates quite a bond.
I wish I knew love like that.
Oh, you will, dear.
You just have to follow your heart.
That's the thing.
I don't know if I can.
Oh, Jill.
If you can't trust yourself who can you trust?
I know.
But what if my heart is telling me to be with someone
I can't be with?
It's not just any guy.
It's the... forget it.
You'll think I'm crazy.
No, of course not.
You can tell me anything.
I'm very good at keeping secrets.
You'll think it's ridiculous, but... it's the Drag...
- I'll get it.
- Thank you.
Hey, babe.
Oh, I forgot to tell you I kinda invited my uncle.
- Your uncle?
- What?
Set another plate.
Well, okay.
I guess.
Miss Johnson.
Please, excuse my nephew's poor manners.
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Adams, I'm Lou Landers.
I hope this isn't too much of an imposition.
Oh, of course not.
There's always room for one more.
Thank you.
It's just Thanksgiving is for family.
Lance is the only family I have.
- I never married.
- Fruitcake?
Nope, just never met the right woman.
Ah, yes, Lance told me Rick Riker was your neighbor.
Where is Rick?
That's odd.
I thought he was out.
I'll go check on him.
Please, you're busy.
Allow me.
Thank you.
Upstairs, second door to the right.
Rick?
Hmmm.
Hmmm.
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, Mr. Landers.
Rick.
No, you're just on time.
Everybody, take your seat.
Ohhh.
Ah ah ah!
Not till we say grace.
Jesus!
Amen.
Please start, everyone.
This all looks so delicious, Lucille.
We have Rick to thank for it.
Ever since Albert...
Rick has been supporting me with his new job.
New job?
You didn't tell me.
Oh well, I'm sort of the Dragonfly's unofficial photographer.
What happened to your arm?
Uh... a bike messenger knocked me down.
I see your wrist is bandaged.
Yes, I burned it on some hot coffee.
And you have a cut on your lip.
Uh... my crackpipe broke.
You have a scratch on your neck.
Yes, I... met a girl on Craigslist.
And you have a bruise on your neck.
I... met a guy on Craigslist.
I'm sorry, Lance.
We have to go.
- Why?
- I... shat my pants.
I'll drive.
- Thanks for helping clean up.
- Of course.
Poor thing's so tired.
Yeah, well, you know old folks after a big meal.
So... you know the Dragonfly?
Uh... yeah, I guess.
You could sorta say we're close.
Has he...
has he ever asked about me?
Um, yeah.
- Yeah, once.
- What did you tell him?
Well, I said...
I told him...
I told him, "The thing about Jill is... when you look in her eyes and she looks back in yours...
- you know that you'd do anything anything to be a better person than you are.
So that...
- if you were ever lucky enough to be with her, you could earn every second of her perfect...
- grace, and her limitless beauty...
- and her unending love.
- Don't cry.
- I'm not.
My eyes are burning.
Rick, I want you to know that was the most beautiful thing anyone's ever said to me.
- Scented candle?
- Thank you.
Rick, I'm so confused, and yet...
- I know exactly what I want.
Sorry to drop in uninvited.
It's okay.
We were hoping someone would open a window.
It was getting stuffy in here.
So this is the lair of the Dragonfly.
- How did you...
- No no no,
I'm not here to fight you.
I've got thousands of other people I plan to kill.
This little visit is just to show you who'll get hurt if you get in my way.
Never!
Time to go.
The woman, Lucille Adams of East Empire City,
- was badly injured.
- How was she injured?
- Badly.
- What about the Dragonfly?
All I can tell you is this:
he didn't save anyone tonight.
Doctor, how is she?
I'm afraid your aunt's taken a turn for the worse.
She can't speak, she can't walk, she had no control over her bowels.
That's... that's awful.
I know.
I went ahead and set up a MySpace page for her under "crazy shit machine."
She already has 40 friends.
Wait a minute.
That's somebody else's aunt.
Your aunt has no problem with her bowels...
- Oh, thank God.
...because she's dead.
I'm truly sorry, Rick, but there is a silver lining.
Your uncle came out of his coma this morning.
He did?
Yes, but you mustn't tell him about your aunt just yet.
He's in a delicate mental state.
The slightest bit of bad news could send him spiraling right back into a coma.
I understand.
Mr. Adams, you have a visitor.
- Is it Lucille?
- No, sir, it's not your dead wife.
It's your nephew Rick.
Remember, no bad news.
Now, sir, here you go.
This is my bill.
- You did surgery on me?
- Yes, sir, we confused you with one of our sex-change patients, but don't worry, we didn't remove your penis.
We did cut your testicles off, but, well, since your wife's dead, you won't be needing them anyway.
You just want to keep his spirits up.
He'll land on his feet in no time.
We are gathered today to say goodbye
- to Lucille Adams.
- Goodbye!
And now the eulogy.
It's tragic to think this is the last time that I can look upon my wife's face.
God, Lucille!
How could you take her from me?
I can't live without her!
Ahhh!
Lucille!
Snookie lumps!
I'm sorry, there's been a terrible mistake.
- This is your wife.
- Ah!
She is this man's wife.
Give me five minutes.
- Uncle Albert!
- I'm not finished.
You're one lucky guy.
Now... where's Lucille?
Ah, Lucille!
I do have this coupon for a cremation.
Rick?
I am so sorry for your loss.
What is it?
I know I said some things, but now more than ever, I realize... we can never be together.
I don't believe you.
You love me, Rick.
I know you do.
Jill, trust me.
I'm telling you this for your own good.
I don't love you.
You're no longer in my five.
How could you?
# When I was young #
# I never needed anyone #
# Makin' love was just for fun #
# Those days are gone #
# All by myself #
# Don't wanna be #
# All by myself #
# Anymore #
# All by myself #
# Don't wanna be #
# All by myself. #
# Anymore #
# All by myself #
# Don't want to be #
# All by myself #
# Anymore #
# All by myself. #
You can't keep getting lucky, man.
You only beat me by two strokes this time.
And the back nine is what killed.
Oh my God!
- Look at this place.
- Yo, what are you doing, man?
You gotta pull yourself together, dude.
What's the point?
Look at you...
eating junk food, wearing fake beards, and we found your costume in the garbage outside.
Yeah, well, I'm not the Dragonfly anymore.
But you said the Hourglass was going to kill thousands of people.
I told you I'm no hero.
All right?
Aunt Lucille's dead,
I've rejected the only girl I've ever loved and I can't even fly.
I wish I'd never been bitten by that stupid dragonfly.
And maybe your father shouldn't have given you this after all.
Look at the words your ancestors inscribed in that ring.
"Honor, valor, sacrifice, duty, commitment, bravery, justice, integrity, brotherhood, self-esteem, low prices, affordable housing, loose-fitting pants, cheap internet porn."
The rest is in Latin.
Rick, the hero's path is dangerous.
You may fail or you may fly.
All that matters is that you do it for the best of reasons.
Helping others, Rick, that's what makes you a real hero.
Maybe you're right, but even if I wanted to stop the Hourglass,
I wouldn't know where to start.
I mean, where's he gonna find thousands of people in one place?
Look.
Reporting here live from the Empire City convention center where thousands of people are in one place, but none of them more important than the attendees of the World Humanity Awards.
I'll drive.
Well, that shortcut through the playground sure saved us some time.
You go ahead,
I'll find a place to park.
Mister, please stop!
Each year the World Humanity Awards are held to honor the greatest achievements on behalf of all humanity.
This gala event is expected to draw the world's most prestigious leaders to Empire City.
- Excuse us, excuse us!
- "Empire City Times."
Damn!
Look, there go Prince Charles.
And Nelson Mandela.
Nelson!
Hey, I was in jail too, man.
One of the guests here is the Hourglass.
But which one?
Thank you so much for inviting us, Mr. Landers.
Well, when you're being honored by the world, you want your family with you.
Perhaps one day, you could be part of our family too.
Ladies and gentlemen, our first award is for the medical breakthrough of the year.
For his company's pioneering work in the field of feminine hygiene
I award Lou Landers douchebag of the year.
# Douchebag #
# He's the douchebag of the year #
# Now ain't he great, folks?
#
# Ain't he grand?
The douchebag of the year. #
# Douchebag #
# He's Mr. Douchebag of the year #
# Look at him smile, look at him shine #
# He's the douchebag of, the douchebag of the year. #
Hold up the douchebag!
Hold up the douchebag, sir.
Stop right there, Landers.
Mr. Riker.
So... you know.
You're damn right I do.
Someone in this auditorium is the Hourglass.
I need your help to figure out who it is.
Now the Hourglass could be anyone... a guest of honor... maybe even a stagehand.
This may be nothing, but I did see a man with what looked like a canister of cerillium.
Who?
- This year's lifetime achievement award...
- Him.
...goes to one of the world's greatest souls,
His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.
This man isn't who you think he is, he's the Hourglass.
No no, I'm a man of peace.
Shut up!
You're plotting to kill all these people and I can prove it.
Show the world the armor you're hiding under these robes.
You can't fool me, Hourglass.
You're packing 10 lbs of Cerillium under there.
- What?
- Ahh!
Take him down.
Tutu.
Peace!
Pea...
Shit shit shit shit shit.
You!
You're the Hourglass.
It's a pity you saw that, my dear.
Perhaps this will help you forget.
What are you doing?
Take me.
Hourglass!
- Hero con?
- It's a convention for people who like to dress up as their favorite heroes and villains.
- By the way, your costume sucks.
- Out of my way!
Excuse me, there is a line.
No, you're killing him all wrong.
It's like this.
Better.
Oh, shit.
Hourglass, you'll never get away with this!
Forget it, Dragonfly.
You're too late.
Run!
Yeah.
Goodbye... little fly.
Dragonfly!
- No!
- Ahhh!
My eye!
So, are you gonna keep the body, or...
Eh.
Dragonfly, you must stop the Hourglass.
I can't.
I can't fly.
If there is one lesson my life can teach, it is that the spirit is stronger than the body.
The hero comes from within.
Those are Celine Dion lyrics.
Whatever.
It's still true.
You're right.
It's working.
Sorry.
Watch, Dragonfly, as your city dies.
Where... am I?
You're with me, your lover.
Dragonfly!
No.
- No.
- Only now do you understand.
Oh, come...
Aha!
I need you to jerk this off.
Yeah.
There's not enough time.
Oh fuck.
- It's over.
- Dragonfly!
Jill!
Gotcha.
- Rick?
- You didn't think I'd let anything happen to the girl I love, did you?
Well, we're still falling.
Damn it!
If only I could fly.
Maybe I wasn't cut out to be a hero.
You know, maybe I was meant to have a normal job... an accountant, a gym teacher.
- This is a really tall building.
- Rick!
I don't care what happens anymore.
If I die, I die happily in your arms.
You're my hero, Rick Riker, and I love you.
Yes!
Oh, thank God!
We only have 50 stories left.
Hang on.
Thank you, Dragonfly.
Because of you, our city is safe at last.
- You said it, Dr. Hawking.
- Shit!
It's a happy ending for us all.
Let's go get some dinner.
I'm buying.
Who am I?
I'm Rick Riker.
I'm the Dragonfly.
And as long as there's crime and injustice
I will forever be a superhero...
I am the Hourglass!

Stop!
Stop the bus!
( tires screech )
Boy's voice:
The story of my life is not for the faint of heart.
Thanks.
But, like any story worth telling, it's all about a girl.
Not that girl.
- Hey.
Hi.
- l don't think that is a girl.
No, it's about this girl--
Jill Johnson.
Ever since I can remember I've been in love with her, but she barely knows I exist.
Yo, Rick!
Yo, come here, man!
I got you a seat down here.
What's-- l'll call y'all back.
Everybody, bye.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, Trey.
Dude, I'm so psyched for this class trip.
We about to see some real serious cutting-edge shit.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yo, you got any C batteries on you?
AAs?
Got that new sandwich from Sony in my backpack.
Wi-Fi-- mmm!
Yo!
You got to forget about her, dawg.
Look look.
Let me show you something.
She not even looking at you.
If I could just tell her how I feel.
- Look, Rick, I already told you...
- ( humming ) you never gonna get with Jill, all right?
Seriously, she hangs out with the popular crew, and nobody messes around outside their group, man.
Come on, that crew stuff isn't real.
The hell it ain't.
Look around, Rick.
- Look, you got your jocks...
- Get the ball, man.
...nerds, emos,
Frodos,
- the Scarface society...
- ( gun clicks )
- ...the sexual predators.
- ( mutters ) Yeah.
- Of course you got the Rick punchers.
- The who?
- Oh!
- Yeah, they new.
Mm-hmm.
But you know what?
Who cares?
'Cause we got our own crew-- me and you.
Thanks, Trey.
You're the best, man.
- Am I in?
- Man:
No.
Come on.
Hey, it's me and you, baby.
The two of us against the world.
You hear me?
You look good today.
I like your hair.
I'm gonna show you something nasty I downloaded.
- Don't tell nobody.
- ( sheep bleats )
Man:
Welcome to Amalgamated.
I'm Dr. Strom, head of the research department...
- Come on, man.
- ...where we create the future today.
And now I'd like to show you our crown jewel.
The Amalgamated animal genetics lab.
- ( animals chittering )
- Whoa.
Go ahead, explore.
Yo yo.
Come on, Rick.
Man, check this out.
Strom:
All of our animals are genetically engineered and each of them has...
Oh, you're so pretty.
Hi, birdie.
( giggles )
Hi.
Hi.
- She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Yes, she is.
Uh, I'm gonna take a picture of her for the school newspaper.
Strom:
Our only rules:
Don't feed the animals and please, no flash photography.
Some of our genetically- engineered animals are a little sensitive to light.
It flew away.
Uh-- whoo-hoo.
What the F, loser?
- Boy:
Get him, Lance.
- Come on, Lance.
- Leave him alone.
- l don't think so.
is there a problem, Lance?
No.
No problem, Uncle Lou.
Mr. Landers!
Students, this is Lou Landers, visionary scientist and C.E.O. of Amalgamated.
Well, I'm just a businessman now.
The future of science belongs to all of you.
- Please, enjoy the tour.
- ( kids chatting )
( coughs )
Are you okay?
Yes, this is healthy-cough blood.
Rick Riker.
You're not Blaine and Julia Riker's son, are you?
- l am.
- Ah.
Good people.
- How are they?
- They died violently nine years ago.
But otherwise okay?
Yes, thank you.
I live with my aunt and uncle now.
Well, you seem like a real chip off the old block.
Let's hope you're not violently murdered too.
- ( boys laughing )
- Lance:
That's for making me look stupid.
Next time I hurt you.
Yeah.
You the man, Lance.
Strom:
Our work with these animals has helped us develop new antibiotics, advanced pesticides and a powerful new pheromone which drives animals to mate called compound H2O9.
It's a strong sexual attractant.
A single drop is enough to arouse any animal.
We plan on using it to breed endangered species.
A special and indeed often overlooked- ( rabbit shrieks )
- Our most-promising research is with these dragonflies.
For example, this dragonfly's skin has a hard, armor-like exoskeleton to defend against...
And this species of dragonfly has enormous strength for its size.
It can lift vast amounts.
- More than it's body weight.
- ( monkey chatters )
And here we've injected the DNA from all three species into seven new genetically-enhanced super dragonflies.
But there's only six in there.
Well, one missing dragonfly is the least of my concerns.
I lost six tigers alone last month.
- ( crunches )
- Ah!
Strom:
This area is where we keep our livestock.
- Ohh.
- ( grunting )
Aren't you going to do something?
Soon as I get this up on YouTube.
I see.
Ye-- well, yes, I understand.
Thank you for the call.
That was the principal.
Rick walked off a class trip.
After all the parenting you've done, he's still so troubled.
Why do you think that is, Albert?
I have no idea, Lucille.
I have taught him everything I know about being a man.
And a good man you are after all these years of marriage.
It's like we first met.
Sure, you're a little older.
Your hair's grey.
You have crow's feet.
It takes you an hour to pee.
Your thighs look like cottage cheese someone threw up on a hot sidewalk.
And you've always had a tiny penis.
Well... what does it matter when you're in love?
- ( groaning )
- Oh, Rick.
We were wondering where you were.
It's so late.
About time you got home.
Your aunt was getting worried.
You can sleep late in the morning, but don't forget to feed the fish.
Attaboy.
( phone clatters ) I don't know.
Something just doesn't seem quite right with him today.
Teenagers.
I'll talk to him.
( knocks )
Rough day, huh?
Well, I won't lie to you.
Puberty is a difficult time in a young man's life.
Now this book may explain what's happening.
Let's see.
There are mood swings, fluid retention, and once a month you'll bleed from your vagina.
This may be the wrong book.
What's important is that you're on the verge of adulthood.
Here...
take a drink.
Ah, the rituals of manhood.
Today you have your first beer, and tomorrow we'll circumcise you.
( thunder booming )
I'm losing patience, Dr. Strom.
Please, sir, if you could just wait a few minutes-- l've waited long enough for this egomaniac.
We're the board of directors.
Our time is valuable.
Not as valuable as mine, Mr. Carlson.
You see, I have a terminal illness.
I've been fighting it for years, but the disease has ravaged my organs.
As of this moment, I have one hour left to live.
It was on sale.
Lou:
Gentlemen, if you're ready, allow me to show you the future.
Strom.
From the-- lift it ov-- lift it over!
What the hell is that?
An innovation-- thank you-- that will not only save my life but the life of this company.
For too long we've scraped out profits from pills and injections.
The real prize is the total cure.
A device that can alter DNA and restore the body to perfect health.
- You're crazy.
- ( Lou chuckles ) No.
Crazy is hearing voices, talking to cats, dating Paula Abdul.
I'm not crazy.
I'm a visionary!
Sir.
Sir, the machine's never been fully tested.
If something should go wrong--
- Start the machine!
- Yes, sir.
- ( beeps, whirrs ) - ( grunts )
Plasma level is steady.
Genetic modification's at optimum levels!
- ( beeps )
- Sir, the core is overheating.
- Ah!
- Strom:
We have to abort!
( whirrs down )
- ( computer beeping )
- Did it work?
- ( men whispering ) - l'm so sorry.
Well, well, well.
I want you to know what a joy it will be running this company without you in the way.
Let go.
Let me go.
( Carlson screaming )
Gentlemen, I think it's time we made some personnel changes.
- ( men screaming )
- Man:
No, stay away!
( hitch-pitched screaming )
( birds chirping )
( birds chirping )
Oh.
How long was I asleep?
Five days.
( grunts, farts )
Huh.
( beeping )
( buzzes )
( beeping )
Wait.
Wha--
Oh, Dad.
I thought you'd live forever.
Oh.
Lucille:
Breakfast, Rick!
I'll be right down!
Oh!
( bell rings )
( bell rings )
Woman:
If I can have your attention.
We are delighted to have as guest judge the foremost scientist in the world.
He's a visiting professor at Empire City University where he's working with the rare element cerillium.
I am so proud to welcome Dr. Stephen Hawking.
Computer:
Thank you for that warm welcome.
I have a disease that has paralyzed me.
I cannot walk and I use this computer to speak.
But I am not depressed, because I have the gift of knowledge.
That's a lie.
I think about suicide every day.
But you should all be happy with your lives.
You can walk, talk, wipe your own asses and then there's all the sex.
- ( murmuring loudly ) - l haven't had sex in years.
My nurse is a lesbian, and not the hot kind.
Hey, anyone want to get high?
- l've got some hash with me.
- Girl:
No way.
White guy in the dreads, you know what I'm talking about.
Can I get a what what?
Holla.
I've got a stiff pole for your sweet hole.
Anyone?
Anyone?
Pussies.
Dr. Hawking, I am such a fan.
I'd love to show you my project on supernovas.
You have an incredible ass stromony career ahead of you.
Wait, where's Saturn?
I'd hate to lose my father's bowling ball.
There it is.
Great reflexes.
You have very manly hands.
So do you.
I'm gonna go find a spot for my project.
Yeah, okay.
Watch where you're going in slo-mo, dipshit.
- Pfft.
- Yeah.
( whispers ) Go to her, stupid.
Tell her how you feel.
( rips )
Yow.
Boy:
Any day.
Uh... he did it.
- ( thunks )
- Man:
Ow!
- l'm gonna kill you.
- Boy #2:
Get him, Lance!
- Lance, stop it.
- Boy #3:
Kick his ass, Lance!
Fight fight fight!
- Let's see what you got.
- Fucking break him!
Boy #4:
Whoa!
Crowd:
Oh!
Damn!
Ooh!
Get off!
Get-- get off me!
Yah!
( bees buzzing )
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
Shit shit shit shit.
( siren blaring in distance )
( dramatic music playing )
- ( hip-hop music playing ) - ## Oh no, you didn't, didn't ##
- ## Oh no, you didn't ## - ## Oh yes, we did ##
## Oh no, you didn't, didn't, Oh no, you didn't ##
- ## Oh yeah, we did ## - ## Oh no, you didn't, didn't ##
- ## Oh no, you didn't ## - ## Oh yes, we did. ##
- ( meows ) - ( truck horn blaring )
Stop!
Stop!
Hey!
Get out of the way!
No brakes!
Get out of the way!
- ( screaming )
- Ma'am, look out!
Woman:
Are you okay?
( moans )
- How did you-- - l can't believe it.
- You just saved that old lady's life.
- Amazing.
l-- l guess.
If I hadn't pushed her out of the way, she would've die-- ah!
- ( grinding ) - ( whining )
- You should be really proud of yourself.
- ( dog barks )
- ( dog whines )
- You're some kind of hero.
If you could excuse me.
( rapid footsteps fading )
( high-pitched hisses )
( high-pitched hisses )
There we go.
Awfully nice of you to help me out here, Trey.
Oh, no problem.
I'm waiting on Rick, anyway, so...
- ( high-pitched hiss )
- Ooh.
My God.
How did you do that?
Uh, it's easier than it looks.
- ( high-pitched hiss ) - ( screaming )
No, I don't think so.
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
All right.
Well, there is something, okay?
But you have to keep it a secret.
( nail clanks ) I think I have...
superpowers.
I find that hard to believe.
All right, all right, how about this?
Go ahead and throw as many punches as you want.
I bet you 100 bucks you don't land one.
- Albert:
Easy money.
- ( dollars rustle )
What else can you do?
I don't know.
l-- l was bitten by a dragonfly.
Well, some dragonflies have armored skin.
- l wonder if my skin is-- - ( yells )
Well, good thing that worked.
So you do have superpowers.
We could be a team!
We gonna get fame, money--
- Don't forget the bitches.
- There's not gonna be fame and there's not gonna be bitches, okay?
I didn't ask for any of this.
I just wanna be like everybody else.
That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
You're not my father.
But I love you like your father did.
I believe in you like your father did.
I had sex with your mother just like your father did.
Huh.
You'll never understand me.
- Never.
- ( door slams )
( Albert's voice echoing ) That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
What a great performance.
Well, Rick, did you enjoy the opera?
( bottles rattling )
Son, is something troubling you?
It's so unfair.
They have nothing.
Why do we have $2 billion?
Well, your grandfather left us $3 billion and I made some bad investments.
But that's nothing for you to worry about.
But I want to change things.
And you will.
Five generations of Rikers have worked hard to make this city great.
One day, Rick, people will look to you to be a hero.
When that day comes, will you be ready?
Give me your wallet.
That too.
Blaine's voice:
People will look to you to be a hero.
When that day comes, will you be ready?
Rick!
Ah!
- ( bullet ricochets )
- Ow!
Huh?
Ah!
Rick, please!
Ah!
- Dad!
- Oh, Rick, I'm dying.
- No!
- Don't worry.
My brother Albert will take you in.
Rick, the money, it's all yours now.
Sell all shares of a small company called Google.
It's worthless.
Invest heavily in Enron.
Rick, I have something for you.
Reach into my coat pocket.
- ( gun fires ) - ( grunts ) The other coat pocket.
( groans, grunts )
God!
That ring was my father's and his father's before him.
Earn it, Rick.
Be a hero.
Claim your-- ( choking )
--destiny.
Dad!
I'm no superhero.
I'm nobody!
Ah!
Man:
Shut up back there!
I'm gonna kill you!
- ( loud clattering ) - ( woman screams )
( glass breaking )
( gunshots )
( cat screeches )
( sighs )
- Are you okay?
- What, you heard that?
You're nothing but an ugly, ungrateful little whore!
Just like your mother!
- Who was that?
- My mother.
Listen, about what happened at school this morning, l--
You really freaked us out.
I'm really going through a tough time right now.
Me too.
My parents, they want me to go to college, but I want to be a dancer.
I believe in you.
You really do, don't you?
I wish I could say the same for Lance.
I don't know.
is he the right one or am I just dating him to rebel against my father?
- He doesn't want any boy near me.
- ( electricity crackling )
That's why he installed the electrified fence.
Well, we'll see.
You can't run from your destiny.
- Right?
- Right.
- ( car engine revs ) - ( car honks )
- Jill, let's go!
- Nice car.
Maybe one day you could take me for a ride in your car.
Uh...
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, definitely.
( chirping )
Oh.
Lovebirds.
( beeps )
( clicks )
Rick, this is Professor Xavier.
Your powers are growing, but you can't control it.
It's important that you... become a hero...
train yourself to fly... ( beeping ) ...in your ass because squatting on a glass table two girls...
one cup...
You know what to do.
- This shouldn't take long.
- Well, I'll be waiting right here.
Woman:
Hello, Mr. Bailey.
I've reviewed your request for a loan, Mr. Riker, but with no job, no credit history, I'm afraid I have to say no.
But what about this?
That was last month.
This new promotion's proving quite popular.
Look, I need to buy a car.
Frankly, Mr. Riker, you're the worst applicant we've ever had.
Thanks for the loan, Mr. Thompson.
( laughs )
This is a good boy.
There must be something I could do.
Ma'am... rubbing my crotch under the desk won't change my mind.
I'm not rubbing your crotch.
I really need that car.
I don't see how that's my problem.
- ( gunshot )
- Man:
This is a robbery!
Nobody move!
Everybody stay down!
Stay down!
- Get down.
- Man:
Come on, Lady!
Hurry it up!
- Oh.
- Come on, move it!
Oh, hey, I made the same mistake before when I came in.
Thanks.
You idiot!
You let him get away with our money!
I don't see how that's my problem.
( gunshots )
- Man:
Oh, man!
- Man #2:
Wow.
Come over here!
You've got to see this.
Let me through.
Let me through.
- ( chittering ) - ( accordion playing )
Oh, thank God. I thought something terrible had happened.
Well, an old guy did get shot over there.
- Uncle Albert!
Just try to breathe.
- ( grunting ) I can't.
You're kneeling on my balls.
- ( sirens blaring )
- Oh, sorry.
Rick, listen.
With great power comes--
Great responsibility?
I was gonna stick with bitches, but if you want to be a virgin for the rest of your life...
- ( muffled )
- Uncle Albert!
My balls!
( beeping )
Very good.
( alarm beeping )
( gasps )
Oh, God.
Mr. Landers!
( woman gasping )
Oh no.
Okay.
( grunts )
Hide the body.
Hide the body.
Yeah.
Get in!
Yah!
Yah!
Okay, I come back.
( beeping )
Jill?
I came as soon as I heard.
- Where's Aunt Lucille?
- She's at home under heavy sedation.
They made her watch three hours of women's basketball.
- This is all my fault.
- Rick, it was an armed robbery.
There was nothing you could've done.
I could've stopped that guy before he shot my uncle.
Then there is blood on your hands.
But that's not important.
All that matters is that you're here for him now.
- Rick Riker?
- Yes?
Dr. Whitby.
I've run some tests.
I'm afraid I have bad news.
- What is it?
- ( sighs ) I have an impacted colon.
Whew.
What a night.
Now what brought you here today?
- My uncle.
- Your uncle brought you?
- No, he's gravely injured.
- Well, then he shouldn't be driving.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to perform a breast exam.
Doctor, please.
is my uncle gonna survive?
Well, I don't know.
We should probably have a look.
Hard to say.
Yup, pretty deep coma.
is he gonna be okay?
Well, I'm not a betting man, but if you want to put some money on it,
- l'll take "dead in a week."
- Oh my God!
No, it's all right.
It's a normal emotional reaction, but this should take the edge off of it.
Here we go.
Nice and easy.
- That's your vein.
- Yes, I know.
- First my parents and now this?
- ( thuds ) I'm nothing but a screw-up.
Yes, your life has been a testament to that.
But your uncle believed in you and so do I.
It's never too late to become the person you're meant to be.
Man's voice:
Rick.
Man's voice:
Rick.
Rick.
Hello, Rick.
Who are you and how do you know my name?
- l'm a psychic.
- Prove it.
Think of any number between one and a million and I'll tell you what it is.
- Nine.
- Not out loud, dumbass!
( sighs ) Follow me... ( mutters ) you dumb son of a bitch.
My name is Professor Xavier, and this is my school.
I started it to help people with special talents like yours.
Our students here learn to harness their incredible talents.
and use them to advance the common good.
- Ah!
Ow.
- ( girl laughs )
Here we have children who can walk through walls.
We have children who think they can walk through walls.
- ( groans )
- Some faces may be familiar, like Wolverine.
Other mutants you probably didn't know existed, like Sneezo.
Most of our students are born with their powers.
Some, like you, gain them later in life.
- Oh, is that--
- Yes, it is.
When he came to this school, he weighed 130 lbs.
Take enough roids, you could do anything.
( yells )
- Back up off those pills, Barry!
- ( glass shatters )
( toilet flushes )
- Why have you brought me here?
- Because you have the potential
- to be the best.
- But I can't even fly.
Once you understand the true nature of heroism, you will fly.
But first I must teach you the secret to becoming a superhero.
Hey, Storm!
You look like you putting on a little weight.
- ( wind howls )
- Ah!
Oh!
So, Professor, about this secret--
- Well, you see--
- Woman:
Xavier!
- Aw, shit.
- Well?
You wanna explain why I found her hiding in your closet?
But, pumpkin, I don't see nobody.
- Oh, you don't?
- Ow!
Rick:
Invisible Girl?
Apparently not invisible enough.
If you knew how to take care of your man, maybe this wouldn't have happened.
- No, she didn't.
- Oh, this bitch is crazy.
I'm gonna have to whip your ass.
- You don't say no disrespectful--
- What are you gonna do, baldy?
I'm everywhere, sweet cheeks.
- Whoa!
- Ow!
- That all you got?
- Yeah!
Now what?
Now how about that, lnvisi-bitch?
Yeah, whatever.
I'm out of here.
I'm sure gonna miss her.
She was crazy in the sack.
Biting, scratching, panting, tongue all over the place.
Wasn't me, asshole.
- Come on, Spanky.
- ( barks ) I didn't even know she had a dog.
Still some of the best sex I ever had.
How could you do this to me?
To your kids?
To your newborn baby?
How do I know that baby's even mine?
Because he can do this.
Shit!
( thunks ) Ah!
Aw, man.
Now I'm never gonna know the secret to becoming a superhero.
You wanna know the secret?
Come close.
Make a costume, shithead!
I swear to God.
They get dumber and dumber every year.
A costume.
- ( knocks )
- Rick, you, uh...
Oh my God.
Damn!
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!
I love the mask.
How you breathe in it though?
- ( labored breathing )
- What's that sound?
You put some kind of air intake in the mask.
Boy, you better-- now I'm assuming that the material is see-through, right?
I'm impressed.
Like really impressed.
Man:
Hey, that's my spot.
You're sitting on my gargoyle.
Move it.
- Excuse me?
- What are you even doing here?
I'm looking seriously out over the city in a squatting position.
Well, that's what I do here.
So if you're not moving, I guess we're gonna have to share.
Uh, okay, fine.
I actually usually perch in the front.
Oh, all right.
Well, here, you've got to go around.
- Okay, wait.
- Just turn this way.
Here we go.
- Dude!
- You're right, I'm sorry.
Relax.
- Okay okay.
- Okay okay.
- Uh, I can't perch like this.
- God, me neither.
- What's your name?
- John Storm.
Dragonfly.
So what's your power?
What's my power?
Stand back.
- Flame on!
- Whoa!
( chuckles ) Huh?
( screaming ) I'm on fire!
Get a blanket or something!
Holy shit!
It's not working!
Get the fire extinguisher!
Ah!
No!
Ah!
God!
You idiot, stop!
What's wrong with you?
( screaming louder )
- ( thuds ) - ( car alarm blaring )
Sorry, my bad.
Xavier's voice:
Rick, once you understand the true nature of heroism, you will fly.
- ( thuds )
- Shit.
( grunting )
This Dragonfly, he's not even a hero.
He's not-- l have-- l have-- l have just a-- l have--
( chuckles )
He can't-- he can't even fly.
The Dragonfly can't even fly!
I can fly, okay?
I can fly.
This just in:
Tom Cruise is dead.
Lou:
World's most powerful man.
I have a feeling you might disagree with that.
Strom, do you have my test results?
Yes, sir.
Whatever you're doing to your... victims, rejuvenates you.
But only for 24 hours.
Hmmm.
What if I killed 28 people in one session?
Would that give me a month to live?
If it were February, yes.
But only if your cells could absorb that much energy at once, and they can't.
I'm afraid you have to kill each day to live each day.
Still a slave to the tyranny of time.
There must be some answer.
There isn't.
Unless... unless you had some cerillium.
Then you could create a device powerful enough to draw the life-force out of thousands of people and enhance your own cellular capacity.
Strom, you're a genius.
Wikipedia.
But that's not important.
What is important is that you don't have any cerillium.
Besides, it's immoral.
We don't do that sort of thing.
We're a pharmaceutical company.
Wait a minute.
Take a look.
Hawking's lab is in the physics building.
I could just walk right in.
You're going to steal cerillium?
No, not me.
I'm a law abiding citizen.
But perhaps there's someone inside me.
Someone unfettered by the rule of law.
Someone who will, at any cost, survive!
( laughs maniacally ) Ow!
Oh, glass in my eye.
Glass in my eye!
- Does it hurt?
- Uh, yeah, it hurts.
Well, if you could spread-- spread them with your fingers.
Push your lids with your fingers.
- Two-- two-- two fingers.
- Are your fingers clean?
That's it.
And roll your eyeball around.
- And push it.
- l'm rolling it!
Dig it out with another piece of glass.
Are you fricking insane?
I'll get the tweezers.
Man:
Read about the Dragonfly, world's greatest hero.
- Right here?
- Right here, yup.
Read all about it.
Man:
No, you listen to me!
I want that story on my desk or you're fired!
Who the hell are you?
I was wondering if you've got a job opening for--
Job?
!
How dare you come in here and ask me for a job?
I'm the editor in chief!
I know the mayor of Venus!
Hamburgers can see the future!
- Rosie O'Donnell--
- Sorry about this.
We share the building with a mental hospital.
Bad news, boss.
We're nowhere on those Dragonfly photos.
Damn.
Those were tomorrow's lead.
What about these?
Wow!
it's almost like you're the Dragonfly.
Uh, no no no.
See?
Look.
Now that's photography.
Just heard on the scanner, some kind of police standoff at Empire University.
We'll need photos.
Kid, I want you to--
Where'd he go?
( siren blaring )
( siren blaring )
Come on, let's go!
This is the chief of police.
We have the building surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.
( high-pitched whine )
What the hell is that?
( crowd screaming )
I am the Hourglass.
And your time is up.
Woman:
Get him, Dragonfly.
( grunts ) lt's over, Hourglass.
No, Dragonfly.
( groaning )
It's just begun!
( shouting ) lt's useless to resist.
I'll fight you to my last breath.
Like the sands of time I am unceasing and relentless.
Evil never triumphs, Hourglass.
You'll pay for your crimes and justice will-- stop!
Stop!
Stop!
- ( gurgling )
- Are you okay?
- No.
- ( retching )
Titanium blades.
They cut through diamonds.
I'm not wearing any diamonds.
Ooh, ow!
Ow!
( grunts ) I wish I could stay longer, Dragonfly.
But I just don't have the time.
( explosion )
Whoever this Dragonfly is, he's in over his head.
We don't need so-called superheroes.
What Empire City needs is more cops.
And a Hooters.
Titanium blades.
Looks like someone found your weakness.
It's not my weakness.
I'm sorry, I forgot.
Your weakness is you can't fly.
Maybe if you had a partner.
I don't need help.
I'm fine all by myself.
She means a lot to you, doesn't she?
What?
Oh, no.
I mean, she's with someone else.
Well, maybe that's for the best.
After all, it could be dangerous, you know, being the girlfriend of the Dragonfly.
I don't know what to do, Aunt Lucille.
- l love her.
- So be it.
But remember, to get to you your enemies will attack the people you care for the most.
Be careful not to hurt the ones you love.
And shave your pubes.
No one wants to go down on a tumbleweed.
Jill!
Rick?
I heard you were auditioning for a part so...
Oh, they're beautiful.
God, you are so supportive.
Why can't Lance be more like you?
There's something you're not telling me, isn't there?
Something secret.
Something locked away deep inside.
It was summer camp.
We had to share a shower.
You trip and fall with your mouth open on one guys--
No!
I mean, in here.
Well, there is...
Lucille's voice:
Keep your identity a secret, Rick.
Trey's voice:
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!
Albert's voice:
Once a month you'll bleed from you vagina.
I... nothing.
Nothing?
Well, I should go.
You're a good friend.
- Hey, check this out.
- ( whistling )
- Hey, check this out.
- ( whistling )
Oh, shit.
- Let's go.
- Get her.
( groaning )
( screaming )
Oh God, it hurts.
It hurts.
Please stop!
I'm begging you!
( groaning )
( thunder rumbles )
- ( buzzes )
- Wait!
- Where are you?
- Behind you.
You saved my life.
Do I get to thank you?
( thunder rumbling )
( siren wailing )
Go.
Be a hero.
Yeah.
Computer:
It looks like you're planning a mass murder.
Would you like help?
( mutters ) Paper clip guy.
I'm so happy that you and your boyfriend are spending Thanksgiving with us.
Of course, Lucille.
You need support at a time like this.
Yes, I miss seeing my Albert each morning.
You know, 50 years of marriage creates quite a bond.
I wish I knew love like that.
Oh, you will, dear.
You just have to follow your heart.
That's the thing.
I don't know if I can.
Oh, Jill.
If you can't trust yourself who can you trust?
I know.
But what if my heart is telling me to be with someone
- l can't be with?
- ( howling ) lt's not just any guy.
It's the-- forget it.
You'll think I'm crazy.
No, of course not.
You can tell me anything.
I'm very good at keeping secrets.
You'll think it's ridiculous, but...
- it's the Drag-- - ( doorbell rings )
- l'll get it.
- Thank you.
Hey, babe.
Oh, I forgot to tell you I kinda invited my uncle.
- Your uncle?
- What?
Set another plate.
Well, okay.
I guess.
Miss Johnson.
Please, excuse my nephew's poor manners.
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Adams, I'm Lou Landers.
I hope this isn't too much of an imposition.
Oh, of course not.
There's always room for one more.
Thank you.
It's just Thanksgiving is for family.
Lance is the only family I have.
- l never married.
- Fruitcake?
Nope, just never met the right woman.
Ah, yes, Lance told me Rick Riker was your neighbor.
Where is Rick?
- ( thumps )
- That's odd.
I thought he was out.
I'll go check on him.
Please, you're busy.
Allow me.
Thank you.
Upstairs, second door to the right.
- ( urinating ) - ( knocking )
Rick?
Hmmm.
Hmmm.
( drips )
( sprinkler thwapping )
( muttering )
( thuds )
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, Mr. Landers.
Rick.
Lucille:
No, you're just on time.
Everybody, take your seat.
Ohhh.
Ah ah ah!
Not till we say grace.
Jesus!
All:
Amen.
Please start, everyone.
This all looks so delicious, Lucille.
We have Rick to thank for it.
Ever since Albert--
Rick has been supporting me with his new job.
New job?
You didn't tell me.
Oh well, I'm sort of the Dragonfly's unofficial photographer.
What happened to your arm?
Uh... a bike messenger knocked me down.
I see your wrist is bandaged.
Yes, I burned it on some hot coffee.
And you have a cut on your lip.
Uh... my crackpipe broke.
You have a scratch on your neck.
Yes, I... met a girl on Craigslist.
And you have a bruise on your neck.
I... met a guy on Craigslist.
I'm sorry, Lance.
We have to go.
- Why?
- l... shat my pants.
( silverware clatters ) I'll drive.
( snoring )
- Thanks for helping clean up.
- Of course.
Poor thing's so tired.
Yeah, well, you know old folks after a big meal.
So... you know the Dragonfly?
Uh... yeah, I guess.
You could sorta say we're close.
Has he...
has he ever asked about me?
Um, yeah.
- Yeah, once.
- What did you tell him?
Well, I said-- l told him--
I told him, "The thing about Jill is... when you look in her eyes and she looks back in yours--
( farts )
( farts )
--you know that you'd do anything anything to be a better person than you are.
- So that-- - ( farts )
--if you were ever lucky enough to be with her, you could earn every second of her perfect--
( farting )
--grace, and her limitless beauty--
( farting )
--and her unending love.
- Don't cry.
- l'm not.
My eyes are burning.
Rick, I want you to know that was the most beautiful thing anyone's ever said to me.
( farting )
- Scented candle?
- Thank you.
- Rick, I'm so confused, and yet-- - ( farts )
--l know exactly what I want.
( farting )
( squeaks )
( groans )
Sorry to drop in uninvited.
It's okay.
We were hoping someone would open a window.
It was getting stuffy in here.
So this is the lair of the Dragonfly.
- How did you--
- No no no, I'm not here to fight you. I've got thousands of other people I plan to kill.
This little visit is just to show you who'll get hurt if you get in my way.
Never!
Time to go.
( screaming )
( farts )
The woman, Lucille Adams of East Empire City,
- was badly injured.

How was she injured?
- Badly.
- What about the Dragonfly?
All I can tell you is this:
he didn't save anyone tonight.
Doctor, how is she?
I'm afraid your aunt's taken a turn for the worse.
She can't speak, she can't walk, she had no control over her bowels.
That's-- that's awful.
I know. I went ahead and set up a MySpace page for her under "crazy shit machine."
She already has 40 friends.
Wait a minute.
That's somebody else's aunt.
Your aunt has no problem with her bowels...
- Oh, thank God.
- ...because she's dead.
I'm truly sorry, Rick, but there is a silver lining.
Your uncle came out of his coma this morning.
He did?
Yes, but you mustn't tell him about your aunt just yet.
He's in a delicate mental state.
The slightest bit of bad news could send him spiraling right back into a coma.
I understand.
Mr. Adams, you have a visitor.
- ls it Lucille?
- No, sir, it's not your dead wife.
It's your nephew Rick.
( softly ) Remember, no bad news.
Now, sir, here you go.
This is my bill.
- You did surgery on me?
- Yes, sir, we confused you with one of our sex-change patients, but don't worry, we didn't remove your penis.
We did cut your testicles off, but, well, since your wife's dead, you won't be needing them anyway.
You just want to keep his spirits up.
He'll land on his feet in no time.
Priest:
We are gathered today to say goodbye
- to Lucille Adams.
- Mourners:
Goodbye!
Priest:
And now the eulogy.
Albert:
It's tragic to think this is the last time that I can look upon my wife's face.
God, Lucille!
How could you take her from me?
I can't live without her!
- Ahhh!
- ( crowd exclaims )
Lucille!
Snookie lumps!
I'm sorry, there's been a terrible mistake.
- This is your wife.
- Ah!
She is this man's wife.
Give me five minutes.
( coffin squeaking )
- Uncle Albert!
- l'm not finished.
( sniffs )
You're one lucky guy.
Now... where's Lucille?
Ah, Lucille!
( sighs )
( crowd shouting ) I do have this coupon for a cremation.
Rick?
I am so sorry for your loss.
What is it?
I know I said some things, but now more than ever, I realize... we can never be together.
I don't believe you.
( soft sobs )
You love me, Rick.
I know you do.
Jill, trust me.
I'm telling you this for your own good.
I don't love you.
You're no longer in my five.
How could you?
## When I was young ## ## l never needed anyone ##
## Makin' love was just for fun ##
## Those days are gone ##
## All by myself ##
## Don't wanna be ##
## All by myself ##
## Anymore ##
## All by myself ##
## Don't wanna be ##
## All by myself. ##
## Anymore ##
## All by myself ##
## Don't want to be ##
## All by myself ##
## Anymore ##
## All by myself. ##
( spraying )
You can't keep getting lucky, man.
You only beat me by two strokes this time.
And the back nine is what killed.
- ( glass shatters )
- Oh my God!
- Look at this place.
- Yo, what are you doing, man?
You gotta pull yourself together, dude.
What's the point?
( burbles )
Look at you-- eating junk food, wearing fake beards, and we found your costume in the garbage outside.
Yeah, well, I'm not the Dragonfly anymore.
But you said the Hourglass was going to kill thousands of people.
I told you I'm no hero.
All right?
Aunt Lucille's dead, I've rejected the only girl I've ever loved and I can't even fly.
I wish I'd never been bitten by that stupid dragonfly.
And maybe your father shouldn't have given you this after all.
Look at the words your ancestors inscribed in that ring.
"Honor, valor, sacrifice, duty, commitment, bravery, justice, integrity, brotherhood, self-esteem, low prices, affordable housing, loose-fitting pants, cheap internet porn."
The rest is in Latin.
Rick, the hero's path is dangerous.
You may fail or you may fly.
All that matters is that you do it for the best of reasons.
Helping others, Rick, that's what makes you a real hero.
Maybe you're right, but even if I wanted to stop the Hourglass, I wouldn't know where to start.
I mean, where's he gonna find thousands of people in one place?
Look.
Reporting here live from the Empire City convention center where thousands of people are in one place, but none of them more important than the attendees of the World Humanity Awards.
I'll drive.
- ( brakes squeal ) - ( grunting )
Well, that shortcut through the playground sure saved us some time.
You go ahead, I'll find a place to park.
Girl:
Mister, please stop!
Each year the World Humanity Awards are held to honor the greatest achievements on behalf of all humanity.
This gala event is expected to draw the world's most prestigious leaders to Empire City.
- Excuse us, excuse us!
- "Empire City Times."
Damn!
Look, there go Prince Charles.
And Nelson Mandela.
Nelson!
Hey, I was in jail too, man.
One of the guests here is the Hourglass.
But which one?
Thank you so much for inviting us, Mr. Landers.
Well, when you're being honored by the world, you want your family with you.
Perhaps one day, you could be part of our family too.
( snorts )
Ladies and gentlemen, our first award is for the medical breakthrough of the year.
For his company's pioneering work in the field of feminine hygiene I award Lou Landers douchebag of the year.
## Douchebag ##
## He's the douchebag of the year ##
## Now ain't he great, folks?
##
## Ain't he grand?
The douchebag of the year. ##
## Douchebag ##
## He's Mr. Douchebag of the year ##
## Look at him smile, look at him shine ##
## He's the douchebag of, the douchebag of the year. ##
Hold up the douchebag!
Hold up the douchebag, sir.
Stop right there, Landers.
Mr. Riker.
So... you know.
You're damn right I do.
Someone in this auditorium is the Hourglass.
I need your help to figure out who it is.
Now the Hourglass could be anyone-- a guest of honor... maybe even a stagehand.
This may be nothing, but I did see a man with what looked like a canister of cerillium.
Who?
- This year's lifetime achievement award...
- Him.
...goes to one of the world's greatest souls,
His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.
( gasping )
This man isn't who you think he is, he's the Hourglass.
No no, I'm a man of peace.
Shut up!
You're plotting to kill all these people and I can prove it.
Show the world the armor you're hiding under these robes.
You can't fool me, Hourglass.
You're packing 10 lbs of Cerillium under there.
- What?
- Ahh!
Take him down.
Tutu.
Peace!
Pea--
( gong clangs )
( chants )
Shit shit shit shit shit.
You!
You're the Hourglass.
It's a pity you saw that, my dear.
Perhaps this will help you forget.
( muffled groaning )
What are you doing?
Take me.
( explosion )
Hourglass!
- Hero con?
- lt's a convention for people who like to dress up as their favorite heroes and villains.
- By the way, your costume sucks.
- Hourglass:
Out of my way!
Excuse me, there is a line.
( groans )
No, you're killing him all wrong.
- lt's like this.
- ( groans )
Better.
( groaning )
Oh, shit.
Hourglass, you'll never get away with this!
Forget it, Dragonfly.
You're too late.
- ( laughs ) - ( beeping )
- Run!
- ( screaming )
( gasps )
Yeah.
( grunting )
Goodbye... little fly.
Dragonfly!
- No!
- Ahhh!
( growls )
- ( splats ) - ( grunts )
Man:
My eye!
So, are you gonna keep the body, or... ( clanging )
Eh.
Dragonfly, you must stop the Hourglass.
( sighs ) I can't.
I can't fly.
If there is one lesson my life can teach, it is that the spirit is stronger than the body.
The hero comes from within.
Those are Celine Dion lyrics.
Whatever.
It's still true.
You're right.
It's working.
- ( groans )
- Sorry.
Watch, Dragonfly, as your city dies.
Where... am I?
You're with me, your lover.
Dragonfly!
No.
- No.
- Only now do you understand.
- ( ticking )
- Oh, come--
( grunts )
Aha!
( ticking ) I need you to jerk this off.
Yeah.
There's not enough time.
Oh fuck.
( Jill screams )
- lt's over.
- Jill:
Dragonfly!
Jill!
Gotcha.
- Rick?
- You didn't think I'd let anything happen to the girl I love, did you?
Well, we're still falling.
Damn it!
If only I could fly.
Maybe I wasn't cut out to be a hero.
You know, maybe I was meant to have a normal job-- an accountant,
- a gym teacher.
- ( screams )
- This is a really tall building.
- Rick!
I don't care what happens anymore.
If I die, I die happily in your arms.
You're my hero, Rick Riker, and I love you.
Yes!
Oh, thank God!
We only have 50 stories left.
Hang on.
Thank you, Dragonfly.
Because of you, our city is safe at last.
- You said it, Dr. Hawking.
- Shit!
It's a happy ending for us all.
- ( screams )
- Let's go get some dinner. I'm buying.
Who am I?
I'm Rick Riker.
I'm the Dragonfly.
And as long as there's crime and injustice I will forever be a superhero--
( splats )
( dramatic music playing )
( dramatic music playing ) I am the Hourglass!

Stop!
Stop the bus!
The story of my life is not for the faint of heart.
Thanks.
But, like any story worth telling, it's all about a girl.
Not that girl.
- Hey.
Hi.
- I don't think that is a girl.
No, it's about this girl...
Jill Johnson.
Ever since I can remember I've been in love with her, but she barely knows I exist.
Yo, Rick!
Yo, come here, man!
I got you a seat down here.
What's...
I'll call y'all back.
Everybody, bye.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, Trey.
Dude, I'm so psyched for this class trip.
We about to see some real serious cutting-edge shit.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yo, you got any C batteries on you?
AAs?
Got that new sandwich from Sony in my backpack.
Wi-Fi... mmm!
Yo!
You got to forget about her, dawg.
Look look.
Let me show you something.
She not even looking at you.
If I could just tell her how I feel.
Look, Rick, I already told you... you never gonna get with Jill, all right?
Seriously, she hangs out with the popular crew, and nobody messes around outside their group, man.
Come on, that crew stuff isn't real.
The hell it ain't.
Look around, Rick.
- Look, you got your jocks...
- Get the ball, man.
...nerds, emos,
Frodos, the Scarface society the sexual predators.
- Yeah.
- Of course you got the Rick punchers.
- The who?
- Oh!
- Yeah, they new.
Mm-hmm.
But you know what?
Who cares?
'Cause we got our own crew...
me and you.
Thanks, Trey.
You're the best, man.
- Am I in?
- No.
Come on.
Hey, it's me and you, baby.
The two of us against the world.
You hear me?
You look good today.
I like your hair.
I'm gonna show you something nasty I downloaded.
Don't tell nobody.
Welcome to Amalgamated.
I'm Dr. Strom, head of the research department...
- Come on, man.
...where we create the future today.
And now I'd like to show you our crown jewel.
The Amalgamated animal genetics lab.
Whoa.
Go ahead, explore.
Yo yo.
Come on, Rick.
Man, check this out.
All of our animals are genetically engineered and each of them has...
Oh, you're so pretty.
Hi, birdie.
Hi.
Hi.
- She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Yes, she is.
Uh, I'm gonna take a picture of her for the school newspaper.
Our only rules:
Don't feed the animals and please, no flash photography.
Some of our genetically- engineered animals are a little sensitive to light.
It flew away.
Uh... whoo-hoo.
What the F, loser?
Get him, Lance.
- Come on, Lance.
- Leave him alone.
- I don't think so.
Is there a problem, Lance?
No.
No problem, Uncle Lou.
Mr. Landers!
Students, this is Lou Landers, visionary scientist and C.E.O. of Amalgamated.
Well, I'm just a businessman now.
The future of science belongs to all of you.
Please, enjoy the tour.
Are you okay?
Yes, this is healthy-cough blood.
Rick Riker.
You're not Blaine and Julia Riker's son, are you?
- I am.
- Ah.
Good people.
- How are they?
- They died violently nine years ago.
But otherwise okay?
Yes, thank you.
I live with my aunt and uncle now.
Well, you seem like a real chip off the old block.
Let's hope you're not violently murdered too.
That's for making me look stupid.
Next time I hurt you.
Yeah.
You the man, Lance.
Our work with these animals has helped us develop new antibiotics, advanced pesticides and a powerful new pheromone which drives animals to mate called compound H2O0.
It's a strong sexual attractant.
A single drop is enough to arouse any animal.
We plan on using it to breed endangered species.
A special and indeed often overlooked...
Our most-promising research is with these dragonflies.
For example, this dragonfly's skin has a hard, armor-like exoskeleton to defend against...
And this species of dragonfly has enormous strength for its size.
It can lift vast amounts.
More than it's body weight.
And here we've injected the DNA from all three species into seven new genetically-enhanced super dragonflies.
But there's only six in there.
Well, one missing dragonfly is the least of my concerns.
I lost six tigers alone last month.
Ah!
This area is where we keep our livestock.
Ohh.
Aren't you going to do something?
Soon as I get this up on YouTube.
I see.
Ye... well, yes, I understand.
Thank you for the call.
That was the principal.
Rick walked off a class trip.
After all the parenting you've done, he's still so troubled.
Why do you think that is, Albert?
I have no idea, Lucille.
I have taught him everything I know about being a man.
And a good man you are after all these years of marriage.
It's like we first met.
Sure, you're a little older.
Your hair's grey.
You have crow's feet.
It takes you an hour to pee.
Your thighs look like cottage cheese someone threw up on a hot sidewalk.
And you've always had a tiny penis.
Well... what does it matter when you're in love?
Oh, Rick.
We were wondering where you were.
It's so late.
About time you got home.
Your aunt was getting worried.
You can sleep late in the morning, but don't forget to feed the fish.
Attaboy.
I don't know.
Something just doesn't seem quite right with him today.
Teenagers.
I'll talk to him.
Rough day, huh?
Well, I won't lie to you.
Puberty is a difficult time in a young man's life.
Now this book may explain what's happening.
Let's see.
There are mood swings, fluid retention, and once a month you'll bleed from your vagina.
This may be the wrong book.
What's important is that you're on the verge of adulthood.
Here...
take a drink.
Ah, the rituals of manhood.
Today you have your first beer, and tomorrow we'll circumcise you.
I'm losing patience, Dr. Strom.
Please, sir, if you could just wait a few minutes...
I've waited long enough for this egomaniac.
We're the board of directors.
Our time is valuable.
Not as valuable as mine, Mr. Carlson.
You see, I have a terminal illness.
I've been fighting it for years, but the disease has ravaged my organs.
As of this moment, I have one hour left to live.
It was on sale.
Gentlemen, if you're ready, allow me to show you the future.
Strom.
From the...
lift it ov...
lift it over!
What the hell is that?
An innovation...
thank you... that will not only save my life but the life of this company.
For too long we've scraped out profits from pills and injections.
The real prize is the total cure.
A device that can alter DNA and restore the body to perfect health.
- You're crazy.
- No.
Crazy is hearing voices, talking to cats, dating Paula Abdul.
I'm not crazy.
I'm a visionary!
Sir.
Sir, the machine's never been fully tested.
If something should go wrong...
- Start the machine!
- Yes, sir.
Plasma level is steady.
Genetic modification's at optimum levels!
Sir, the core is overheating.
- Ah!
- We have to abort!
Did it work?
I'm so sorry.
Well, well, well.
I want you to know what a joy it will be running this company without you in the way.
Let go.
Let me go.
Gentlemen, I think it's time we made some personnel changes.
No, stay away!
Oh.
How long was I asleep?
Five days.
Huh.
Wait.
Wha...
Oh, Dad.
I thought you'd live forever.
Oh.
Breakfast, Rick!
I'll be right down!
Oh!
If I can have your attention.
We are delighted to have as guest judge the foremost scientist in the world.
He's a visiting professor at Empire City University where he's working with the rare element cerillium.
I am so proud to welcome Dr. Stephen Hawking.
Thank you for that warm welcome.
I have a disease that has paralyzed me.
I cannot walk and I use this computer to speak.
But I am not depressed, because I have the gift of knowledge.
That's a lie.
I think about suicide every day.
But you should all be happy with your lives.
You can walk, talk, wipe your own asses and then there's all the sex.
I haven't had sex in years.
My nurse is a lesbian, and not the hot kind.
Hey, anyone want to get high?
- I've got some hash with me.
- No way.
White guy in the dreads, you know what I'm talking about.
Can I get a what what?
Holla.
I've got a stiff pole for your sweet hole.
Anyone?
Anyone?
Pussies.
Dr. Hawking, I am such a fan.
I'd love to show you my project on supernovas.
You have an incredible ass stromony career ahead of you.
Wait, where's Saturn?
I'd hate to lose my father's bowling ball.
There it is.
Great reflexes.
You have very manly hands.
So do you.
I'm gonna go find a spot for my project.
Yeah, okay.
Watch where you're going in slo-mo, dipshit.
- Pfft.
- Yeah.
Go to her, stupid.
Tell her how you feel.
Yow.
Any day.
Uh... he did it.
Ow!
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Get him, Lance!
- Lance, stop it.
- Kick his ass, Lance!
Fight fight fight!
- Let's see what you got.
- Fucking break him!
Whoa!
Oh!
Damn!
Ooh!
Get off!
Get... get off me!
Yah!
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
Shit shit shit shit.
# Oh no, you didn't, didn't #
- # Oh no, you didn't # - # Oh yes, we did #
# Oh no, you didn't, didn't, Oh no, you didn't #
- # Oh yeah, we did # - # Oh no, you didn't, didn't #
- # Oh no, you didn't # - # Oh yes, we did. #
Stop!
Stop!
Hey!
Get out of the way!
No brakes!
Get out of the way!
Ma'am, look out!
Are you okay?
- How did you...
- I can't believe it.
- You just saved that old lady's life.
- Amazing.
I...
I guess.
If I hadn't pushed her out of the way, she would've die... ah!
You should be really proud of yourself.
You're some kind of hero.
If you could excuse me.
There we go.
Awfully nice of you to help me out here, Trey.
Oh, no problem.
I'm waiting on Rick, anyway, so...
Ooh.
My God.
How did you do that?
Uh, it's easier than it looks.
No, I don't think so.
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
All right.
Well, there is something, okay?
But you have to keep it a secret.
I think I have...
superpowers.
I find that hard to believe.
All right, all right, how about this?
Go ahead and throw as many punches as you want.
I bet you 100 bucks you don't land one.
Easy money.
What else can you do?
I don't know.
I...
I was bitten by a dragonfly.
Well, some dragonflies have armored skin.
I wonder if my skin is...
Well, good thing that worked.
So you do have superpowers.
We could be a team!
We gonna get fame, money...
- Don't forget the bitches.
- There's not gonna be fame and there's not gonna be bitches, okay?
I didn't ask for any of this.
I just wanna be like everybody else.
That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
You're not my father.
But I love you like your father did.
I believe in you like your father did.
I had sex with your mother just like your father did.
Huh.
You'll never understand me.
Never.
That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
What a great performance.
Well, Rick, did you enjoy the opera?
Son, is something troubling you?
It's so unfair.
They have nothing.
Why do we have $2 billion?
Well, your grandfather left us $3 billion and I made some bad investments.
But that's nothing for you to worry about.
But I want to change things.
And you will.
Five generations of Rikers have worked hard to make this city great.
One day, Rick, people will look to you to be a hero.
When that day comes, will you be ready?
Give me your wallet.
That too.
People will look to you to be a hero.
When that day comes, will you be ready?
Rick!
Ah!
Ow!
Huh?
Ah!
Rick, please!
Ah!
- Dad!
- Oh, Rick, I'm dying.
- No!
- Don't worry.
My brother Albert will take you in.
Rick, the money, it's all yours now.
Sell all shares of a small company called Google.
It's worthless.
Invest heavily in Enron.
Rick, I have something for you.
Reach into my coat pocket.
The other coat pocket.
God!
That ring was my father's and his father's before him.
Earn it, Rick.
Be a hero.
Claim your...
- destiny.
Dad!
I'm no superhero.
I'm nobody!
Ah!
Shut up back there!
I'm gonna kill you!
- Are you okay?
- What, you heard that?
You're nothing but an ugly, ungrateful little whore!
Just like your mother!
- Who was that?
- My mother.
Listen, about what happened at school this morning, I...
You really freaked us out.
I'm really going through a tough time right now.
Me too.
My parents, they want me to go to college, but I want to be a dancer.
I believe in you.
You really do, don't you?
I wish I could say the same for Lance.
I don't know.
Is he the right one or am I just dating him to rebel against my father?
He doesn't want any boy near me.
That's why he installed the electrified fence.
Well, we'll see.
You can't run from your destiny.
- Right?
- Right.
- Jill, let's go!
- Nice car.
Maybe one day you could take me for a ride in your car.
Uh...
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, definitely.
Oh.
Lovebirds.
Rick, this is Professor Xavier.
Your powers are growing, but you can't control it.
It's important that you... become a hero...
train yourself to fly in your ass because squatting on a glass table two girls...
one cup...
You know what to do.
- This shouldn't take long.
- Well, I'll be waiting right here.
Hello, Mr. Bailey.
I've reviewed your request for a loan, Mr. Riker, but with no job, no credit history,
I'm afraid I have to say no.
But what about this?
That was last month.
This new promotion's proving quite popular.
Look, I need to buy a car.
Frankly, Mr. Riker, you're the worst applicant we've ever had.
Thanks for the loan, Mr. Thompson.
This is a good boy.
There must be something I could do.
Ma'am... rubbing my crotch under the desk won't change my mind.
I'm not rubbing your crotch.
I really need that car.
I don't see how that's my problem.
This is a robbery!
Nobody move!
Everybody stay down!
Stay down!
- Get down.
- Come on, Lady!
Hurry it up!
- Oh.
- Come on, move it!
Oh, hey, I made the same mistake before when I came in.
Thanks.
You idiot!
You let him get away with our money!
I don't see how that's my problem.
- Oh, man!
- Wow.
Come over here!
You've got to see this.
Let me through.
Let me through.
Oh, thank God.
I thought something terrible had happened.
Well, an old guy did get shot over there.
Uncle Albert!
Just try to breathe.
I can't.
You're kneeling on my balls.
Oh, sorry.
Rick, listen.
With great power comes...
Great responsibility?
I was gonna stick with bitches, but if you want to be a virgin for the rest of your life...
Uncle Albert!
My balls!
Very good.
Oh, God.
Mr. Landers!
Oh no.
Okay.
Hide the body.
Hide the body.
Yeah.
Get in!
Yah!
Yah!
Okay, I come back.
Jill?
I came as soon as I heard.
- Where's Aunt Lucille?
- She's at home under heavy sedation.
They made her watch three hours of women's basketball.
- This is all my fault.
- Rick, it was an armed robbery.
There was nothing you could've done.
I could've stopped that guy before he shot my uncle.
Then there is blood on your hands.
But that's not important.
All that matters is that you're here for him now.
- Rick Riker?
- Yes?
Dr. Whitby.
I've run some tests.
I'm afraid I have bad news.
What is it?
I have an impacted colon.
Whew.
What a night.
Now what brought you here today?
- My uncle.
- Your uncle brought you?
- No, he's gravely injured.
- Well, then he shouldn't be driving.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to perform a breast exam.
Doctor, please.
Is my uncle gonna survive?
Well, I don't know.
We should probably have a look.
Hard to say.
Yup, pretty deep coma.
Is he gonna be okay?
Well, I'm not a betting man, but if you want to put some money on it,
- I'll take "dead in a week."
- Oh my God!
No, it's all right.
It's a normal emotional reaction, but this should take the edge off of it.
Here we go.
Nice and easy.
- That's your vein.
- Yes, I know.
First my parents and now this?
I'm nothing but a screw-up.
Yes, your life has been a testament to that.
But your uncle believed in you and so do I.
It's never too late to become the person you're meant to be.
Rick.
Rick.
Rick.
Hello, Rick.
Who are you and how do you know my name?
- I'm a psychic.
- Prove it.
Think of any number between one and a million and I'll tell you what it is.
- Nine.
- Not out loud, dumbass!
Follow me... you dumb son of a bitch.
My name is Professor Xavier, and this is my school.
I started it to help people with special talents like yours.
Our students here learn to harness their incredible talents.
and use them to advance the common good.
Ah!
Ow.
Here we have children who can walk through walls.
We have children who think they can walk through walls.
Some faces may be familiar, like Wolverine.
Other mutants you probably didn't know existed, like Sneezo.
Most of our students are born with their powers.
Some, like you, gain them later in life.
- Oh, is that...
- Yes, it is.
When he came to this school, he weighed 130 lbs.
Take enough roids, you could do anything.
Back up off those pills, Barry!
- Why have you brought me here?
- Because you have the potential
- to be the best.
- But I can't even fly.
Once you understand the true nature of heroism, you will fly.
But first I must teach you the secret to becoming a superhero.
Hey, Storm!
You look like you putting on a little weight.
Ah!
Oh!
So, Professor, about this secret...
- Well, you see...
- Xavier!
- Aw, shit.
- Well?
You wanna explain why I found her hiding in your closet?
But, pumpkin, I don't see nobody.
- Oh, you don't?
- Ow!
Invisible Girl?
Apparently not invisible enough.
If you knew how to take care of your man, maybe this wouldn't have happened.
- No, she didn't.
- Oh, this bitch is crazy.
I'm gonna have to whip your ass.
- You don't say no disrespectful...
- What are you gonna do, baldy?
I'm everywhere, sweet cheeks.
- Whoa!
- Ow!
- That all you got?
- Yeah!
Now what?
Now how about that, Invisi-bitch?
Yeah, whatever.
I'm out of here.
I'm sure gonna miss her.
She was crazy in the sack.
Biting, scratching, panting, tongue all over the place.
Wasn't me, asshole.
Come on, Spanky.
I didn't even know she had a dog.
Still some of the best sex I ever had.
How could you do this to me?
To your kids?
To your newborn baby?
How do I know that baby's even mine?
Because he can do this.
Shit!
Ah!
Aw, man.
Now I'm never gonna know the secret to becoming a superhero.
You wanna know the secret?
Come close.
Make a costume, shithead!
I swear to God.
They get dumber and dumber every year.
A costume.
Rick, you, uh...
Oh my God.
Damn!
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!
I love the mask.
How you breathe in it though?
What's that sound?
You put some kind of air intake in the mask.
Boy, you better...
now I'm assuming that the material is see-through, right?
Yeah, dude, I'ma tell you something.
Rick, this is good.
I'm impressed.
Like really impressed.
Hey, that's my spot.
You're sitting on my gargoyle.
Move it.
- Excuse me?
- What are you even doing here?
I'm looking seriously out over the city in a squatting position.
Well, that's what I do here.
So if you're not moving,
I guess we're gonna have to share.
Uh, okay, fine.
I actually usually perch in the front.
Oh, all right.
Well, here, you've got to go around.
- Okay, wait.
- Just turn this way.
Here we go.
- Dude!
- You're right, I'm sorry.
Relax.
- Okay okay.
- Okay okay.
- Uh, I can't perch like this.
- God, me neither.
- What's your name?
- John Storm.
Dragonfly.
So what's your power?
What's my power?
Stand back.
- Flame on!
- Whoa!
Huh?
I'm on fire!
Get a blanket or something!
Holy shit!
It's not working!
Get the fire extinguisher!
Ah!
No!
Ah!
God!
You idiot, stop!
What's wrong with you?
Sorry, my bad.
Rick, once you understand the true nature of heroism, you will fly.
Shit.
This Dragonfly, he's not even a hero.
He's not...
I have...
I have...
I have just a...
I have...
He can't...
he can't even fly.
The Dragonfly can't even fly!
I can fly, okay?
I can fly.
This just in:
Tom Cruise is dead.
World's most powerful man.
I have a feeling you might disagree with that.
Strom, do you have my test results?
Yes, sir.
Whatever you're doing to your... victims, rejuvenates you.
But only for 24 hours.
Hmmm.
What if I killed 28 people in one session?
Would that give me a month to live?
If it were February, yes.
But only if your cells could absorb that much energy at once, and they can't.
I'm afraid you have to kill each day to live each day.
Still a slave to the tyranny of time.
There must be some answer.
There isn't.
Unless... unless you had some cerillium.
Then you could create a device powerful enough to draw the life-force out of thousands of people and enhance your own cellular capacity.
Strom, you're a genius.
Wikipedia.
But that's not important.
What is important is that you don't have any cerillium.
Besides, it's immoral.
We don't do that sort of thing.
We're a pharmaceutical company.
Wait a minute.
Take a look.
Hawking's lab is in the physics building.
I could just walk right in.
You're going to steal cerillium?
No, not me.
I'm a law abiding citizen.
But perhaps there's someone inside me.
Someone unfettered by the rule of law.
Someone who will, at any cost, survive!
Ow!
Oh, glass in my eye.
Glass in my eye!
- Does it hurt?
- Uh, yeah, it hurts.
Well, if you could spread...
spread them with your fingers.
Push your lids with your fingers.
- Two... two... two fingers.
- Are your fingers clean?
That's it.
And roll your eyeball around.
- And push it.
- I'm rolling it!
Dig it out with another piece of glass.
Are you fricking insane?
I'll get the tweezers.
Read about the Dragonfly, world's greatest hero.
- Right here?
- Right here, yup.
Read all about it.
No, you listen to me!
I want that story on my desk or you're fired!
Who the hell are you?
I was wondering if you've got a job opening for...
Job?
!
How dare you come in here and ask me for a job?
I'm the editor in chief!
I know the mayor of Venus!
Hamburgers can see the future!
- Rosie O'Donnell...
- Sorry about this.
We share the building with a mental hospital.
Bad news, boss.
We're nowhere on those Dragonfly photos.
Damn.
Those were tomorrow's lead.
What about these?
Wow!
it's almost like you're the Dragonfly.
Uh, no no no.
See?
Look.
Now that's photography.
Just heard on the scanner, some kind of police standoff at Empire University.
We'll need photos.
Kid, I want you to...
Where'd he go?
Come on, let's go!
This is the chief of police.
We have the building surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.
What the hell is that?
I am the Hourglass.
And your time is up.
Get him, Dragonfly.
It's over, Hourglass.
No, Dragonfly.
It's just begun!
It's useless to resist.
I'll fight you to my last breath.
Like the sands of time I am unceasing and relentless.
Evil never triumphs, Hourglass.
You'll pay for your crimes and justice will... stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Are you okay?
No.
Titanium blades.
They cut through diamonds.
I'm not wearing any diamonds.
Ooh, ow!
Ow!
I wish I could stay longer, Dragonfly.
But I just don't have the time.
Whoever this Dragonfly is, he's in over his head.
We don't need so-called superheroes.
What Empire City needs is more cops.
And a Hooters.
Titanium blades.
Looks like someone found your weakness.
It's not my weakness.
I'm sorry, I forgot.
Your weakness is you can't fly.
Maybe if you had a partner.
I don't need help.
I'm fine all by myself.
She means a lot to you, doesn't she?
What?
Oh, no.
I mean, she's with someone else.
Well, maybe that's for the best.
After all, it could be dangerous, you know, being the girlfriend of the Dragonfly.
I don't know what to do, Aunt Lucille.
- I love her.
- So be it.
But remember, to get to you your enemies will attack the people you care for the most.
Be careful not to hurt the ones you love.
And shave your pubes.
No one wants to go down on a tumbleweed.
Jill!
Rick?
I heard you were auditioning for a part so...
Oh, they're beautiful.
God, you are so supportive.
Why can't Lance be more like you?
There's something you're not telling me, isn't there?
Something secret.
Something locked away deep inside.
It was summer camp.
We had to share a shower.
You trip and fall with your mouth open on one guys...
No!
I mean, in here.
Well, there is...
Keep your identity a secret, Rick.
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!
Once a month you'll bleed from you vagina.
I... nothing.
Nothing?
Well, I should go.
You're a good friend.
Hey, check this out.
Hey, check this out.
Oh, shit.
- Let's go.
- Get her.
Oh God, it hurts.
It hurts.
Please stop!
I'm begging you!
Wait!
- Where are you?
- Behind you.
You saved my life.
Do I get to thank you?
Go.
Be a hero.
Yeah.
It looks like you're planning a mass murder.
Would you like help?
Paper clip guy.
I'm so happy that you and your boyfriend are spending Thanksgiving with us.
Of course, Lucille.
You need support at a time like this.
Yes, I miss seeing my Albert each morning.
You know, 50 years of marriage creates quite a bond.
I wish I knew love like that.
Oh, you will, dear.
You just have to follow your heart.
That's the thing.
I don't know if I can.
Oh, Jill.
If you can't trust yourself who can you trust?
I know.
But what if my heart is telling me to be with someone
I can't be with?
It's not just any guy.
It's the... forget it.
You'll think I'm crazy.
No, of course not.
You can tell me anything.
I'm very good at keeping secrets.
You'll think it's ridiculous, but... it's the Drag...
- I'll get it.
- Thank you.
Hey, babe.
Oh, I forgot to tell you I kinda invited my uncle.
- Your uncle?
- What?
Set another plate.
Well, okay.
I guess.
Miss Johnson.
Please, excuse my nephew's poor manners.
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Adams, I'm Lou Landers.
I hope this isn't too much of an imposition.
Oh, of course not.
There's always room for one more.
Thank you.
It's just Thanksgiving is for family.
Lance is the only family I have.
- I never married.
- Fruitcake?
Nope, just never met the right woman.
Ah, yes, Lance told me Rick Riker was your neighbor.
Where is Rick?
That's odd.
I thought he was out.
I'll go check on him.
Please, you're busy.
Allow me.
Thank you.
Upstairs, second door to the right.
Rick?
Hmmm.
Hmmm.
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, Mr. Landers.
Rick.
No, you're just on time.
Everybody, take your seat.
Ohhh.
Ah ah ah!
Not till we say grace.
Jesus!
Amen.
Please start, everyone.
This all looks so delicious, Lucille.
We have Rick to thank for it.
Ever since Albert...
Rick has been supporting me with his new job.
New job?
You didn't tell me.
Oh well, I'm sort of the Dragonfly's unofficial photographer.
What happened to your arm?
Uh... a bike messenger knocked me down.
I see your wrist is bandaged.
Yes, I burned it on some hot coffee.
And you have a cut on your lip.
Uh... my crackpipe broke.
You have a scratch on your neck.
Yes, I... met a girl on Craigslist.
And you have a bruise on your neck.
I... met a guy on Craigslist.
I'm sorry, Lance.
We have to go.
- Why?
- I... shat my pants.
I'll drive.
- Thanks for helping clean up.
- Of course.
Poor thing's so tired.
Yeah, well, you know old folks after a big meal.
So... you know the Dragonfly?
Uh... yeah, I guess.
You could sorta say we're close.
Has he...
has he ever asked about me?
Um, yeah.
- Yeah, once.
- What did you tell him?
Well, I said...
I told him...
I told him, "The thing about Jill is... when you look in her eyes and she looks back in yours...
- you know that you'd do anything anything to be a better person than you are.
So that...
- if you were ever lucky enough to be with her, you could earn every second of her perfect...
- grace, and her limitless beauty...
- and her unending love.
- Don't cry.
- I'm not.
My eyes are burning.
Rick, I want you to know that was the most beautiful thing anyone's ever said to me.
- Scented candle?
- Thank you.
Rick, I'm so confused, and yet...
- I know exactly what I want.
Sorry to drop in uninvited.
It's okay.
We were hoping someone would open a window.
It was getting stuffy in here.
So this is the lair of the Dragonfly.
- How did you...
- No no no,
I'm not here to fight you.
I've got thousands of other people I plan to kill.
This little visit is just to show you who'll get hurt if you get in my way.
Never!
Time to go.
The woman, Lucille Adams of East Empire City,
- was badly injured.
- How was she injured?
- Badly.
- What about the Dragonfly?
All I can tell you is this:
he didn't save anyone tonight.
Doctor, how is she?
I'm afraid your aunt's taken a turn for the worse.
She can't speak, she can't walk, she had no control over her bowels.
That's... that's awful.
I know.
I went ahead and set up a MySpace page for her under "crazy shit machine."
She already has 40 friends.
Wait a minute.
That's somebody else's aunt.
Your aunt has no problem with her bowels...
- Oh, thank God.
...because she's dead.
I'm truly sorry, Rick, but there is a silver lining.
Your uncle came out of his coma this morning.
He did?
Yes, but you mustn't tell him about your aunt just yet.
He's in a delicate mental state.
The slightest bit of bad news could send him spiraling right back into a coma.
I understand.
Mr. Adams, you have a visitor.
- Is it Lucille?
- No, sir, it's not your dead wife.
It's your nephew Rick.
Remember, no bad news.
Now, sir, here you go.
This is my bill.
- You did surgery on me?
- Yes, sir, we confused you with one of our sex-change patients, but don't worry, we didn't remove your penis.
We did cut your testicles off, but, well, since your wife's dead, you won't be needing them anyway.
You just want to keep his spirits up.
He'll land on his feet in no time.
We are gathered today to say goodbye
- to Lucille Adams.
- Goodbye!
And now the eulogy.
It's tragic to think this is the last time that I can look upon my wife's face.
God, Lucille!
How could you take her from me?
I can't live without her!
Ahhh!
Lucille!
Snookie lumps!
I'm sorry, there's been a terrible mistake.
- This is your wife.
- Ah!
She is this man's wife.
Give me five minutes.
- Uncle Albert!
- I'm not finished.
You're one lucky guy.
Now... where's Lucille?
Ah, Lucille!
I do have this coupon for a cremation.
Rick?
I am so sorry for your loss.
What is it?
I know I said some things, but now more than ever, I realize... we can never be together.
I don't believe you.
You love me, Rick.
I know you do.
Jill, trust me.
I'm telling you this for your own good.
I don't love you.
You're no longer in my five.
How could you?
# When I was young #
# I never needed anyone #
# Makin' love was just for fun #
# Those days are gone #
# All by myself #
# Don't wanna be #
# All by myself #
# Anymore #
# All by myself #
# Don't wanna be #
# All by myself. #
# Anymore #
# All by myself #
# Don't want to be #
# All by myself #
# Anymore #
# All by myself. #
You can't keep getting lucky, man.
You only beat me by two strokes this time.
And the back nine is what killed.
Oh my God!
- Look at this place.
- Yo, what are you doing, man?
You gotta pull yourself together, dude.
What's the point?
Look at you...
eating junk food, wearing fake beards, and we found your costume in the garbage outside.
Yeah, well, I'm not the Dragonfly anymore.
But you said the Hourglass was going to kill thousands of people.
I told you I'm no hero.
All right?
Aunt Lucille's dead,
I've rejected the only girl I've ever loved and I can't even fly.
I wish I'd never been bitten by that stupid dragonfly.
And maybe your father shouldn't have given you this after all.
Look at the words your ancestors inscribed in that ring.
"Honor, valor, sacrifice, duty, commitment, bravery, justice, integrity, brotherhood, self-esteem, low prices, affordable housing, loose-fitting pants, cheap internet porn."
The rest is in Latin.
Rick, the hero's path is dangerous.
You may fail or you may fly.
All that matters is that you do it for the best of reasons.
Helping others, Rick, that's what makes you a real hero.
Maybe you're right, but even if I wanted to stop the Hourglass,
I wouldn't know where to start.
I mean, where's he gonna find thousands of people in one place?
Look.
Reporting here live from the Empire City convention center where thousands of people are in one place, but none of them more important than the attendees of the World Humanity Awards.
I'll drive.
Well, that shortcut through the playground sure saved us some time.
You go ahead,
I'll find a place to park.
Mister, please stop!
Each year the World Humanity Awards are held to honor the greatest achievements on behalf of all humanity.
This gala event is expected to draw the world's most prestigious leaders to Empire City.
- Excuse us, excuse us!
- "Empire City Times."
Damn!
Look, there go Prince Charles.
And Nelson Mandela.
Nelson!
Hey, I was in jail too, man.
One of the guests here is the Hourglass.
But which one?
Thank you so much for inviting us, Mr. Landers.
Well, when you're being honored by the world, you want your family with you.
Perhaps one day, you could be part of our family too.
Ladies and gentlemen, our first award is for the medical breakthrough of the year.
For his company's pioneering work in the field of feminine hygiene
I award Lou Landers douchebag of the year.
# Douchebag #
# He's the douchebag of the year #
# Now ain't he great, folks?
#
# Ain't he grand?
The douchebag of the year. #
# Douchebag #
# He's Mr. Douchebag of the year #
# Look at him smile, look at him shine #
# He's the douchebag of, the douchebag of the year. #
Hold up the douchebag!
Hold up the douchebag, sir.
Stop right there, Landers.
Mr. Riker.
So... you know.
You're damn right I do.
Someone in this auditorium is the Hourglass.
I need your help to figure out who it is.
Now the Hourglass could be anyone... a guest of honor... maybe even a stagehand.
This may be nothing, but I did see a man with what looked like a canister of cerillium.
Who?
- This year's lifetime achievement award...
- Him.
...goes to one of the world's greatest souls,
His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.
This man isn't who you think he is, he's the Hourglass.
No no, I'm a man of peace.
Shut up!
You're plotting to kill all these people and I can prove it.
Show the world the armor you're hiding under these robes.
You can't fool me, Hourglass.
You're packing 10 lbs of Cerillium under there.
- What?
- Ahh!
Take him down.
Tutu.
Peace!
Pea...
Shit shit shit shit shit.
You!
You're the Hourglass.
It's a pity you saw that, my dear.
Perhaps this will help you forget.
What are you doing?
Take me.
Hourglass!
- Hero con?
- It's a convention for people who like to dress up as their favorite heroes and villains.
- By the way, your costume sucks.
- Out of my way!
Excuse me, there is a line.
No, you're killing him all wrong.
It's like this.
Better.
Oh, shit.
Hourglass, you'll never get away with this!
Forget it, Dragonfly.
You're too late.
Run!
Yeah.
Goodbye... little fly.
Dragonfly!
- No!
- Ahhh!
My eye!
So, are you gonna keep the body, or...
Eh.
Dragonfly, you must stop the Hourglass.
I can't.
I can't fly.
If there is one lesson my life can teach, it is that the spirit is stronger than the body.
The hero comes from within.
Those are Celine Dion lyrics.
Whatever.
It's still true.
You're right.
It's working.
Sorry.
Watch, Dragonfly, as your city dies.
Where... am I?
You're with me, your lover.
Dragonfly!
No.
- No.
- Only now do you understand.
Oh, come...
Aha!
I need you to jerk this off.
Yeah.
There's not enough time.
Oh fuck.
- It's over.
- Dragonfly!
Jill!
Gotcha.
- Rick?
- You didn't think I'd let anything happen to the girl I love, did you?
Well, we're still falling.
Damn it!
If only I could fly.
Maybe I wasn't cut out to be a hero.
You know, maybe I was meant to have a normal job... an accountant, a gym teacher.
- This is a really tall building.
- Rick!
I don't care what happens anymore.
If I die, I die happily in your arms.
You're my hero, Rick Riker, and I love you.
Yes!
Oh, thank God!
We only have 50 stories left.
Hang on.
Thank you, Dragonfly.
Because of you, our city is safe at last.
- You said it, Dr. Hawking.
- Shit!
It's a happy ending for us all.
Let's go get some dinner.
I'm buying.
Who am I?
I'm Rick Riker.
I'm the Dragonfly.
And as long as there's crime and injustice
I will forever be a superhero...
Who am I?
You sure you want to know?
Truth is, I'm a nobody.
Actually, I'm worse than a nobody.
I'm this guy.
Stop!
Stop the bus!
The story of my life is not for the faint of heart.
Thanks.
But, like any story worth telling, it's all about a girl.
Not that girl.
- Hey.
Hi.
- I don't think that is a girl.
No, it's about this girl...
Jill Johnson.
Ever since I can remember I've been in love with her, but she barely knows I exist.
Yo, Rick!
Yo, come here, man!
I got you a seat down here.
What's...
I'll call y'all back.
Everybody, bye.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, Trey.
Dude, I'm so psyched for this class trip.
We about to see some real serious cutting-edge shit.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yo, you got any C batteries on you?
AAs?
Got that new sandwich from Sony in my backpack.
Wi-Fi... mmm!
Yo!
You got to forget about her, dawg.
Look look.
Let me show you something.
She not even looking at you.
If I could just tell her how I feel.
Look, Rick, I already told you... you never gonna get with Jill, all right?
Seriously, she hangs out with the popular crew, and nobody messes around outside their group, man.
Come on, that crew stuff isn't real.
The hell it ain't.
Look around, Rick.
- Look, you got your jocks...
- Get the ball, man.
...nerds, emos,
Frodos, the Scarface society the sexual predators.
- Yeah.
- Of course you got the Rick punchers.
- The who?
- Oh!
- Yeah, they new.
But you know what?
Who cares?
'Cause we got our own crew...
me and you.
Thanks, Trey.
You're the best, man.
- Am I in?
- No.
Come on.
Hey, it's me and you, baby.
The two of us against the world.
You hear me?
You look good today.
I like your hair.
I'm gonna show you something nasty I downloaded.
Don't tell nobody.
Welcome to Amalgamated.
I'm Dr. Strom, head of the research department...
- Come on, man.
- ... where we create the future today.
And now I'd like to show you our crown jewel.
The Amalgamated animal genetics lab.
Go ahead, explore.
Yo yo.
Come on, Rick.
Man, check this out.
All of our animals are genetically engineered and each of them has...
Oh, you're so pretty.
Hi, birdie.
Hi.
Hi.
- She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Yes, she is.
Uh, I'm gonna take a picture of her for the school newspaper.
Our only rules:
Don't feed the animals and please, no flash photography.
Some of our genetically- engineered animals are a little sensitive to light.
It flew away.
Uh... whoo-hoo.
What the F, loser?
- Get him, Lance.
- Come on, Lance.
- Leave him alone.
- I don't think so.
Is there a problem, Lance?
No.
No problem, Uncle Lou.
Mr. Landers!
Students, this is Lou Landers, visionary scientist and C.E.O. of Amalgamated.
Well, I'm just a businessman now.
The future of science belongs to all of you.
Please, enjoy the tour.
Are you okay?
Yes, this is healthy-cough blood.
Rick Riker.
You're not Blaine and Julia Riker's son, are you?
- I am.
- Ah.
Good people.
- How are they?
- They died violently nine years ago.
But otherwise okay?
Yes, thank you.
I live with my aunt and uncle now.
Well, you seem like a real chip off the old block.
Let's hope you're not violently murdered too.
That's for making me look stupid.
Next time I hurt you.
Yeah.
You the man, Lance.
Our work with these animals has helped us develop new antibiotics, advanced pesticides and a powerful new pheromone which drives animals to mate called compound H2O9.
It's a strong sexual attractant.
A single drop is enough to arouse any animal.
We plan on using it to breed endangered species.
A special and indeed often overlooked...
Our most-promising research is with these dragonflies.
For example, this dragonfly's skin has a hard, armor-like exoskeleton to defend against...
And this species of dragonfly has enormous strength for its size.
It can lift vast amounts.
More than it's body weight.
And here we've injected the DNA from all three species into seven new genetically-enhanced super dragonflies.
But there's only six in there.
Well, one missing dragonfly is the least of my concerns.
I lost six tigers alone last month.
This area is where we keep our livestock.
Aren't you going to do something?
Soon as I get this up on YouTube.
I see.
Ye... well, yes, I understand.
Thank you for the call.
That was the principal.
Rick walked off a class trip.
After all the parenting you've done, he's still so troubled.
Why do you think that is, Albert?
I have no idea, Lucille.
I have taught him everything I know about being a man.
And a good man you are after all these years of marriage.
It's like we first met.
Sure, you're a little older.
Your hair's grey.
You have crow's feet.
It takes you an hour to pee.
Your thighs look like cottage cheese someone threw up on a hot sidewalk.
And you've always had a tiny penis.
Well... what does it matter when you're in love?
Oh, Rick.
We were wondering where you were.
It's so late.
About time you got home.
Your aunt was getting worried.
You can sleep late in the morning, but don't forget to feed the fish.
Attaboy.
I don't know.
Something just doesn't seem quite right with him today.
Teenagers.
I'll talk to him.
Rough day, huh?
Well, I won't lie to you.
Puberty is a difficult time in a young man's life.
Now this book may explain what's happening.
Let's see.
There are mood swings, fluid retention, and once a month you'll bleed from your vagina.
This may be the wrong book.
What's important is that you're on the verge of adulthood.
Here... take a drink.
Ah, the rituals of manhood.
Today you have your first beer, and tomorrow we'll circumcise you.
I'm losing patience, Dr. Strom.
Please, sir, if you could just wait a few minutes...
I've waited long enough for this egomaniac.
Not as valuable as mine, Mr. Carlson.
You see, I have a terminal illness.
I've been fighting it for years, but the disease has ravaged my organs.
As of this moment, I have one hour left to live.
It was on sale.
Gentlemen, if you're ready, allow me to show you the future.
What the hell is that?
An innovation...
thank you... that will not only save my life but the life of this company.
For too long we've scraped out profits from pills and injections.
The real prize is the total cure.
A device that can alter DNA and restore the body to perfect health.
- You're crazy.
- No.
Crazy is hearing voices, talking to cats, dating Paula Abdul.
I'm not crazy.
I'm a visionary!
Sir.
Sir, the machine's never been fully tested.
If something should go wrong...
- Start the machine!
- Yes, sir.
Plasma level is steady.
Genetic modification's at optimum levels!
Sir, the core is overheating.
We have to abort!
Did it work?
I'm so sorry.
Well, well, well.
I want you to know what a joy it will be running this company without you in the way.
Let go.
Let me go.
Gentlemen, I think it's time we made some personnel changes.
No, get away!
Oh.
How long was I asleep?
Five days.
Wait.
Wha...
Oh, Dad.
I thought you'd live forever.
Breakfast, Rick!
I'll be right down!
If I can have your attention.
We are delighted to have as guest judge the foremost scientist in the world.
He's a visiting professor at Empire City University where he's working with the rare element cerillium.
I am so proud to welcome Dr. Stephen Hawking.
Thank you for that warm welcome.
I have a disease that has paralyzed me.
I cannot walk and I use this computer to speak.
But I am not depressed, because I have the gift of knowledge.
That's a lie.
I think about suicide every day.
But you should all be happy with your lives.
You can walk, talk, wipe your own asses and then there's all the sex.
I haven't had sex in years.
My nurse is a lesbian, and not the hot kind.
Hey, anyone want to get high?
I've got some hash with me.
White guy in the dreads, you know what I'm talking about.
Anyone?
Anyone?
Pussies!
Watch where you're going in slo-mo, dipshit.
- Pfft.
- Yeah.
Go to her, stupid.
Tell her how you feel.
Yow.
Uh... he did it.
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Get him, Lance!
- Lance, stop it.
- Kick his ass, Lance!
Fight fight fight!
Damn!
Get... get off me!
Ow ow.
Shit shit shit shit.
Stop!
Stop!
Hey!
Get out of the way!
No brakes!
Get out of the way!
Ma'am, look out!
- How did you...
- I can't believe it.
- You just saved that old lady's life.
- Amazing.
I...
I guess.
If I hadn't pushed her out of the way, she would've die... ah!
You should be really proud of yourself.
You're some kind of hero.
If you could excuse me.
There we go.
Awfully nice of you to help me out here, Trey.
Oh, no problem.
I'm waiting on Rick, anyway, so...
My God.
How did you do that?
Uh, it's easier than it looks.
No, I don't think so.
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
All right.
Well, there is something, okay?
But you have to keep it a secret.
I think I have...
superpowers.
I find that hard to believe.
All right, all right, how about this?
Go ahead and throw as many punches as you want.
I bet you 100 bucks you don't land one.
Easy money.
What else can you do?
I don't know.
I...
I was bitten by a dragonfly.
Well, some dragonflies have armored skin.
I wonder if my skin is...
Well, good thing that worked.
So you do have superpowers.
We could be a team!
We gonna get fame, money...
- Don't forget the bitches.
- There's not gonna be fame and there's not gonna be bitches, okay?
I didn't ask for any of this.
I just wanna be like everybody else.
That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
You're not my father.
But I love you like your father did.
I believe in you like your father did.
I had sex with your mother just like your father did.
Huh.
You'll never understand me.
Never.
That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
What a great performance.
Well, Rick, did you enjoy the opera?
Son, is something troubling you?
It's so unfair.
They have nothing.
I want to change things.
And you will.
One day, Rick, people will look to you to be a hero.
When that day comes, will you be ready?
Give me your wallet.
That too.
Blaine's voice:
People will look to you to be a hero.
When that day comes, will you be ready?
Rick!
Rick, please!
- Dad!
- Oh, Rick, I'm dying.
- No!
- Don't worry.
My brother Albert will take you in.
Rick, the money, it's all yours now.
Sell all shares of a small company called Google.
It's worthless.
Invest heavily in Enron.
Rick, I have something for you.
Reach into my coat pocket.
The other coat pocket.
God!
That ring was my father's and his father's before him.
Earn it, Rick.
Be a hero.
Claim your... destiny.
Dad!
I'm no superhero.
I'm nobody!
- Are you okay?
- What, you heard that?
You're nothing but an ugly, ungrateful little whore!
Just like your mother!
- Who was that?
- My mother.
Listen, about what happened at school this morning, I...
You really freaked us out.
I'm really going through a tough time right now.
Me too.
My parents, they want me to go to college, but I want to be a dancer.
I believe in you.
You really do, don't you?
I wish I could say the same for Lance.
I don't know.
Is he the right one or am I just dating him to rebel against my father?
He doesn't want any boy near me.
That's why he installed the electrified fence.
Well, we'll see.
You can't run from your destiny.
- Right?
- Right.
- Jill, let's go!
- Nice car.
Maybe one day you could take me for a ride in your car.
Uh...
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, definitely.
Oh.
Lovebirds.
Rick, this is Professor Xavier.
Your powers are growing, but you can't control it.
It's important that you... become a hero...
train yourself to fly in your ass because squatting on a glass table two girls...
one cup...
You know what to do.
- This shouldn't take long.
- Well, I'll be waiting right here.
I've reviewed your request for a loan, Mr. Riker, but with no job, no credit history,
I'm afraid I have to say no.
But what about this?
That was last month.
This new promotion's proving quite popular.
Look, I need to buy a car.
Frankly, Mr. Riker, you're the worst applicant we've ever had.
Thanks for the loan, Mr. Thompson.
This is a good boy.
There must be something I could do.
Ma'am... rubbing my crotch under the desk won't change my mind.
I'm not rubbing your crotch.
I really need that car.
I don't see how that's my problem.
This is a robbery!
Nobody move!
Everybody stay down!
Stay down!
- Get down.
- Come on, Lady!
Hurry it up!
- Oh.
- Come on, move it!
Oh, hey, I made the same mistake before when I came in.
Thanks.
You idiot!
You let him get away with our money!
I don't see how that's my problem.
Let me through.
Let me through.
Oh, thank God.
I thought something terrible had happened.
Well, an old guy did get shot over there.
Uncle Albert!
Just try to breathe.
I can't.
You're kneeling on my balls.
Oh, sorry.
Rick, listen.
With great power comes...
Great responsibility?
I was gonna stick with bitches, but if you want to be a virgin for the rest of your life...
Uncle Albert!
My balls!
Oh, God.
Mr. Landers!
Oh no.
Okay.
Hide the body.
Yeah.
Get in!
Yah!
Yah!
Okay, I come back.
Jill?
I came as soon as I heard.
- This is all my fault.
- Rick, it was an armed robbery.
There was nothing you could've done.
I could've stopped that guy before he shot my uncle.
- Rick Riker?
- Yes?
Dr. Whitby.
What brought you here today?
- My uncle.
- Your uncle brought you?
- No, he's gravely injured.
- Well, then he shouldn't be driving.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to perform a breast exam.
Doctor, please.
Is my uncle gonna survive?
Well, I'm not a betting man, but if you want to put some money on it,
- I'll take "dead in a week."
- Oh my God!
No, it's all right.
It's a normal emotional reaction, but this should take the edge off of it.
Here we go.
Nice and easy.
- That's your vein.
- Yes, I know.
First my parents and now this?
I'm nothing but a screw-up.
Yes, your life has been a testament to that.
But your uncle believed in you and so do I.
It's never too late to become the person you're meant to be.
Rick.
Rick.
Hello, Rick.
Who are you and how do you know my name?
- I'm a psychic.
- Prove it.
Think of any number between one and a million and I'll tell you what it is.
- Nine.
- Not out loud, dumbass!
Follow me...
My name is Professor Xavier, and this is my school.
I started it to help people with special talents like yours.
Our students here learn to harness their incredible talents.
and use them to advance the common good.
Here we have children who can walk through walls.
We have children who think they can walk through walls.
Some faces may be familiar, like Wolverine.
Other mutants you probably didn't know existed, like Sneezo.
Most of our students are born with their powers.
Some, like you, gain them later in life.
- Oh, is that...
- Yes, it is.
When he came to this school, he weighed 130 Ibs.
Take enough roids, you could do anything.
Back up off those pills, Barry!
- Why have you brought me here?
- Because you have the potential
- to be the best.
- But I can't even fly.
Once you understand the true nature of heroism, you will fly.
But first I must teach you the secret to becoming a superhero.
Hey, Storm!
You look like you putting on a little weight.
So, Professor, about this secret...
- Well, you see...
- Xavier!
- Aw, shit.
- Well?
You wanna explain why I found her hiding in your closet?
But, pumpkin, I don't see nobody.
- Oh, you don't?
- Ow!
Invisible Girl?
Apparently not invisible enough.
If you knew how to take care of your man, maybe this wouldn't have happened.
- No, she didn't.
- Oh, this bitch is crazy.
I'm gonna have to whip your ass.
- You don't say no disrespectful...
- What are you gonna do, baldy?
I'm everywhere, sweet cheeks.
- That all you got?
- Yeah!
Now what?
Now how about that, Invisi-bitch?
Yeah, whatever.
I'm out of here.
How could you do this to me?
To your kids?
To your newborn baby?
How do I know that baby's even mine?
Because he can do this.
Shit!
Aw, man.
Now I'm never gonna know the secret to becoming a superhero.
You wanna know the secret?
Come close.
Make a costume, shithead!
I swear to God.
They get dumber and dumber every year.
A costume.
Rick, you, uh...
Oh my God.
Damn!
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!
I love the mask.
How you breathe in it though?
What's that sound?
You put some kind of air intake in the mask.
Boy, you better...
now I'm assuming that the material is see-through, right?
Yeah, dude, I'ma tell you something.
Rick, this is good.
I'm impressed.
Like really impressed.
Hey, that's my spot.
You're sitting on my gargoyle.
Move it.
- Excuse me?
- What are you even doing here?
I'm looking seriously out over the city
Well, that's what I do here.
So if you're not moving,
I guess we're gonna have to share.
Uh, okay, fine.
- Uh, I can't perch like this.
- God, me neither.
- What's your name?
- John Storm.
Dragonfly.
So what's your power?
What's my power?
Stand back.
- Flame on!
- Whoa!
Huh?
I'm on fire!
Get a blanket or something!
Holy shit!
It's not working!
Get the fire extinguisher!
Ah!
No!
Ah!
God!
You idiot, stop!
What's wrong with you?
Sorry, my bad.
Rick, once you understand the true nature of heroism, you will fly.
Shit.
This Dragonfly, he's not even a hero.
He's not...
I have...
I have...
I have just a...
I have...
He can't...
he can't even fly.
The Dragonfly can't even fly!
I can fly, okay?
I can fly.
This just in:
Tom Cruise is dead.
Strom, do you have my test results?
I'm afraid you have to kill each day to live each day.
unless you had some cerillium.
Take a look.
Hawking's lab is in the physics building.
I could just walk right in.
You're going to steal cerillium?
No, not me.
But perhaps there's someone inside me.
Someone who will, at any cost, survive!
Oh, glass in my eye.
Glass in my eye!
- Does it hurt?
- Uh, yeah, it hurts.
Well, if you could spread...
spread them with your fingers.
Push your lids with your fingers.
- Two... two... two fingers.
- Are your fingers clean?
That's it.
And roll your eyeball around.
- And push it.
- I'm rolling it!
Dig it out with another piece of glass.
Are you fricking insane?
I'll get the tweezers.
Read about the Dragonfly, world's greatest hero.
- Right here?
- Right here, yup.
Read all about it.
No, you listen to me!
I want that story on my desk or you're fired!
Who the hell are you?
I was wondering if you've got a job opening for...
Job?
!
How dare you come in here and ask me for a job?
I'm the editor in chief!
I know the mayor of Venus!
Hamburgers can see the future!
- Rosie O'Donnell...
- Sorry about this.
We share the building with a mental hospital.
Bad news, boss.
We're nowhere on those Dragonfly photos.
Damn.
Those were tomorrow's lead.
What about these?
Wow!
it's almost like you're the Dragonfly.
Uh, no no no.
See?
Look.
Now that's photography.
Just heard on the scanner, some kind of police standoff at Empire University.
We'll need photos.
Kid, I want you to...
Where'd he go?
Come on, let's go!
This is the chief of police.
We have the building surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.
What the hell is that?
I am the Hourglass.
And your time is up.
It's useless to resist.
I'll fight you to my last breath.
Like the sands of time I am unceasing and relentless.
Evil never triumphs, Hourglass.
You'll pay for your crimes and justice will be... stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Are you okay?
No.
Titanium blades.
They cut through diamonds.
I'm not wearing any diamonds.
I wish I could stay longer, Dragonfly.
But I just don't have the time.
Titanium blades.
Looks like someone found your weakness.
It's not my weakness.
I'm sorry, I forgot.
Your weakness is you can't fly.
Maybe if you had a partner.
I don't need help.
I'm fine all by myself.
She means a lot to you, doesn't she?
What?
Oh, no.
I mean, she's with someone else.
Well, maybe that's for the best.
After all, it could be dangerous, you know, being the girlfriend of the Dragonfly.
I don't know what to do, Aunt Lucille.
- I love her.
- So be it.
But remember, to get to you your enemies will attack the people you care for the most.
Be careful not to hurt the ones you love.
Whoever this Dragonfly is, he's in over his head.
We don't need so-called superheroes.
What Empire City needs is more cops.
And a Hooters.
Jill!
Rick?
I heard you were auditioning for a part so...
Oh, they're beautiful.
God, you are so supportive.
Why can't Lance be more like you?
There's something you're not telling me, isn't there?
Something secret.
Something locked away deep inside.
Well, there is...
Lucille's voice:
Keep your identity a secret, Rick.
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!
Once a month you'll bleed from you vagina.
I... nothing.
Nothing?
Well, I should go.
You're a good friend.
Hey, check this out.
Oh, shit.
- Let's go.
- Get her.
Oh God, it hurts.
It hurts.
Please stop!
I'm begging you!
Wait!
- Where are you?
- Behind you.
You saved my life.
Do I get to thank you?
Go.
Be a hero.
It looks like you're planning a mass murder.
Would you like help?
I'm so happy that you and your boyfriend are spending Thanksgiving with us.
Of course, Lucille.
You need support at a time like this.
Yes, I miss seeing my Albert each morning.
You know, 50 years of marriage creates quite a bond.
I wish I knew love like that.
Oh, you will, dear.
You just have to follow your heart.
That's the thing.
I don't know if I can.
Oh, Jill.
If you can't trust yourself who can you trust?
I know.
But what if my heart is telling me to be with someone
I can't be with?
It's not just any guy.
It's the... forget it.
You'll think I'm crazy.
No, of course not.
You can tell me anything.
I'm very good at keeping secrets.
You'll think it's ridiculous, but... it's the Drag...
- I'll get it.
- Thank you.
Hey, babe.
Oh, I forgot to tell you I kinda invited my uncle.
- Your uncle?
- What?
Set another plate.
Well, okay.
I guess.
Miss Johnson.
Please, excuse my nephew's poor manners.
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Adams, I'm Lou Landers.
I hope this isn't too much of an imposition.
Oh, of course not.
There's always room for one more.
Thank you.
It's just Thanksgiving is for family.
Lance is the only family I have.
- I never married.
- Fruitcake?
Nope, just never met the right woman.
Ah, yes, Lance told me Rick Riker was your neighbor.
Where is Rick?
That's odd.
I thought he was out.
I'll go check on him.
Please, you're busy.
Allow me.
Thank you.
Upstairs, second door to the right.
Rick?
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, Mr. Landers.
Rick.
No, you're just on time.
Everybody, take your seat.
Not till we say grace.
Jesus!
Amen.
Please start, everyone.
This all looks so delicious, Lucille.
We have Rick to thank for it.
Ever since Albert...
Rick has been supporting me with his new job.
New job?
You didn't tell me.
Oh well, I'm sort of the Dragonfly's unofficial photographer.
What happened to your arm?
Uh... a bike messenger knocked me down.
I see your wrist is bandaged.
Yes, I burned it on some hot coffee.
And you have a cut on your lip.
Uh... my crackpipe broke.
You have a scratch on your neck.
Yes, I... met a girl on Craigslist.
And you have a bruise on your neck.
I... met a guy on Craigslist.
I'm sorry, Lance.
We have to go.
- Why?
- I... shat my pants.
I'll drive.
- Thanks for helping clean up.
- Of course.
Poor thing's so tired.
Yeah, well, you know old folks after a big meal.
So... you know the Dragonfly?
Uh... yeah, I guess.
You could sorta say we're close.
Has he...
has he ever asked about me?
Um, yeah.
- Yeah, once.
- What did you tell him?
Well, I said...
I told him...
I told him, "The thing about Jill is... when you look in her eyes and she looks back in yours... you know that you'd do anything anything to be a better person than you are.
So that... if you were ever lucky enough to be with her, you could earn every second of her perfect... grace, and her limitless beauty... and her unending love.
- Don't cry.
- I'm not.
My eyes are burning.
Rick, I want you to know that was the most beautiful thing anyone's ever said to me.
- Scented candle?
- Thank you.
Rick, I'm so confused, and yet...
I know exactly what I want.
Sorry to drop in uninvited.
It's okay.
We were hoping someone would open a window.
It was getting stuffy in here.
So this is the lair of the Dragonfly.
- How did you...
- No no no,
I'm not here to fight you.
I've got... thousands of other people I plan to kill.
This little visit is just to show you who'll get hurt if you get in my way.
Never!
Time to go.
The woman, Lucille Adams of East Empire City,
- was badly injured.
- How was she injured?
- Badly.
- What about the Dragonfly?
All I can tell you is this:
he didn't save anyone tonight.
Doctor, how is she?
I'm afraid your aunt's taken a turn for the worse.
She can't speak, she can't walk, she had no control over her bowels.
That's... that's awful.
I know.
I went ahead and set up a MySpace page for her under "crazy shit machine."
She already has 40 friends.
Wait a minute.
That's somebody else's aunt.
Your aunt has no problem with her bowels...
- Oh, thank God.
- ...because she's dead.
I'm truly sorry, Rick, but there is a silver lining.
Your uncle came out of his coma this morning.
He did?
Yes, but you mustn't tell him about your aunt just yet.
He's in a delicate mental state.
The slightest bit of bad news could send him spiraling right back into a coma.
I understand.
Mr. Adams, you have a visitor.
- Is it Lucille?
- No, sir, it's not your dead wife.
It's your nephew Rick.
Remember, no bad news.
Now, sir, here you go.
This is my bill.
- You did surgery on me?
- Yes, sir, we confused you with one of our sex-change patients, but don't worry, we didn't remove your penis.
We did cut your testicles off, but, well, since your wife's dead, you won't be needing them anyway.
You just want to keep his spirits up.
He'll land on his feet in no time.
We are gathered today to say goodbye
- to Lucille Adams.
- Goodbye!
And now the eulogy.
It's tragic to think this is the last time that I can look upon my wife's face.
God, Lucille!
How could you take her from me?
I can't live without her!
Lucille!
Snookie lumps!
I'm sorry, there's been a terrible mistake.
This is your wife.
She is this man's wife.
Give me five minutes.
- Uncle Albert!
- I'm not finished.
You're one lucky guy.
Now... where's Lucille?
Ah, Lucille!
I do have this coupon for a cremation.
Rick?
I am so sorry for your loss.
What is it?
I know I said some things, but now more than ever, I realize... we can never be together.
I don't believe you.
You love me, Rick.
I know you do.
Jill, trust me.
I'm telling you this for your own good.
I don't love you.
You're no longer in my five.
How could you?
# When I was young #
# I never needed anyone #
# Makin' love was just for fun #
# Those days are gone #
# All by myself #
# Don't wanna be #
# All by myself #
# Anymore #
# All by myself #
# Don't wanna be #
# All by myself. #
You can't keep getting lucky, man.
You only beat me by two strokes this time.
And the back nine is what killed.
Oh my God!
- Look at this place.
- Yo, what are you doing, man?
You gotta pull yourself together, dude.
What's the point?
Look at you...
eating junk food, wearing fake beards, and we found your costume in the garbage outside.
Yeah, well, I'm not the Dragonfly anymore.
But you said the Hourglass was going to kill thousands of people.
I told you I'm no hero.
All right?
Aunt Lucille's dead,
I've rejected the only girl I've ever loved and I can't even fly.
I wish I'd never been bitten by that stupid dragonfly.
And maybe your father shouldn't have given you this after all.
Look at the words your ancestors inscribed in that ring.
"Honor, valor, sacrifice, duty, commitment, bravery, justice, integrity, brotherhood, self-esteem, low prices, affordable housing, loose-fitting pants, cheap internet porn."
The rest is in Latin.
Rick, the hero's path is dangerous.
You may fail or you may fly.
All that matters is that you do it for the best of reasons.
Helping others, Rick, that's what makes you a real hero.
Maybe you're right, but even if I wanted to stop the Hourglass,
I wouldn't know where to start.
I mean, where's he gonna find thousands of people in one place?
Look.
Reporting here live from the Empire City convention center where thousands of people are in one place, but none of them more important than the attendees of the World Humanity Awards.
I'll drive.
Well, that shortcut through the playground... sure saved us some time.
You go ahead,
I'll find a place to park.
Mister, please stop!
Each year the World Humanity Awards are held to honor the greatest achievements on behalf of all humanity.
This gala event is expected to draw the world's most prestigious leaders to Empire City.
- Excuse us, excuse us!
- "Empire City Times."
Damn!
Look, there go Prince Charles.
And Nelson Mandela.
Nelson!
Hey, I was in jail too, man.
One of the guests here is the Hourglass.
But which one?
Thank you so much for inviting us, Mr. Landers.
Well, when you're being honored by the world, you want your family with you.
Perhaps one day, you could be part of our family too.
Ladies and gentlemen, our first award is for the medical breakthrough of the year.
For his company's pioneering work in the field of feminine hygiene
I award Lou Landers douchebag of the year.
# Douchebag #
# He's the douchebag of the year #
# Now ain't he great, folks?
#
# Ain't he grand?
The douchebag of the year. #
# Douchebag #
# He's Mr. Douchebag of the year #
# Look at him smile, look at him shine #
# He's the douchebag of, the douchebag of the year. #
Hold up the douchebag!
Hold up the douchebag, sir.
Stop right there, Landers.
Mr. Riker.
So... you know.
You're damn right I do.
Someone in this auditorium is the Hourglass.
I need your help to figure out who it is.
Now the Hourglass could be anyone... a guest of honor... maybe even a stagehand.
This may be nothing, but I did see a man with what looked like a canister of cerillium.
Who?
This year's lifetime achievement award...
Him.
...goes to one of the world's greatest souls,
His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.
This man isn't who you think he is, he's the Hourglass.
No no, I'm a man of peace.
Shut up!
You're plotting to kill all these people and I can prove it.
Show the world the armor you're hiding under these robes.
You can't fool me, Hourglass.
You're packing 10 Ibs of Cerillium under there.
What?
Take him down.
Tutu.
Peace!
Pea...
Shit shit shit shit shit.
You!
You're the Hourglass.
Hourglass!
- Hero con?
- It's a convention for people who like to dress up as their favorite heroes and villains.
- By the way, your costume sucks.
- Out of my way!
Hourglass, you'll never get away with this!
Forget it, Dragonfly.
You're too late.
Run!
Yeah.
Goodbye... little fly.
Dragonfly!
No!
My eye!
Dragonfly, you must stop the Hourglass.
I can't.
I can't fly.
If there is one lesson my life can teach, it is that the spirit is stronger than the body.
The hero comes from within.
Those are Celine Dion lyrics.
Whatever.
It's still true.
You're right.
It's working.
Sorry.
Watch, Dragonfly, as your city dies.
Where... am I?
You're with me, your lover.
Dragonfly!
No.
- No.
- Only now do you understand.
Oh, come...
Aha!
I need you to yank this off.
Yeah.
There's not enough time.
Oh fuck.
- It's over.
- Dragonfly!
Jill!
Gotcha.
Rick?
You didn't think I'd let anything happen to the girl I love, did you?
Well, we're still falling.
Damn it!
If only I could fly.
Maybe I wasn't cut out to be a hero.
You know, maybe I was meant to have a normal job... an accountant, a gym teacher.
- This is a really tall building.
- Rick!
I don't care what happens anymore.
If I die, I die happily in your arms.
You're my hero, Rick Riker, and I love you.
Yes!
Oh, thank God!
We only have 50 stories left.
Hang on.
Thank you, Dragonfly.
Because of you, our city is safe at last.
- You said it, Dr. Hawking.
- Shit!
It's a happy ending for us all.
Let's go get some dinner.
I'm buying.
Who am I?
I'm Rick Riker.
I'm the Dragonfly.
And as long as there's crime and injustice
I will forever be a superhero...
I am the Hourglass!

Who am I?
Do you know this?
Actually I am a nobody.
I'm even worse than a nobody.
I am this guy.
Stop the bus.
My life is not for straight.
Thank you.
But, well worth the telling, because it is a girl.
Not that girl.
I do not think that a girl.
No, it is about this girl.
Jill Johnson.
As long as I can remember, I'm already in love with her.
But they barely know that I exist.
-
- Rick, come here, dude.
I have a rather clear.
I'll call you back.
Okay, day.
What's up, dude?
-
- Hello Trey.
I'm so excited for this school, advanced things we are going to see.
I think that is only good.
Do you have C batteries with you?
AA?
I have this new sandwich Sony in my backpack, it's a Wi-Fi.
You have forgotten her, dude.
Look, I will show you something.
She even looks to you.
If I could tell her but what I feel for her.
I've already told you, it never gets what about Jill.
She draws on the popular gang and there is no outsider.
Come on, that bendegedoe is not real.
That you think.
Look around you, Rick.
Look, there you have the Jacks, the Nerds, the Immos, the Frodos, the Scarfacegezelschap, sexual predators ... and even Rick-meppers.
-
- The who?
Yes, those are new.
But what does it matter?
Because we have our own gang, me and you.
Thanks Trey, you're the best.
-
- Am I there?
No.
-
- Come now.
You and me, baby.
We two against the rest, okay.
You look good today.
It is her good.
I ga you something disgusting show I have downloaded.
Not more telling.
Welcome to Amalgamated.
I'm Dr. Strom,
Head of the Department of Research, where we create the future, today.
And now let me show you our crown jewel.
The Amalgamated laboratory of the dierengenetica.
Ga assured exploration.
All the animals were genetically manufactured and each animal has its unique characteristics.
What are you beautiful.
Hello, birdie.
Hello.
She is beautiful, do not you think?
-
- Yes, that she is sure.
I will make a photograph of her for the schooljournaal.
Our only rules: the animals do not enter and make no pictures with flash.
Most of our animals are hypersensitive to light.
They flew away.
What was that, pummel.
-
- Pak him, Lance.
Come now, Lance, let him alone.
-
- That you thought.
Is there a problem, Lance?
No, no problem, Uncle Lou.
Mr. Landers.
Students, this is Lou Landers, visionary scientist ... and CEO of Amalgamated.
Well, I'm simply a businessman now.
The future of science belongs to you all.
Enjoy the tour.
What's up with you?
-
- Yes, this is healthy hoestbloed.
Rick Riker.
Are you not coincidentally the son of Blaine and Julia Riker?
Yes, that's right.
Good people, what's new with them?
She died nine years ago.
-
- But for the rest everything okay?
Yes, thank you.
Now I live with my aunt and uncle.
You seem from the same stuff if your uncle.
Let us hope that ultimately you even murdered.
That's because you've put me laughing.
The next time I'm your pain.
Our work with these animals helped us to develop new antibiotics, advanced pesticides and a powerful, new pheromone, that the animals impetus to couples, compound called H2O-9.
It delivers a strong, sexual attraction.
A single drop is sufficient make an impact on ...
We want to use it to multiply ...
One promising research we do in these dragonflies.
And this has libelsoort an enormous strength for his size.
Keep it tight boys, I come out.
We have the DNA of these three libelsoorten injected ... in seven new superlibellen genetically improved.
There are only six.
Well, one missing libel is the least of my concerns.
This month I have lost six tigers.
In this space, we keep our wildlife.
Would you not do something?
-
- Once I've put it on YouTube.
Pak, slut.
I understand it.
Yes, of course.
Thanks for calling.
That was the director.
Rick walked away from a school trip.
After such a long upbringing he is still so unsettled.
Why do you think so, Albert?
-
- I have no idea, Lucille.
And I taught him everything what I know about the man.
And a good man are you, after all these years that we are married.
Like on that first day.
You're probably already have some age.
-
- And your hair is gray.
You've kraaiepootjes.
-
- You have one hour needed to pass urine.
Your thighs look like cottage cheese overgaf someone on a hot sidewalk.
And you had always been a small penis.
Well, what does it helps if you're in love.
Rick, we already asked us where you were.
You're so late.
It was time that you are at home, your aunt was becoming worried.
You may continue late into the morning sleeping, but do not forget to eat the fish.
Well done, my boy.
I do not know what saves, but you seem not quite okay today.
Teenagers, I will talk with him.
Heavy day, huh?
Well, I ga not lie to you, puberty is a difficult time in the life of a young man.
Perhaps this book will explain what is going on.
Once look, mood swings, vochtophouding ... and once a month you from your vagina bleeding.
This is likely to be the wrong book can be.
The important thing is that you on the verge of adulthood are.
Here, take a drink.
The rites of masculinity.
Today you drink your first beer ... and tomorrow we can besnijden.
My patience is running out, Dr. Strom.
If you just a few minutes could wait ...
I've had long enough egomaniak waited for this.
We are the Board of Directors, our time is valuable.
Not so valuable as my time, Mr. Carlson.
You see, I have a terminal illness and I are fighting for years against.
But the disease has affected my organs.
At this moment I have one hour to live.
It was in advertising.
Gentlemen, if you are ready, allow me then to show you the future.
What should this?
-
- An innovation.
It will not only save my life, but also the life of this company.
Too long have we try to make profit with pills and injections, while the fate of the large total healing.
A device that can alter DNA, and the body are perfect health can return.
You're crazy.
-
- No, crazy is hearing voices, with cats talk, in step with Paula Abdul.
I'm not crazy, I am a visionary.
The machine was never fully tested.
If something goes wrong ...
Start the machine.
-
- Yes sir.
Plasmaniveaus stable, genetic adaptations to optimum level.
Sir, the core becomes overheated.
We have to abort the process.
Is it successful?
I'm sorry.
I want you know what pleasure it will be to lead this company without you, and ...
Let loose, let me loose.
Gentlemen, it is time we agree that what occurred.
How long have I slept?
-
- Five days.

We have the pleasure to as a guest juror to have the principal scientist in the world, Professor at the Empire City University, where he has the rare substance Cerillium works,
I'm so proud to welcome him, Dr. Stephen Hawking.
Thank you for that warm welcome.
I have a disease that has paralyzed me.
I can not walk and I use this computer to speak.
But I'm not discouraged because I have the gift of science.
That is a lie, I think every day to suicide.
But you should rejoice with your life.
You can walk, talk, afkuisen your own ass ... and sex experience.
I have many years no longer had sex.
My nurse is a lesbian and it is not the hottest.
Hey, who would be high?
I have some hashish in their pocket.
Blanke guy with the dreadlocks, you know what I am talking about.
Nobody?
Mietjes.
Watch out where you are in slow-motion runs, acorn.

High, high, high.
Ga from the road.
No brakes.
Ga from the road.
Madam, watch out.
How do you ...?
I can not believe what you just the old lady have saved her life.
Amazingly.
Had I not pushed from the road then she was probably dead.
You would really be proud of yourself.
-
- You are a kind of hero.
Can you tell me apologize?
Voila.
Really kind of you for me to come help, Trey.
No problem!
I was still waiting to Rick.
My god, how did you do that?
It is simpler than it seems.
No, I do not think so.
Why do not you show me what is going on?
Okay then, there is something, but you must keep the secret.
I think I have superpowers.
I can feel difficult.
-
- Okay, what do you think of it.
You may get as many times as you like but I'll bet you 100 dollars ... that you never touches me.
Easy earned.
What can you do all?
Well, I do not know, I am bitten by a libel.
Some dragonflies have an armed skin.
I wonder whether my skin also ...
Well, fortunately that worked well.
So you really have superpowers.
We can form a team.
Then we are famous, get a lot of money ...
-
- Forget the chicks.
We will not be famous and there will be no chicks.
Okay, so I have not asked.
I have been like everyone else.
That is not what your parents wanted for you.
You're not my father.
But I love you like your father!
I believe in you like your father.
I had sex with your mother like your father.
You'll never understand me.
Never.
That is not what your parents wanted for you.
What a fantastic action.
Well Rick, have you enjoyed the opera?
Son, is something you cross?
It's so unfair, they have nothing.
I want things to change.
-
- And that'll do.
One day, Rick, people will ask you to be a hero.
When that day comes, you will then be ready for his?
Give me your wallet.
And that, too.
people will ask you ...
to be a hero.
When that day comes, you will then be ready for his?
Rick, please.
Rick, I'm on the die.
-
- No.
But do not worry, my brother Albert will you adopt.
Rick, the money is all yours.
Sell all shares of the company called Google, it is worth nothing.
Invest in Enron.
Rick, I have something for you.
Taste in my pocket.
The other pocket.
That ring was my father and his father before him.
Earn it, Rick.
Be a hero.
Eis you fate.
Papa.
I'm not a superhero, I am a niemendal.
Is everything okay?
-
- What, have you heard that?
You have nothing else than an ugly and ungrateful whore,
Like your mother.
Who was that?
-
- My mother.
Listen, what about this morning happened at school, I ...
You made us really scared.
-
- I ga rather through a difficult period now.
Me too.
My parents, like I looked at the college ga, but ...

You really believes in me, huh?
I wish I could say the same of Lance.

He does not want any boy in my neighborhood.
Therefore, he schrikdraad put on the fence.
Well, we'll see.

I have reviewed your application for a car loan checked, Mr. Riker, but ... no job, no credit history ...
I am afraid I have to say no.
But, what is it?
That was last month.
The new promotion appears to be quite popular.
Listen, I have to buy a car.
Frankly, Mr. Riker, you are the worst candidate we've ever had.
Thanks for the loan, Mr. Johnson.
This is a good boy.
There must be something that I can do?
Madam,
Cross my pet under the desk , I would not mind doing.
I aai your cross.
I really need that car.
I do not see why that my problem should be.
Everyone silent, remain seated.

You've heard me.
Hurry you.

Hey, I just made the same mistake when I arrived.
Thank you.
You idiot, you let him go ervandoor with our money.
I do not see why that my problem should be.
Come here, you see.
Let me through it.
Fortunately, I thought that something extraordinary had happened.
Well, there is an old guy back.
Uncle Albert.
Try to breathe.
That does not, you kneels on my balls.

Great responsibility?

-
- Yes.
Dr. Whitby.
What brought you here today?
My uncle.

Well, I'm not beroepswedder, but if you want to put some money ... then I give him another week.
Oh, my God.

This is a normal emotional reaction.
But this should soften.

Nine.
-
- Not out loud, stommerik.
Follow me.
My name is Professor Xavier and this is my school.
I began to accept people with special talents, like yours, to help.
Our students learn here their incredible talents to refine ... taking the general interest driven approach.
We have children here who can walk through walls.
We have children who think that they can walk through walls.
Some faces are perhaps known for, as Wolverine.
Other mutants you had probably never heard as Sneezo.
Most of our students were born with their forces, while others, like you, later they acquired in their lives.
Is that ...
-
- Yes, he's it.
When he came to this school he weighed 65 kilos.
By taking steroids, you can achieve a great deal.
You should not touch those pills, Barry.
Why have you brought me here?
-
- Because you've Instance to be the best.
But I can not even fly.
Once you the true meaning of heroïsme knows, you can fly.
But first I must learn your secret of the superhero.

I ga you have to beatings, you can not just say ...
And now what?
What should you say, invisible slut.

I would like to remain a bit longer, but I do not have the time.
Knives of titanium, it seems ... that someone has found your weakness.

- That is not my weakness.
I'm sorry, I had forgotten, your weakness is that you can not fly.
Maybe if you had a partner?

Of course, Lucille, you need support during a period like this.
Yes, I miss my Albert every morning.
50 years are married rather creates a band.
I wish I knew about love.
-
- That will come baby, you should just follow your heart.
That is exactly, I do not know whether I can do that.
If you can not trust, Who can you trust it?
I know, but what if my heart I am an unreachable someone does choose?
Let but, you think I'm crazy.
-
- No, not at all, you can tell everything.
I can keep secrets well.
You'll find it ridiculous, but it is Dra ...
I'm open.
Hello dear.
I forgot to tell you I have invited my uncle.
Your uncle?

Well, that succeed will do ...
-
- Mrs. Johnson, please,
Forgive the bad ways of my cousin.
-
- Thank you!
Ms. Adams, I am Lou Landers, I hope that this is not a burden.
Of course not, there is always room for one more.
Thanks, but Thanksgiving is a familiegebeuren ... and Lance is my only family.
I'm never married.
Fruitcake?
-
- No, just not yet met the right woman.
Yes, Lance told me Rick Riker that your neighbour.
Where's Rick?
That is odd, I thought he was away.
I will call him.
Please, you're doing, allow me.
-
- Thank you.
Above the second door right.
Sorry that I'm so late.
You're just in time.
Take a seat everyone.
Not for the prayer.
Jesus.
-
- Amen.
Please, to touch everyone.
It looks so nice.
-
- Well, we have to thank Rick.
Since Albert ...
Rick has helped me with his new job.
New job?
That you have not told me.
I am a bit the unofficial photographer of Dragonfly.
What happened to your arm?
A fietsboodschapper drove me overthrow.
I see that your wrist is linked.
-
- Yes, I have burned to hot coffee.
And you have a cut in your lip.
My crackpijp broke.
You have a schram in your neck.
-
- Yes, I met a girl on Craigslist.
And you have a bruising in your neck.
-
- I met a boy on Craigslist.
I'm sorry Lance, we should go.
-
- Why then?
I've done in my pants.
I do row.
Thanks to help cleanup.
-
- You are welcome.
The poor stakker is so tired.
You know how old lazy After a heavy meal.
Do you know Dragonfly?
Yes, I think so, you can say that we are thick.
Has he ever asked me to?
Yes, once.
-
- What did you do?
Well, I said ...
I told him ...
I told him about Jill that ... when you look in her eyes and they look back in your eyes, that ... that you know that you would do everything to a better man to be so ... if you ever had the good fortune to her ... every second you could earn its perfect ...
its infinite charm and beauty ... and her endless love.
Do not cry.
-
- Do I not, my eyes burn.
I want you know that that was the most beautiful that anyone ever said to me.
Will I do burn a candle?
-
- Thank you.
I'm so confused, and yet ...
I know exactly what I want.
I'm sorry if ongenodigd binnenval.
It is okay, we all hoped that someone would open a window.
It was here rather stale.
So, this is the hollow of Dragonfly.
How did you know ...
-
- No, no,
I'm not here to fight with you, there are thousands of others who I want dead.
With this visit I would like to show who will be hurt if you frustrates me.
Never.
Time to go.
The woman, Lucille Adams East Empire City, was seriously injured.
How was she injured?
-
- Heavy.
And Dragonfly?
-
- Well, I can tell you ... nobody's life that he has rescued.
Doctor, how it is with her?
-
- It is becoming worse with her.
They can not talk, not walk, she has no control over her bowels.
This is terrible.
-
- I know,
I've already created a MySpace page with the name 'Crazy Shit Machine. "
She already has 40 friends.
Wait again, that is another his file, your aunt has no problems with her intestines,
Happy.
-
- Because she is dead.
Excuse me really Rick, but there is something good.
Your uncle woke up this morning from his coma.
-
- Yes?
But you can not have him tell your aunt, he is in a fragile mental state.
Due to bad news he may go back into a coma.
I understand it.
Mr. Adams, you've visited.
-
- Is the Lucille?
No sir, it's not your dead wife, it's your cousin, Rick.
Remember, no bad news.
Voila sir, here's my bill.
-
- Did you give me surgery?
Yes, we confused you with a patient who went on sex change, but do not worry, we have not deleted your penis.
We have your testicles removed but since your wife is dead ... you'll still no longer need.
Try what his energy to raise ... then he quickly the old one.
We are here together today to say goodbye to Lucille Adams.
Goodbye.
-
- And now the treurdicht.
It is sad to remember that this is the last time ...
I looked at the face my wife can watch.
How could you afpakken her from me.
I can not live without her.
Sorry, there was a terrible mistake.
This is your wife, she is the wife of this man.
Give me five minutes.
You're a lucky man.
Where is Lucille?
I have a coupon for a cremation.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
What is happening?
I know I said things but I realize now more than ever ... that we may never together.
-
- I believe you do not.
You love me Rick, I know.
-
- Jill, believe me,
I tell you this for your own good, I ...
I do not like you.
You are no longer in my top five.
How could you?
'Causes more than likely depression'
My God, you should look.
-
- What are you doing, man.
You have to herpakken.
-
- It makes no sense
Look at yourself, you eat junk, you wear a nepbaard, and we felt your costume in the garbage.
-
- Well, I'm no longer Dragonfly.
But you said that Hourglass Thousands of people went dead.
I've already told you, I am no hero.
Aunt Lucille is dead,
I am the only girl that I ever loved rejected ... and I can not even fly.
That klotelibel had never bite me.
Then you had your father never allowed.
Look at the words that your ancestors that ring graveerden.
Honor, courage, sacrifice, beauty, commitment, courage, justice, unity, brotherhood, pride, low prices, affordable housing, easy trousers, internetporno advantageous.
The remainder is in Latin.
Rick, a hero of the road is dangerous, maybe you'll fail or you will fly, it is important that you use your intellect and others from the emergency help.
If you are a real hero.
Perhaps you are right, but even though I would like to stop Hourglass,
I do not know where to begin.
Where does he find a thousand people together?
Look.
... live from the Empire City Convention Centre, where thousands of people together, but none of them is more important then the winners for the World Humanity Awards.
I do row.
Those shorter road through the park has spared us some time.
You go now, I'm looking for a parking lot.
Each year, the World Humanity Awards place for the largest philanthropic performance honor.
This gala will be the most prestigious world leaders Empire City to attract.
Look, there you have Prince Charles and Nelson Mandela.
Nelson.
I was also in prison, man.
One of the guests here Hourglass, but what is it?
Thanks for us to invite, Mr. Landers.
Well, if you will be honoured by the world do you want your family with you.
One day you might also be part of our family?

- Keep the Lavement up.
Halt, Landers.
-
- Mr. Riker,
So, you know.
-
- Be sure there.
Someone in this auditorium is the Hourglass, I need your help to find out whom.
It may be about equal, a guest of honour, or maybe even a toneelknecht.
Perhaps it is nothing, I have seen a man with something that looked like a barrel Cerillium.
Who?
-
- It there.
His holiness, the Dalai Lama.
This man is not who you think, he is the trophy.
No, I am a man of peace.
-
- Keep your mouth.
You did all these people murder and I can prove otherwise.
Let the world see the weapon that you under this garment hides.
I love you not for the crazy, Hourglass, you hide below five kilos Cerillium.
What?
Pak him.
Peace, kal ...
You?
You're the trophy.
Hourglass.
Heldconventie?
-
- It is a convention for people ... who like verkleden in their favorite hero or crook ... and indeed, your costume is worthless.
-
- From the road.
Hourglass, I let you never committed.
-
- Forget it, Dragonfly, you come too late.
Wegwezen.
Goodbye, vliegje small.
Dragonfly.
-
- No.
Dragonfly, you must stop Hourglass.
I can not, I can not fly.
If my life can learn a lesson, it is that the spirit is stronger than the body, the hero is inside.
This is a text of Celine Dion.
Never mind, it's the truth.
You're right.
It works.
Sorry.
Look, Dragonfly, while your city dies.
Where am I?
-
- You are with me, your lover.
'10 SECONDS TO ONSTERFELIJKHEID ' -
- No.
'Rosie O'Donnel goes naked' -
- No.
Understand you now?
Think of off-earner families.
There is no time anymore.
It is over.
I have you.
Did you think I would have done something with the girl I love?
Well, we still fall.
If I could do but fly.
Maybe I had absolutely no hero ... and I had a normal job, an accountant, a turnleraar.
This is a tall building.
It may take me no longer care, if I die is that fortunately, in your arms.
You're my hero, Rick Riker, and I love you.
Fortunately, there remained only 50 floors.
Shut up.
Thank you, Dragonfly, by you our city is finally secure.
That sound you've said, Dr. Hawking.
At the end of good, all right.
Let us what not to eat, I treat.
Who am I?
I'm Rick Riker.
I'm Dragonfly, and as long as there is injustice and crime, I will always be a superhero ...
Stop!
Stop the bus!
The story of my life is not for the faint of heart.
Thanks. it's all about a girl.
Not that girl.
Hey.
Hi.
I don't think that is a girl.
it's about this girl.
Jill Johnson. but she barely knows I exist.
man!
I got you a seat down here.
What's.

Trey.
I'm so psyched for this class trip.
We about to see some real serious cuttingedge shit.
Mmm.
Mmhmm.
Mmm.
That's what I'm talking about.

AAs?
Got that new sandwich from Sony in my backpack.
WiFi. mmm!

Look look.
Let me show you something.
She not even looking at you.
If I could just tell her how I feel.
I already told you.

that crew stuff isn't real.
Rick.
man. the Scarface society.
.the sexual predators.
Yeah.
Of course you got the Rick punchers.
The who?
they new.
Mmhmm.
But you know what?
Who cares?
'Cause we got our own crew.
me and you.
man.
Am I in?
No.

The two of us against the world.
You hear me?
You look good today.
I like your hair.
I'm gonna show you something nasty I downloaded.
Don't tell nobody.
Welcome to Amalgamated.
head of the research department.
man.
.where we create the future today.
And now I'd like to show you our crown jewel.
The Amalgamated animal genetics lab.
Whoa.
explore.
check this out.
All of our animals are genetically engineered and each of them has.
you're so pretty.
birdie.
Hi.
Hi.
she is.
I'm gonna take a picture of her for the school newspaper.
Our only rules:
Don't feed the animals no flash photography.
Some of our genetically engineered animals are a little sensitive to light.
It flew away.
Uh. whoohoo.
loser?
Lance.
Leave him alone.
I don't think so.
Lance?
Uncle Lou.
Mr. Landers! visionary scientist and C.E.O. of Amalgamated.
I'm just a businessman now.
The future of science belongs to all of you.
enjoy the tour.
Are you okay?
this is healthycough blood.
are you?
I am.
Ah.
Good people.
How are they?
They died violently nine years ago.
But otherwise okay?
thank you.
I live with my aunt and uncle now.
you seem like a real chip off the old block.
Let's hope you're not violently murdered too.
That's for making me look stupid.
Next time I hurt you.
Lance.
Our work with these animals has helped us develop advanced pesticides and a powerful new pheromone which drives animals to mate called compound H2O0.
It's a strong sexual attractant.
A single drop is enough to arouse any animal.
We plan on using it to breed endangered species.
A special and indeed often overlooked.
Our mostpromising research is with these dragonflies.
this dragonfly's skin armorlike exoskeleton to defend against.
And this species of dragonfly has enormous strength for its size.
It can lift vast amounts.
More than it's body weight.
And here we've injected the DNA from all three species into seven new geneticallyenhanced super dragonflies.
But there's only six in there.
one missing dragonfly is the least of my concerns.
I lost six tigers alone last month.
Ah!
This area is where we keep our livestock.
Ohh.
Aren't you going to do something?
Soon as I get this up on YouTube.
I understand.
Thank you for the call.
That was the principal.
Rick walked off a class trip. he's still so troubled.
Albert?
Lucille.
I have taught him everything I know about being a man.
And a good man you are after all these years of marriage.
It's like we first met.
you're a little older.
Your hair's grey.
You have crow's feet.
It takes you an hour to pee.
Your thighs look like cottage cheese someone threw up on a hot sidewalk.
And you've always had a tiny penis.
Well. what does it matter when you're in love?
Rick.
We were wondering where you were.
It's so late.
About time you got home.
Your aunt was getting worried. but don't forget to feed the fish.
Attaboy.
I don't know.
Something just doesn't seem quite right with him today.
Teenagers.
I'll talk to him.
I won't lie to you.
Puberty is a difficult time in a young man's life.
Now this book may explain what's happening. and once a month you'll bleed from your vagina.
This may be the wrong book.
What's important is that you're on the verge of adulthood.
Here.
take a drink.
the rituals of manhood. and tomorrow we'll circumcise you.
Dr. Strom.
if you could just wait a few minutes.
I've waited long enough for this egomaniac.
We're the board of directors.
Our time is valuable.
Mr. Carlson.
I have a terminal illness. but the disease has ravaged my organs.
I have one hour left to live.
It was on sale. allow me to show you the future.
Strom.
From the. lift it ov.
lift it over!
What the hell is that?
An innovation.
thank you.
that will not only save my life but the life of this company.
For too long we've scraped out profits from pills and injections.
The real prize is the total cure.
A device that can alter DNA and restore the body to perfect health.
You're crazy.
No. dating Paula Abdul.
I'm not crazy.
I'm a visionary!
the machine's never been fully tested.
If something should go wrong.
sir.
Plasma level is steady.
Genetic modification's at optimum levels!
the core is overheating.
Ah!
We have to abort!
Did it work?
I'm so sorry.
well.
I want you to know what a joy it will be running this company without you in the way.
Let go.
Let me go.
I think it's time we made some personnel changes.
stay away!
Oh.
How long was I asleep?
Five days.
Huh.
Wait.
Wha.
Dad.
I thought you'd live forever.
Oh.
Rick!
I'll be right down!
Oh!
If I can have your attention.
We are delighted to have as guest judge the foremost scientist in the world.
He's a visiting professor at Empire City University where he's working with the rare element cerillium.
I am so proud to welcome Dr. Stephen Hawking.
Thank you for that warm welcome.
I have a disease that has paralyzed me.
I cannot walk and I use this computer to speak.
because I have the gift of knowledge.
That's a lie.
I think about suicide every day.
But you should all be happy with your lives.
wipe your own asses and then there's all the sex.
I haven't had sex in years.
and not the hot kind.
anyone want to get high?
I've got some hash with me.
No way. you know what I'm talking about.
Can I get a what what?
Holla.
I've got a stiff pole for your sweet hole.

Pussies.

Are you okay?
How did you.
I can't believe it.
You just saved that old lady's life.
Amazing. she would've die. ah!
You should be really proud of yourself.
You're some kind of hero.
If you could excuse me.
Trey.
so.
Ooh.
My God.
How did you do that?
it's easier than it looks.
I don't think so.
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
okay?
But you have to keep it a secret.
I think I have.
superpowers.
I find that hard to believe.
how about this?
Go ahead and throw as many punches as you want.
I bet you 100 bucks you don't land one.
Easy money.
What else can you do?
I don't know.
I.
I was bitten by a dragonfly.
some dragonflies have armored skin.
I wonder if my skin is.
good thing that worked.
So you do have superpowers.
We could be a team!
money.
Don't forget the bitches.
There's not gonna be fame okay?
I didn't ask for any of this.
I just wanna be like everybody else.
That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
You're not my father.
But I love you like your father did.
I believe in you like your father did.
I had sex with your mother just like your father did.
Huh.
You'll never understand me.
Never.
That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
What a great performance.
did you enjoy the opera?
is something troubling you?
It's so unfair.
They have nothing.
Why do we have $2 billion?
your grandfather left us $3 billion and I made some bad investments.
But that's nothing for you to worry about.
But I want to change things.
And you will.
Five generations of Rikers have worked hard to make this city great.
people will look to you to be a hero.
will you be ready?
Give me your wallet.
That too.
People will look to you to be a hero.
will you be ready?
Rick!
Ah!
Ow!
Huh?
Ah!
please!
Ah!
I'm dying.
No!
Don't worry.
My brother Albert will take you in.
it's all yours now.
Sell all shares of a small company called Google.
It's worthless.
Invest heavily in Enron.
I have something for you.
Reach into my coat pocket.
The other coat pocket.
God!
That ring was my father's and his father's before him.
Rick.
Be a hero.
Claim your.
destiny.
Dad!
I'm no superhero.
I'm nobody!
Ah!
Shut up back there!
I'm gonna kill you!
you heard that?
ungrateful little whore!
Just like your mother!
Who was that?
My mother.
I.
You really freaked us out.
I'm really going through a tough time right now. but I want to be a dancer.
I believe in you.
don't you?
I wish I could say the same for Lance.
I don't know.
Is he the right one or am I just dating him to rebel against my father?
He doesn't want any boy near me.
That's why he installed the electrified fence.
we'll see.
You can't run from your destiny.
Right?
Right.
let's go!
Nice car.
Maybe one day you could take me for a ride in your car.
Uh.
yeah.
definitely.
Oh.
Lovebirds.
this is Professor Xavier.
but you can't control it.
It's important that you.
become a hero.
train yourself to fly.
.in your ass because.
.squatting on a glass table.
.two girls.
one cup.
You know what to do.
I'll be waiting right here.
Mr. Bailey.
I'm afraid I have to say no.
But what about this?
That was last month.
This new promotion's proving quite popular.
I need to buy a car.
you're the worst applicant we've ever had.
Mr. Thompson.
This is a good boy.
There must be something I could do.
Ma'am.
rubbing my crotch under the desk won't change my mind.
I'm not rubbing your crotch.
I really need that car.
I don't see how that's my problem.
This is a robbery!
Nobody move!
Everybody stay down!
Stay down!
Lady!
Hurry it up!
move it!
I made the same mistake before when I came in.
Thanks.
You idiot!
You let him get away with our money!
I don't see how that's my problem.
man!
Wow.
Come over here!
You've got to see this.
Let me through.
Let me through.
thank God.
I thought something terrible had happened.
an old guy did get shot over there.
Uncle Albert!
Just try to breathe.
I can't.
You're kneeling on my balls.
sorry.
listen.
With great power comes.
Great responsibility? but if you want to be a virgin for the rest of your life.
Uncle Albert!
My balls!
Very good.
God.
Mr. Landers!
Oh no.
Okay.
Hide the body.
Hide the body.
Yeah.
Get in!
Yah!
Yah!
I come back.
Jill?
I came as soon as I heard.
Where's Aunt Lucille?
She's at home under heavy sedation.
They made her watch three hours of women's basketball.
it was an armed robbery.
There was nothing you could've done.
I could've stopped that guy before he shot my uncle.
Then there is blood on your hands.
But that's not important.
All that matters is that you're here for him now.
Rick Riker?
Yes?
Dr. Whitby.
I've run some tests.
I'm afraid I have bad news.
What is it?
I have an impacted colon.
Whew.
What a night.
Now what brought you here today?
My uncle.
Your uncle brought you?
then he shouldn't be driving.
I have to perform a breast exam.
please.
Is my uncle gonna survive?
I don't know.
We should probably have a look.
Hard to say.
pretty deep coma.
Is he gonna be okay? I'll take "dead in a week." Oh my God! but this should take the edge off of it.
Here we go.
Nice and easy.
I know.
First my parents and now this?
I'm nothing but a screwup.
your life has been a testament to that.
But your uncle believed in you and so do I.
It's never too late to become the person you're meant to be.
Rick.
Rick.
Rick.
Rick.
Who are you and how do you know my name?
I'm a psychic.
Prove it.
Think of any number between one and a million and I'll tell you what it is.
dumbass!
Follow me.
you dumb son of a bitch. and this is my school.
I started it to help people with special talents like yours.
Our students here learn to harness their incredible talents.
and use them to advance the common good.
Ah!
Ow.
Here we have children who can walk through walls.
We have children who think they can walk through walls. like Wolverine. like Sneezo.
Most of our students are born with their powers.
gain them later in life.
it is. he weighed 130 lbs.
you could do anything.
Barry!
Why have you brought me here?
Because you have the potential to be the best.
But I can't even fly. you will fly.
But first I must teach you the secret to becoming a superhero.
Storm!
You look like you putting on a little weight.
Ah!
Oh!
about this secret.
you see.
Xavier!
shit.
Well?
You wanna explain why I found her hiding in your closet?
I don't see nobody.
you don't?
Ow!
Invisible Girl?
Apparently not invisible enough.
maybe this wouldn't have happened.
this bitch is crazy.
I'm gonna have to whip your ass.
baldy?
sweet cheeks.
Whoa!
Ow!
That all you got?
Yeah!
Invisibitch?
whatever.
I'm out of here.
I'm sure gonna miss her.
She was crazy in the sack.
tongue all over the place.
asshole.
Spanky.
I didn't even know she had a dog.
Still some of the best sex I ever had.
How could you do this to me?
To your kids?
To your newborn baby?
How do I know that baby's even mine?
Because he can do this.
Shit!
Ah!
man.
Now I'm never gonna know the secret to becoming a superhero.
You wanna know the secret?
Come close.
shithead!
I swear to God.
They get dumber and dumber every year.
A costume.
uh.
Oh my God.
Damn!
man!
I love the mask.
How you breathe in it though?
What's that sound?
You put some kind of air intake in the mask.
you better.
now I'm assuming right?
this is good.
I'm impressed.
Like really impressed.
that's my spot.
You're sitting on my gargoyle.
Move it.
Excuse me?
What are you even doing here?
I'm looking seriously out over the city in a squatting position.
I guess we're gonna have to share.
fine.
I actually usually perch in the front.
you've got to go around.
wait.
Just turn this way.
Here we go.
I'm sorry.
Relax.
Okay okay.
Okay okay.
me neither.
What's your name?
John Storm.
Dragonfly.
So what's your power?
What's my power?
Stand back.
Flame on!
Whoa!
Huh?
I'm on fire!
Get a blanket or something!
Holy shit!
It's not working!
Get the fire extinguisher!
Ah!
No!
Ah!
stop!
What's wrong with you?
my bad. you will fly.
Shit.
he's not even a hero.
He's not.
I have.
I have.
I have just a.
I have.
He can't.
he can't even fly.
The Dragonfly can't even fly!
okay?
I can fly.
This just in:
Tom Cruise is dead.
World's most powerful man.
I have a feeling you might disagree with that.
do you have my test results?
sir. rejuvenates you.
But only for 24 hours.
Hmmm.
What if I killed 28 people in one session?
Would that give me a month to live?
yes.
But only if your cells could absorb and they can't.
I'm afraid you have to kill each day to live each day.
Still a slave to the tyranny of time.
There must be some answer.
There isn't.
Unless.
unless you had some cerillium.
Then you could create a device powerful enough to draw the lifeforce out of thousands of people and enhance your own cellular capacity.
you're a genius.
Wikipedia.
But that's not important.
What is important is that you don't have any cerillium.
it's immoral.
We don't do that sort of thing.
We're a pharmaceutical company.
Wait a minute.
Take a look.
Hawking's lab is in the physics building.
I could just walk right in.
You're going to steal cerillium?
not me.
I'm a law abiding citizen.
But perhaps there's someone inside me.
Someone unfettered by the rule of law.
survive!
Ow!
glass in my eye.
Glass in my eye!
it hurts.
if you could spread.
spread them with your fingers.
Push your lids with your fingers.
Two. two. two fingers.
Are your fingers clean?
That's it.
And roll your eyeball around.
And push it.
I'm rolling it!
Dig it out with another piece of glass.
Are you fricking insane?
I'll get the tweezers.
world's greatest hero.
yup.
Read all about it.
you listen to me!
I want that story on my desk or you're fired!
Who the hell are you?
I was wondering if you've got a job opening for.
Job?
!
How dare you come in here and ask me for a job?
I'm the editor in chief!
I know the mayor of Venus!
Hamburgers can see the future!
Rosie O'Donnell.
Sorry about this.
We share the building with a mental hospital.
boss.
We're nowhere on those Dragonfly photos.
Damn.
Those were tomorrow's lead.
What about these?
Wow!
it's almost like you're the Dragonfly.
no no no.
See?
Look.
Now that's photography.
some kind of police standoff at Empire University.
I want you to.
Where'd he go?
let's go!
This is the chief of police.
We have the building surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.
What the hell is that?
I am the Hourglass.
And your time is up.
Dragonfly.
Hourglass.
Dragonfly.
It's just begun!
It's useless to resist.
I'll fight you to my last breath.
Like the sands of time I am unceasing and relentless.
Hourglass.
You'll pay for your crimes and justice will.
stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Are you okay?
No.
Titanium blades.
They cut through diamonds.
I'm not wearing any diamonds.
ow!
Ow!
Dragonfly.
But I just don't have the time.
he's in over his head.
We don't need socalled superheroes.
What Empire City needs is more cops.
And a Hooters.
Titanium blades.
Looks like someone found your weakness.
It's not my weakness.
I forgot.
Your weakness is you can't fly.
Maybe if you had a partner.
I don't need help.
I'm fine all by myself.
doesn't she?
no.
she's with someone else.
maybe that's for the best. being the girlfriend of the Dragonfly.
Aunt Lucille.
I love her.
So be it.
to get to you your enemies will attack the people you care for the most.
Be careful not to hurt the ones you love.
And shave your pubes.
No one wants to go down on a tumbleweed.
Jill!
Rick?
I heard you were auditioning for a part so.
they're beautiful.
you are so supportive.
Why can't Lance be more like you?
isn't there?
Something secret.
Something locked away deep inside.
It was summer camp.
We had to share a shower.
You trip and fall with your mouth open on one guys.
No!
in here.
there is.
Rick.
man!
Once a month you'll bleed from you vagina.
I.
nothing.
Nothing?
I should go.
You're a good friend.
check this out.
check this out.
shit.
Let's go.
Get her.
it hurts.
It hurts.
Please stop!
I'm begging you!
Wait!
Where are you?
Behind you.
You saved my life.
Do I get to thank you?
Go.
Be a hero.
Yeah.
It looks like you're planning a mass murder.
Would you like help?
Paper clip guy.
I'm so happy that you and your boyfriend are spending Thanksgiving with us.
Lucille.
You need support at a time like this.
I miss seeing my Albert each morning.
50 years of marriage creates quite a bond.
I wish I knew love like that.
dear.
You just have to follow your heart.
That's the thing.
I don't know if I can.
Jill.
If you can't trust yourself who can you trust?
I know.
But what if my heart is telling me to be with someone
I can't be with?
It's not just any guy.
It's the.
forget it.
You'll think I'm crazy.
of course not.
You can tell me anything.
I'm very good at keeping secrets.
but.
it's the Drag.
I'll get it.
Thank you.
babe.
I forgot to tell you I kinda invited my uncle.
Your uncle?
What?
Set another plate.
okay.
I guess.
excuse my nephew's poor manners.
I'm Lou Landers.
I hope this isn't too much of an imposition.
of course not.
There's always room for one more.
Thank you.
It's just Thanksgiving is for family.
Lance is the only family I have.
I never married.
Fruitcake?
just never met the right woman.
Lance told me Rick Riker was your neighbor.
Where is Rick?
That's odd.
I thought he was out.
I'll go check on him.
you're busy.
Allow me.
second door to the right.
Rick?
Hmmm.
Hmmm.
Sorry I'm late.
Mr. Landers.
Rick.
you're just on time.
take your seat.
Ohhh.
Ah ah ah!
Not till we say grace.
Jesus!
Amen.
everyone.
Lucille.
We have Rick to thank for it.
Ever since Albert.
Rick has been supporting me with his new job.
New job?
You didn't tell me.
I'm sort of the Dragonfly's unofficial photographer.
What happened to your arm?
Uh.
a bike messenger knocked me down.
I see your wrist is bandaged.
I burned it on some hot coffee.
And you have a cut on your lip.
Uh.
my crackpipe broke.
You have a scratch on your neck.
I.
met a girl on Craigslist.
And you have a bruise on your neck.
I.
met a guy on Craigslist.
Lance.
We have to go.
Why?
I.
shat my pants.
I'll drive.
Thanks for helping clean up.
Of course.
Poor thing's so tired.
you know old folks after a big meal.
So. you know the Dragonfly?
Uh.
I guess.
You could sorta say we're close.
Has he.
has he ever asked about me?
yeah.
once.
What did you tell him?
I said.
I told him.
The thing about Jill is.
when you look in her eyes and she looks back in yours.
you know that you'd do anything anything to be a better person than you are.
So that. you could earn every second of her perfect.
and her limitless beauty.
and her unending love.
Don't cry.
I'm not.
My eyes are burning.
I want you to know that was the most beautiful thing anyone's ever said to me.
Scented candle?
Thank you.
and yet.
I know exactly what I want.
Sorry to drop in uninvited.
It's okay.
We were hoping someone would open a window.
It was getting stuffy in here.
So this is the lair of the Dragonfly.
I'm not here to fight you.
I've got thousands of other people I plan to kill.
This little visit is just to show you who'll get hurt if you get in my way.
Never!
Time to go. was badly injured.
How was she injured?
Badly.
What about the Dragonfly?
All I can tell you is this:
he didn't save anyone tonight.
how is she?
I'm afraid your aunt's taken a turn for the worse.
she had no control over her bowels.
That's. that's awful.
I know.
I went ahead and set up a MySpace page for her under "crazy shit machine.
She already has 40 friends.
Wait a minute.
That's somebody else's aunt.
Your aunt has no problem with her bowels.
thank God.
.because she's dead.
but there is a silver lining.
Your uncle came out of his coma this morning.
He did?
but you mustn't tell him about your aunt just yet.
He's in a delicate mental state.
The slightest bit of bad news could send him spiraling right back into a coma.
I understand.
you have a visitor.
it's not your dead wife.
It's your nephew Rick.
no bad news.
here you go.
This is my bill.
we confused you we didn't remove your penis. you won't be needing them anyway.
You just want to keep his spirits up.
He'll land on his feet in no time.
We are gathered today to say goodbye to Lucille Adams.
Goodbye!
And now the eulogy.
It's tragic to think this is the last time that I can look upon my wife's face.
Lucille!
How could you take her from me?
I can't live without her!
Ahhh!
Lucille!
Snookie lumps!
there's been a terrible mistake.
This is your wife.
Ah!
She is this man's wife.
Give me five minutes.
Uncle Albert!
I'm not finished.
You're one lucky guy.
Now.
where's Lucille?
Lucille!
I do have this coupon for a cremation.
Rick?
I am so sorry for your loss.
What is it? I realize.
we can never be together.
I don't believe you.
Rick.
I know you do.
trust me.
I'm telling you this for your own good.
I don't love you.
You're no longer in my five.
How could you?
When I was young
I never needed anyone
Makin' love was just for fun
Those days are gone
All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself.
Anymore
All by myself
Don't want to be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself.
man.
You only beat me by two strokes this time.
And the back nine is what killed.
Oh my God!
man?
dude.
What's the point? and we found your costume in the garbage outside.
I'm not the Dragonfly anymore.
But you said the Hourglass was going to kill thousands of people.
I've rejected the only girl I've ever loved and I can't even fly.
I wish I'd never been bitten by that stupid dragonfly.
And maybe your father shouldn't have given you this after all.
Look at the words your ancestors inscribed in that ring. cheap internet porn.
The rest is in Latin.
the hero's path is dangerous.
You may fail or you may fly.
All that matters is that you do it for the best of reasons. that's what makes you a real hero.
I wouldn't know where to start.
where's he gonna find thousands of people in one place?
Look.
Reporting here live from the Empire City convention center but none of them more important than the attendees of the World Humanity Awards.
I'll drive.
that shortcut through the playground sure saved us some time.
I'll find a place to park.
please stop!
Each year the World Humanity Awards are held to honor the greatest achievements on behalf of all humanity.
This gala event is expected to draw the world's most prestigious leaders to Empire City.
excuse us!
"Empire City Times.
there go Prince Charles.
And Nelson Mandela.
Nelson!
man.
One of the guests here is the Hourglass.
But which one?
Mr. Landers. you want your family with you.
you could be part of our family too.
our first award is for the medical breakthrough of the year.
For his company's pioneering work in the field of feminine hygiene
I award Lou Landers douchebag of the year.
Douchebag
He's the douchebag of the year folks?
Ain't he grand?
The douchebag of the year.
Douchebag
He's Mr. Douchebag of the year look at him shine the douchebag of the year.
sir.
Landers.
Mr. Riker.
So.
you know.
You're damn right I do.
Someone in this auditorium is the Hourglass.
I need your help to figure out who it is.
Now the Hourglass could be anyone.
a guest of honor.
maybe even a stagehand.
but I did see a man with what looked like a canister of cerillium.
Who?
This year's lifetime achievement award.
Him. the Dalai Lama.
he's the Hourglass.
I'm a man of peace.
Shut up!
You're plotting to kill all these people and I can prove it.
Show the world the armor you're hiding under these robes.
Hourglass.
You're packing 10 lbs of Cerillium under there.
What?
Ahh!
Take him down.
Tutu.
Peace!
Pea.
Shit shit shit shit shit.
You!
You're the Hourglass.
my dear.
Perhaps this will help you forget.
What are you doing?
Take me.
Hourglass!
Hero con?
It's a convention for people who like to dress up as their favorite heroes and villains.
your costume sucks.
Out of my way!
there is a line.
you're killing him all wrong.
It's like this.
Better.
shit.
you'll never get away with this!
Dragonfly.
You're too late.
Run!
Yeah.
Goodbye.
little fly.
Dragonfly!
No!
Ahhh!
My eye!
or.
Eh.
you must stop the Hourglass.
I can't.
I can't fly. it is that the spirit is stronger than the body.
The hero comes from within.
Those are Celine Dion lyrics.
Whatever.
It's still true.
You're right.
It's working.
Sorry. as your city dies.
Where. am I? your lover.
Dragonfly!
No.
No.
Only now do you understand.
come.
Aha!
I need you to jerk this off.
Yeah.
There's not enough time.
Oh fuck.
It's over.
Dragonfly!
Jill!
Gotcha.
Rick?
You didn't think I'd let anything happen did you?
we're still falling.
Damn it!
If only I could fly.
Maybe I wasn't cut out to be a hero. a gym teacher.
This is a really tall building.
Rick!
I don't care what happens anymore.
I die happily in your arms.
and I love you.
thank God!
We only have 50 stories left.
Hang on.
Dragonfly.
our city is safe at last.
Dr. Hawking.
Shit!
It's a happy ending for us all.
Let's go get some dinner.
I'm buying.
Who am I?
I'm Rick Riker.
I'm the Dragonfly.
And as long as there's crime and injustice
I will forever be a superhero.
I am the Hourglass!
evil surrounds you we're almost out of time
What do you do when nothing can be done?
Where do you go with nowhere left to run?
Where is the one who stands up and tells you
I'm here to save you?
We're almost out of time
Nobody knows just who he's trying to be his wings and suit of green
Just in time to reach up for the sky
And fly away
Don't worry you're safe 'cause it takes your love it's safe to say
Jill and I were always meant to be
So I will show you why I'm here to stay
Don't they know that I'll protect you?
Don't they know they'll have to get through
Me
Don't worry yourself.
Your time is up!
Watch out behind you
This is designed to
Quickly remind you
We're almost out of time
Somebody tell me what he's trying to be his suit of green
Just in time to reach up for the sky
And fly away
Don't worry you're safe 'cause it takes your love it's safe to say
Jill and I were always meant to be
So I will show you why I'm here to stay
I'm the one
Who let's them know that I'll protect you
Don't they know they'll have to get through me?
Don't worry you're safe.
In my arms so green
It's easy.
I need a hero
I need a hero
I want you here
This is my 011
I'm sinking down into the fear
That I just can't outrun
To save myself all I can see
Is that I've got no choice
I cry for help and pray you'll be
The one who hears my voice
I need a hero
Someone to rescue me when I'm in a mess someone to be my safety net
I need a hero watching over me
I need a hero in my time of need
To fix it when it's going wrong you know that I need a hero
Waited my whole life
For someone like you
And I think it's time
For my dreams to come true
If only you could hear me
I know you'd be near me
You'll never let me go
I need a hero
I need a hero
Someone to rescue me when I'm in a mess someone to be my safety net
I need a hero watching over me
I need a hero in my time of need
To fix it when it's going wrong you know that I need a hero.

Boy's voice:
The story of my life is not for the faint of heart.
Thanks.
But, like any story worth telling, it's all about a girl.
Not that girl.
- Hey.
Hi.
- l don't think that is a girl.
No, it's about this girl--
Jill Johnson.
Ever since I can remember I've been in love with her, but she barely knows I exist.
Yo, Rick!
Yo, come here, man!
I got you a seat down here.
What's-- l'll call y'all back.
Everybody, bye.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, Trey.
Dude, I'm so psyched for this class trip.
We about to see some real serious cutting-edge shit.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yo, you got any C batteries on you?
AAs?
Got that new sandwich from Sony in my backpack.
Wi-Fi-- mmm!
Yo!
You got to forget about her, dawg.
Look look.
Let me show you something.
She not even looking at you.
If I could just tell her how I feel.
- Look, Rick, I already told you...
- ( humming ) you never gonna get with Jill, all right?
Seriously, she hangs out with the popular crew, and nobody messes around outside their group, man.
Come on, that crew stuff isn't real.
The hell it ain't.
Look around, Rick.
- Look, you got your jocks...
- Get the ball, man.
...nerds, emos,
Frodos,
- the Scarface society...
- ( gun clicks )
- ...the sexual predators.
- ( mutters ) Yeah.
- Of course you got the Rick punchers.
- The who?
- Oh!
- Yeah, they new.
Mm-hmm.
But you know what?
Who cares?
'Cause we got our own crew-- me and you.
Thanks, Trey.
You're the best, man.
- Am I in?
- Man:
No.
Come on.
Hey, it's me and you, baby.
The two of us against the world.
You hear me?
You look good today.
I like your hair.
I'm gonna show you something nasty I downloaded.
- Don't tell nobody.
- ( sheep bleats )
Man:
Welcome to Amalgamated.
I'm Dr. Strom, head of the research department...
- Come on, man.
- ...where we create the future today.
And now I'd like to show you our crown jewel.
The Amalgamated animal genetics lab.
- ( animals chittering )
- Whoa.
Go ahead, explore.
Yo yo.
Come on, Rick.
Man, check this out.
Strom:
All of our animals are genetically engineered and each of them has...
Oh, you're so pretty.
Hi, birdie.
( giggles )
Hi.
Hi.
- She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Yes, she is.
Uh, I'm gonna take a picture of her for the school newspaper.
Strom:
Our only rules:
Don't feed the animals and please, no flash photography.
Some of our genetically- engineered animals are a little sensitive to light.
It flew away.
Uh-- whoo-hoo.
What the F, loser?
- Boy:
Get him, Lance.
- Come on, Lance.
- Leave him alone.
- l don't think so.
is there a problem, Lance?
No.
No problem, Uncle Lou.
Mr. Landers!
Students, this is Lou Landers, visionary scientist and C.E.O. of Amalgamated.
Well, I'm just a businessman now.
The future of science belongs to all of you.
- Please, enjoy the tour.
- ( kids chatting )
( coughs )
Are you okay?
Yes, this is healthy-cough blood.
Rick Riker.
You're not Blaine and Julia Riker's son, are you?
- l am.
- Ah.
Good people.
- How are they?
- They died violently nine years ago.
But otherwise okay?
Yes, thank you.
I live with my aunt and uncle now.
Well, you seem like a real chip off the old block.
Let's hope you're not violently murdered too.
- ( boys laughing )
- Lance:
That's for making me look stupid.
Next time I hurt you.
Yeah.
You the man, Lance.
Strom:
Our work with these animals has helped us develop new antibiotics, advanced pesticides and a powerful new pheromone which drives animals to mate called compound H2O9.
It's a strong sexual attractant.
A single drop is enough to arouse any animal.
We plan on using it to breed endangered species.
A special and indeed often overlooked- ( rabbit shrieks )
- Our most-promising research is with these dragonflies.
For example, this dragonfly's skin has a hard, armor-like exoskeleton to defend against...
And this species of dragonfly has enormous strength for its size.
It can lift vast amounts.
- More than it's body weight.
- ( monkey chatters )
And here we've injected the DNA from all three species into seven new genetically-enhanced super dragonflies.
But there's only six in there.
Well, one missing dragonfly is the least of my concerns.
I lost six tigers alone last month.
- ( crunches )
- Ah!
Strom:
This area is where we keep our livestock.
- Ohh.
- ( grunting )
Aren't you going to do something?
Soon as I get this up on YouTube.
I see.
Ye-- well, yes, I understand.
Thank you for the call.
That was the principal.
Rick walked off a class trip.
After all the parenting you've done, he's still so troubled.
Why do you think that is, Albert?
I have no idea, Lucille.
I have taught him everything I know about being a man.
And a good man you are after all these years of marriage.
It's like we first met.
Sure, you're a little older.
Your hair's grey.
You have crow's feet.
It takes you an hour to pee.
Your thighs look like cottage cheese someone threw up on a hot sidewalk.
And you've always had a tiny penis.
Well... what does it matter when you're in love?
- ( groaning )
- Oh, Rick.
We were wondering where you were.
It's so late.
About time you got home.
Your aunt was getting worried.
You can sleep late in the morning, but don't forget to feed the fish.
Attaboy.
( phone clatters ) I don't know.
Something just doesn't seem quite right with him today.
Teenagers.
I'll talk to him.
( knocks )
Rough day, huh?
Well, I won't lie to you.
Puberty is a difficult time in a young man's life.
Now this book may explain what's happening.
Let's see.
There are mood swings, fluid retention, and once a month you'll bleed from your vagina.
This may be the wrong book.
What's important is that you're on the verge of adulthood.
Here...
take a drink.
Ah, the rituals of manhood.
Today you have your first beer, and tomorrow we'll circumcise you.
( thunder booming )
I'm losing patience, Dr. Strom.
Please, sir, if you could just wait a few minutes-- l've waited long enough for this egomaniac.
We're the board of directors.
Our time is valuable.
Not as valuable as mine, Mr. Carlson.
You see, I have a terminal illness.
I've been fighting it for years, but the disease has ravaged my organs.
As of this moment, I have one hour left to live.
It was on sale.
Lou:
Gentlemen, if you're ready, allow me to show you the future.
Strom.
From the-- lift it ov-- lift it over!
What the hell is that?
An innovation-- thank you-- that will not only save my life but the life of this company.
For too long we've scraped out profits from pills and injections.
The real prize is the total cure.
A device that can alter DNA and restore the body to perfect health.
- You're crazy.
- ( Lou chuckles ) No.
Crazy is hearing voices, talking to cats, dating Paula Abdul.
I'm not crazy.
I'm a visionary!
Sir.
Sir, the machine's never been fully tested.
If something should go wrong--
- Start the machine!
- Yes, sir.
- ( beeps, whirrs ) - ( grunts )
Plasma level is steady.
Genetic modification's at optimum levels!
- ( beeps )
- Sir, the core is overheating.
- Ah!
- Strom:
We have to abort!
( whirrs down )
- ( computer beeping )
- Did it work?
- ( men whispering ) - l'm so sorry.
Well, well, well.
I want you to know what a joy it will be running this company without you in the way.
Let go.
Let me go.
( Carlson screaming )
Gentlemen, I think it's time we made some personnel changes.
- ( men screaming )
- Man:
No, stay away!
( hitch-pitched screaming )
( birds chirping )
( birds chirping )
Oh.
How long was I asleep?
Five days.
( grunts, farts )
Huh.
( beeping )
( buzzes )
( beeping )
Wait.
Wha--
Oh, Dad.
I thought you'd live forever.
Oh.
Lucille:
Breakfast, Rick!
I'll be right down!
Oh!
( bell rings )
( bell rings )
Woman:
If I can have your attention.
We are delighted to have as guest judge the foremost scientist in the world.
He's a visiting professor at Empire City University where he's working with the rare element cerillium.
I am so proud to welcome Dr. Stephen Hawking.
Computer:
Thank you for that warm welcome.
I have a disease that has paralyzed me.
I cannot walk and I use this computer to speak.
But I am not depressed, because I have the gift of knowledge.
That's a lie.
I think about suicide every day.
But you should all be happy with your lives.
You can walk, talk, wipe your own asses and then there's all the sex.
- ( murmuring loudly ) - l haven't had sex in years.
My nurse is a lesbian, and not the hot kind.
Hey, anyone want to get high?
- l've got some hash with me.
- Girl:
No way.
White guy in the dreads, you know what I'm talking about.
Can I get a what what?
Holla.
I've got a stiff pole for your sweet hole.
Anyone?
Anyone?
Pussies.
Dr. Hawking, I am such a fan.
I'd love to show you my project on supernovas.
You have an incredible ass stromony career ahead of you.
Wait, where's Saturn?
I'd hate to lose my father's bowling ball.
There it is.
Great reflexes.
You have very manly hands.
So do you.
I'm gonna go find a spot for my project.
Yeah, okay.
Watch where you're going in slo-mo, dipshit.
- Pfft.
- Yeah.
( whispers ) Go to her, stupid.
Tell her how you feel.
( rips )
Yow.
Boy:
Any day.
Uh... he did it.
- ( thunks )
- Man:
Ow!
- l'm gonna kill you.
- Boy #2:
Get him, Lance!
- Lance, stop it.
- Boy #3:
Kick his ass, Lance!
Fight fight fight!
- Let's see what you got.
- Fucking break him!
Boy #4:
Whoa!
Crowd:
Oh!
Damn!
Ooh!
Get off!
Get-- get off me!
Yah!
( bees buzzing )
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
Shit shit shit shit.
( siren blaring in distance )
( dramatic music playing )
- ( hip-hop music playing ) - ## Oh no, you didn't, didn't ##
- ## Oh no, you didn't ## - ## Oh yes, we did ##
## Oh no, you didn't, didn't, Oh no, you didn't ##
- ## Oh yeah, we did ## - ## Oh no, you didn't, didn't ##
- ## Oh no, you didn't ## - ## Oh yes, we did. ##
- ( meows ) - ( truck horn blaring )
Stop!
Stop!
Hey!
Get out of the way!
No brakes!
Get out of the way!
- ( screaming )
- Ma'am, look out!
Woman:
Are you okay?
( moans )
- How did you-- - l can't believe it.
- You just saved that old lady's life.
- Amazing.
l-- l guess.
If I hadn't pushed her out of the way, she would've die-- ah!
- ( grinding ) - ( whining )
- You should be really proud of yourself.
- ( dog barks )
- ( dog whines )
- You're some kind of hero.
If you could excuse me.
( rapid footsteps fading )
( high-pitched hisses )
( high-pitched hisses )
There we go.
Awfully nice of you to help me out here, Trey.
Oh, no problem.
I'm waiting on Rick, anyway, so...
- ( high-pitched hiss )
- Ooh.
My God.
How did you do that?
Uh, it's easier than it looks.
- ( high-pitched hiss ) - ( screaming )
No, I don't think so.
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
All right.
Well, there is something, okay?
But you have to keep it a secret.
( nail clanks ) I think I have...
superpowers.
I find that hard to believe.
All right, all right, how about this?
Go ahead and throw as many punches as you want.
I bet you 100 bucks you don't land one.
- Albert:
Easy money.
- ( dollars rustle )
What else can you do?
I don't know.
l-- l was bitten by a dragonfly.
Well, some dragonflies have armored skin.
- l wonder if my skin is-- - ( yells )
Well, good thing that worked.
So you do have superpowers.
We could be a team!
We gonna get fame, money--
- Don't forget the bitches.
- There's not gonna be fame and there's not gonna be bitches, okay?
I didn't ask for any of this.
I just wanna be like everybody else.
That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
You're not my father.
But I love you like your father did.
I believe in you like your father did.
I had sex with your mother just like your father did.
Huh.
You'll never understand me.
- Never.
- ( door slams )
( Albert's voice echoing ) That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
What a great performance.
Well, Rick, did you enjoy the opera?
( bottles rattling )
Son, is something troubling you?
It's so unfair.
They have nothing.
Why do we have $2 billion?
Well, your grandfather left us $3 billion and I made some bad investments.
But that's nothing for you to worry about.
But I want to change things.
And you will.
Five generations of Rikers have worked hard to make this city great.
One day, Rick, people will look to you to be a hero.
When that day comes, will you be ready?
Give me your wallet.
That too.
Blaine's voice:
People will look to you to be a hero.
When that day comes, will you be ready?
Rick!
Ah!
- ( bullet ricochets )
- Ow!
Huh?
Ah!
Rick, please!
Ah!
- Dad!
- Oh, Rick, I'm dying.
- No!
- Don't worry.
My brother Albert will take you in.
Rick, the money, it's all yours now.
Sell all shares of a small company called Google.
It's worthless.
Invest heavily in Enron.
Rick, I have something for you.
Reach into my coat pocket.
- ( gun fires ) - ( grunts ) The other coat pocket.
( groans, grunts )
God!
That ring was my father's and his father's before him.
Earn it, Rick.
Be a hero.
Claim your-- ( choking )
--destiny.
Dad!
I'm no superhero.
I'm nobody!
Ah!
Man:
Shut up back there!
I'm gonna kill you!
- ( loud clattering ) - ( woman screams )
( glass breaking )
( gunshots )
( cat screeches )
( sighs )
- Are you okay?
- What, you heard that?
You're nothing but an ugly, ungrateful little whore!
Just like your mother!
- Who was that?
- My mother.
Listen, about what happened at school this morning, l--
You really freaked us out.
I'm really going through a tough time right now.
Me too.
My parents, they want me to go to college, but I want to be a dancer.
I believe in you.
You really do, don't you?
I wish I could say the same for Lance.
I don't know.
is he the right one or am I just dating him to rebel against my father?
- He doesn't want any boy near me.
- ( electricity crackling )
That's why he installed the electrified fence.
Well, we'll see.
You can't run from your destiny.
- Right?
- Right.
- ( car engine revs ) - ( car honks )
- Jill, let's go!
- Nice car.
Maybe one day you could take me for a ride in your car.
Uh...
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, definitely.
( chirping )
Oh.
Lovebirds.
( beeps )
( clicks )
Rick, this is Professor Xavier.
Your powers are growing, but you can't control it.
It's important that you... become a hero...
train yourself to fly... ( beeping ) ...in your ass because squatting on a glass table two girls...
one cup...
You know what to do.
- This shouldn't take long.
- Well, I'll be waiting right here.
Woman:
Hello, Mr. Bailey.
I've reviewed your request for a loan, Mr. Riker, but with no job, no credit history, I'm afraid I have to say no.
But what about this?
That was last month.
This new promotion's proving quite popular.
Look, I need to buy a car.
Frankly, Mr. Riker, you're the worst applicant we've ever had.
Thanks for the loan, Mr. Thompson.
( laughs )
This is a good boy.
There must be something I could do.
Ma'am... rubbing my crotch under the desk won't change my mind.
I'm not rubbing your crotch.
I really need that car.
I don't see how that's my problem.
- ( gunshot )
- Man:
This is a robbery!
Nobody move!
Everybody stay down!
Stay down!
- Get down.
- Man:
Come on, Lady!
Hurry it up!
- Oh.
- Come on, move it!
Oh, hey, I made the same mistake before when I came in.
Thanks.
You idiot!
You let him get away with our money!
I don't see how that's my problem.
( gunshots )
- Man:
Oh, man!
- Man #2:
Wow.
Come over here!
You've got to see this.
Let me through.
Let me through.
- ( chittering ) - ( accordion playing )
Oh, thank God. I thought something terrible had happened.
Well, an old guy did get shot over there.
- Uncle Albert!
Just try to breathe.
- ( grunting ) I can't.
You're kneeling on my balls.
- ( sirens blaring )
- Oh, sorry.
Rick, listen.
With great power comes--
Great responsibility?
I was gonna stick with bitches, but if you want to be a virgin for the rest of your life...
- ( muffled )
- Uncle Albert!
My balls!
( beeping )
Very good.
( alarm beeping )
( gasps )
Oh, God.
Mr. Landers!
( woman gasping )
Oh no.
Okay.
( grunts )
Hide the body.
Hide the body.
Yeah.
Get in!
Yah!
Yah!
Okay, I come back.
( beeping )
Jill?
I came as soon as I heard.
- Where's Aunt Lucille?
- She's at home under heavy sedation.
They made her watch three hours of women's basketball.
- This is all my fault.
- Rick, it was an armed robbery.
There was nothing you could've done.
I could've stopped that guy before he shot my uncle.
Then there is blood on your hands.
But that's not important.
All that matters is that you're here for him now.
- Rick Riker?
- Yes?
Dr. Whitby.
I've run some tests.
I'm afraid I have bad news.
- What is it?
- ( sighs ) I have an impacted colon.
Whew.
What a night.
Now what brought you here today?
- My uncle.
- Your uncle brought you?
- No, he's gravely injured.
- Well, then he shouldn't be driving.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to perform a breast exam.
Doctor, please.
is my uncle gonna survive?
Well, I don't know.
We should probably have a look.
Hard to say.
Yup, pretty deep coma.
is he gonna be okay?
Well, I'm not a betting man, but if you want to put some money on it,
- l'll take "dead in a week."
- Oh my God!
No, it's all right.
It's a normal emotional reaction, but this should take the edge off of it.
Here we go.
Nice and easy.
- That's your vein.
- Yes, I know.
- First my parents and now this?
- ( thuds ) I'm nothing but a screw-up.
Yes, your life has been a testament to that.
But your uncle believed in you and so do I.
It's never too late to become the person you're meant to be.
Man's voice:
Rick.
Man's voice:
Rick.
Rick.
Hello, Rick.
Who are you and how do you know my name?
- l'm a psychic.
- Prove it.
Think of any number between one and a million and I'll tell you what it is.
- Nine.
- Not out loud, dumbass!
( sighs ) Follow me... ( mutters ) you dumb son of a bitch.
My name is Professor Xavier, and this is my school.
I started it to help people with special talents like yours.
Our students here learn to harness their incredible talents.
and use them to advance the common good.
- Ah!
Ow.
- ( girl laughs )
Here we have children who can walk through walls.
We have children who think they can walk through walls.
- ( groans )
- Some faces may be familiar, like Wolverine.
Other mutants you probably didn't know existed, like Sneezo.
Most of our students are born with their powers.
Some, like you, gain them later in life.
- Oh, is that--
- Yes, it is.
When he came to this school, he weighed 130 lbs.
Take enough roids, you could do anything.
( yells )
- Back up off those pills, Barry!
- ( glass shatters )
( toilet flushes )
- Why have you brought me here?
- Because you have the potential
- to be the best.
- But I can't even fly.
Once you understand the true nature of heroism, you will fly.
But first I must teach you the secret to becoming a superhero.
Hey, Storm!
You look like you putting on a little weight.
- ( wind howls )
- Ah!
Oh!
So, Professor, about this secret--
- Well, you see--
- Woman:
Xavier!
- Aw, shit.
- Well?
You wanna explain why I found her hiding in your closet?
But, pumpkin, I don't see nobody.
- Oh, you don't?
- Ow!
Rick:
Invisible Girl?
Apparently not invisible enough.
If you knew how to take care of your man, maybe this wouldn't have happened.
- No, she didn't.
- Oh, this bitch is crazy.
I'm gonna have to whip your ass.
- You don't say no disrespectful--
- What are you gonna do, baldy?
I'm everywhere, sweet cheeks.
- Whoa!
- Ow!
- That all you got?
- Yeah!
Now what?
Now how about that, lnvisi-bitch?
Yeah, whatever.
I'm out of here.
I'm sure gonna miss her.
She was crazy in the sack.
Biting, scratching, panting, tongue all over the place.
Wasn't me, asshole.
- Come on, Spanky.
- ( barks ) I didn't even know she had a dog.
Still some of the best sex I ever had.
How could you do this to me?
To your kids?
To your newborn baby?
How do I know that baby's even mine?
Because he can do this.
Shit!
( thunks ) Ah!
Aw, man.
Now I'm never gonna know the secret to becoming a superhero.
You wanna know the secret?
Come close.
Make a costume, shithead!
I swear to God.
They get dumber and dumber every year.
A costume.
- ( knocks )
- Rick, you, uh...
Oh my God.
Damn!
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!
I love the mask.
How you breathe in it though?
- ( labored breathing )
- What's that sound?
You put some kind of air intake in the mask.
Boy, you better-- now I'm assuming that the material is see-through, right?
I'm impressed.
Like really impressed.
Man:
Hey, that's my spot.
You're sitting on my gargoyle.
Move it.
- Excuse me?
- What are you even doing here?
I'm looking seriously out over the city in a squatting position.
Well, that's what I do here.
So if you're not moving, I guess we're gonna have to share.
Uh, okay, fine.
I actually usually perch in the front.
Oh, all right.
Well, here, you've got to go around.
- Okay, wait.
- Just turn this way.
Here we go.
- Dude!
- You're right, I'm sorry.
Relax.
- Okay okay.
- Okay okay.
- Uh, I can't perch like this.
- God, me neither.
- What's your name?
- John Storm.
Dragonfly.
So what's your power?
What's my power?
Stand back.
- Flame on!
- Whoa!
( chuckles ) Huh?
( screaming ) I'm on fire!
Get a blanket or something!
Holy shit!
It's not working!
Get the fire extinguisher!
Ah!
No!
Ah!
God!
You idiot, stop!
What's wrong with you?
( screaming louder )
- ( thuds ) - ( car alarm blaring )
Sorry, my bad.
Xavier's voice:
Rick, once you understand the true nature of heroism, you will fly.
- ( thuds )
- Shit.
( grunting )
This Dragonfly, he's not even a hero.
He's not-- l have-- l have-- l have just a-- l have--
( chuckles )
He can't-- he can't even fly.
The Dragonfly can't even fly!
I can fly, okay?
I can fly.
This just in:
Tom Cruise is dead.
Lou:
World's most powerful man.
I have a feeling you might disagree with that.
Strom, do you have my test results?
Yes, sir.
Whatever you're doing to your... victims, rejuvenates you.
But only for 24 hours.
Hmmm.
What if I killed 28 people in one session?
Would that give me a month to live?
If it were February, yes.
But only if your cells could absorb that much energy at once, and they can't.
I'm afraid you have to kill each day to live each day.
Still a slave to the tyranny of time.
There must be some answer.
There isn't.
Unless... unless you had some cerillium.
Then you could create a device powerful enough to draw the life-force out of thousands of people and enhance your own cellular capacity.
Strom, you're a genius.
Wikipedia.
But that's not important.
What is important is that you don't have any cerillium.
Besides, it's immoral.
We don't do that sort of thing.
We're a pharmaceutical company.
Wait a minute.
Take a look.
Hawking's lab is in the physics building.
I could just walk right in.
You're going to steal cerillium?
No, not me.
I'm a law abiding citizen.
But perhaps there's someone inside me.
Someone unfettered by the rule of law.
Someone who will, at any cost, survive!
( laughs maniacally ) Ow!
Oh, glass in my eye.
Glass in my eye!
- Does it hurt?
- Uh, yeah, it hurts.
Well, if you could spread-- spread them with your fingers.
Push your lids with your fingers.
- Two-- two-- two fingers.
- Are your fingers clean?
That's it.
And roll your eyeball around.
- And push it.
- l'm rolling it!
Dig it out with another piece of glass.
Are you fricking insane?
I'll get the tweezers.
Man:
Read about the Dragonfly, world's greatest hero.
- Right here?
- Right here, yup.
Read all about it.
Man:
No, you listen to me!
I want that story on my desk or you're fired!
Who the hell are you?
I was wondering if you've got a job opening for--
Job?
!
How dare you come in here and ask me for a job?
I'm the editor in chief!
I know the mayor of Venus!
Hamburgers can see the future!
- Rosie O'Donnell--
- Sorry about this.
We share the building with a mental hospital.
Bad news, boss.
We're nowhere on those Dragonfly photos.
Damn.
Those were tomorrow's lead.
What about these?
Wow!
it's almost like you're the Dragonfly.
Uh, no no no.
See?
Look.
Now that's photography.
Just heard on the scanner, some kind of police standoff at Empire University.
We'll need photos.
Kid, I want you to--
Where'd he go?
( siren blaring )
( siren blaring )
Come on, let's go!
This is the chief of police.
We have the building surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.
( high-pitched whine )
What the hell is that?
( crowd screaming )
I am the Hourglass.
And your time is up.
Woman:
Get him, Dragonfly.
( grunts ) lt's over, Hourglass.
No, Dragonfly.
( groaning )
It's just begun!
( shouting ) lt's useless to resist.
I'll fight you to my last breath.
Like the sands of time I am unceasing and relentless.
Evil never triumphs, Hourglass.
You'll pay for your crimes and justice will-- stop!
Stop!
Stop!
- ( gurgling )
- Are you okay?
- No.
- ( retching )
Titanium blades.
They cut through diamonds.
I'm not wearing any diamonds.
Ooh, ow!
Ow!
( grunts ) I wish I could stay longer, Dragonfly.
But I just don't have the time.
( explosion )
Whoever this Dragonfly is, he's in over his head.
We don't need so-called superheroes.
What Empire City needs is more cops.
And a Hooters.
Titanium blades.
Looks like someone found your weakness.
It's not my weakness.
I'm sorry, I forgot.
Your weakness is you can't fly.
Maybe if you had a partner.
I don't need help.
I'm fine all by myself.
She means a lot to you, doesn't she?
What?
Oh, no.
I mean, she's with someone else.
Well, maybe that's for the best.
After all, it could be dangerous, you know, being the girlfriend of the Dragonfly.
I don't know what to do, Aunt Lucille.
- l love her.
- So be it.
But remember, to get to you your enemies will attack the people you care for the most.
Be careful not to hurt the ones you love.
And shave your pubes.
No one wants to go down on a tumbleweed.
Jill!
Rick?
I heard you were auditioning for a part so...
Oh, they're beautiful.
God, you are so supportive.
Why can't Lance be more like you?
There's something you're not telling me, isn't there?
Something secret.
Something locked away deep inside.
It was summer camp.
We had to share a shower.
You trip and fall with your mouth open on one guys--
No!
I mean, in here.
Well, there is...
Lucille's voice:
Keep your identity a secret, Rick.
Trey's voice:
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!
Albert's voice:
Once a month you'll bleed from you vagina.
I... nothing.
Nothing?
Well, I should go.
You're a good friend.
- Hey, check this out.
- ( whistling )
- Hey, check this out.
- ( whistling )
Oh, shit.
- Let's go.
- Get her.
( groaning )
( screaming )
Oh God, it hurts.
It hurts.
Please stop!
I'm begging you!
( groaning )
( thunder rumbles )
- ( buzzes )
- Wait!
- Where are you?
- Behind you.
You saved my life.
Do I get to thank you?
( thunder rumbling )
( siren wailing )
Go.
Be a hero.
Yeah.
Computer:
It looks like you're planning a mass murder.
Would you like help?
( mutters ) Paper clip guy.
I'm so happy that you and your boyfriend are spending Thanksgiving with us.
Of course, Lucille.
You need support at a time like this.
Yes, I miss seeing my Albert each morning.
You know, 50 years of marriage creates quite a bond.
I wish I knew love like that.
Oh, you will, dear.
You just have to follow your heart.
That's the thing.
I don't know if I can.
Oh, Jill.
If you can't trust yourself who can you trust?
I know.
But what if my heart is telling me to be with someone
- l can't be with?
- ( howling ) lt's not just any guy.
It's the-- forget it.
You'll think I'm crazy.
No, of course not.
You can tell me anything.
I'm very good at keeping secrets.
You'll think it's ridiculous, but...
- it's the Drag-- - ( doorbell rings )
- l'll get it.
- Thank you.
Hey, babe.
Oh, I forgot to tell you I kinda invited my uncle.
- Your uncle?
- What?
Set another plate.
Well, okay.
I guess.
Miss Johnson.
Please, excuse my nephew's poor manners.
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Adams, I'm Lou Landers.
I hope this isn't too much of an imposition.
Oh, of course not.
There's always room for one more.
Thank you.
It's just Thanksgiving is for family.
Lance is the only family I have.
- l never married.
- Fruitcake?
Nope, just never met the right woman.
Ah, yes, Lance told me Rick Riker was your neighbor.
Where is Rick?
- ( thumps )
- That's odd.
I thought he was out.
I'll go check on him.
Please, you're busy.
Allow me.
Thank you.
Upstairs, second door to the right.
- ( urinating ) - ( knocking )
Rick?
Hmmm.
Hmmm.
( drips )
( sprinkler thwapping )
( muttering )
( thuds )
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, Mr. Landers.
Rick.
Lucille:
No, you're just on time.
Everybody, take your seat.
Ohhh.
Ah ah ah!
Not till we say grace.
Jesus!
All:
Amen.
Please start, everyone.
This all looks so delicious, Lucille.
We have Rick to thank for it.
Ever since Albert--
Rick has been supporting me with his new job.
New job?
You didn't tell me.
Oh well, I'm sort of the Dragonfly's unofficial photographer.
What happened to your arm?
Uh... a bike messenger knocked me down.
I see your wrist is bandaged.
Yes, I burned it on some hot coffee.
And you have a cut on your lip.
Uh... my crackpipe broke.
You have a scratch on your neck.
Yes, I... met a girl on Craigslist.
And you have a bruise on your neck.
I... met a guy on Craigslist.
I'm sorry, Lance.
We have to go.
- Why?
- l... shat my pants.
( silverware clatters ) I'll drive.
( snoring )
- Thanks for helping clean up.
- Of course.
Poor thing's so tired.
Yeah, well, you know old folks after a big meal.
So... you know the Dragonfly?
Uh... yeah, I guess.
You could sorta say we're close.
Has he...
has he ever asked about me?
Um, yeah.
- Yeah, once.
- What did you tell him?
Well, I said-- l told him--
I told him, "The thing about Jill is... when you look in her eyes and she looks back in yours--
( farts )
( farts )
--you know that you'd do anything anything to be a better person than you are.
- So that-- - ( farts )
--if you were ever lucky enough to be with her, you could earn every second of her perfect--
( farting )
--grace, and her limitless beauty--
( farting )
--and her unending love.
- Don't cry.
- l'm not.
My eyes are burning.
Rick, I want you to know that was the most beautiful thing anyone's ever said to me.
( farting )
- Scented candle?
- Thank you.
- Rick, I'm so confused, and yet-- - ( farts )
--l know exactly what I want.
( farting )
( squeaks )
( groans )
Sorry to drop in uninvited.
It's okay.
We were hoping someone would open a window.
It was getting stuffy in here.
So this is the lair of the Dragonfly.
- How did you--
- No no no, I'm not here to fight you. I've got thousands of other people I plan to kill.
This little visit is just to show you who'll get hurt if you get in my way.
Never!
Time to go.
( screaming )
( farts )
The woman, Lucille Adams of East Empire City,
- was badly injured.
- Reporter:
How was she injured?
- Badly.
- What about the Dragonfly?
All I can tell you is this:
he didn't save anyone tonight.
Doctor, how is she?
I'm afraid your aunt's taken a turn for the worse.
She can't speak, she can't walk, she had no control over her bowels.
That's-- that's awful.
I know. I went ahead and set up a MySpace page for her under "crazy shit machine."
She already has 40 friends.
Wait a minute.
That's somebody else's aunt.
Your aunt has no problem with her bowels...
- Oh, thank God.
- ...because she's dead.
I'm truly sorry, Rick, but there is a silver lining.
Your uncle came out of his coma this morning.
He did?
Yes, but you mustn't tell him about your aunt just yet.
He's in a delicate mental state.
The slightest bit of bad news could send him spiraling right back into a coma.
I understand.
Mr. Adams, you have a visitor.
- ls it Lucille?
- No, sir, it's not your dead wife.
It's your nephew Rick.
( softly ) Remember, no bad news.
Now, sir, here you go.
This is my bill.
- You did surgery on me?
- Yes, sir, we confused you with one of our sex-change patients, but don't worry, we didn't remove your penis.
We did cut your testicles off, but, well, since your wife's dead, you won't be needing them anyway.
You just want to keep his spirits up.
He'll land on his feet in no time.
Priest:
We are gathered today to say goodbye
- to Lucille Adams.
- Mourners:
Goodbye!
Priest:
And now the eulogy.
Albert:
It's tragic to think this is the last time that I can look upon my wife's face.
God, Lucille!
How could you take her from me?
I can't live without her!
- Ahhh!
- ( crowd exclaims )
Lucille!
Snookie lumps!
I'm sorry, there's been a terrible mistake.
- This is your wife.
- Ah!
She is this man's wife.
Give me five minutes.
( coffin squeaking )
- Uncle Albert!
- l'm not finished.
( sniffs )
You're one lucky guy.
Now... where's Lucille?
Ah, Lucille!
( sighs )
( crowd shouting ) I do have this coupon for a cremation.
Rick?
I am so sorry for your loss.
What is it?
I know I said some things, but now more than ever, I realize... we can never be together.
I don't believe you.
( soft sobs )
You love me, Rick.
I know you do.
Jill, trust me.
I'm telling you this for your own good.
I don't love you.
You're no longer in my five.
How could you?
## When I was young ## ## l never needed anyone ##
## Makin' love was just for fun ##
## Those days are gone ##
## All by myself ##
## Don't wanna be ##
## All by myself ##
## Anymore ##
## All by myself ##
## Don't wanna be ##
## All by myself. ##
## Anymore ##
## All by myself ##
## Don't want to be ##
## All by myself ##
## Anymore ##
## All by myself. ##
( spraying )
You can't keep getting lucky, man.
You only beat me by two strokes this time.
And the back nine is what killed.
- ( glass shatters )
- Oh my God!
- Look at this place.
- Yo, what are you doing, man?
You gotta pull yourself together, dude.
What's the point?
( burbles )
Look at you-- eating junk food, wearing fake beards, and we found your costume in the garbage outside.
Yeah, well, I'm not the Dragonfly anymore.
But you said the Hourglass was going to kill thousands of people.
I told you I'm no hero.
All right?
Aunt Lucille's dead, I've rejected the only girl I've ever loved and I can't even fly.
I wish I'd never been bitten by that stupid dragonfly.
And maybe your father shouldn't have given you this after all.
Look at the words your ancestors inscribed in that ring.
"Honor, valor, sacrifice, duty, commitment, bravery, justice, integrity, brotherhood, self-esteem, low prices, affordable housing, loose-fitting pants, cheap internet porn."
The rest is in Latin.
Rick, the hero's path is dangerous.
You may fail or you may fly.
All that matters is that you do it for the best of reasons.
Helping others, Rick, that's what makes you a real hero.
Maybe you're right, but even if I wanted to stop the Hourglass, I wouldn't know where to start.
I mean, where's he gonna find thousands of people in one place?
Look.
Reporting here live from the Empire City convention center where thousands of people are in one place, but none of them more important than the attendees of the World Humanity Awards.
I'll drive.
- ( brakes squeal ) - ( grunting )
Well, that shortcut through the playground sure saved us some time.
You go ahead, I'll find a place to park.
Girl:
Mister, please stop!
Each year the World Humanity Awards are held to honor the greatest achievements on behalf of all humanity.
This gala event is expected to draw the world's most prestigious leaders to Empire City.
- Excuse us, excuse us!
- "Empire City Times."
Damn!
Look, there go Prince Charles.
And Nelson Mandela.
Nelson!
Hey, I was in jail too, man.
One of the guests here is the Hourglass.
But which one?
Thank you so much for inviting us, Mr. Landers.
Well, when you're being honored by the world, you want your family with you.
Perhaps one day, you could be part of our family too.
( snorts )
Ladies and gentlemen, our first award is for the medical breakthrough of the year.
For his company's pioneering work in the field of feminine hygiene I award Lou Landers douchebag of the year.
## Douchebag ##
## He's the douchebag of the year ##
## Now ain't he great, folks?
##
## Ain't he grand?
The douchebag of the year. ##
## Douchebag ##
## He's Mr. Douchebag of the year ##
## Look at him smile, look at him shine ##
## He's the douchebag of, the douchebag of the year. ##
Hold up the douchebag!
Hold up the douchebag, sir.
Stop right there, Landers.
Mr. Riker.
So... you know.
You're damn right I do.
Someone in this auditorium is the Hourglass.
I need your help to figure out who it is.
Now the Hourglass could be anyone-- a guest of honor... maybe even a stagehand.
This may be nothing, but I did see a man with what looked like a canister of cerillium.
Who?
- This year's lifetime achievement award...
- Him.
...goes to one of the world's greatest souls,
His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.
( gasping )
This man isn't who you think he is, he's the Hourglass.
No no, I'm a man of peace.
Shut up!
You're plotting to kill all these people and I can prove it.
Show the world the armor you're hiding under these robes.
You can't fool me, Hourglass.
You're packing 10 lbs of Cerillium under there.
- What?
- Ahh!
Take him down.
Tutu.
Peace!
Pea--
( gong clangs )
( chants )
Shit shit shit shit shit.
You!
You're the Hourglass.
It's a pity you saw that, my dear.
Perhaps this will help you forget.
( muffled groaning )
What are you doing?
Take me.
( explosion )
Hourglass!
- Hero con?
- lt's a convention for people who like to dress up as their favorite heroes and villains.
- By the way, your costume sucks.
- Hourglass:
Out of my way!
Excuse me, there is a line.
( groans )
No, you're killing him all wrong.
- lt's like this.
- ( groans )
Better.
( groaning )
Oh, shit.
Hourglass, you'll never get away with this!
Forget it, Dragonfly.
You're too late.
- ( laughs ) - ( beeping )
- Run!
- ( screaming )
( gasps )
Yeah.
( grunting )
Goodbye... little fly.
Dragonfly!
- No!
- Ahhh!
( growls )
- ( splats ) - ( grunts )
Man:
My eye!
So, are you gonna keep the body, or... ( clanging )
Eh.
Dragonfly, you must stop the Hourglass.
( sighs ) I can't.
I can't fly.
If there is one lesson my life can teach, it is that the spirit is stronger than the body.
The hero comes from within.
Those are Celine Dion lyrics.
Whatever.
It's still true.
You're right.
It's working.
- ( groans )
- Sorry.
Watch, Dragonfly, as your city dies.
Where... am I?
You're with me, your lover.
Dragonfly!
No.
- No.
- Only now do you understand.
- ( ticking )
- Oh, come--
( grunts )
Aha!
( ticking ) I need you to jerk this off.
Yeah.
There's not enough time.
Oh fuck.
( Jill screams )
- lt's over.
- Jill:
Dragonfly!
Jill!
Gotcha.
- Rick?
- You didn't think I'd let anything happen to the girl I love, did you?
Well, we're still falling.
Damn it!
If only I could fly.
Maybe I wasn't cut out to be a hero.
You know, maybe I was meant to have a normal job-- an accountant,
- a gym teacher.
- ( screams )
- This is a really tall building.
- Rick!
I don't care what happens anymore.
If I die, I die happily in your arms.
You're my hero, Rick Riker, and I love you.
Yes!
Oh, thank God!
We only have 50 stories left.
Hang on.
Thank you, Dragonfly.
Because of you, our city is safe at last.
- You said it, Dr. Hawking.
- Shit!
It's a happy ending for us all.
- ( screams )
- Let's go get some dinner. I'm buying.
Who am I?
I'm Rick Riker.
I'm the Dragonfly.
And as long as there's crime and injustice I will forever be a superhero--
( splats )
( dramatic music playing )
( dramatic music playing ) I am the Hourglass!

Stop!
Stop the bus!
The story of my life is not for the faint of heart.
Thanks. it's all about a girl.
Not that girl.
Hey.
Hi.
I don't think that is a girl.
it's about this girl.
Jill Johnson. but she barely knows I exist.
man!
I got you a seat down here.
What's.
bye.
Trey.
I'm so psyched for this class trip.
We about to see some real serious cuttingedge shit.
Mmm.
Mmhmm.
Mmm.
That's what I'm talking about.
you got any C batteries on you?
AAs?
Got that new sandwich from Sony in my backpack.
WiFi. mmm!
dawg.
Look look.
Let me show you something.
She not even looking at you.
If I could just tell her how I feel.
I already told you.
all right? man.
that crew stuff isn't real.
Rick.
man. the Scarface society.
.the sexual predators.
Yeah.
Of course you got the Rick punchers.
The who?
they new.
Mmhmm.
But you know what?
Who cares?
'Cause we got our own crew.
me and you.
man.
Am I in?
No.
baby.
The two of us against the world.
You hear me?
You look good today.
I like your hair.
I'm gonna show you something nasty I downloaded.
Don't tell nobody.
Welcome to Amalgamated.
head of the research department.
man.
.where we create the future today.
And now I'd like to show you our crown jewel.
The Amalgamated animal genetics lab.
Whoa.
explore.
check this out.
All of our animals are genetically engineered and each of them has.
you're so pretty.
birdie.
Hi.
Hi.
she is.
I'm gonna take a picture of her for the school newspaper.
Our only rules:
Don't feed the animals no flash photography.
Some of our genetically engineered animals are a little sensitive to light.
It flew away.
Uh. whoohoo.
loser?
Lance.
Leave him alone.
I don't think so.
Lance?
Uncle Lou.
Mr. Landers! visionary scientist and C.E.O. of Amalgamated.
I'm just a businessman now.
The future of science belongs to all of you.
enjoy the tour.
Are you okay?
this is healthycough blood.
are you?
I am.
Ah.
Good people.
How are they?
They died violently nine years ago.
But otherwise okay?
thank you.
I live with my aunt and uncle now.
you seem like a real chip off the old block.
Let's hope you're not violently murdered too.
That's for making me look stupid.
Next time I hurt you.
Lance.
Our work with these animals has helped us develop advanced pesticides and a powerful new pheromone which drives animals to mate called compound H2O0.
It's a strong sexual attractant.
A single drop is enough to arouse any animal.
We plan on using it to breed endangered species.
A special and indeed often overlooked.
Our mostpromising research is with these dragonflies.
this dragonfly's skin armorlike exoskeleton to defend against.
And this species of dragonfly has enormous strength for its size.
It can lift vast amounts.
More than it's body weight.
And here we've injected the DNA from all three species into seven new geneticallyenhanced super dragonflies.
But there's only six in there.
one missing dragonfly is the least of my concerns.
I lost six tigers alone last month.
Ah!
This area is where we keep our livestock.
Ohh.
Aren't you going to do something?
Soon as I get this up on YouTube.
I understand.
Thank you for the call.
That was the principal.
Rick walked off a class trip. he's still so troubled.
Albert?
Lucille.
I have taught him everything I know about being a man.
And a good man you are after all these years of marriage.
It's like we first met.
you're a little older.
Your hair's grey.
You have crow's feet.
It takes you an hour to pee.
Your thighs look like cottage cheese someone threw up on a hot sidewalk.
And you've always had a tiny penis.
Well. what does it matter when you're in love?
Rick.
We were wondering where you were.
It's so late.
About time you got home.
Your aunt was getting worried. but don't forget to feed the fish.
Attaboy.
I don't know.
Something just doesn't seem quite right with him today.
Teenagers.
I'll talk to him.
I won't lie to you.
Puberty is a difficult time in a young man's life.
Now this book may explain what's happening. and once a month you'll bleed from your vagina.
This may be the wrong book.
What's important is that you're on the verge of adulthood.
Here.
take a drink.
the rituals of manhood. and tomorrow we'll circumcise you.
Dr. Strom.
if you could just wait a few minutes.
I've waited long enough for this egomaniac.
We're the board of directors.
Our time is valuable.
Mr. Carlson.
I have a terminal illness. but the disease has ravaged my organs.
I have one hour left to live.
It was on sale. allow me to show you the future.
Strom.
From the. lift it ov.
lift it over!
What the hell is that?
An innovation.
thank you.
that will not only save my life but the life of this company.
For too long we've scraped out profits from pills and injections.
The real prize is the total cure.
A device that can alter DNA and restore the body to perfect health.
You're crazy.
No. dating Paula Abdul.
I'm not crazy.
I'm a visionary!
the machine's never been fully tested.
If something should go wrong.
sir.
Plasma level is steady.
Genetic modification's at optimum levels!
the core is overheating.
Ah!
We have to abort!
Did it work?
I'm so sorry.
well.
I want you to know what a joy it will be running this company without you in the way.
Let go.
Let me go.
I think it's time we made some personnel changes.
stay away!
Oh.
How long was I asleep?
Five days.
Huh.
Wait.
Wha.
Dad.
I thought you'd live forever.
Oh.
Rick!
I'll be right down!
Oh!
If I can have your attention.
We are delighted to have as guest judge the foremost scientist in the world.
He's a visiting professor at Empire City University where he's working with the rare element cerillium.
I am so proud to welcome Dr. Stephen Hawking.
Thank you for that warm welcome.
I have a disease that has paralyzed me.
I cannot walk and I use this computer to speak.
because I have the gift of knowledge.
That's a lie.
I think about suicide every day.
But you should all be happy with your lives.
wipe your own asses and then there's all the sex.
I haven't had sex in years.
and not the hot kind.
anyone want to get high?
I've got some hash with me.
No way. you know what I'm talking about.
Can I get a what what?
Holla.
I've got a stiff pole for your sweet hole.
Anyone?
Anyone?
Pussies.
I am such a fan.
I'd love to show you my project on supernovas.
You have an incredible ass.
.stromony career ahead of you.
where's Saturn?
I'd hate to lose my father's bowling ball.
There it is.
Great reflexes.
You have very manly hands.
So do you.
I'm gonna go find a spot for my project.
okay.
dipshit.
Pfft.
Yeah.
stupid.
Tell her how you feel.
Yow.
Any day.
Uh. he did it.
Ow!
Lance!
Lance!
Fight fight fight!
Let's see what you got.
Fucking break him!
Whoa!
Oh!
Damn!
Ooh!
Get off!
Get. get off me!
Yah!
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
Shit shit shit shit.
didn't we did you didn't didn't we did.
Stop!
Stop!
Hey!
Get out of the way!
No brakes!
Get out of the way!
look out!
Are you okay?
How did you.
I can't believe it.
You just saved that old lady's life.
Amazing. she would've die. ah!
You should be really proud of yourself.
You're some kind of hero.
If you could excuse me.
Trey.
so.
Ooh.
My God.
How did you do that?
it's easier than it looks.
I don't think so.
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
okay?
But you have to keep it a secret.
I think I have.
superpowers.
I find that hard to believe.
how about this?
Go ahead and throw as many punches as you want.
I bet you 100 bucks you don't land one.
Easy money.
What else can you do?
I don't know.
I.
I was bitten by a dragonfly.
some dragonflies have armored skin.
I wonder if my skin is.
good thing that worked.
So you do have superpowers.
We could be a team!
money.
Don't forget the bitches.
There's not gonna be fame okay?
I didn't ask for any of this.
I just wanna be like everybody else.
That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
You're not my father.
But I love you like your father did.
I believe in you like your father did.
I had sex with your mother just like your father did.
Huh.
You'll never understand me.
Never.
That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
What a great performance.
did you enjoy the opera?
is something troubling you?
It's so unfair.
They have nothing.
Why do we have $2 billion?
your grandfather left us $3 billion and I made some bad investments.
But that's nothing for you to worry about.
But I want to change things.
And you will.
Five generations of Rikers have worked hard to make this city great.
people will look to you to be a hero.
will you be ready?
Give me your wallet.
That too.
People will look to you to be a hero.
will you be ready?
Rick!
Ah!
Ow!
Huh?
Ah!
please!
Ah!
I'm dying.
No!
Don't worry.
My brother Albert will take you in.
it's all yours now.
Sell all shares of a small company called Google.
It's worthless.
Invest heavily in Enron.
I have something for you.
Reach into my coat pocket.
The other coat pocket.
God!
That ring was my father's and his father's before him.
Rick.
Be a hero.
Claim your.
destiny.
Dad!
I'm no superhero.
I'm nobody!
Ah!
Shut up back there!
I'm gonna kill you!
you heard that?
ungrateful little whore!
Just like your mother!
Who was that?
My mother.
I.
You really freaked us out.
I'm really going through a tough time right now. but I want to be a dancer.
I believe in you.
don't you?
I wish I could say the same for Lance.
I don't know.
Is he the right one or am I just dating him to rebel against my father?
He doesn't want any boy near me.
That's why he installed the electrified fence.
we'll see.
You can't run from your destiny.
Right?
Right.
let's go!
Nice car.
Maybe one day you could take me for a ride in your car.
Uh.
yeah.
definitely.
Oh.
Lovebirds.
this is Professor Xavier.
but you can't control it.
It's important that you.
become a hero.
train yourself to fly.
.in your ass because.
.squatting on a glass table.
.two girls.
one cup.
You know what to do.
I'll be waiting right here.
Mr. Bailey.
I'm afraid I have to say no.
But what about this?
That was last month.
This new promotion's proving quite popular.
I need to buy a car.
you're the worst applicant we've ever had.
Mr. Thompson.
This is a good boy.
There must be something I could do.
Ma'am.
rubbing my crotch under the desk won't change my mind.
I'm not rubbing your crotch.
I really need that car.
I don't see how that's my problem.
This is a robbery!
Nobody move!
Everybody stay down!
Stay down!
Lady!
Hurry it up!
move it!
I made the same mistake before when I came in.
Thanks.
You idiot!
You let him get away with our money!
I don't see how that's my problem.
man!
Wow.
Come over here!
You've got to see this.
Let me through.
Let me through.
thank God.
I thought something terrible had happened.
an old guy did get shot over there.
Uncle Albert!
Just try to breathe.
I can't.
You're kneeling on my balls.
sorry.
listen.
With great power comes.
Great responsibility? but if you want to be a virgin for the rest of your life.
Uncle Albert!
My balls!
Very good.
God.
Mr. Landers!
Oh no.
Okay.
Hide the body.
Hide the body.
Yeah.
Get in!
Yah!
Yah!
I come back.
Jill?
I came as soon as I heard.
Where's Aunt Lucille?
She's at home under heavy sedation.
They made her watch three hours of women's basketball.
it was an armed robbery.
There was nothing you could've done.
I could've stopped that guy before he shot my uncle.
Then there is blood on your hands.
But that's not important.
All that matters is that you're here for him now.
Rick Riker?
Yes?
Dr. Whitby.
I've run some tests.
I'm afraid I have bad news.
What is it?
I have an impacted colon.
Whew.
What a night.
Now what brought you here today?
My uncle.
Your uncle brought you?
then he shouldn't be driving.
I have to perform a breast exam.
please.
Is my uncle gonna survive?
I don't know.
We should probably have a look.
Hard to say.
pretty deep coma.
Is he gonna be okay? I'll take "dead in a week." Oh my God! but this should take the edge off of it.
Here we go.
Nice and easy.
I know.
First my parents and now this?
I'm nothing but a screwup.
your life has been a testament to that.
But your uncle believed in you and so do I.
It's never too late to become the person you're meant to be.
Rick.
Rick.
Rick.
Rick.
Who are you and how do you know my name?
I'm a psychic.
Prove it.
Think of any number between one and a million and I'll tell you what it is.
dumbass!
Follow me.
you dumb son of a bitch. and this is my school.
I started it to help people with special talents like yours.
Our students here learn to harness their incredible talents.
and use them to advance the common good.
Ah!
Ow.
Here we have children who can walk through walls.
We have children who think they can walk through walls. like Wolverine. like Sneezo.
Most of our students are born with their powers.
gain them later in life.
it is. he weighed 130 lbs.
you could do anything.
Barry!
Why have you brought me here?
Because you have the potential to be the best.
But I can't even fly. you will fly.
But first I must teach you the secret to becoming a superhero.
Storm!
You look like you putting on a little weight.
Ah!
Oh!
about this secret.
you see.
Xavier!
shit.
Well?
You wanna explain why I found her hiding in your closet?
I don't see nobody.
you don't?
Ow!
Invisible Girl?
Apparently not invisible enough.
maybe this wouldn't have happened.
this bitch is crazy.
I'm gonna have to whip your ass.
baldy?
sweet cheeks.
Whoa!
Ow!
That all you got?
Yeah!
Invisibitch?
whatever.
I'm out of here.
I'm sure gonna miss her.
She was crazy in the sack.
tongue all over the place.
asshole.
Spanky.
I didn't even know she had a dog.
Still some of the best sex I ever had.
How could you do this to me?
To your kids?
To your newborn baby?
How do I know that baby's even mine?
Because he can do this.
Shit!
Ah!
man.
Now I'm never gonna know the secret to becoming a superhero.
You wanna know the secret?
Come close.
shithead!
I swear to God.
They get dumber and dumber every year.
A costume.
uh.
Oh my God.
Damn!
man!
I love the mask.
How you breathe in it though?
What's that sound?
You put some kind of air intake in the mask.
you better.
now I'm assuming right?
this is good.
I'm impressed.
Like really impressed.
that's my spot.
You're sitting on my gargoyle.
Move it.
Excuse me?
What are you even doing here?
I'm looking seriously out over the city in a squatting position.
I guess we're gonna have to share.
fine.
I actually usually perch in the front.
you've got to go around.
wait.
Just turn this way.
Here we go.
I'm sorry.
Relax.
Okay okay.
Okay okay.
me neither.
What's your name?
John Storm.
Dragonfly.
So what's your power?
What's my power?
Stand back.
Flame on!
Whoa!
Huh?
I'm on fire!
Get a blanket or something!
Holy shit!
It's not working!
Get the fire extinguisher!
Ah!
No!
Ah!
stop!
What's wrong with you?
my bad. you will fly.
Shit.
he's not even a hero.
He's not.
I have.
I have.
I have just a.
I have.
He can't.
he can't even fly.
The Dragonfly can't even fly!
okay?
I can fly.
This just in:
Tom Cruise is dead.
World's most powerful man.
I have a feeling you might disagree with that.
do you have my test results?
sir. rejuvenates you.
But only for 24 hours.
Hmmm.
What if I killed 28 people in one session?
Would that give me a month to live?
yes.
But only if your cells could absorb and they can't.
I'm afraid you have to kill each day to live each day.
Still a slave to the tyranny of time.
There must be some answer.
There isn't.
Unless.
unless you had some cerillium.
Then you could create a device powerful enough to draw the lifeforce out of thousands of people and enhance your own cellular capacity.
you're a genius.
Wikipedia.
But that's not important.
What is important is that you don't have any cerillium.
it's immoral.
We don't do that sort of thing.
We're a pharmaceutical company.
Wait a minute.
Take a look.
Hawking's lab is in the physics building.
I could just walk right in.
You're going to steal cerillium?
not me.
I'm a law abiding citizen.
But perhaps there's someone inside me.
Someone unfettered by the rule of law.
survive!
Ow!
glass in my eye.
Glass in my eye!
it hurts.
if you could spread.
spread them with your fingers.
Push your lids with your fingers.
Two. two. two fingers.
Are your fingers clean?
That's it.
And roll your eyeball around.
And push it.
I'm rolling it!
Dig it out with another piece of glass.
Are you fricking insane?
I'll get the tweezers.
world's greatest hero.
yup.
Read all about it.
you listen to me!
I want that story on my desk or you're fired!
Who the hell are you?
I was wondering if you've got a job opening for.
Job?
!
How dare you come in here and ask me for a job?
I'm the editor in chief!
I know the mayor of Venus!
Hamburgers can see the future!
Rosie O'Donnell.
Sorry about this.
We share the building with a mental hospital.
boss.
We're nowhere on those Dragonfly photos.
Damn.
Those were tomorrow's lead.
What about these?
Wow!
it's almost like you're the Dragonfly.
no no no.
See?
Look.
Now that's photography.
some kind of police standoff at Empire University.
I want you to.
Where'd he go?
let's go!
This is the chief of police.
We have the building surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.
What the hell is that?
I am the Hourglass.
And your time is up.
Dragonfly.
Hourglass.
Dragonfly.
It's just begun!
It's useless to resist.
I'll fight you to my last breath.
Like the sands of time I am unceasing and relentless.
Hourglass.
You'll pay for your crimes and justice will.
stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Are you okay?
No.
Titanium blades.
They cut through diamonds.
I'm not wearing any diamonds.
ow!
Ow!
Dragonfly.
But I just don't have the time.
he's in over his head.
We don't need socalled superheroes.
What Empire City needs is more cops.
And a Hooters.
Titanium blades.
Looks like someone found your weakness.
It's not my weakness.
I forgot.
Your weakness is you can't fly.
Maybe if you had a partner.
I don't need help.
I'm fine all by myself.
doesn't she?
no.
she's with someone else.
maybe that's for the best. being the girlfriend of the Dragonfly.
Aunt Lucille.
I love her.
So be it.
to get to you your enemies will attack the people you care for the most.
Be careful not to hurt the ones you love.
And shave your pubes.
No one wants to go down on a tumbleweed.
Jill!
Rick?
I heard you were auditioning for a part so.
they're beautiful.
you are so supportive.
Why can't Lance be more like you?
isn't there?
Something secret.
Something locked away deep inside.
It was summer camp.
We had to share a shower.
You trip and fall with your mouth open on one guys.
No!
in here.
there is.
Rick.
man!
Once a month you'll bleed from you vagina.
I.
nothing.
Nothing?
I should go.
You're a good friend.
check this out.
check this out.
shit.
Let's go.
Get her.
it hurts.
It hurts.
Please stop!
I'm begging you!
Wait!
Where are you?
Behind you.
You saved my life.
Do I get to thank you?
Go.
Be a hero.
Yeah.
It looks like you're planning a mass murder.
Would you like help?
Paper clip guy.
I'm so happy that you and your boyfriend are spending Thanksgiving with us.
Lucille.
You need support at a time like this.
I miss seeing my Albert each morning.
50 years of marriage creates quite a bond.
I wish I knew love like that.
dear.
You just have to follow your heart.
That's the thing.
I don't know if I can.
Jill.
If you can't trust yourself who can you trust?
I know.
But what if my heart is telling me to be with someone
I can't be with?
It's not just any guy.
It's the.
forget it.
You'll think I'm crazy.
of course not.
You can tell me anything.
I'm very good at keeping secrets.
but.
it's the Drag.
I'll get it.
Thank you.
babe.
I forgot to tell you I kinda invited my uncle.
Your uncle?
What?
Set another plate.
okay.
I guess.
excuse my nephew's poor manners.
I'm Lou Landers.
I hope this isn't too much of an imposition.
of course not.
There's always room for one more.
Thank you.
It's just Thanksgiving is for family.
Lance is the only family I have.
I never married.
Fruitcake?
just never met the right woman.
Lance told me Rick Riker was your neighbor.
Where is Rick?
That's odd.
I thought he was out.
I'll go check on him.
you're busy.
Allow me.
second door to the right.
Rick?
Hmmm.
Hmmm.
Sorry I'm late.
Mr. Landers.
Rick.
you're just on time.
take your seat.
Ohhh.
Ah ah ah!
Not till we say grace.
Jesus!
Amen.
everyone.
Lucille.
We have Rick to thank for it.
Ever since Albert.
Rick has been supporting me with his new job.
New job?
You didn't tell me.
I'm sort of the Dragonfly's unofficial photographer.
What happened to your arm?
Uh.
a bike messenger knocked me down.
I see your wrist is bandaged.
I burned it on some hot coffee.
And you have a cut on your lip.
Uh.
my crackpipe broke.
You have a scratch on your neck.
I.
met a girl on Craigslist.
And you have a bruise on your neck.
I.
met a guy on Craigslist.
Lance.
We have to go.
Why?
I.
shat my pants.
I'll drive.
Thanks for helping clean up.
Of course.
Poor thing's so tired.
you know old folks after a big meal.
So. you know the Dragonfly?
Uh.
I guess.
You could sorta say we're close.
Has he.
has he ever asked about me?
yeah.
once.
What did you tell him?
I said.
I told him.
The thing about Jill is.
when you look in her eyes and she looks back in yours.
you know that you'd do anything anything to be a better person than you are.
So that. you could earn every second of her perfect.
and her limitless beauty.
and her unending love.
Don't cry.
I'm not.
My eyes are burning.
I want you to know that was the most beautiful thing anyone's ever said to me.
Scented candle?
Thank you.
and yet.
I know exactly what I want.
Sorry to drop in uninvited.
It's okay.
We were hoping someone would open a window.
It was getting stuffy in here.
So this is the lair of the Dragonfly.
I'm not here to fight you.
I've got thousands of other people I plan to kill.
This little visit is just to show you who'll get hurt if you get in my way.
Never!
Time to go. was badly injured.
How was she injured?
Badly.
What about the Dragonfly?
All I can tell you is this:
he didn't save anyone tonight.
how is she?
I'm afraid your aunt's taken a turn for the worse.
she had no control over her bowels.
That's. that's awful.
I know.
I went ahead and set up a MySpace page for her under "crazy shit machine.
She already has 40 friends.
Wait a minute.
That's somebody else's aunt.
Your aunt has no problem with her bowels.
thank God.
.because she's dead.
but there is a silver lining.
Your uncle came out of his coma this morning.
He did?
but you mustn't tell him about your aunt just yet.
He's in a delicate mental state.
The slightest bit of bad news could send him spiraling right back into a coma.
I understand.
you have a visitor.
it's not your dead wife.
It's your nephew Rick.
no bad news.
here you go.
This is my bill.
we confused you we didn't remove your penis. you won't be needing them anyway.
You just want to keep his spirits up.
He'll land on his feet in no time.
We are gathered today to say goodbye to Lucille Adams.
Goodbye!
And now the eulogy.
It's tragic to think this is the last time that I can look upon my wife's face.
Lucille!
How could you take her from me?
I can't live without her!
Ahhh!
Lucille!
Snookie lumps!
there's been a terrible mistake.
This is your wife.
Ah!
She is this man's wife.
Give me five minutes.
Uncle Albert!
I'm not finished.
You're one lucky guy.
Now.
where's Lucille?
Lucille!
I do have this coupon for a cremation.
Rick?
I am so sorry for your loss.
What is it? I realize.
we can never be together.
I don't believe you.
Rick.
I know you do.
trust me.
I'm telling you this for your own good.
I don't love you.
You're no longer in my five.
How could you?
When I was young
I never needed anyone
Makin' love was just for fun
Those days are gone
All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself.
Anymore
All by myself
Don't want to be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself.
man.
You only beat me by two strokes this time.
And the back nine is what killed.
Oh my God!
man?
dude.
What's the point? and we found your costume in the garbage outside.
I'm not the Dragonfly anymore.
But you said the Hourglass was going to kill thousands of people.
I've rejected the only girl I've ever loved and I can't even fly.
I wish I'd never been bitten by that stupid dragonfly.
And maybe your father shouldn't have given you this after all.
Look at the words your ancestors inscribed in that ring. cheap internet porn.
The rest is in Latin.
the hero's path is dangerous.
You may fail or you may fly.
All that matters is that you do it for the best of reasons. that's what makes you a real hero.
I wouldn't know where to start.
where's he gonna find thousands of people in one place?
Look.
Reporting here live from the Empire City convention center but none of them more important than the attendees of the World Humanity Awards.
I'll drive.
that shortcut through the playground sure saved us some time.
I'll find a place to park.
please stop!
Each year the World Humanity Awards are held to honor the greatest achievements on behalf of all humanity.
This gala event is expected to draw the world's most prestigious leaders to Empire City.
excuse us!
"Empire City Times.
there go Prince Charles.
And Nelson Mandela.
Nelson!
man.
One of the guests here is the Hourglass.
But which one?
Mr. Landers. you want your family with you.
you could be part of our family too.
our first award is for the medical breakthrough of the year.
For his company's pioneering work in the field of feminine hygiene
I award Lou Landers douchebag of the year.
Douchebag
He's the douchebag of the year folks?
Ain't he grand?
The douchebag of the year.
Douchebag
He's Mr. Douchebag of the year look at him shine the douchebag of the year.
sir.
Landers.
Mr. Riker.
So.
you know.
You're damn right I do.
Someone in this auditorium is the Hourglass.
I need your help to figure out who it is.
Now the Hourglass could be anyone.
a guest of honor.
maybe even a stagehand.
but I did see a man with what looked like a canister of cerillium.
Who?
This year's lifetime achievement award.
Him. the Dalai Lama.
he's the Hourglass.
I'm a man of peace.
Shut up!
You're plotting to kill all these people and I can prove it.
Show the world the armor you're hiding under these robes.
Hourglass.
You're packing 10 lbs of Cerillium under there.
What?
Ahh!
Take him down.
Tutu.
Peace!
Pea.
Shit shit shit shit shit.
You!
You're the Hourglass.
my dear.
Perhaps this will help you forget.
What are you doing?
Take me.
Hourglass!
Hero con?
It's a convention for people who like to dress up as their favorite heroes and villains.
your costume sucks.
Out of my way!
there is a line.
you're killing him all wrong.
It's like this.
Better.
shit.
you'll never get away with this!
Dragonfly.
You're too late.
Run!
Yeah.
Goodbye.
little fly.
Dragonfly!
No!
Ahhh!
My eye!
or.
Eh.
you must stop the Hourglass.
I can't.
I can't fly. it is that the spirit is stronger than the body.
The hero comes from within.
Those are Celine Dion lyrics.
Whatever.
It's still true.
You're right.
It's working.
Sorry. as your city dies.
Where. am I? your lover.
Dragonfly!
No.
No.
Only now do you understand.
come.
Aha!
I need you to jerk this off.
Yeah.
There's not enough time.
Oh fuck.
It's over.
Dragonfly!
Jill!
Gotcha.
Rick?
You didn't think I'd let anything happen did you?
we're still falling.
Damn it!
If only I could fly.
Maybe I wasn't cut out to be a hero. a gym teacher.
This is a really tall building.
Rick!
I don't care what happens anymore.
I die happily in your arms.
and I love you.
thank God!
We only have 50 stories left.
Hang on.
Dragonfly.
our city is safe at last.
Dr. Hawking.
Shit!
It's a happy ending for us all.
Let's go get some dinner.
I'm buying.
Who am I?
I'm Rick Riker.
I'm the Dragonfly.
And as long as there's crime and injustice
I will forever be a superhero.
I am the Hourglass!
evil surrounds you we're almost out of time
What do you do when nothing can be done?
Where do you go with nowhere left to run?
Where is the one who stands up and tells you
I'm here to save you?
We're almost out of time
Nobody knows just who he's trying to be his wings and suit of green
Just in time to reach up for the sky
And fly away
Don't worry you're safe 'cause it takes your love it's safe to say
Jill and I were always meant to be
So I will show you why I'm here to stay
Don't they know that I'll protect you?
Don't they know they'll have to get through
Me
Don't worry yourself.
Your time is up!
Watch out behind you
This is designed to
Quickly remind you
We're almost out of time
Somebody tell me what he's trying to be his suit of green
Just in time to reach up for the sky
And fly away
Don't worry you're safe 'cause it takes your love it's safe to say
Jill and I were always meant to be
So I will show you why I'm here to stay
I'm the one
Who let's them know that I'll protect you
Don't they know they'll have to get through me?
Don't worry you're safe.
In my arms so green
It's easy.
I need a hero
I need a hero
I want you here
This is my 011
I'm sinking down into the fear
That I just can't outrun
To save myself all I can see
Is that I've got no choice
I cry for help and pray you'll be
The one who hears my voice
I need a hero
Someone to rescue me when I'm in a mess someone to be my safety net
I need a hero watching over me
I need a hero in my time of need
To fix it when it's going wrong you know that I need a hero
Waited my whole life
For someone like you
And I think it's time
For my dreams to come true
If only you could hear me
I know you'd be near me
You'll never let me go
I need a hero
I need a hero
Someone to rescue me when I'm in a mess someone to be my safety net
I need a hero watching over me
I need a hero in my time of need
To fix it when it's going wrong you know that I need a hero.
(dramatic music playing)
Stop!
Stop the bus!
(tires screech)
Boy's voice:
The story of my life is not for the faint of heart.
Thanks.
But, like any story worth telling, it's all about a girl.
Not that girl.
- Hey.
Hi.
- I don't think that is a girl.
No, it's about this girl...
Jill Johnson.
Ever since I can remember I've been in love with her, but she barely knows I exist.
Yo, Rick!
Yo, come here, man!
I got you a seat down here.
What's...
I'll call y'all back.
Everybody, bye.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, Trey.
Dude, I'm so psyched for this class trip.
We about to see some real serious cutting-edge shit.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yo, you got any C batteries on you?
AAs?
Got that new sandwich from Sony in my backpack.
Wi-Fi... mmm!
Yo!
You got to forget about her, dawg.
Look look.
Let me show you something.
She not even looking at you.
If I could just tell her how I feel.
- Look, Rick, I already told you...
- (humming) you never gonna get with Jill, all right?
Seriously, she hangs out with the popular crew, and nobody messes around outside their group, man.
Come on, that crew stuff isn't real.
The hell it ain't.
Look around, Rick.
- Look, you got your jocks...
- Get the ball, man.
...nerds, emos,
Frodos,
- the Scarface society...
- (gun clicks) ...the sexual predators.
- (mutters) Yeah.
- Of course you got the Rick punchers.
- The who?
- Oh!
- Yeah, they new.
Mm-hmm.
But you know what?
Who cares?
'Cause we got our own crew...
me and you.
Thanks, Trey.
You're the best, man.
- Am I in?
- Man:
No.
Come on.
Hey, it's me and you, baby.
The two of us against the world.
You hear me?
You look good today.
I like your hair.
I'm gonna show you something nasty I downloaded.
- Don't tell nobody.
- (sheep bleats)
Man:
Welcome to Amalgamated.
I'm Dr. Strom, head of the research department...
- Come on, man.
...where we create the future today.
And now I'd like to show you our crown jewel.
The Amalgamated animal genetics lab.
- (animals chittering)
- Whoa.
Go ahead, explore.
Yo yo.
Come on, Rick.
Man, check this out.
Strom:
All of our animals are genetically engineered and each of them has...
Oh, you're so pretty.
Hi, birdie.
(giggles)
Hi.
Hi.
- She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Yes, she is.
Uh, I'm gonna take a picture of her for the school newspaper.
Strom:
Our only rules:
Don't feed the animals and please, no flash photography.
Some of our genetically- engineered animals are a little sensitive to light.
It flew away.
Uh... whoo-hoo.
What the F, loser?
- Boy:
Get him, Lance.
- Come on, Lance.
- Leave him alone.
- I don't think so.
Is there a problem, Lance?
No.
No problem, Uncle Lou.
Mr. Landers!
Students, this is Lou Landers, visionary scientist and C.E.O. of Amalgamated.
Well, I'm just a businessman now.
The future of science belongs to all of you.
- Please, enjoy the tour.
- (kids chatting)
(coughs)
Are you okay?
Yes, this is healthy-cough blood.
Rick Riker.
You're not Blaine and Julia Riker's son, are you?
- I am.
- Ah.
Good people.
- How are they?
- They died violently nine years ago.
But otherwise okay?
Yes, thank you.
I live with my aunt and uncle now.
Well, you seem like a real chip off the old block.
Let's hope you're not violently murdered too.
- (boys laughing)
- Lance:
That's for making me look stupid.
Next time I hurt you.
Yeah.
You the man, Lance.
Strom:
Our work with these animals has helped us develop new antibiotics, advanced pesticides and a powerful new pheromone which drives animals to mate called compound H2O0.
It's a strong sexual attractant.
A single drop is enough to arouse any animal.
We plan on using it to breed endangered species.
A special and indeed often overlooked...
- (rabbit shrieks)
- Our most-promising research is with these dragonflies.
For example, this dragonfly's skin has a hard, armor-like exoskeleton to defend against...
And this species of dragonfly has enormous strength for its size.
It can lift vast amounts.
- More than it's body weight.
- (monkey chatters)
And here we've injected the DNA from all three species into seven new genetically-enhanced super dragonflies.
But there's only six in there.
Well, one missing dragonfly is the least of my concerns.
I lost six tigers alone last month.
- (crunches)
- Ah!
Strom:
This area is where we keep our livestock.
- Ohh.
- (grunting)
Aren't you going to do something?
Soon as I get this up on YouTube.
I see.
Ye... well, yes, I understand.
Thank you for the call.
That was the principal.
Rick walked off a class trip.
After all the parenting you've done, he's still so troubled.
Why do you think that is, Albert?
I have no idea, Lucille.
I have taught him everything I know about being a man.
And a good man you are after all these years of marriage.
It's like we first met.
Sure, you're a little older.
Your hair's grey.
You have crow's feet.
It takes you an hour to pee.
Your thighs look like cottage cheese someone threw up on a hot sidewalk.
And you've always had a tiny penis.
Well... what does it matter when you're in love?
- (groaning)
- Oh, Rick.
We were wondering where you were.
It's so late.
About time you got home.
Your aunt was getting worried.
You can sleep late in the morning, but don't forget to feed the fish.
Attaboy.
(phone clatters)
I don't know.
Something just doesn't seem quite right with him today.
Teenagers.
I'll talk to him.
(knocks)
Rough day, huh?
Well, I won't lie to you.
Puberty is a difficult time in a young man's life.
Now this book may explain what's happening.
Let's see.
There are mood swings, fluid retention, and once a month you'll bleed from your vagina.
This may be the wrong book.
What's important is that you're on the verge of adulthood.
Here...
take a drink.
Ah, the rituals of manhood.
Today you have your first beer, and tomorrow we'll circumcise you.
(thunder booming)
I'm losing patience, Dr. Strom.
Please, sir, if you could just wait a few minutes...
I've waited long enough for this egomaniac.
We're the board of directors.
Our time is valuable.
Not as valuable as mine, Mr. Carlson.
You see, I have a terminal illness.
I've been fighting it for years, but the disease has ravaged my organs.
As of this moment, I have one hour left to live.
It was on sale.
Lou:
Gentlemen, if you're ready, allow me to show you the future.
Strom.
From the...
lift it ov...
lift it over!
What the hell is that?
An innovation...
thank you... that will not only save my life but the life of this company.
For too long we've scraped out profits from pills and injections.
The real prize is the total cure.
A device that can alter DNA and restore the body to perfect health.
- You're crazy.
- (Lou chuckles) No.
Crazy is hearing voices, talking to cats, dating Paula Abdul.
I'm not crazy.
I'm a visionary!
Sir.
Sir, the machine's never been fully tested.
If something should go wrong...
- Start the machine!
- Yes, sir.
- (beeps, whirrs) - (grunts)
Plasma level is steady.
Genetic modification's at optimum levels!
- (beeps)
- Sir, the core is overheating.
- Ah!
- Strom:
We have to abort!
(whirrs down)
- (computer beeping)
- Did it work?
- (men whispering)
- I'm so sorry.
Well, well, well.
I want you to know what a joy it will be running this company without you in the way.
Let go.
Let me go.
(Carlson screaming)
Gentlemen, I think it's time we made some personnel changes.
- (men screaming)
- Man:
No, stay away!
(hitch-pitched screaming)
(birds chirping)
(birds chirping)
Oh.
How long was I asleep?
Five days.
(grunts, farts)
Huh.
(beeping)
(buzzes)
(beeping)
Wait.
Wha...
Oh, Dad.
I thought you'd live forever.
Oh.
Lucille:
Breakfast, Rick!
I'll be right down!
Oh!
(bell rings)
(bell rings)
Woman:
If I can have your attention.
We are delighted to have as guest judge the foremost scientist in the world.
He's a visiting professor at Empire City University where he's working with the rare element cerillium.
I am so proud to welcome Dr. Stephen Hawking.
Computer:
Thank you for that warm welcome.
I have a disease that has paralyzed me.
I cannot walk and I use this computer to speak.
But I am not depressed, because I have the gift of knowledge.
That's a lie.
I think about suicide every day.
But you should all be happy with your lives.
You can walk, talk, wipe your own asses and then there's all the sex.
- (murmuring loudly)
- I haven't had sex in years.
My nurse is a lesbian, and not the hot kind.
Hey, anyone want to get high?
- I've got some hash with me.
- Girl:
No way.
White guy in the dreads, you know what I'm talking about.
Can I get a what what?
Holla.
I've got a stiff pole for your sweet hole.
Anyone?
Anyone?
Pussies.
Dr. Hawking, I am such a fan.
I'd love to show you my project on supernovas.
You have an incredible ass stromony career ahead of you.
Wait, where's Saturn?
I'd hate to lose my father's bowling ball.
There it is.
Great reflexes.
You have very manly hands.
So do you.
I'm gonna go find a spot for my project.
Yeah, okay.
Watch where you're going in slo-mo, dipshit.
- Pfft.
- Yeah.
(whispers) Go to her, stupid.
Tell her how you feel.
(rips)
Yow.
Boy:
Any day.
Uh... he did it.
- (thunks)
- Man:
Ow!
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Boy #2:
Get him, Lance!
- Lance, stop it.
- Boy #3:
Kick his ass, Lance!
Fight fight fight!
- Let's see what you got.
- Fucking break him!
Boy #4:
Whoa!
Crowd:
Oh!
Damn!
Ooh!
Get off!
Get... get off me!
Yah!
(bees buzzing)
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
Shit shit shit shit.
(siren blaring in distance)
(dramatic music playing)
- (hip-hop music playing) - # Oh no, you didn't, didn't #
- # Oh no, you didn't # - # Oh yes, we did #
# Oh no, you didn't, didn't, Oh no, you didn't #
- # Oh yeah, we did # - # Oh no, you didn't, didn't #
- # Oh no, you didn't # - # Oh yes, we did. #
- (meows) - (truck horn blaring)
Stop!
Stop!
Hey!
Get out of the way!
No brakes!
Get out of the way!
- (screaming)
- Ma'am, look out!
Woman:
Are you okay?
(moans)
- How did you...
- I can't believe it.
- You just saved that old lady's life.
- Amazing.
I...
I guess.
If I hadn't pushed her out of the way, she would've die... ah!
- (grinding) - (whining)
- You should be really proud of yourself.
- (dog barks)
- (dog whines)
- You're some kind of hero.
If you could excuse me.
(rapid footsteps fading)
(high-pitched hisses)
(high-pitched hisses)
There we go.
Awfully nice of you to help me out here, Trey.
Oh, no problem.
I'm waiting on Rick, anyway, so...
- (high-pitched hiss)
- Ooh.
My God.
How did you do that?
Uh, it's easier than it looks.
- (high-pitched hiss) - (screaming)
No, I don't think so.
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
All right.
Well, there is something, okay?
But you have to keep it a secret.
(nail clanks)
I think I have...
superpowers.
I find that hard to believe.
All right, all right, how about this?
Go ahead and throw as many punches as you want.
I bet you 100 bucks you don't land one.
- Albert:
Easy money.
- (dollars rustle)
What else can you do?
I don't know.
I...
I was bitten by a dragonfly.
Well, some dragonflies have armored skin.
- I wonder if my skin is...
- (yells)
Well, good thing that worked.
So you do have superpowers.
We could be a team!
We gonna get fame, money...
- Don't forget the bitches.
- There's not gonna be fame and there's not gonna be bitches, okay?
I didn't ask for any of this.
I just wanna be like everybody else.
That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
You're not my father.
But I love you like your father did.
I believe in you like your father did.
I had sex with your mother just like your father did.
Huh.
You'll never understand me.
- Never.
- (door slams)
(Albert's voice echoing) That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
What a great performance.
Well, Rick, did you enjoy the opera?
(bottles rattling)
Son, is something troubling you?
It's so unfair.
They have nothing.
Why do we have $2 billion?
Well, your grandfather left us $3 billion and I made some bad investments.
But that's nothing for you to worry about.
But I want to change things.
And you will.
Five generations of Rikers have worked hard to make this city great.
One day, Rick, people will look to you to be a hero.
When that day comes, will you be ready?
Give me your wallet.
That too.
Blaine's voice:
People will look to you to be a hero.
When that day comes, will you be ready?
Rick!
Ah!
- (bullet ricochets)
- Ow!
Huh?
Ah!
Rick, please!
Ah!
- Dad!
- Oh, Rick, I'm dying.
- No!
- Don't worry.
My brother Albert will take you in.
Rick, the money, it's all yours now.
Sell all shares of a small company called Google.
It's worthless.
Invest heavily in Enron.
Rick, I have something for you.
Reach into my coat pocket.
- (gun fires) - (grunts) The other coat pocket.
(groans, grunts)
God!
That ring was my father's and his father's before him.
Earn it, Rick.
Be a hero.
Claim your...
(choking)
- destiny.
Dad!
I'm no superhero.
I'm nobody!
Ah!
Man:
Shut up back there!
I'm gonna kill you!
- (loud clattering) - (woman screams)
(glass breaking)
(gunshots)
(cat screeches)
(sighs)
- Are you okay?
- What, you heard that?
You're nothing but an ugly, ungrateful little whore!
Just like your mother!
- Who was that?
- My mother.
Listen, about what happened at school this morning, I...
You really freaked us out.
I'm really going through a tough time right now.
Me too.
My parents, they want me to go to college, but I want to be a dancer.
I believe in you.
You really do, don't you?
I wish I could say the same for Lance.
I don't know.
Is he the right one or am I just dating him to rebel against my father?
- He doesn't want any boy near me.
- (electricity crackling)
That's why he installed the electrified fence.
Well, we'll see.
You can't run from your destiny.
- Right?
- Right.
- (car engine revs) - (car honks)
- Jill, let's go!
- Nice car.
Maybe one day you could take me for a ride in your car.
Uh...
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, definitely.
(chirping)
Oh.
Lovebirds.
(beeps)
(clicks)
Rick, this is Professor Xavier.
Your powers are growing, but you can't control it.
It's important that you... become a hero...
train yourself to fly... (beeping) ...in your ass because squatting on a glass table two girls...
one cup...
You know what to do.
- This shouldn't take long.
- Well, I'll be waiting right here.
Woman:
Hello, Mr. Bailey.
I've reviewed your request for a loan, Mr. Riker, but with no job, no credit history,
I'm afraid I have to say no.
But what about this?
That was last month.
This new promotion's proving quite popular.
Look, I need to buy a car.
Frankly, Mr. Riker, you're the worst applicant we've ever had.
Thanks for the loan, Mr. Thompson.
(laughs)
This is a good boy.
There must be something I could do.
Ma'am... rubbing my crotch under the desk won't change my mind.
I'm not rubbing your crotch.
I really need that car.
I don't see how that's my problem.
- (gunshot)
- Man:
This is a robbery!
Nobody move!
Everybody stay down!
Stay down!
- Get down.
- Man:
Come on, Lady!
Hurry it up!
- Oh.
- Come on, move it!
Oh, hey, I made the same mistake before when I came in.
Thanks.
You idiot!
You let him get away with our money!
I don't see how that's my problem.
(gunshots)
- Man:
Oh, man!
- Man #2:
Wow.
Come over here!
You've got to see this.
Let me through.
Let me through.
- (chittering) - (accordion playing)
Oh, thank God.
I thought something terrible had happened.
Well, an old guy did get shot over there.
- Uncle Albert!
Just try to breathe.
- (grunting)
I can't.
You're kneeling on my balls.
- (sirens blaring)
- Oh, sorry.
Rick, listen.
With great power comes...
Great responsibility?
I was gonna stick with bitches, but if you want to be a virgin for the rest of your life...
- (muffled)
- Uncle Albert!
My balls!
(beeping)
Very good.
(alarm beeping)
(gasps)
Oh, God.
Mr. Landers!
(woman gasping)
Oh no.
Okay.
(grunts)
Hide the body.
Hide the body.
Yeah.
Get in!
Yah!
Yah!
Okay, I come back.
(beeping)
Jill?
I came as soon as I heard.
- Where's Aunt Lucille?
- She's at home under heavy sedation.
They made her watch three hours of women's basketball.
- This is all my fault.
- Rick, it was an armed robbery.
There was nothing you could've done.
I could've stopped that guy before he shot my uncle.
Then there is blood on your hands.
But that's not important.
All that matters is that you're here for him now.
- Rick Riker?
- Yes?
Dr. Whitby.
I've run some tests.
I'm afraid I have bad news.
- What is it?
- (sighs)
I have an impacted colon.
Whew.
What a night.
Now what brought you here today?
- My uncle.
- Your uncle brought you?
- No, he's gravely injured.
- Well, then he shouldn't be driving.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to perform a breast exam.
Doctor, please.
Is my uncle gonna survive?
Well, I don't know.
We should probably have a look.
Hard to say.
Yup, pretty deep coma.
Is he gonna be okay?
Well, I'm not a betting man, but if you want to put some money on it,
- I'll take "dead in a week."
- Oh my God!
No, it's all right.
It's a normal emotional reaction, but this should take the edge off of it.
Here we go.
Nice and easy.
- That's your vein.
- Yes, I know.
- First my parents and now this?
- (thuds)
I'm nothing but a screw-up.
Yes, your life has been a testament to that.
But your uncle believed in you and so do I.
It's never too late to become the person you're meant to be.
Man's voice:
Rick.
Man's voice:
Rick.
Rick.
Hello, Rick.
Who are you and how do you know my name?
- I'm a psychic.
- Prove it.
Think of any number between one and a million and I'll tell you what it is.
- Nine.
- Not out loud, dumbass!
(sighs) Follow me... (mutters) you dumb son of a bitch.
My name is Professor Xavier, and this is my school.
I started it to help people with special talents like yours.
Our students here learn to harness their incredible talents.
and use them to advance the common good.
- Ah!
Ow.
- (girl laughs)
Here we have children who can walk through walls.
We have children who think they can walk through walls.
- (groans)
- Some faces may be familiar, like Wolverine.
Other mutants you probably didn't know existed, like Sneezo.
Most of our students are born with their powers.
Some, like you, gain them later in life.
- Oh, is that...
- Yes, it is.
When he came to this school, he weighed 130 lbs.
Take enough roids, you could do anything.
(yells)
- Back up off those pills, Barry!
- (glass shatters)
(toilet flushes)
- Why have you brought me here?
- Because you have the potential
- to be the best.
- But I can't even fly.
Once you understand the true nature of heroism, you will fly.
But first I must teach you the secret to becoming a superhero.
Hey, Storm!
You look like you putting on a little weight.
- (wind howls)
- Ah!
Oh!
So, Professor, about this secret...
- Well, you see...
- Woman:
Xavier!
- Aw, shit.
- Well?
You wanna explain why I found her hiding in your closet?
But, pumpkin, I don't see nobody.
- Oh, you don't?
- Ow!
Rick:
Invisible Girl?
Apparently not invisible enough.
If you knew how to take care of your man, maybe this wouldn't have happened.
- No, she didn't.
- Oh, this bitch is crazy.
I'm gonna have to whip your ass.
- You don't say no disrespectful...
- What are you gonna do, baldy?
I'm everywhere, sweet cheeks.
- Whoa!
- Ow!
- That all you got?
- Yeah!
Now what?
Now how about that, Invisi-bitch?
Yeah, whatever.
I'm out of here.
I'm sure gonna miss her.
She was crazy in the sack.
Biting, scratching, panting, tongue all over the place.
Wasn't me, asshole.
- Come on, Spanky.
- (barks)
I didn't even know she had a dog.
Still some of the best sex I ever had.
How could you do this to me?
To your kids?
To your newborn baby?
How do I know that baby's even mine?
Because he can do this.
Shit!
(thunks) Ah!
Aw, man.
Now I'm never gonna know the secret to becoming a superhero.
You wanna know the secret?
Come close.
Make a costume, shithead!
I swear to God.
They get dumber and dumber every year.
A costume.
- (knocks)
- Rick, you, uh...
Oh my God.
Damn!
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!
I love the mask.
How you breathe in it though?
- (labored breathing)
- What's that sound?
You put some kind of air intake in the mask.
Boy, you better...
now I'm assuming that the material is see-through, right?
Yeah, dude, I'ma tell you something.
Rick, this is good.
I'm impressed.
Like really impressed.
Man:
Hey, that's my spot.
You're sitting on my gargoyle.
Move it.
- Excuse me?
- What are you even doing here?
I'm looking seriously out over the city in a squatting position.
Well, that's what I do here.
So if you're not moving,
I guess we're gonna have to share.
Uh, okay, fine.
I actually usually perch in the front.
Oh, all right.
Well, here, you've got to go around.
- Okay, wait.
- Just turn this way.
Here we go.
- Dude!
- You're right, I'm sorry.
Relax.
- Okay okay.
- Okay okay.
- Uh, I can't perch like this.
- God, me neither.
- What's your name?
- John Storm.
Dragonfly.
So what's your power?
What's my power?
Stand back.
- Flame on!
- Whoa!
(chuckles) Huh?
(screaming) I'm on fire!
Get a blanket or something!
Holy shit!
It's not working!
Get the fire extinguisher!
Ah!
No!
Ah!
God!
You idiot, stop!
What's wrong with you?
(screaming louder)
- (thuds) - (car alarm blaring)
Sorry, my bad.
Xavier's voice:
Rick, once you understand the true nature of heroism, you will fly.
- (thuds)
- Shit.
(grunting)
This Dragonfly, he's not even a hero.
He's not...
I have...
I have...
I have just a...
I have... (chuckles)
He can't...
he can't even fly.
The Dragonfly can't even fly!
I can fly, okay?
I can fly.
This just in:
Tom Cruise is dead.
Lou:
World's most powerful man.
I have a feeling you might disagree with that.
Strom, do you have my test results?
Yes, sir.
Whatever you're doing to your... victims, rejuvenates you.
But only for 24 hours.
Hmmm.
What if I killed 28 people in one session?
Would that give me a month to live?
If it were February, yes.
But only if your cells could absorb that much energy at once, and they can't.
I'm afraid you have to kill each day to live each day.
Still a slave to the tyranny of time.
There must be some answer.
There isn't.
Unless... unless you had some cerillium.
Then you could create a device powerful enough to draw the life-force out of thousands of people and enhance your own cellular capacity.
Strom, you're a genius.
Wikipedia.
But that's not important.
What is important is that you don't have any cerillium.
Besides, it's immoral.
We don't do that sort of thing.
We're a pharmaceutical company.
Wait a minute.
Take a look.
Hawking's lab is in the physics building.
I could just walk right in.
You're going to steal cerillium?
No, not me.
I'm a law abiding citizen.
But perhaps there's someone inside me.
Someone unfettered by the rule of law.
Someone who will, at any cost, survive!
(laughs maniacally) Ow!
Oh, glass in my eye.
Glass in my eye!
- Does it hurt?
- Uh, yeah, it hurts.
Well, if you could spread...
spread them with your fingers.
Push your lids with your fingers.
- Two... two... two fingers.
- Are your fingers clean?
That's it.
And roll your eyeball around.
- And push it.
- I'm rolling it!
Dig it out with another piece of glass.
Are you fricking insane?
I'll get the tweezers.
Man:
Read about the Dragonfly, world's greatest hero.
- Right here?
- Right here, yup.
Read all about it.
Man:
No, you listen to me!
I want that story on my desk or you're fired!
Who the hell are you?
I was wondering if you've got a job opening for...
Job?
!
How dare you come in here and ask me for a job?
I'm the editor in chief!
I know the mayor of Venus!
Hamburgers can see the future!
- Rosie O'Donnell...
- Sorry about this.
We share the building with a mental hospital.
Bad news, boss.
We're nowhere on those Dragonfly photos.
Damn.
Those were tomorrow's lead.
What about these?
Wow!
it's almost like you're the Dragonfly.
Uh, no no no.
See?
Look.
Now that's photography.
Just heard on the scanner, some kind of police standoff at Empire University.
We'll need photos.
Kid, I want you to...
Where'd he go?
(siren blaring)
(siren blaring)
Come on, let's go!
This is the chief of police.
We have the building surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.
(high-pitched whine)
What the hell is that?
(crowd screaming)
I am the Hourglass.
And your time is up.
Woman:
Get him, Dragonfly.
(grunts)
It's over, Hourglass.
No, Dragonfly.
(groaning)
It's just begun!
(shouting)
It's useless to resist.
I'll fight you to my last breath.
Like the sands of time I am unceasing and relentless.
Evil never triumphs, Hourglass.
You'll pay for your crimes and justice will... stop!
Stop!
Stop!
- (gurgling)
- Are you okay?
- No.
- (retching)
Titanium blades.
They cut through diamonds.
I'm not wearing any diamonds.
Ooh, ow!
Ow!
(grunts)
I wish I could stay longer, Dragonfly.
But I just don't have the time.
(explosion)
Whoever this Dragonfly is, he's in over his head.
We don't need so-called superheroes.
What Empire City needs is more cops.
And a Hooters.
Titanium blades.
Looks like someone found your weakness.
It's not my weakness.
I'm sorry, I forgot.
Your weakness is you can't fly.
Maybe if you had a partner.
I don't need help.
I'm fine all by myself.
She means a lot to you, doesn't she?
What?
Oh, no.
I mean, she's with someone else.
Well, maybe that's for the best.
After all, it could be dangerous, you know, being the girlfriend of the Dragonfly.
I don't know what to do, Aunt Lucille.
- I love her.
- So be it.
But remember, to get to you your enemies will attack the people you care for the most.
Be careful not to hurt the ones you love.
And shave your pubes.
No one wants to go down on a tumbleweed.
Jill!
Rick?
I heard you were auditioning for a part so...
Oh, they're beautiful.
God, you are so supportive.
Why can't Lance be more like you?
There's something you're not telling me, isn't there?
Something secret.
Something locked away deep inside.
It was summer camp.
We had to share a shower.
You trip and fall with your mouth open on one guys...
No!
I mean, in here.
Well, there is...
Lucille's voice:
Keep your identity a secret, Rick.
Trey's voice:
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!
Albert's voice:
Once a month you'll bleed from you vagina.
I... nothing.
Nothing?
Well, I should go.
You're a good friend.
- Hey, check this out.
- (whistling)
- Hey, check this out.
- (whistling)
Oh, shit.
- Let's go.
- Get her.
(groaning)
(screaming)
Oh God, it hurts.
It hurts.
Please stop!
I'm begging you!
(groaning)
(thunder rumbles)
- (buzzes)
- Wait!
- Where are you?
- Behind you.
You saved my life.
Do I get to thank you?
(thunder rumbling)
(siren wailing)
Go.
Be a hero.
Yeah.
Computer:
It looks like you're planning a mass murder.
Would you like help?
(mutters) Paper clip guy.
I'm so happy that you and your boyfriend are spending Thanksgiving with us.
Of course, Lucille.
You need support at a time like this.
Yes, I miss seeing my Albert each morning.
You know, 50 years of marriage creates quite a bond.
I wish I knew love like that.
Oh, you will, dear.
You just have to follow your heart.
That's the thing.
I don't know if I can.
Oh, Jill.
If you can't trust yourself who can you trust?
I know.
But what if my heart is telling me to be with someone
- I can't be with?
- (howling)
It's not just any guy.
It's the... forget it.
You'll think I'm crazy.
No, of course not.
You can tell me anything.
I'm very good at keeping secrets.
You'll think it's ridiculous, but...
- it's the Drag...
- (doorbell rings)
- I'll get it.
- Thank you.
Hey, babe.
Oh, I forgot to tell you I kinda invited my uncle.
- Your uncle?
- What?
Set another plate.
Well, okay.
I guess.
Miss Johnson.
Please, excuse my nephew's poor manners.
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Adams, I'm Lou Landers.
I hope this isn't too much of an imposition.
Oh, of course not.
There's always room for one more.
Thank you.
It's just Thanksgiving is for family.
Lance is the only family I have.
- I never married.
- Fruitcake?
Nope, just never met the right woman.
Ah, yes, Lance told me Rick Riker was your neighbor.
Where is Rick?
- (thumps)
- That's odd.
I thought he was out.
I'll go check on him.
Please, you're busy.
Allow me.
Thank you.
Upstairs, second door to the right.
- (urinating) - (knocking)
Rick?
Hmmm.
Hmmm.
(drips)
(sprinkler thwapping)
(muttering)
(thuds)
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, Mr. Landers.
Rick.
Lucille:
No, you're just on time.
Everybody, take your seat.
Ohhh.
Ah ah ah!
Not till we say grace.
Jesus!
All:
Amen.
Please start, everyone.
This all looks so delicious, Lucille.
We have Rick to thank for it.
Ever since Albert...
Rick has been supporting me with his new job.
New job?
You didn't tell me.
Oh well, I'm sort of the Dragonfly's unofficial photographer.
What happened to your arm?
Uh... a bike messenger knocked me down.
I see your wrist is bandaged.
Yes, I burned it on some hot coffee.
And you have a cut on your lip.
Uh... my crackpipe broke.
You have a scratch on your neck.
Yes, I... met a girl on Craigslist.
And you have a bruise on your neck.
I... met a guy on Craigslist.
I'm sorry, Lance.
We have to go.
- Why?
- I... shat my pants.
(silverware clatters)
I'll drive.
(snoring)
- Thanks for helping clean up.
- Of course.
Poor thing's so tired.
Yeah, well, you know old folks after a big meal.
So... you know the Dragonfly?
Uh... yeah, I guess.
You could sorta say we're close.
Has he...
has he ever asked about me?
Um, yeah.
- Yeah, once.
- What did you tell him?
Well, I said...
I told him...
I told him, "The thing about Jill is... when you look in her eyes and she looks back in yours... (farts)
(farts)
- you know that you'd do anything anything to be a better person than you are.
- So that...
- (farts)
- if you were ever lucky enough to be with her, you could earn every second of her perfect... (farting)
- grace, and her limitless beauty... (farting)
- and her unending love.
- Don't cry.
- I'm not.
My eyes are burning.
Rick, I want you to know that was the most beautiful thing anyone's ever said to me.
(farting)
- Scented candle?
- Thank you.
- Rick, I'm so confused, and yet...
- (farts)
- I know exactly what I want.
(farting)
(squeaks)
(groans)
Sorry to drop in uninvited.
It's okay.
We were hoping someone would open a window.
It was getting stuffy in here.
So this is the lair of the Dragonfly.
- How did you...
- No no no,
I'm not here to fight you.
I've got thousands of other people I plan to kill.
This little visit is just to show you who'll get hurt if you get in my way.
Never!
Time to go.
(screaming)
(farts)
The woman, Lucille Adams of East Empire City,
- was badly injured.
- Reporter:
How was she injured?
- Badly.
- What about the Dragonfly?
All I can tell you is this:
he didn't save anyone tonight.
Doctor, how is she?
I'm afraid your aunt's taken a turn for the worse.
She can't speak, she can't walk, she had no control over her bowels.
That's... that's awful.
I know.
I went ahead and set up a MySpace page for her under "crazy shit machine."
She already has 40 friends.
Wait a minute.
That's somebody else's aunt.
Your aunt has no problem with her bowels...
- Oh, thank God.
...because she's dead.
I'm truly sorry, Rick, but there is a silver lining.
Your uncle came out of his coma this morning.
He did?
Yes, but you mustn't tell him about your aunt just yet.
He's in a delicate mental state.
The slightest bit of bad news could send him spiraling right back into a coma.
I understand.
Mr. Adams, you have a visitor.
- Is it Lucille?
- No, sir, it's not your dead wife.
It's your nephew Rick.
(softly) Remember, no bad news.
Now, sir, here you go.
This is my bill.
- You did surgery on me?
- Yes, sir, we confused you with one of our sex-change patients, but don't worry, we didn't remove your penis.
We did cut your testicles off, but, well, since your wife's dead, you won't be needing them anyway.
You just want to keep his spirits up.
He'll land on his feet in no time.
Priest:
We are gathered today to say goodbye
- to Lucille Adams.
- Mourners:
Goodbye!
Priest:
And now the eulogy.
Albert:
It's tragic to think this is the last time that I can look upon my wife's face.
God, Lucille!
How could you take her from me?
I can't live without her!
- Ahhh!
- (crowd exclaims)
Lucille!
Snookie lumps!
I'm sorry, there's been a terrible mistake.
- This is your wife.
- Ah!
She is this man's wife.
Give me five minutes.
(coffin squeaking)
- Uncle Albert!
- I'm not finished.
(sniffs)
You're one lucky guy.
Now... where's Lucille?
Ah, Lucille!
(sighs)
(crowd shouting)
I do have this coupon for a cremation.
Rick?
I am so sorry for your loss.
What is it?
I know I said some things, but now more than ever, I realize... we can never be together.
I don't believe you.
(soft sobs)
You love me, Rick.
I know you do.
Jill, trust me.
I'm telling you this for your own good.
I don't love you.
You're no longer in my five.
How could you?
# When I was young #
# I never needed anyone #
# Makin' love was just for fun #
# Those days are gone #
# All by myself #
# Don't wanna be #
# All by myself #
# Anymore #
# All by myself #
# Don't wanna be #
# All by myself. #
# Anymore #
# All by myself #
# Don't want to be #
# All by myself #
# Anymore #
# All by myself. #
(spraying)
You can't keep getting lucky, man.
You only beat me by two strokes this time.
And the back nine is what killed.
- (glass shatters)
- Oh my God!
- Look at this place.
- Yo, what are you doing, man?
You gotta pull yourself together, dude.
What's the point?
(burbles)
Look at you...
eating junk food, wearing fake beards, and we found your costume in the garbage outside.
Yeah, well, I'm not the Dragonfly anymore.
But you said the Hourglass was going to kill thousands of people.
I told you I'm no hero.
All right?
Aunt Lucille's dead,
I've rejected the only girl I've ever loved and I can't even fly.
I wish I'd never been bitten by that stupid dragonfly.
And maybe your father shouldn't have given you this after all.
Look at the words your ancestors inscribed in that ring.
"Honor, valor, sacrifice, duty, commitment, bravery, justice, integrity, brotherhood, self-esteem, low prices, affordable housing, loose-fitting pants, cheap internet porn."
The rest is in Latin.
Rick, the hero's path is dangerous.
You may fail or you may fly.
All that matters is that you do it for the best of reasons.
Helping others, Rick, that's what makes you a real hero.
Maybe you're right, but even if I wanted to stop the Hourglass,
I wouldn't know where to start.
I mean, where's he gonna find thousands of people in one place?
Look.
Reporting here live from the Empire City convention center where thousands of people are in one place, but none of them more important than the attendees of the World Humanity Awards.
I'll drive.
- (brakes squeal) - (grunting)
Well, that shortcut through the playground sure saved us some time.
You go ahead,
I'll find a place to park.
Girl:
Mister, please stop!
Each year the World Humanity Awards are held to honor the greatest achievements on behalf of all humanity.
This gala event is expected to draw the world's most prestigious leaders to Empire City.
- Excuse us, excuse us!
- "Empire City Times."
Damn!
Look, there go Prince Charles.
And Nelson Mandela.
Nelson!
Hey, I was in jail too, man.
One of the guests here is the Hourglass.
But which one?
Thank you so much for inviting us, Mr. Landers.
Well, when you're being honored by the world, you want your family with you.
Perhaps one day, you could be part of our family too.
(snorts)
Ladies and gentlemen, our first award is for the medical breakthrough of the year.
For his company's pioneering work in the field of feminine hygiene
I award Lou Landers douchebag of the year.
# Douchebag #
# He's the douchebag of the year #
# Now ain't he great, folks?
#
# Ain't he grand?
The douchebag of the year. #
# Douchebag #
# He's Mr. Douchebag of the year #
# Look at him smile, look at him shine #
# He's the douchebag of, the douchebag of the year. #
Hold up the douchebag!
Hold up the douchebag, sir.
Stop right there, Landers.
Mr. Riker.
So... you know.
You're damn right I do.
Someone in this auditorium is the Hourglass.
I need your help to figure out who it is.
Now the Hourglass could be anyone... a guest of honor... maybe even a stagehand.
This may be nothing, but I did see a man with what looked like a canister of cerillium.
Who?
- This year's lifetime achievement award...
- Him.
...goes to one of the world's greatest souls,
His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.
(gasping)
This man isn't who you think he is, he's the Hourglass.
No no, I'm a man of peace.
Shut up!
You're plotting to kill all these people and I can prove it.
Show the world the armor you're hiding under these robes.
You can't fool me, Hourglass.
You're packing 10 lbs of Cerillium under there.
- What?
- Ahh!
Take him down.
Tutu.
Peace!
Pea... (gong clangs)
(chants)
Shit shit shit shit shit.
You!
You're the Hourglass.
It's a pity you saw that, my dear.
Perhaps this will help you forget.
(muffled groaning)
What are you doing?
Take me.
(explosion)
Hourglass!
- Hero con?
- It's a convention for people who like to dress up as their favorite heroes and villains.
- By the way, your costume sucks.
- Hourglass:
Out of my way!
Excuse me, there is a line.
(groans)
No, you're killing him all wrong.
- It's like this.
- (groans)
Better.
(groaning)
Oh, shit.
Hourglass, you'll never get away with this!
Forget it, Dragonfly.
You're too late.
- (laughs) - (beeping)
- Run!
- (screaming)
(gasps)
Yeah.
(grunting)
Goodbye... little fly.
Dragonfly!
- No!
- Ahhh!
(growls)
- (splats) - (grunts)
Man:
My eye!
So, are you gonna keep the body, or... (clanging)
Eh.
Dragonfly, you must stop the Hourglass.
(sighs)
I can't.
I can't fly.
If there is one lesson my life can teach, it is that the spirit is stronger than the body.
The hero comes from within.
Those are Celine Dion lyrics.
Whatever.
It's still true.
You're right.
It's working.
- (groans)
- Sorry.
Watch, Dragonfly, as your city dies.
Where... am I?
You're with me, your lover.
Dragonfly!
No.
- No.
- Only now do you understand.
- (ticking)
- Oh, come... (grunts)
Aha!
(ticking)
I need you to jerk this off.
Yeah.
There's not enough time.
Oh fuck.
(Jill screams)
- It's over.
- Jill:
Dragonfly!
Jill!
Gotcha.
- Rick?
- You didn't think I'd let anything happen to the girl I love, did you?
Well, we're still falling.
Damn it!
If only I could fly.
Maybe I wasn't cut out to be a hero.
You know, maybe I was meant to have a normal job... an accountant,
- a gym teacher.
- (screams)
- This is a really tall building.
- Rick!
I don't care what happens anymore.
If I die, I die happily in your arms.
You're my hero, Rick Riker, and I love you.
Yes!
Oh, thank God!
We only have 50 stories left.
Hang on.
Thank you, Dragonfly.
Because of you, our city is safe at last.
- You said it, Dr. Hawking.
- Shit!
It's a happy ending for us all.
- (screams)
- Let's go get some dinner.
I'm buying.
Who am I?
I'm Rick Riker.
I'm the Dragonfly.
And as long as there's crime and injustice
I will forever be a superhero... (splats)
(dramatic music playing)
(dramatic music playing)
I am the Hourglass!

Stop the bus!
(tires screech)
Boy's voice:
The story of my life is not for the faint of heart.
Thanks.
But, like any story worth telling, it's all about a girl.
Not that girl.
- Hey.
Hi.
- I don't think that is a girl.
No, it's about this girl...
Jill Johnson.
Ever since I can remember I've been in love with her, but she barely knows I exist.
Yo, Rick!
Yo, come here, man!
I got you a seat down here.
What's...
I'll call y'all back.
Everybody, bye.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, Trey.
Dude, I'm so psyched for this class trip.
We about to see some real serious cutting-edge shit.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yo, you got any C batteries on you?
AAs?
Got that new sandwich from Sony in my backpack.
Wi-Fi... mmm!
Yo!
You got to forget about her, dawg.
Look look.
Let me show you something.
She not even looking at you.
If I could just tell her how I feel.
- Look, Rick, I already told you...
- (humming) you never gonna get with Jill, all right?
Seriously, she hangs out with the popular crew, and nobody messes around outside their group, man.
Come on, that crew stuff isn't real.
The hell it ain't.
Look around, Rick.
- Look, you got your jocks...
- Get the ball, man.
...nerds, emos,
Frodos,
- the Scarface society...
- (gun clicks) ...the sexual predators.
- (mutters) Yeah.
- Of course you got the Rick punchers.
- The who?
- Oh!
- Yeah, they new.
Mm-hmm.
But you know what?
Who cares?
'Cause we got our own crew...
me and you.
Thanks, Trey.
You're the best, man.
- Am I in?
- Man:
No.
Come on.
Hey, it's me and you, baby.
The two of us against the world.
You hear me?
You look good today.
I like your hair.
I'm gonna show you something nasty I downloaded.
- Don't tell nobody.
- (sheep bleats)
Man:
Welcome to Amalgamated.
I'm Dr. Strom, head of the research department...
- Come on, man.
...where we create the future today.
And now I'd like to show you our crown jewel.
The Amalgamated animal genetics lab.
- (animals chittering)
- Whoa.
Go ahead, explore.
Yo yo.
Come on, Rick.
Man, check this out.
Strom:
All of our animals are genetically engineered and each of them has...
Oh, you're so pretty.
Hi, birdie.
(giggles)
Hi.
Hi.
- She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Yes, she is.
Uh, I'm gonna take a picture of her for the school newspaper.
Strom:
Our only rules:
Don't feed the animals and please, no flash photography.
Some of our genetically- engineered animals are a little sensitive to light.
It flew away.
Uh... whoo-hoo.
What the F, loser?
- Boy:
Get him, Lance.
- Come on, Lance.
- Leave him alone.
- I don't think so.
Is there a problem, Lance?
No.
No problem, Uncle Lou.
Mr. Landers!
Students, this is Lou Landers, visionary scientist and C.E.O. of Amalgamated.
Well, I'm just a businessman now.
The future of science belongs to all of you.
- Please, enjoy the tour.
- (kids chatting)
(coughs)
Are you okay?
Yes, this is healthy-cough blood.
Rick Riker.
You're not Blaine and Julia Riker's son, are you?
- I am.
- Ah.
Good people.
- How are they?
- They died violently nine years ago.
But otherwise okay?
Yes, thank you.
I live with my aunt and uncle now.
Well, you seem like a real chip off the old block.
Let's hope you're not violently murdered too.
- (boys laughing)
- Lance:
That's for making me look stupid.
Next time I hurt you.
Yeah.
You the man, Lance.
Strom:
Our work with these animals has helped us develop new antibiotics, advanced pesticides and a powerful new pheromone which drives animals to mate called compound H2O0.
It's a strong sexual attractant.
A single drop is enough to arouse any animal.
We plan on using it to breed endangered species.
A special and indeed often overlooked...
- (rabbit shrieks)
- Our most-promising research is with these dragonflies.
For example, this dragonfly's skin has a hard, armor-like exoskeleton to defend against...
And this species of dragonfly has enormous strength for its size.
It can lift vast amounts.
- More than it's body weight.
- (monkey chatters)
And here we've injected the DNA from all three species into seven new genetically-enhanced super dragonflies.
But there's only six in there.
Well, one missing dragonfly is the least of my concerns.
I lost six tigers alone last month.
- (crunches)
- Ah!
Strom:
This area is where we keep our livestock.
- Ohh.
- (grunting)
Aren't you going to do something?
Soon as I get this up on YouTube.
I see.
Ye... well, yes, I understand.
Thank you for the call.
That was the principal.
Rick walked off a class trip.
After all the parenting you've done, he's still so troubled.
Why do you think that is, Albert?
I have no idea, Lucille.
I have taught him everything I know about being a man.
And a good man you are after all these years of marriage.
It's like we first met.
Sure, you're a little older.
Your hair's grey.
You have crow's feet.
It takes you an hour to pee.
Your thighs look like cottage cheese someone threw up on a hot sidewalk.
And you've always had a tiny penis.
Well... what does it matter when you're in love?
- (groaning)
- Oh, Rick.
We were wondering where you were.
It's so late.
About time you got home.
Your aunt was getting worried.
You can sleep late in the morning, but don't forget to feed the fish.
Attaboy.
(phone clatters)
I don't know.
Something just doesn't seem quite right with him today.
Teenagers.
I'll talk to him.
(knocks)
Rough day, huh?
Well, I won't lie to you.
Puberty is a difficult time in a young man's life.
Now this book may explain what's happening.
Let's see.
There are mood swings, fluid retention, and once a month you'll bleed from your vagina.
This may be the wrong book.
What's important is that you're on the verge of adulthood.
Here...
take a drink.
Ah, the rituals of manhood.
Today you have your first beer, and tomorrow we'll circumcise you.
(thunder booming)
I'm losing patience, Dr. Strom.
Please, sir, if you could just wait a few minutes...
I've waited long enough for this egomaniac.
We're the board of directors.
Our time is valuable.
Not as valuable as mine, Mr. Carlson.
You see, I have a terminal illness.
I've been fighting it for years, but the disease has ravaged my organs.
As of this moment, I have one hour left to live.
It was on sale.
Lou:
Gentlemen, if you're ready, allow me to show you the future.
Strom.
From the...
lift it ov...
lift it over!
What the hell is that?
An innovation...
thank you... that will not only save my life but the life of this company.
For too long we've scraped out profits from pills and injections.
The real prize is the total cure.
A device that can alter DNA and restore the body to perfect health.
- You're crazy.
- (Lou chuckles) No.
Crazy is hearing voices, talking to cats, dating Paula Abdul.
I'm not crazy.
I'm a visionary!
Sir.
Sir, the machine's never been fully tested.
If something should go wrong...
- Start the machine!
- Yes, sir.
- (beeps, whirrs) - (grunts)
Plasma level is steady.
Genetic modification's at optimum levels!
- (beeps)
- Sir, the core is overheating.
- Ah!
- Strom:
We have to abort!
(whirrs down)
- (computer beeping)
- Did it work?
- (men whispering)
- I'm so sorry.
Well, well, well.
I want you to know what a joy it will be running this company without you in the way.
Let go.
Let me go.
(Carlson screaming)
Gentlemen, I think it's time we made some personnel changes.
- (men screaming)
- Man:
No, stay away!
(hitch-pitched screaming)
(birds chirping)
(birds chirping)
Oh.
How long was I asleep?
Five days.
(grunts, farts)
Huh.
(beeping)
(buzzes)
(beeping)
Wait.
Wha...
Oh, Dad.
I thought you'd live forever.
Oh.
Lucille:
Breakfast, Rick!
I'll be right down!
Oh!
(bell rings)
(bell rings)
Woman:
If I can have your attention.
We are delighted to have as guest judge the foremost scientist in the world.
He's a visiting professor at Empire City University where he's working with the rare element cerillium.
I am so proud to welcome Dr. Stephen Hawking.
Computer:
Thank you for that warm welcome.
I have a disease that has paralyzed me.
I cannot walk and I use this computer to speak.
But I am not depressed, because I have the gift of knowledge.
That's a lie.
I think about suicide every day.
But you should all be happy with your lives.
You can walk, talk, wipe your own asses and then there's all the sex.
- (murmuring loudly)
- I haven't had sex in years.
My nurse is a lesbian, and not the hot kind.
Hey, anyone want to get high?
- I've got some hash with me.
- Girl:
No way.
White guy in the dreads, you know what I'm talking about.
Can I get a what what?
Holla.
I've got a stiff pole for your sweet hole.
Anyone?
Anyone?
Pussies.
Dr. Hawking, I am such a fan.
I'd love to show you my project on supernovas.
You have an incredible ass stromony career ahead of you.
Wait, where's Saturn?
I'd hate to lose my father's bowling ball.
There it is.
Great reflexes.
You have very manly hands.
So do you.
I'm gonna go find a spot for my project.
Yeah, okay.
Watch where you're going in slo-mo, dipshit.
- Pfft.
- Yeah.
(whispers) Go to her, stupid.
Tell her how you feel.
(rips)
Yow.
Boy:
Any day.
Uh... he did it.
- (thunks)
- Man:
Ow!
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Boy #2:
Get him, Lance!
- Lance, stop it.
- Boy #3:
Kick his ass, Lance!
Fight fight fight!
- Let's see what you got.
- Fucking break him!
Boy #4:
Whoa!
Crowd:
Oh!
Damn!
Ooh!
Get off!
Get... get off me!
Yah!
(bees buzzing)
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
Shit shit shit shit.
(siren blaring in distance)
(dramatic music playing)
- (hip-hop music playing) - # Oh no, you didn't, didn't #
- # Oh no, you didn't # - # Oh yes, we did #
# Oh no, you didn't, didn't, Oh no, you didn't #
- # Oh yeah, we did # - # Oh no, you didn't, didn't #
- # Oh no, you didn't # - # Oh yes, we did. #
- (meows) - (truck horn blaring)
Stop!
Stop!
Hey!
Get out of the way!
No brakes!
Get out of the way!
- (screaming)
- Ma'am, look out!
Woman:
Are you okay?
(moans)
- How did you...
- I can't believe it.
- You just saved that old lady's life.
- Amazing.
I...
I guess.
If I hadn't pushed her out of the way, she would've die... ah!
- (grinding) - (whining)
- You should be really proud of yourself.
- (dog barks)
- (dog whines)
- You're some kind of hero.
If you could excuse me.
(rapid footsteps fading)
(high-pitched hisses)
(high-pitched hisses)
There we go.
Awfully nice of you to help me out here, Trey.
Oh, no problem.
I'm waiting on Rick, anyway, so...
- (high-pitched hiss)
- Ooh.
My God.
How did you do that?
Uh, it's easier than it looks.
- (high-pitched hiss) - (screaming)
No, I don't think so.
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
All right.
Well, there is something, okay?
But you have to keep it a secret.
(nail clanks)
I think I have...
superpowers.
I find that hard to believe.
All right, all right, how about this?
Go ahead and throw as many punches as you want.
I bet you 100 bucks you don't land one.
- Albert:
Easy money.
- (dollars rustle)
What else can you do?
I don't know.
I...
I was bitten by a dragonfly.
Well, some dragonflies have armored skin.
- I wonder if my skin is...
- (yells)
Well, good thing that worked.
So you do have superpowers.
We could be a team!
We gonna get fame, money...
- Don't forget the bitches.
- There's not gonna be fame and there's not gonna be bitches, okay?
I didn't ask for any of this.
I just wanna be like everybody else.
That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
You're not my father.
But I love you like your father did.
I believe in you like your father did.
I had sex with your mother just like your father did.
Huh.
You'll never understand me.
- Never.
- (door slams)
(Albert's voice echoing) That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
What a great performance.
Well, Rick, did you enjoy the opera?
(bottles rattling)
Son, is something troubling you?
It's so unfair.
They have nothing.
Why do we have $2 billion?
Well, your grandfather left us $3 billion and I made some bad investments.
But that's nothing for you to worry about.
But I want to change things.
And you will.
Five generations of Rikers have worked hard to make this city great.
One day, Rick, people will look to you to be a hero.
When that day comes, will you be ready?
Give me your wallet.
That too.
Blaine's voice:
People will look to you to be a hero.
When that day comes, will you be ready?
Rick!
Ah!
- (bullet ricochets)
- Ow!
Huh?
Ah!
Rick, please!
Ah!
- Dad!
- Oh, Rick, I'm dying.
- No!
- Don't worry.
My brother Albert will take you in.
Rick, the money, it's all yours now.
Sell all shares of a small company called Google.
It's worthless.
Invest heavily in Enron.
Rick, I have something for you.
Reach into my coat pocket.
- (gun fires) - (grunts) The other coat pocket.
(groans, grunts)
God!
That ring was my father's and his father's before him.
Earn it, Rick.
Be a hero.
Claim your...
(choking)
- destiny.
Dad!
I'm no superhero.
I'm nobody!
Ah!
Man:
Shut up back there!
I'm gonna kill you!
- (loud clattering) - (woman screams)
(glass breaking)
(gunshots)
(cat screeches)
(sighs)
- Are you okay?
- What, you heard that?
You're nothing but an ugly, ungrateful little whore!
Just like your mother!
- Who was that?
- My mother.
Listen, about what happened at school this morning, I...
You really freaked us out.
I'm really going through a tough time right now.
Me too.
My parents, they want me to go to college, but I want to be a dancer.
I believe in you.
You really do, don't you?
I wish I could say the same for Lance.
I don't know.
Is he the right one or am I just dating him to rebel against my father?
- He doesn't want any boy near me.
- (electricity crackling)
That's why he installed the electrified fence.
Well, we'll see.
You can't run from your destiny.
- Right?
- Right.
- (car engine revs) - (car honks)
- Jill, let's go!
- Nice car.
Maybe one day you could take me for a ride in your car.
Uh...
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, definitely.
(chirping)
Oh.
Lovebirds.
(beeps)
(clicks)
Rick, this is Professor Xavier.
Your powers are growing, but you can't control it.
It's important that you... become a hero...
train yourself to fly... (beeping) ...in your ass because squatting on a glass table two girls...
one cup...
You know what to do.
- This shouldn't take long.
- Well, I'll be waiting right here.
Woman:
Hello, Mr. Bailey.
I've reviewed your request for a loan, Mr. Riker, but with no job, no credit history,
I'm afraid I have to say no.
But what about this?
That was last month.
This new promotion's proving quite popular.
Look, I need to buy a car.
Frankly, Mr. Riker, you're the worst applicant we've ever had.
Thanks for the loan, Mr. Thompson.
(laughs)
This is a good boy.
There must be something I could do.
Ma'am... rubbing my crotch under the desk won't change my mind.
I'm not rubbing your crotch.
I really need that car.
I don't see how that's my problem.
- (gunshot)
- Man:
This is a robbery!
Nobody move!
Everybody stay down!
Stay down!
- Get down.
- Man:
Come on, Lady!
Hurry it up!
- Oh.
- Come on, move it!
Oh, hey, I made the same mistake before when I came in.
Thanks.
You idiot!
You let him get away with our money!
I don't see how that's my problem.
(gunshots)
- Man:
Oh, man!
- Man #2:
Wow.
Come over here!
You've got to see this.
Let me through.
Let me through.
- (chittering) - (accordion playing)
Oh, thank God.
I thought something terrible had happened.
Well, an old guy did get shot over there.
- Uncle Albert!
Just try to breathe.
- (grunting)
I can't.
You're kneeling on my balls.
- (sirens blaring)
- Oh, sorry.
Rick, listen.
With great power comes...
Great responsibility?
I was gonna stick with bitches, but if you want to be a virgin for the rest of your life...
- (muffled)
- Uncle Albert!
My balls!
(beeping)
Very good.
(alarm beeping)
(gasps)
Oh, God.
Mr. Landers!
(woman gasping)
Oh no.
Okay.
(grunts)
Hide the body.
Hide the body.
Yeah.
Get in!
Yah!
Yah!
Okay, I come back.
(beeping)
Jill?
I came as soon as I heard.
- Where's Aunt Lucille?
- She's at home under heavy sedation.
They made her watch three hours of women's basketball.
- This is all my fault.
- Rick, it was an armed robbery.
There was nothing you could've done.
I could've stopped that guy before he shot my uncle.
Then there is blood on your hands.
But that's not important.
All that matters is that you're here for him now.
- Rick Riker?
- Yes?
Dr. Whitby.
I've run some tests.
I'm afraid I have bad news.
- What is it?
- (sighs)
I have an impacted colon.
Whew.
What a night.
Now what brought you here today?
- My uncle.
- Your uncle brought you?
- No, he's gravely injured.
- Well, then he shouldn't be driving.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to perform a breast exam.
Doctor, please.
Is my uncle gonna survive?
Well, I don't know.
We should probably have a look.
Hard to say.
Yup, pretty deep coma.
Is he gonna be okay?
Well, I'm not a betting man, but if you want to put some money on it,
- I'll take "dead in a week."
- Oh my God!
No, it's all right.
It's a normal emotional reaction, but this should take the edge off of it.
Here we go.
Nice and easy.
- That's your vein.
- Yes, I know.
- First my parents and now this?
- (thuds)
I'm nothing but a screw-up.
Yes, your life has been a testament to that.
But your uncle believed in you and so do I.
It's never too late to become the person you're meant to be.
Man's voice:
Rick.
Man's voice:
Rick.
Rick.
Hello, Rick.
Who are you and how do you know my name?
- I'm a psychic.
- Prove it.
Think of any number between one and a million and I'll tell you what it is.
- Nine.
- Not out loud, dumbass!
(sighs) Follow me... (mutters) you dumb son of a bitch.
My name is Professor Xavier, and this is my school.
I started it to help people with special talents like yours.
Our students here learn to harness their incredible talents.
and use them to advance the common good.
- Ah!
Ow.
- (girl laughs)
Here we have children who can walk through walls.
We have children who think they can walk through walls.
- (groans)
- Some faces may be familiar, like Wolverine.
Other mutants you probably didn't know existed, like Sneezo.
Most of our students are born with their powers.
Some, like you, gain them later in life.
- Oh, is that...
- Yes, it is.
When he came to this school, he weighed 130 lbs.
Take enough roids, you could do anything.
(yells)
- Back up off those pills, Barry!
- (glass shatters)
(toilet flushes)
- Why have you brought me here?
- Because you have the potential
- to be the best.
- But I can't even fly.
Once you understand the true nature of heroism, you will fly.
But first I must teach you the secret to becoming a superhero.
Hey, Storm!
You look like you putting on a little weight.
- (wind howls)
- Ah!
Oh!
So, Professor, about this secret...
- Well, you see...
- Woman:
Xavier!
- Aw, shit.
- Well?
You wanna explain why I found her hiding in your closet?
But, pumpkin, I don't see nobody.
- Oh, you don't?
- Ow!
Rick:
Invisible Girl?
Apparently not invisible enough.
If you knew how to take care of your man, maybe this wouldn't have happened.
- No, she didn't.
- Oh, this bitch is crazy.
I'm gonna have to whip your ass.
- You don't say no disrespectful...
- What are you gonna do, baldy?
I'm everywhere, sweet cheeks.
- Whoa!
- Ow!
- That all you got?
- Yeah!
Now what?
Now how about that, Invisi-bitch?
Yeah, whatever.
I'm out of here.
I'm sure gonna miss her.
She was crazy in the sack.
Biting, scratching, panting, tongue all over the place.
Wasn't me, asshole.
- Come on, Spanky.
- (barks)
I didn't even know she had a dog.
Still some of the best sex I ever had.
How could you do this to me?
To your kids?
To your newborn baby?
How do I know that baby's even mine?
Because he can do this.
Shit!
(thunks) Ah!
Aw, man.
Now I'm never gonna know the secret to becoming a superhero.
You wanna know the secret?
Come close.
Make a costume, shithead!
I swear to God.
They get dumber and dumber every year.
A costume.
- (knocks)
- Rick, you, uh...
Oh my God.
Damn!
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!
I love the mask.
How you breathe in it though?
- (labored breathing)
- What's that sound?
You put some kind of air intake in the mask.
Boy, you better...
now I'm assuming that the material is see-through, right?
Yeah, dude, I'ma tell you something.
Rick, this is good.
I'm impressed.
Like really impressed.
Man:
Hey, that's my spot.
You're sitting on my gargoyle.
Move it.
- Excuse me?
- What are you even doing here?
I'm looking seriously out over the city in a squatting position.
Well, that's what I do here.
So if you're not moving,
I guess we're gonna have to share.
Uh, okay, fine.
I actually usually perch in the front.
Oh, all right.
Well, here, you've got to go around.
- Okay, wait.
- Just turn this way.
Here we go.
- Dude!
- You're right, I'm sorry.
Relax.
- Okay okay.
- Okay okay.
- Uh, I can't perch like this.
- God, me neither.
- What's your name?
- John Storm.
Dragonfly.
So what's your power?
What's my power?
Stand back.
- Flame on!
- Whoa!
(chuckles) Huh?
(screaming) I'm on fire!
Get a blanket or something!
Holy shit!
It's not working!
Get the fire extinguisher!
Ah!
No!
Ah!
God!
You idiot, stop!
What's wrong with you?
(screaming louder)
- (thuds) - (car alarm blaring)
Sorry, my bad.
Xavier's voice:
Rick, once you understand the true nature of heroism, you will fly.
- (thuds)
- Shit.
(grunting)
This Dragonfly, he's not even a hero.
He's not...
I have...
I have...
I have just a...
I have... (chuckles)
He can't...
he can't even fly.
The Dragonfly can't even fly!
I can fly, okay?
I can fly.
This just in:
Tom Cruise is dead.
Lou:
World's most powerful man.
I have a feeling you might disagree with that.
Strom, do you have my test results?
Yes, sir.
Whatever you're doing to your... victims, rejuvenates you.
But only for 24 hours.
Hmmm.
What if I killed 28 people in one session?
Would that give me a month to live?
If it were February, yes.
But only if your cells could absorb that much energy at once, and they can't.
I'm afraid you have to kill each day to live each day.
Still a slave to the tyranny of time.
There must be some answer.
There isn't.
Unless... unless you had some cerillium.
Then you could create a device powerful enough to draw the life-force out of thousands of people and enhance your own cellular capacity.
Strom, you're a genius.
Wikipedia.
But that's not important.
What is important is that you don't have any cerillium.
Besides, it's immoral.
We don't do that sort of thing.
We're a pharmaceutical company.
Wait a minute.
Take a look.
Hawking's lab is in the physics building.
I could just walk right in.
You're going to steal cerillium?
No, not me.
I'm a law abiding citizen.
But perhaps there's someone inside me.
Someone unfettered by the rule of law.
Someone who will, at any cost, survive!
(laughs maniacally) Ow!
Oh, glass in my eye.
Glass in my eye!
- Does it hurt?
- Uh, yeah, it hurts.
Well, if you could spread...
spread them with your fingers.
Push your lids with your fingers.
- Two... two... two fingers.
- Are your fingers clean?
That's it.
And roll your eyeball around.
- And push it.
- I'm rolling it!
Dig it out with another piece of glass.
Are you fricking insane?
I'll get the tweezers.
Man:
Read about the Dragonfly, world's greatest hero.
- Right here?
- Right here, yup.
Read all about it.
Man:
No, you listen to me!
I want that story on my desk or you're fired!
Who the hell are you?
I was wondering if you've got a job opening for...
Job?
!
How dare you come in here and ask me for a job?
I'm the editor in chief!
I know the mayor of Venus!
Hamburgers can see the future!
- Rosie O'Donnell...
- Sorry about this.
We share the building with a mental hospital.
Bad news, boss.
We're nowhere on those Dragonfly photos.
Damn.
Those were tomorrow's lead.
What about these?
Wow!
it's almost like you're the Dragonfly.
Uh, no no no.
See?
Look.
Now that's photography.
Just heard on the scanner, some kind of police standoff at Empire University.
We'll need photos.
Kid, I want you to...
Where'd he go?
(siren blaring)
(siren blaring)
Come on, let's go!
This is the chief of police.
We have the building surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.
(high-pitched whine)
What the hell is that?
(crowd screaming)
I am the Hourglass.
And your time is up.
Woman:
Get him, Dragonfly.
(grunts)
It's over, Hourglass.
No, Dragonfly.
(groaning)
It's just begun!
(shouting)
It's useless to resist.
I'll fight you to my last breath.
Like the sands of time I am unceasing and relentless.
Evil never triumphs, Hourglass.
You'll pay for your crimes and justice will... stop!
Stop!
Stop!
- (gurgling)
- Are you okay?
- No.
- (retching)
Titanium blades.
They cut through diamonds.
I'm not wearing any diamonds.
Ooh, ow!
Ow!
(grunts)
I wish I could stay longer, Dragonfly.
But I just don't have the time.
(explosion)
Whoever this Dragonfly is, he's in over his head.
We don't need so-called superheroes.
What Empire City needs is more cops.
And a Hooters.
Titanium blades.
Looks like someone found your weakness.
It's not my weakness.
I'm sorry, I forgot.
Your weakness is you can't fly.
Maybe if you had a partner.
I don't need help.
I'm fine all by myself.
She means a lot to you, doesn't she?
What?
Oh, no.
I mean, she's with someone else.
Well, maybe that's for the best.
After all, it could be dangerous, you know, being the girlfriend of the Dragonfly.
I don't know what to do, Aunt Lucille.
- I love her.
- So be it.
But remember, to get to you your enemies will attack the people you care for the most.
Be careful not to hurt the ones you love.
And shave your pubes.
No one wants to go down on a tumbleweed.
Jill!
Rick?
I heard you were auditioning for a part so...
Oh, they're beautiful.
God, you are so supportive.
Why can't Lance be more like you?
There's something you're not telling me, isn't there?
Something secret.
Something locked away deep inside.
It was summer camp.
We had to share a shower.
You trip and fall with your mouth open on one guys...
No!
I mean, in here.
Well, there is...
Lucille's voice:
Keep your identity a secret, Rick.
Trey's voice:
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!
Albert's voice:
Once a month you'll bleed from you vagina.
I... nothing.
Nothing?
Well, I should go.
You're a good friend.
- Hey, check this out.
- (whistling)
- Hey, check this out.
- (whistling)
Oh, shit.
- Let's go.
- Get her.
(groaning)
(screaming)
Oh God, it hurts.
It hurts.
Please stop!
I'm begging you!
(groaning)
(thunder rumbles)
- (buzzes)
- Wait!
- Where are you?
- Behind you.
You saved my life.
Do I get to thank you?
(thunder rumbling)
(siren wailing)
Go.
Be a hero.
Yeah.
Computer:
It looks like you're planning a mass murder.
Would you like help?
(mutters) Paper clip guy.
I'm so happy that you and your boyfriend are spending Thanksgiving with us.
Of course, Lucille.
You need support at a time like this.
Yes, I miss seeing my Albert each morning.
You know, 50 years of marriage creates quite a bond.
I wish I knew love like that.
Oh, you will, dear.
You just have to follow your heart.
That's the thing.
I don't know if I can.
Oh, Jill.
If you can't trust yourself who can you trust?
I know.
But what if my heart is telling me to be with someone
- I can't be with?
- (howling)
It's not just any guy.
It's the... forget it.
You'll think I'm crazy.
No, of course not.
You can tell me anything.
I'm very good at keeping secrets.
You'll think it's ridiculous, but...
- it's the Drag...
- (doorbell rings)
- I'll get it.
- Thank you.
Hey, babe.
Oh, I forgot to tell you I kinda invited my uncle.
- Your uncle?
- What?
Set another plate.
Well, okay.
I guess.
Miss Johnson.
Please, excuse my nephew's poor manners.
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Adams, I'm Lou Landers.
I hope this isn't too much of an imposition.
Oh, of course not.
There's always room for one more.
Thank you.
It's just Thanksgiving is for family.
Lance is the only family I have.
- I never married.
- Fruitcake?
Nope, just never met the right woman.
Ah, yes, Lance told me Rick Riker was your neighbor.
Where is Rick?
- (thumps)
- That's odd.
I thought he was out.
I'll go check on him.
Please, you're busy.
Allow me.
Thank you.
Upstairs, second door to the right.
- (urinating) - (knocking)
Rick?
Hmmm.
Hmmm.
(drips)
(sprinkler thwapping)
(muttering)
(thuds)
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, Mr. Landers.
Rick.
Lucille:
No, you're just on time.
Everybody, take your seat.
Ohhh.
Ah ah ah!
Not till we say grace.
Jesus!
All:
Amen.
Please start, everyone.
This all looks so delicious, Lucille.
We have Rick to thank for it.
Ever since Albert...
Rick has been supporting me with his new job.
New job?
You didn't tell me.
Oh well, I'm sort of the Dragonfly's unofficial photographer.
What happened to your arm?
Uh... a bike messenger knocked me down.
I see your wrist is bandaged.
Yes, I burned it on some hot coffee.
And you have a cut on your lip.
Uh... my crackpipe broke.
You have a scratch on your neck.
Yes, I... met a girl on Craigslist.
And you have a bruise on your neck.
I... met a guy on Craigslist.
I'm sorry, Lance.
We have to go.
- Why?
- I... shat my pants.
(silverware clatters)
I'll drive.
(snoring)
- Thanks for helping clean up.
- Of course.
Poor thing's so tired.
Yeah, well, you know old folks after a big meal.
So... you know the Dragonfly?
Uh... yeah, I guess.
You could sorta say we're close.
Has he...
has he ever asked about me?
Um, yeah.
- Yeah, once.
- What did you tell him?
Well, I said...
I told him...
I told him, "The thing about Jill is... when you look in her eyes and she looks back in yours... (farts)
(farts)
- you know that you'd do anything anything to be a better person than you are.
- So that...
- (farts)
- if you were ever lucky enough to be with her, you could earn every second of her perfect... (farting)
- grace, and her limitless beauty... (farting)
- and her unending love.
- Don't cry.
- I'm not.
My eyes are burning.
Rick, I want you to know that was the most beautiful thing anyone's ever said to me.
(farting)
- Scented candle?
- Thank you.
- Rick, I'm so confused, and yet...
- (farts)
- I know exactly what I want.
(farting)
(squeaks)
(groans)
Sorry to drop in uninvited.
It's okay.
We were hoping someone would open a window.
It was getting stuffy in here.
So this is the lair of the Dragonfly.
- How did you...
- No no no,
I'm not here to fight you.
I've got thousands of other people I plan to kill.
This little visit is just to show you who'll get hurt if you get in my way.
Never!
Time to go.
(screaming)
(farts)
The woman, Lucille Adams of East Empire City,
- was badly injured.
- Reporter:
How was she injured?
- Badly.
- What about the Dragonfly?
All I can tell you is this:
he didn't save anyone tonight.
Doctor, how is she?
I'm afraid your aunt's taken a turn for the worse.
She can't speak, she can't walk, she had no control over her bowels.
That's... that's awful.
I know.
I went ahead and set up a MySpace page for her under "crazy shit machine."
She already has 40 friends.
Wait a minute.
That's somebody else's aunt.
Your aunt has no problem with her bowels...
- Oh, thank God.
...because she's dead.
I'm truly sorry, Rick, but there is a silver lining.
Your uncle came out of his coma this morning.
He did?
Yes, but you mustn't tell him about your aunt just yet.
He's in a delicate mental state.
The slightest bit of bad news could send him spiraling right back into a coma.
I understand.
Mr. Adams, you have a visitor.
- Is it Lucille?
- No, sir, it's not your dead wife.
It's your nephew Rick.
(softly) Remember, no bad news.
Now, sir, here you go.
This is my bill.
- You did surgery on me?
- Yes, sir, we confused you with one of our sex-change patients, but don't worry, we didn't remove your penis.
We did cut your testicles off, but, well, since your wife's dead, you won't be needing them anyway.
You just want to keep his spirits up.
He'll land on his feet in no time.
Priest:
We are gathered today to say goodbye
- to Lucille Adams.
- Mourners:
Goodbye!
Priest:
And now the eulogy.
Albert:
It's tragic to think this is the last time that I can look upon my wife's face.
God, Lucille!
How could you take her from me?
I can't live without her!
- Ahhh!
- (crowd exclaims)
Lucille!
Snookie lumps!
I'm sorry, there's been a terrible mistake.
- This is your wife.
- Ah!
She is this man's wife.
Give me five minutes.
(coffin squeaking)
- Uncle Albert!
- I'm not finished.
(sniffs)
You're one lucky guy.
Now... where's Lucille?
Ah, Lucille!
(sighs)
(crowd shouting)
I do have this coupon for a cremation.
Rick?
I am so sorry for your loss.
What is it?
I know I said some things, but now more than ever, I realize... we can never be together.
I don't believe you.
(soft sobs)
You love me, Rick.
I know you do.
Jill, trust me.
I'm telling you this for your own good.
I don't love you.
You're no longer in my five.
How could you?
# When I was young #
# I never needed anyone #
# Makin' love was just for fun #
# Those days are gone #
# All by myself #
# Don't wanna be #
# All by myself #
# Anymore #
# All by myself #
# Don't wanna be #
# All by myself. #
# Anymore #
# All by myself #
# Don't want to be #
# All by myself #
# Anymore #
# All by myself. #
(spraying)
You can't keep getting lucky, man.
You only beat me by two strokes this time.
And the back nine is what killed.
- (glass shatters)
- Oh my God!
- Look at this place.
- Yo, what are you doing, man?
You gotta pull yourself together, dude.
What's the point?
(burbles)
Look at you...
eating junk food, wearing fake beards, and we found your costume in the garbage outside.
Yeah, well, I'm not the Dragonfly anymore.
But you said the Hourglass was going to kill thousands of people.
I told you I'm no hero.
All right?
Aunt Lucille's dead,
I've rejected the only girl I've ever loved and I can't even fly.
I wish I'd never been bitten by that stupid dragonfly.
And maybe your father shouldn't have given you this after all.
Look at the words your ancestors inscribed in that ring.
"Honor, valor, sacrifice, duty, commitment, bravery, justice, integrity, brotherhood, self-esteem, low prices, affordable housing, loose-fitting pants, cheap internet porn."
The rest is in Latin.
Rick, the hero's path is dangerous.
You may fail or you may fly.
All that matters is that you do it for the best of reasons.
Helping others, Rick, that's what makes you a real hero.
Maybe you're right, but even if I wanted to stop the Hourglass,
I wouldn't know where to start.
I mean, where's he gonna find thousands of people in one place?
Look.
Reporting here live from the Empire City convention center where thousands of people are in one place, but none of them more important than the attendees of the World Humanity Awards.
I'll drive.
- (brakes squeal) - (grunting)
Well, that shortcut through the playground sure saved us some time.
You go ahead,
I'll find a place to park.
Girl:
Mister, please stop!
Each year the World Humanity Awards are held to honor the greatest achievements on behalf of all humanity.
This gala event is expected to draw the world's most prestigious leaders to Empire City.
- Excuse us, excuse us!
- "Empire City Times."
Damn!
Look, there go Prince Charles.
And Nelson Mandela.
Nelson!
Hey, I was in jail too, man.
One of the guests here is the Hourglass.
But which one?
Thank you so much for inviting us, Mr. Landers.
Well, when you're being honored by the world, you want your family with you.
Perhaps one day, you could be part of our family too.
(snorts)
Ladies and gentlemen, our first award is for the medical breakthrough of the year.
For his company's pioneering work in the field of feminine hygiene
I award Lou Landers douchebag of the year.
# Douchebag #
# He's the douchebag of the year #
# Now ain't he great, folks?
#
# Ain't he grand?
The douchebag of the year. #
# Douchebag #
# He's Mr. Douchebag of the year #
# Look at him smile, look at him shine #
# He's the douchebag of, the douchebag of the year. #
Hold up the douchebag!
Hold up the douchebag, sir.
Stop right there, Landers.
Mr. Riker.
So... you know.
You're damn right I do.
Someone in this auditorium is the Hourglass.
I need your help to figure out who it is.
Now the Hourglass could be anyone... a guest of honor... maybe even a stagehand.
This may be nothing, but I did see a man with what looked like a canister of cerillium.
Who?
- This year's lifetime achievement award...
- Him.
...goes to one of the world's greatest souls,
His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.
(gasping)
This man isn't who you think he is, he's the Hourglass.
No no, I'm a man of peace.
Shut up!
You're plotting to kill all these people and I can prove it.
Show the world the armor you're hiding under these robes.
You can't fool me, Hourglass.
You're packing 10 lbs of Cerillium under there.
- What?
- Ahh!
Take him down.
Tutu.
Peace!
Pea... (gong clangs)
(chants)
Shit shit shit shit shit.
You!
You're the Hourglass.
It's a pity you saw that, my dear.
Perhaps this will help you forget.
(muffled groaning)
What are you doing?
Take me.
(explosion)
Hourglass!
- Hero con?
- It's a convention for people who like to dress up as their favorite heroes and villains.
- By the way, your costume sucks.
- Hourglass:
Out of my way!
Excuse me, there is a line.
(groans)
No, you're killing him all wrong.
- It's like this.
- (groans)
Better.
(groaning)
Oh, shit.
Hourglass, you'll never get away with this!
Forget it, Dragonfly.
You're too late.
- (laughs) - (beeping)
- Run!
- (screaming)
(gasps)
Yeah.
(grunting)
Goodbye... little fly.
Dragonfly!
- No!
- Ahhh!
(growls)
- (splats) - (grunts)
Man:
My eye!
So, are you gonna keep the body, or... (clanging)
Eh.
Dragonfly, you must stop the Hourglass.
(sighs)
I can't.
I can't fly.
If there is one lesson my life can teach, it is that the spirit is stronger than the body.
The hero comes from within.
Those are Celine Dion lyrics.
Whatever.
It's still true.
You're right.
It's working.
- (groans)
- Sorry.
Watch, Dragonfly, as your city dies.
Where... am I?
You're with me, your lover.
Dragonfly!
No.
- No.
- Only now do you understand.
- (ticking)
- Oh, come... (grunts)
Aha!
(ticking)
I need you to jerk this off.
Yeah.
There's not enough time.
Oh fuck.
(Jill screams)
- It's over.
- Jill:
Dragonfly!
Jill!
Gotcha.
- Rick?
- You didn't think I'd let anything happen to the girl I love, did you?
Well, we're still falling.
Damn it!
If only I could fly.
Maybe I wasn't cut out to be a hero.
You know, maybe I was meant to have a normal job... an accountant,
- a gym teacher.
- (screams)
- This is a really tall building.
- Rick!
I don't care what happens anymore.
If I die, I die happily in your arms.
You're my hero, Rick Riker, and I love you.
Yes!
Oh, thank God!
We only have 50 stories left.
Hang on.
Thank you, Dragonfly.
Because of you, our city is safe at last.
- You said it, Dr. Hawking.
- Shit!
It's a happy ending for us all.
- (screams)
- Let's go get some dinner.
I'm buying.
Who am I?
I'm Rick Riker.
I'm the Dragonfly.
And as long as there's crime and injustice
I will forever be a superhero... (splats)
(dramatic music playing)
(dramatic music playing)
I am the Hourglass!

Stop!
Stop the bus!
The story of my life is not for the faint of heart.
Thanks.
But, like any story worth telling, it's all about a girl.
Not that girl.
- Hey.
Hi.
- I don't think that is a girl.
No, it's about this girl...
Jill Johnson.
Ever since I can remember I've been in love with her, but she barely knows I exist.
Yo, Rick!
Yo, come here, man!
I got you a seat down here.
What's...
I'll call y'all back.
Everybody, bye.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, Trey.
Dude, I'm so psyched for this class trip.
We about to see some real serious cutting-edge shit.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yo, you got any C batteries on you?
AAs?
Got that new sandwich from Sony in my backpack.
Wi-Fi... mmm!
Yo!
You got to forget about her, dawg.
Look look.
Let me show you something.
She not even looking at you.
If I could just tell her how I feel.
Look, Rick, I already told you... you never gonna get with Jill, all right?
Seriously, she hangs out with the popular crew, and nobody messes around outside their group, man.
Come on, that crew stuff isn't real.
The hell it ain't.
Look around, Rick.
- Look, you got your jocks...
- Get the ball, man.
...nerds, emos,
Frodos, the Scarface society the sexual predators.
- Yeah.
- Of course you got the Rick punchers.
- The who?
- Oh!
- Yeah, they new.
Mm-hmm.
But you know what?
Who cares?
'Cause we got our own crew...
me and you.
Thanks, Trey.
You're the best, man.
- Am I in?
- No.
Come on.
Hey, it's me and you, baby.
The two of us against the world.
You hear me?
You look good today.
I like your hair.
I'm gonna show you something nasty I downloaded.
Don't tell nobody.
Welcome to Amalgamated.
I'm Dr. Strom, head of the research department...
- Come on, man.
...where we create the future today.
And now I'd like to show you our crown jewel.
The Amalgamated animal genetics lab.
Whoa.
Go ahead, explore.
Yo yo.
Come on, Rick.
Man, check this out.
All of our animals are genetically engineered and each of them has...
Oh, you're so pretty.
Hi, birdie.
Hi.
Hi.
- She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Yes, she is.
Uh, I'm gonna take a picture of her for the school newspaper.
Our only rules:
Don't feed the animals and please, no flash photography.
Some of our genetically- engineered animals are a little sensitive to light.
It flew away.
Uh... whoo-hoo.
What the F, loser?
Get him, Lance.
- Come on, Lance.
- Leave him alone.
- I don't think so.
Is there a problem, Lance?
No.
No problem, Uncle Lou.
Mr. Landers!
Students, this is Lou Landers, visionary scientist and C.E.O. of Amalgamated.
Well, I'm just a businessman now.
The future of science belongs to all of you.
Please, enjoy the tour.
Are you okay?
Yes, this is healthy-cough blood.
Rick Riker.
You're not Blaine and Julia Riker's son, are you?
- I am.
- Ah.
Good people.
- How are they?
- They died violently nine years ago.
But otherwise okay?
Yes, thank you.
I live with my aunt and uncle now.
Well, you seem like a real chip off the old block.
Let's hope you're not violently murdered too.
That's for making me look stupid.
Next time I hurt you.
Yeah.
You the man, Lance.
Our work with these animals has helped us develop new antibiotics, advanced pesticides and a powerful new pheromone which drives animals to mate called compound H2O0.
It's a strong sexual attractant.
A single drop is enough to arouse any animal.
We plan on using it to breed endangered species.
A special and indeed often overlooked...
Our most-promising research is with these dragonflies.
For example, this dragonfly's skin has a hard, armor-like exoskeleton to defend against...
And this species of dragonfly has enormous strength for its size.
It can lift vast amounts.
More than it's body weight.
And here we've injected the DNA from all three species into seven new genetically-enhanced super dragonflies.
But there's only six in there.
Well, one missing dragonfly is the least of my concerns.
I lost six tigers alone last month.
Ah!
This area is where we keep our livestock.
Ohh.
Aren't you going to do something?
Soon as I get this up on YouTube.
I see.
Ye... well, yes, I understand.
Thank you for the call.
That was the principal.
Rick walked off a class trip.
After all the parenting you've done, he's still so troubled.
Why do you think that is, Albert?
I have no idea, Lucille.
I have taught him everything I know about being a man.
And a good man you are after all these years of marriage.
It's like we first met.
Sure, you're a little older.
Your hair's grey.
You have crow's feet.
It takes you an hour to pee.
Your thighs look like cottage cheese someone threw up on a hot sidewalk.
And you've always had a tiny penis.
Well... what does it matter when you're in love?
Oh, Rick.
We were wondering where you were.
It's so late.
About time you got home.
Your aunt was getting worried.
You can sleep late in the morning, but don't forget to feed the fish.
Attaboy.
I don't know.
Something just doesn't seem quite right with him today.
Teenagers.
I'll talk to him.
Rough day, huh?
Well, I won't lie to you.
Puberty is a difficult time in a young man's life.
Now this book may explain what's happening.
Let's see.
There are mood swings, fluid retention, and once a month you'll bleed from your vagina.
This may be the wrong book.
What's important is that you're on the verge of adulthood.
Here...
take a drink.
Ah, the rituals of manhood.
Today you have your first beer, and tomorrow we'll circumcise you.
I'm losing patience, Dr. Strom.
Please, sir, if you could just wait a few minutes...
I've waited long enough for this egomaniac.
We're the board of directors.
Our time is valuable.
Not as valuable as mine, Mr. Carlson.
You see, I have a terminal illness.
I've been fighting it for years, but the disease has ravaged my organs.
As of this moment, I have one hour left to live.
It was on sale.
Gentlemen, if you're ready, allow me to show you the future.
Strom.
From the...
lift it ov...
lift it over!
What the hell is that?
An innovation...
thank you... that will not only save my life but the life of this company.
For too long we've scraped out profits from pills and injections.
The real prize is the total cure.
A device that can alter DNA and restore the body to perfect health.
- You're crazy.
- No.
Crazy is hearing voices, talking to cats, dating Paula Abdul.
I'm not crazy.
I'm a visionary!
Sir.
Sir, the machine's never been fully tested.
If something should go wrong...
- Start the machine!
- Yes, sir.
Plasma level is steady.
Genetic modification's at optimum levels!
Sir, the core is overheating.
- Ah!
- We have to abort!
Did it work?
I'm so sorry.
Well, well, well.
I want you to know what a joy it will be running this company without you in the way.
Let go.
Let me go.
Gentlemen, I think it's time we made some personnel changes.
No, stay away!
Oh.
How long was I asleep?
Five days.
Huh.
Wait.
Wha...
Oh, Dad.
I thought you'd live forever.
Oh.
Breakfast, Rick!
I'll be right down!
Oh!
If I can have your attention.
We are delighted to have as guest judge the foremost scientist in the world.
He's a visiting professor at Empire City University where he's working with the rare element cerillium.
I am so proud to welcome Dr. Stephen Hawking.
Thank you for that warm welcome.
I have a disease that has paralyzed me.
I cannot walk and I use this computer to speak.
But I am not depressed, because I have the gift of knowledge.
That's a lie.
I think about suicide every day.
But you should all be happy with your lives.
You can walk, talk, wipe your own asses and then there's all the sex.
I haven't had sex in years.
My nurse is a lesbian, and not the hot kind.
Hey, anyone want to get high?
- I've got some hash with me.
- No way.
White guy in the dreads, you know what I'm talking about.
Can I get a what what?
Holla.
I've got a stiff pole for your sweet hole.
Anyone?
Anyone?
Pussies.
Dr. Hawking, I am such a fan.
I'd love to show you my project on supernovas.
You have an incredible ass stromony career ahead of you.
Wait, where's Saturn?
I'd hate to lose my father's bowling ball.
There it is.
Great reflexes.
You have very manly hands.
So do you.
I'm gonna go find a spot for my project.
Yeah, okay.
Watch where you're going in slo-mo, dipshit.
- Pfft.
- Yeah.
Go to her, stupid.
Tell her how you feel.
Yow.
Any day.
Uh... he did it.
Ow!
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Get him, Lance!
- Lance, stop it.
- Kick his ass, Lance!
Fight fight fight!
- Let's see what you got.
- Fucking break him!
Whoa!
Oh!
Damn!
Ooh!
Get off!
Get... get off me!
Yah!
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
Shit shit shit shit.
# Oh no, you didn't, didn't #
- # Oh no, you didn't # - # Oh yes, we did #
# Oh no, you didn't, didn't, Oh no, you didn't #
- # Oh yeah, we did # - # Oh no, you didn't, didn't #
- # Oh no, you didn't # - # Oh yes, we did. #
Stop!
Stop!
Hey!
Get out of the way!
No brakes!
Get out of the way!
Ma'am, look out!
Are you okay?
- How did you...
- I can't believe it.
- You just saved that old lady's life.
- Amazing.
I...
I guess.
If I hadn't pushed her out of the way, she would've die... ah!
You should be really proud of yourself.
You're some kind of hero.
If you could excuse me.
There we go.
Awfully nice of you to help me out here, Trey.
Oh, no problem.
I'm waiting on Rick, anyway, so...
Ooh.
My God.
How did you do that?
Uh, it's easier than it looks.
No, I don't think so.
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
All right.
Well, there is something, okay?
But you have to keep it a secret.
I think I have...
superpowers.
I find that hard to believe.
All right, all right, how about this?
Go ahead and throw as many punches as you want.
I bet you 100 bucks you don't land one.
Easy money.
What else can you do?
I don't know.
I...
I was bitten by a dragonfly.
Well, some dragonflies have armored skin.
I wonder if my skin is...
Well, good thing that worked.
So you do have superpowers.
We could be a team!
We gonna get fame, money...
- Don't forget the bitches.
- There's not gonna be fame and there's not gonna be bitches, okay?
I didn't ask for any of this.
I just wanna be like everybody else.
That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
You're not my father.
But I love you like your father did.
I believe in you like your father did.
I had sex with your mother just like your father did.
Huh.
You'll never understand me.
Never.
That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
What a great performance.
Well, Rick, did you enjoy the opera?
Son, is something troubling you?
It's so unfair.
They have nothing.
Why do we have $2 billion?
Well, your grandfather left us $3 billion and I made some bad investments.
But that's nothing for you to worry about.
But I want to change things.
And you will.
Five generations of Rikers have worked hard to make this city great.
One day, Rick, people will look to you to be a hero.
When that day comes, will you be ready?
Give me your wallet.
That too.
People will look to you to be a hero.
When that day comes, will you be ready?
Rick!
Ah!
Ow!
Huh?
Ah!
Rick, please!
Ah!
- Dad!
- Oh, Rick, I'm dying.
- No!
- Don't worry.
My brother Albert will take you in.
Rick, the money, it's all yours now.
Sell all shares of a small company called Google.
It's worthless.
Invest heavily in Enron.
Rick, I have something for you.
Reach into my coat pocket.
The other coat pocket.
God!
That ring was my father's and his father's before him.
Earn it, Rick.
Be a hero.
Claim your...
- destiny.
Dad!
I'm no superhero.
I'm nobody!
Ah!
Shut up back there!
I'm gonna kill you!
- Are you okay?
- What, you heard that?
You're nothing but an ugly, ungrateful little whore!
Just like your mother!
- Who was that?
- My mother.
Listen, about what happened at school this morning, I...
You really freaked us out.
I'm really going through a tough time right now.
Me too.
My parents, they want me to go to college, but I want to be a dancer.
I believe in you.
You really do, don't you?
I wish I could say the same for Lance.
I don't know.
Is he the right one or am I just dating him to rebel against my father?
He doesn't want any boy near me.
That's why he installed the electrified fence.
Well, we'll see.
You can't run from your destiny.
- Right?
- Right.
- Jill, let's go!
- Nice car.
Maybe one day you could take me for a ride in your car.
Uh...
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, definitely.
Oh.
Lovebirds.
Rick, this is Professor Xavier.
Your powers are growing, but you can't control it.
It's important that you... become a hero...
train yourself to fly in your ass because squatting on a glass table two girls...
one cup...
You know what to do.
- This shouldn't take long.
- Well, I'll be waiting right here.
Hello, Mr. Bailey.
I've reviewed your request for a loan, Mr. Riker, but with no job, no credit history,
I'm afraid I have to say no.
But what about this?
That was last month.
This new promotion's proving quite popular.
Look, I need to buy a car.
Frankly, Mr. Riker, you're the worst applicant we've ever had.
Thanks for the loan, Mr. Thompson.
This is a good boy.
There must be something I could do.
Ma'am... rubbing my crotch under the desk won't change my mind.
I'm not rubbing your crotch.
I really need that car.
I don't see how that's my problem.
This is a robbery!
Nobody move!
Everybody stay down!
Stay down!
- Get down.
- Come on, Lady!
Hurry it up!
- Oh.
- Come on, move it!
Oh, hey, I made the same mistake before when I came in.
Thanks.
You idiot!
You let him get away with our money!
I don't see how that's my problem.
- Oh, man!
- Wow.
Come over here!
You've got to see this.
Let me through.
Let me through.
Oh, thank God.
I thought something terrible had happened.
Well, an old guy did get shot over there.
Uncle Albert!
Just try to breathe.
I can't.
You're kneeling on my balls.
Oh, sorry.
Rick, listen.
With great power comes...
Great responsibility?
I was gonna stick with bitches, but if you want to be a virgin for the rest of your life...
Uncle Albert!
My balls!
Very good.
Oh, God.
Mr. Landers!
Oh no.
Okay.
Hide the body.
Hide the body.
Yeah.
Get in!
Yah!
Yah!
Okay, I come back.
Jill?
I came as soon as I heard.
- Where's Aunt Lucille?
- She's at home under heavy sedation.
They made her watch three hours of women's basketball.
- This is all my fault.
- Rick, it was an armed robbery.
There was nothing you could've done.
I could've stopped that guy before he shot my uncle.
Then there is blood on your hands.
But that's not important.
All that matters is that you're here for him now.
- Rick Riker?
- Yes?
Dr. Whitby.
I've run some tests.
I'm afraid I have bad news.
What is it?
I have an impacted colon.
Whew.
What a night.
Now what brought you here today?
- My uncle.
- Your uncle brought you?
- No, he's gravely injured.
- Well, then he shouldn't be driving.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to perform a breast exam.
Doctor, please.
Is my uncle gonna survive?
Well, I don't know.
We should probably have a look.
Hard to say.
Yup, pretty deep coma.
Is he gonna be okay?
Well, I'm not a betting man, but if you want to put some money on it,
- I'll take "dead in a week."
- Oh my God!
No, it's all right.
It's a normal emotional reaction, but this should take the edge off of it.
Here we go.
Nice and easy.
- That's your vein.
- Yes, I know.
First my parents and now this?
I'm nothing but a screw-up.
Yes, your life has been a testament to that.
But your uncle believed in you and so do I.
It's never too late to become the person you're meant to be.
Rick.
Rick.
Rick.
Hello, Rick.
Who are you and how do you know my name?
- I'm a psychic.
- Prove it.
Think of any number between one and a million and I'll tell you what it is.
- Nine.
- Not out loud, dumbass!
Follow me... you dumb son of a bitch.
My name is Professor Xavier, and this is my school.
I started it to help people with special talents like yours.
Our students here learn to harness their incredible talents.
and use them to advance the common good.
Ah!
Ow.
Here we have children who can walk through walls.
We have children who think they can walk through walls.
Some faces may be familiar, like Wolverine.
Other mutants you probably didn't know existed, like Sneezo.
Most of our students are born with their powers.
Some, like you, gain them later in life.
- Oh, is that...
- Yes, it is.
When he came to this school, he weighed 130 lbs.
Take enough roids, you could do anything.
Back up off those pills, Barry!
- Why have you brought me here?
- Because you have the potential
- to be the best.
- But I can't even fly.
Once you understand the true nature of heroism, you will fly.
But first I must teach you the secret to becoming a superhero.
Hey, Storm!
You look like you putting on a little weight.
Ah!
Oh!
So, Professor, about this secret...
- Well, you see...
- Xavier!
- Aw, shit.
- Well?
You wanna explain why I found her hiding in your closet?
But, pumpkin, I don't see nobody.
- Oh, you don't?
- Ow!
Invisible Girl?
Apparently not invisible enough.
If you knew how to take care of your man, maybe this wouldn't have happened.
- No, she didn't.
- Oh, this bitch is crazy.
I'm gonna have to whip your ass.
- You don't say no disrespectful...
- What are you gonna do, baldy?
I'm everywhere, sweet cheeks.
- Whoa!
- Ow!
- That all you got?
- Yeah!
Now what?
Now how about that, Invisi-bitch?
Yeah, whatever.
I'm out of here.
I'm sure gonna miss her.
She was crazy in the sack.
Biting, scratching, panting, tongue all over the place.
Wasn't me, asshole.
Come on, Spanky.
I didn't even know she had a dog.
Still some of the best sex I ever had.
How could you do this to me?
To your kids?
To your newborn baby?
How do I know that baby's even mine?
Because he can do this.
Shit!
Ah!
Aw, man.
Now I'm never gonna know the secret to becoming a superhero.
You wanna know the secret?
Come close.
Make a costume, shithead!
I swear to God.
They get dumber and dumber every year.
A costume.
Rick, you, uh...
Oh my God.
Damn!
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!
I love the mask.
How you breathe in it though?
What's that sound?
You put some kind of air intake in the mask.
Boy, you better...
now I'm assuming that the material is see-through, right?
Yeah, dude, I'ma tell you something.
Rick, this is good.
I'm impressed.
Like really impressed.
Hey, that's my spot.
You're sitting on my gargoyle.
Move it.
- Excuse me?
- What are you even doing here?
I'm looking seriously out over the city in a squatting position.
Well, that's what I do here.
So if you're not moving,
I guess we're gonna have to share.
Uh, okay, fine.
I actually usually perch in the front.
Oh, all right.
Well, here, you've got to go around.
- Okay, wait.
- Just turn this way.
Here we go.
- Dude!
- You're right, I'm sorry.
Relax.
- Okay okay.
- Okay okay.
- Uh, I can't perch like this.
- God, me neither.
- What's your name?
- John Storm.
Dragonfly.
So what's your power?
What's my power?
Stand back.
- Flame on!
- Whoa!
Huh?
I'm on fire!
Get a blanket or something!
Holy shit!
It's not working!
Get the fire extinguisher!
Ah!
No!
Ah!
God!
You idiot, stop!
What's wrong with you?
Sorry, my bad.
Rick, once you understand the true nature of heroism, you will fly.
Shit.
This Dragonfly, he's not even a hero.
He's not...
I have...
I have...
I have just a...
I have...
He can't...
he can't even fly.
The Dragonfly can't even fly!
I can fly, okay?
I can fly.
This just in:
Tom Cruise is dead.
World's most powerful man.
I have a feeling you might disagree with that.
Strom, do you have my test results?
Yes, sir.
Whatever you're doing to your... victims, rejuvenates you.
But only for 24 hours.
Hmmm.
What if I killed 28 people in one session?
Would that give me a month to live?
If it were February, yes.
But only if your cells could absorb that much energy at once, and they can't.
I'm afraid you have to kill each day to live each day.
Still a slave to the tyranny of time.
There must be some answer.
There isn't.
Unless... unless you had some cerillium.
Then you could create a device powerful enough to draw the life-force out of thousands of people and enhance your own cellular capacity.
Strom, you're a genius.
Wikipedia.
But that's not important.
What is important is that you don't have any cerillium.
Besides, it's immoral.
We don't do that sort of thing.
We're a pharmaceutical company.
Wait a minute.
Take a look.
Hawking's lab is in the physics building.
I could just walk right in.
You're going to steal cerillium?
No, not me.
I'm a law abiding citizen.
But perhaps there's someone inside me.
Someone unfettered by the rule of law.
Someone who will, at any cost, survive!
Ow!
Oh, glass in my eye.
Glass in my eye!
- Does it hurt?
- Uh, yeah, it hurts.
Well, if you could spread...
spread them with your fingers.
Push your lids with your fingers.
- Two... two... two fingers.
- Are your fingers clean?
That's it.
And roll your eyeball around.
- And push it.
- I'm rolling it!
Dig it out with another piece of glass.
Are you fricking insane?
I'll get the tweezers.
Read about the Dragonfly, world's greatest hero.
- Right here?
- Right here, yup.
Read all about it.
No, you listen to me!
I want that story on my desk or you're fired!
Who the hell are you?
I was wondering if you've got a job opening for...
Job?
!
How dare you come in here and ask me for a job?
I'm the editor in chief!
I know the mayor of Venus!
Hamburgers can see the future!
- Rosie O'Donnell...
- Sorry about this.
We share the building with a mental hospital.
Bad news, boss.
We're nowhere on those Dragonfly photos.
Damn.
Those were tomorrow's lead.
What about these?
Wow!
it's almost like you're the Dragonfly.
Uh, no no no.
See?
Look.
Now that's photography.
Just heard on the scanner, some kind of police standoff at Empire University.
We'll need photos.
Kid, I want you to...
Where'd he go?
Come on, let's go!
This is the chief of police.
We have the building surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.
What the hell is that?
I am the Hourglass.
And your time is up.
Get him, Dragonfly.
It's over, Hourglass.
No, Dragonfly.
It's just begun!
It's useless to resist.
I'll fight you to my last breath.
Like the sands of time I am unceasing and relentless.
Evil never triumphs, Hourglass.
You'll pay for your crimes and justice will... stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Are you okay?
No.
Titanium blades.
They cut through diamonds.
I'm not wearing any diamonds.
Ooh, ow!
Ow!
I wish I could stay longer, Dragonfly.
But I just don't have the time.
Whoever this Dragonfly is, he's in over his head.
We don't need so-called superheroes.
What Empire City needs is more cops.
And a Hooters.
Titanium blades.
Looks like someone found your weakness.
It's not my weakness.
I'm sorry, I forgot.
Your weakness is you can't fly.
Maybe if you had a partner.
I don't need help.
I'm fine all by myself.
She means a lot to you, doesn't she?
What?
Oh, no.
I mean, she's with someone else.
Well, maybe that's for the best.
After all, it could be dangerous, you know, being the girlfriend of the Dragonfly.
I don't know what to do, Aunt Lucille.
- I love her.
- So be it.
But remember, to get to you your enemies will attack the people you care for the most.
Be careful not to hurt the ones you love.
And shave your pubes.
No one wants to go down on a tumbleweed.
Jill!
Rick?
I heard you were auditioning for a part so...
Oh, they're beautiful.
God, you are so supportive.
Why can't Lance be more like you?
There's something you're not telling me, isn't there?
Something secret.
Something locked away deep inside.
It was summer camp.
We had to share a shower.
You trip and fall with your mouth open on one guys...
No!
I mean, in here.
Well, there is...
Keep your identity a secret, Rick.
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!
Once a month you'll bleed from you vagina.
I... nothing.
Nothing?
Well, I should go.
You're a good friend.
Hey, check this out.
Hey, check this out.
Oh, shit.
- Let's go.
- Get her.
Oh God, it hurts.
It hurts.
Please stop!
I'm begging you!
Wait!
- Where are you?
- Behind you.
You saved my life.
Do I get to thank you?
Go.
Be a hero.
Yeah.
It looks like you're planning a mass murder.
Would you like help?
Paper clip guy.
I'm so happy that you and your boyfriend are spending Thanksgiving with us.
Of course, Lucille.
You need support at a time like this.
Yes, I miss seeing my Albert each morning.
You know, 50 years of marriage creates quite a bond.
I wish I knew love like that.
Oh, you will, dear.
You just have to follow your heart.
That's the thing.
I don't know if I can.
Oh, Jill.
If you can't trust yourself who can you trust?
I know.
But what if my heart is telling me to be with someone
I can't be with?
It's not just any guy.
It's the... forget it.
You'll think I'm crazy.
No, of course not.
You can tell me anything.
I'm very good at keeping secrets.
You'll think it's ridiculous, but... it's the Drag...
- I'll get it.
- Thank you.
Hey, babe.
Oh, I forgot to tell you I kinda invited my uncle.
- Your uncle?
- What?
Set another plate.
Well, okay.
I guess.
Miss Johnson.
Please, excuse my nephew's poor manners.
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Adams, I'm Lou Landers.
I hope this isn't too much of an imposition.
Oh, of course not.
There's always room for one more.
Thank you.
It's just Thanksgiving is for family.
Lance is the only family I have.
- I never married.
- Fruitcake?
Nope, just never met the right woman.
Ah, yes, Lance told me Rick Riker was your neighbor.
Where is Rick?
That's odd.
I thought he was out.
I'll go check on him.
Please, you're busy.
Allow me.
Thank you.
Upstairs, second door to the right.
Rick?
Hmmm.
Hmmm.
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, Mr. Landers.
Rick.
No, you're just on time.
Everybody, take your seat.
Ohhh.
Ah ah ah!
Not till we say grace.
Jesus!
Amen.
Please start, everyone.
This all looks so delicious, Lucille.
We have Rick to thank for it.
Ever since Albert...
Rick has been supporting me with his new job.
New job?
You didn't tell me.
Oh well, I'm sort of the Dragonfly's unofficial photographer.
What happened to your arm?
Uh... a bike messenger knocked me down.
I see your wrist is bandaged.
Yes, I burned it on some hot coffee.
And you have a cut on your lip.
Uh... my crackpipe broke.
You have a scratch on your neck.
Yes, I... met a girl on Craigslist.
And you have a bruise on your neck.
I... met a guy on Craigslist.
I'm sorry, Lance.
We have to go.
- Why?
- I... shat my pants.
I'll drive.
- Thanks for helping clean up.
- Of course.
Poor thing's so tired.
Yeah, well, you know old folks after a big meal.
So... you know the Dragonfly?
Uh... yeah, I guess.
You could sorta say we're close.
Has he...
has he ever asked about me?
Um, yeah.
- Yeah, once.
- What did you tell him?
Well, I said...
I told him...
I told him, "The thing about Jill is... when you look in her eyes and she looks back in yours...
- you know that you'd do anything anything to be a better person than you are.
So that...
- if you were ever lucky enough to be with her, you could earn every second of her perfect...
- grace, and her limitless beauty...
- and her unending love.
- Don't cry.
- I'm not.
My eyes are burning.
Rick, I want you to know that was the most beautiful thing anyone's ever said to me.
- Scented candle?
- Thank you.
Rick, I'm so confused, and yet...
- I know exactly what I want.
Sorry to drop in uninvited.
It's okay.
We were hoping someone would open a window.
It was getting stuffy in here.
So this is the lair of the Dragonfly.
- How did you...
- No no no,
I'm not here to fight you.
I've got thousands of other people I plan to kill.
This little visit is just to show you who'll get hurt if you get in my way.
Never!
Time to go.
The woman, Lucille Adams of East Empire City,
- was badly injured.
- How was she injured?
- Badly.
- What about the Dragonfly?
All I can tell you is this:
he didn't save anyone tonight.
Doctor, how is she?
I'm afraid your aunt's taken a turn for the worse.
She can't speak, she can't walk, she had no control over her bowels.
That's... that's awful.
I know.
I went ahead and set up a MySpace page for her under "crazy shit machine."
She already has 40 friends.
Wait a minute.
That's somebody else's aunt.
Your aunt has no problem with her bowels...
- Oh, thank God.
...because she's dead.
I'm truly sorry, Rick, but there is a silver lining.
Your uncle came out of his coma this morning.
He did?
Yes, but you mustn't tell him about your aunt just yet.
He's in a delicate mental state.
The slightest bit of bad news could send him spiraling right back into a coma.
I understand.
Mr. Adams, you have a visitor.
- Is it Lucille?
- No, sir, it's not your dead wife.
It's your nephew Rick.
Remember, no bad news.
Now, sir, here you go.
This is my bill.
- You did surgery on me?
- Yes, sir, we confused you with one of our sex-change patients, but don't worry, we didn't remove your penis.
We did cut your testicles off, but, well, since your wife's dead, you won't be needing them anyway.
You just want to keep his spirits up.
He'll land on his feet in no time.
We are gathered today to say goodbye
- to Lucille Adams.
- Goodbye!
And now the eulogy.
It's tragic to think this is the last time that I can look upon my wife's face.
God, Lucille!
How could you take her from me?
I can't live without her!
Ahhh!
Lucille!
Snookie lumps!
I'm sorry, there's been a terrible mistake.
- This is your wife.
- Ah!
She is this man's wife.
Give me five minutes.
- Uncle Albert!
- I'm not finished.
You're one lucky guy.
Now... where's Lucille?
Ah, Lucille!
I do have this coupon for a cremation.
Rick?
I am so sorry for your loss.
What is it?
I know I said some things, but now more than ever, I realize... we can never be together.
I don't believe you.
You love me, Rick.
I know you do.
Jill, trust me.
I'm telling you this for your own good.
I don't love you.
You're no longer in my five.
How could you?
# When I was young #
# I never needed anyone #
# Makin' love was just for fun #
# Those days are gone #
# All by myself #
# Don't wanna be #
# All by myself #
# Anymore #
# All by myself #
# Don't wanna be #
# All by myself. #
# Anymore #
# All by myself #
# Don't want to be #
# All by myself #
# Anymore #
# All by myself. #
You can't keep getting lucky, man.
You only beat me by two strokes this time.
And the back nine is what killed.
Oh my God!
- Look at this place.
- Yo, what are you doing, man?
You gotta pull yourself together, dude.
What's the point?
Look at you...
eating junk food, wearing fake beards, and we found your costume in the garbage outside.
Yeah, well, I'm not the Dragonfly anymore.
But you said the Hourglass was going to kill thousands of people.
I told you I'm no hero.
All right?
Aunt Lucille's dead,
I've rejected the only girl I've ever loved and I can't even fly.
I wish I'd never been bitten by that stupid dragonfly.
And maybe your father shouldn't have given you this after all.
Look at the words your ancestors inscribed in that ring.
"Honor, valor, sacrifice, duty, commitment, bravery, justice, integrity, brotherhood, self-esteem, low prices, affordable housing, loose-fitting pants, cheap internet porn."
The rest is in Latin.
Rick, the hero's path is dangerous.
You may fail or you may fly.
All that matters is that you do it for the best of reasons.
Helping others, Rick, that's what makes you a real hero.
Maybe you're right, but even if I wanted to stop the Hourglass,
I wouldn't know where to start.
I mean, where's he gonna find thousands of people in one place?
Look.
Reporting here live from the Empire City convention center where thousands of people are in one place, but none of them more important than the attendees of the World Humanity Awards.
I'll drive.
Well, that shortcut through the playground sure saved us some time.
You go ahead,
I'll find a place to park.
Mister, please stop!
Each year the World Humanity Awards are held to honor the greatest achievements on behalf of all humanity.
This gala event is expected to draw the world's most prestigious leaders to Empire City.
- Excuse us, excuse us!
- "Empire City Times."
Damn!
Look, there go Prince Charles.
And Nelson Mandela.
Nelson!
Hey, I was in jail too, man.
One of the guests here is the Hourglass.
But which one?
Thank you so much for inviting us, Mr. Landers.
Well, when you're being honored by the world, you want your family with you.
Perhaps one day, you could be part of our family too.
Ladies and gentlemen, our first award is for the medical breakthrough of the year.
For his company's pioneering work in the field of feminine hygiene
I award Lou Landers douchebag of the year.
# Douchebag #
# He's the douchebag of the year #
# Now ain't he great, folks?
#
# Ain't he grand?
The douchebag of the year. #
# Douchebag #
# He's Mr. Douchebag of the year #
# Look at him smile, look at him shine #
# He's the douchebag of, the douchebag of the year. #
Hold up the douchebag!
Hold up the douchebag, sir.
Stop right there, Landers.
Mr. Riker.
So... you know.
You're damn right I do.
Someone in this auditorium is the Hourglass.
I need your help to figure out who it is.
Now the Hourglass could be anyone... a guest of honor... maybe even a stagehand.
This may be nothing, but I did see a man with what looked like a canister of cerillium.
Who?
- This year's lifetime achievement award...
- Him.
...goes to one of the world's greatest souls,
His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.
This man isn't who you think he is, he's the Hourglass.
No no, I'm a man of peace.
Shut up!
You're plotting to kill all these people and I can prove it.
Show the world the armor you're hiding under these robes.
You can't fool me, Hourglass.
You're packing 10 lbs of Cerillium under there.
- What?
- Ahh!
Take him down.
Tutu.
Peace!
Pea...
Shit shit shit shit shit.
You!
You're the Hourglass.
It's a pity you saw that, my dear.
Perhaps this will help you forget.
What are you doing?
Take me.
Hourglass!
- Hero con?
- It's a convention for people who like to dress up as their favorite heroes and villains.
- By the way, your costume sucks.
- Out of my way!
Excuse me, there is a line.
No, you're killing him all wrong.
It's like this.
Better.
Oh, shit.
Hourglass, you'll never get away with this!
Forget it, Dragonfly.
You're too late.
Run!
Yeah.
Goodbye... little fly.
Dragonfly!
- No!
- Ahhh!
My eye!
So, are you gonna keep the body, or...
Eh.
Dragonfly, you must stop the Hourglass.
I can't.
I can't fly.
If there is one lesson my life can teach, it is that the spirit is stronger than the body.
The hero comes from within.
Those are Celine Dion lyrics.
Whatever.
It's still true.
You're right.
It's working.
Sorry.
Watch, Dragonfly, as your city dies.
Where... am I?
You're with me, your lover.
Dragonfly!
No.
- No.
- Only now do you understand.
Oh, come...
Aha!
I need you to jerk this off.
Yeah.
There's not enough time.
Oh fuck.
- It's over.
- Dragonfly!
Jill!
Gotcha.
- Rick?
- You didn't think I'd let anything happen to the girl I love, did you?
Well, we're still falling.
Damn it!
If only I could fly.
Maybe I wasn't cut out to be a hero.
You know, maybe I was meant to have a normal job... an accountant, a gym teacher.
- This is a really tall building.
- Rick!
I don't care what happens anymore.
If I die, I die happily in your arms.
You're my hero, Rick Riker, and I love you.
Yes!
Oh, thank God!
We only have 50 stories left.
Hang on.
Thank you, Dragonfly.
Because of you, our city is safe at last.
- You said it, Dr. Hawking.
- Shit!
It's a happy ending for us all.
Let's go get some dinner.
I'm buying.
Who am I?
I'm Rick Riker.
I'm the Dragonfly.
And as long as there's crime and injustice
I will forever be a superhero...
I am the Hourglass!

# Don't worry you're safe... #
# In my arms so green #
# It's easy. #
#I need a hero #
#I need a hero #
# I'm calling out, I want you here #
# This is my 011 #
# I'm sinking down into the fear #
# That I just can't outrun #
# To save myself all I can see #
# Is that I've got no choice #
# I cry for help and pray you'll be #
# The one who hears my voice #
# I need a hero #
# Someone to rescue me when I'm in a mess #
# Whenever I'm falling, someone to be my safety net #
# I need a hero watching over me #
# I need a hero in my time of need #
# To fix it when it's going wrong #
# To be big and strong, you know that I need a hero #
# Waited my whole life #
# For someone like you #
# And I think it's time #
# For my dreams to come true #
# If only you could hear me #
# I know you'd be near me #
# You'll never let me go #
#Oh, I need a hero #
# I need a hero #
# Someone to rescue me when I'm in a mess #
# Whenever I'm falling, someone to be my safety net #
# I need a hero watching over me #
# I need a hero in my time of need #
# To fix it when it's going wrong #
# To be big and strong, you know that I need a hero. #

Hello?
Andi, hey!
Yeah, everything's on schedule.
Dinner might be a little bit late.
No, I want to cook for you.
No, you won't get food poisoning.
All right, I'll see you in a bit.
"Debone chicken."
Why?
Why did you betray us?
!
Tony?
Tony, I swear I was tricked by the devil!
Look into my eyes.
I didn't betray you!
Oh, God.
I know.
I know, Sam.
Come here.
Did I hurt you?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
What's it say next?
Uh, debone chicken.
Okay, easy enough.
Oh, that's how you do that.
So I'm leaving my apartment... dropping out of society altogether... except for my Bon Appetit magazines.
They're what keep me sane... but it's just not safe to be around anymore.
Where you gonna go?
Oh, Steve and I had this little ramshackle place in the country.
We... were gonna retire there.
But now it's perfect for what I need... to fight against... the devil.
- To do what?
- To defeat him!
I'm going to rebuild the army.
Pass the paprika.
Tony, I think the better way to defeat the devil... is with Steve's plan.
Random acts of kindness, pay it forward... that's what's gonna stop the devil!
Hey.
Hey.
You're early.
Yeah, sorry, I just felt guilty... with you doing everything on your own.
No, it's fine.
Were you talking to someone?
Just me.
Just...
I was reading the cookbook.
Oh, because I heard two voices.
Yeah, I like to give different voices to the ingredients.
Urrr... zucchini.
Well, it smells great.
Yeah.
It's the paprika.
So we still on for lunch?
Definitely.
Anything you want from the meat truck, my treat.
You, sir, are an amazing boyfriend.
- Bye.
- Bye.
What's going on here?
Take a look.
Hey.
Hey.
So... you're back together, huh?
Yeah.
I decided to give the poor thing one more shot... see how she handles herself, you know?
I hope you guys both know how lucky you are... to have strong, proud, intelligent women.
It's hard to find love.
I should know.
Don't.
Just don't, man.
Don't mope.
Don't go down that road.
You wanna find a girl, we will help you find a girl!
You must have your eye on somebody.
I got nothing.
Well, of course you got nothin'.
You choose to got nothin'.
All right, Ben, come on.
Show me the list.
What list?
This list right here.
The one you've had...
Benji!
The one you've had in your back pocket... for ten years, all right?
So let's see, what would you like?
You would like...
"a girl who's funny," sure...
"smart...
"piercing green eyes...
"delicate wrists...
"independently wealthy...
"a trained masseuse."
Sensual.
Uh-huh.
"A fan of mixed martial arts."
Tough.
"Familiar with the works of Ms. Sue Grafton."
Intellectual.
Sue Grafton?
Really?
Oh, alphabet novels are sick... and G Is for Gumshoe is so off the hook!
Point is, Ben, we all wanna date this girl... but it isn't gonna happen.
You know why?
She doesn't exist!
Now listen to me, Ben.
I am going to spit some scientific fact at you.
The longer most men are in a relationship... the happier they get.
The opposite is true for the ladyfolk, okay?
So we would just like to see you happy... making a woman miserable like we're both doing.
So kill the ridiculous list, okay?
- Well, I could...
- Kill the list.
Heads up!
Nice header there, Becks.
Oh, look at you, man.
I kick a soccer ball right at your head... and you're grinning like an idiot.
No, I'm not grinning.
Maybe this'll put a smile on your face.
Now, you see number five over there?
And the one over there by the jungle gym?
And that one over by the tree?
Don't tell me they're all souls.
No.
They're all related.
They all have different mothers, but the same father.
Okay.
But they don't know that.
See?
And as a matter of fact...
I don't think any of the mothers know that, either... that this man... is the father.
He now goes by the name Jack King.
Yup.
Old Jack's not only their father... he's also the proud father of a few hundred other children.
A few hundred?
Yeah.
He's a true narcissist, a man after my own heart.
I mean, what is he, a serial rapist?
Wow, you go to the dark place fast.
No, nothing like that.
No, Jack's method of conception is somewhat less conventional.
I can assure you that the sperm in our bank... comes from the highest caliber contributor.
Here is our donor book.
You can start flipping through, but I have to say...
I think I have the perfect guy for you.
Yeah, I'd have to say he's pretty much the total package.
So where do we find him?
Devil says Jack opened up shop again at a new sperm bank.
Oh, fun.
- Whoa.
Vessel.
- Huh?
Oh.
What?
That doesn't look all that...
Whoa!
Oh, sweet Lord in hell!
Oh, thank you, devil.
Thank you so, so much.
- May I?
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
He is Duncan McLeod, the Highlander.
The Highlander doesn't have a scythe.
He is Duncan McLeod... the Highlander who now has a scythe.
All right.
Let's just get on with it.
Okay, take it easy.
Easy.
Sweet.
Let's go.
Hi.
You ready for lunch?
Oh.
Um... actually I already ate.
Oh.
That's my fault.
I challenged Sam to an eating contest.
I won.
Yeah, Sock brought in a bunch of food.
It was paella.
It's Spanish for rice.
But I promise you I'll make it up to you, okay?
Okay.
No problem.
Hey.
So, did the devil happen to mention to you... what this semen demon's special powers are?
I don't think so.
Okay, 'cause my head is goin'... to some pretty awful places with this one.
Hi.
We'd like to become donors.
Fill these out.
Just so you know... we have an extremely rigorous selection process.
That's good.
So do I.
What college did you attend?
Harvard.
I went to Oxford.
Yeah, but I also went to Yale Medical School.
I research alternate power sources.
I have a four-foot vertical leap.
Hey, there he is.
Come in.
Hey, Jack.
Hello.
You're not here for a deposit, are you?
I don't know.
We might be making one big deposit today.
You, back to hell.
No, wait.
No.
Come on, you don't think I really belong in hell!
I was just trying to make the world a better place.
And I did.
No, please, don't do this.
I have children to think of.
Hundreds and hundreds of children.
Did you mean to cut his head off?
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
They're over here!
No, this way!
I don't know what to do.
I cut...
Cut him again.
Cut him again.
You morons!
You're carving up a masterpiece!
You're destroying art!
All right.
Now, now, hold on one second.
Before you send me back, tell me... how do I look?
Wait, stupid question.
I know I look great.
So, we good?
Yeah.
I feel kinda hungry.
- What do you wanna get?
- I don't know.
I feel like ham for some reason.
Let's do it.
Hey, Ben.
Want the rest of my pretzel?
I can't finish it.
Are you kidding?
I know you love your pretzels.
Are you sure?
It's my fifth one of the day.
Oh, my God!
Come on, that is not safe.
All right.
What's that?
Uh, nothing.
It's...
It's nothing.
What?
Just let me see.
No, it's just a stupid list... about everything I want in a girlfriend, and it's long... and I'm gonna cut it down so, uh...
This is really great.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
You know, because the guys think it's unrealistic... and they think my standards are too high.
Really?
Oh, Ben, they are wrong.
This girl is out there.
You've just gotta go and find her.
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
Soul mates exist.
I really believe that.
Have you met yours?
Yeah.
When I was twelve.
I was at the mall... and I was sipping an orange juice... and I looked up, and there he was.
Phil Collins.
You hang onto your list, Benjamin... for your Phil Collins is out there, okay?
Oh, that's so funny.
What?
I am almost none of these things.
For you, milady.
What are you doing?
!
- I saw you!
- What?
What?
I saw you, Sam.
You killed that man!
How...
You saw that?
Yeah, how could you do something like that?
Huh?
How?
But I promise you...
I promise you there's an explanation.
Fine.
Please... explain to me how you chopped some guy's head off!
Right.
Right, exactly.
Okay?
Think about that.
Think about how crazy that is.
Me, Sam Oliver, chopping a dude's head off?
I mean, who does that, okay?
I mean, come on.
There has to be an explanation for that... and there is.
Then what is it?
That's the...
That's the thing is...
I can't tell you.
Okay.
I have no other choice.
I have to call the police.
Wait.
Wait!
Wait, Andi, no, you don't, all right?
What you saw me doing today, that was...
That was my other job, all right?
Listen.
And I need a little time to talk to my boss... and once I do that, I can tell you the truth.
Sam, none of this makes sense!
Yeah, but it will.
I promise.
Okay?
Just...
Andi, I'm begging you.
Please.
I need a day.
Just give me one day.
I mean, do you really think I would do something like this?
You have 24 hours.
What's this?
It's the vessel... all ready to go.
Just shoot it on down.
What's this?
Nothing.
Just a...
Just a message for the devil.
Kind of personal.
All right, fine.
I'm...
I'm kind of in a bind here... and I really need to talk to him about something... and I didn't know what else to do, so I wrote him a note.
Can you please just send it?
Whatever.
Thank you.
Next.
Are you familiar with this actress?
The woman does everything.
Amazing range!
It worked.
You got the note.
And you've got a problem.
The soul is still out there.
What do you mean?
I caught him, I dropped him off.
Not all of him.
You missed a piece.
Hey!
This isn't a hookup spot.
You wanna get your jollies off, do it in the alley.
What did you...
Did you kill him?
Is he dead?
I don't know, Sam.
I'm not a doctor.
He's still breathing.
Oh, thank heavens.
Now, look... could we just talk about the fact that the soul is still on the loose?
I told you, I got him.
Really?
Well, this footage was taken less than an hour ago.
That's him.
How is that even possible?
Jack's all about multiplying.
He's like a starfish.
Cut off a limb, grow a whole new Jack.
You must have missed a piece.
Okay, fine.
I promise I'll catch him, but I need to talk to you.
Something happened.
I need to tell Andi the truth about you.
What do you mean, something happened?
Well, she sorta... saw me chop Jack's head off.
And why did she sorta see that?
Because she followed me.
Because you're getting sloppy, Sammy.
Jeez!
She said she's going to the cops.
I don't see another option, I have to tell her!
I mean, I promise...
I can make her keep the secret, but I don't see another way.
Well... maybe we can work out something.
Anything.
But one day I will come to you, and I will need a favor.
Done.
Before you say yes, think on this.
It could be a big favor.
In fact, it probably will be.
Oh, hell, let's be honest, it'll be terrible.
Doesn't matter, I'm in.
All right.
Well, you keep Andi from talking... and you can tell her... about us.
But you'll owe me.
Do we have a deal?
Yeah, we have a deal.
So let me see if I got this straight.
You promised the devil a favor.
Is that what you're telling me?
That's great, Sam.
Another deal with the devil.
That's, um, always a good plan.
What choice did I have?
It's the only way he would let me tell her the truth.
I have to tell her.
Today.
You want us there when you do it?
Yeah, I could use the backup.
You got it, homeboy.
Hey, Ben.
Could I use your conditioner?
- Hi, guys.
- Oh, hey.
Yeah.
Um, it's the one... in the green bottle with the kelp extract.
Nice.
Thank you.
What?
It just helps to tame the frizziness... and really maintain manageability...
Not the shampoo, dum-dum.
The girl.
Did you hook up with Sara?
What?
No.
I...
No.
I just... got married.
What the hell are you talking about?
She needed a green card, and I felt sorry for her, okay?
And, look, it just happened all really quickly.
So she's living here now?
Just for a little while.
You know, just to make it look real.
You are too stupid to exist.
Why?
I like Sara.
I think she's great.
I think she'd make an excellent citizen... and she paid me 1,600 bucks.
You know what, I take it all back, buddy.
That is awesome.
That is outstanding.
She is beautiful, beautiful!
We got married!
Andi, before I tell you what I have to tell you... you should take this.
I'll take it.
Andi, what I'm about to tell you... is gonna change everything you think you knew about... the world... the universe, life, death... everything.
It'll explain all those times I've been weird... or showed up late to something.
It's that part of my life I told you that I couldn't talk about.
Sam works for the devil.
What?
It's not that big of a deal.
My other job that I was telling you about?
I'm a bounty hunter for hell.
Andi, hold on!
Where are you going?
Is this your idea of some sick joke?
Before I was born, my parents got into some trouble... and to get out of it, they sold my soul to the devil.
Oh, shut up!
Hey!
I'm not joking, okay?
When a soul escapes from hell, I have to capture it.
What you saw us doing the other day... that was an escaped soul.
You only have a few hours left.
If you don't come up with a real explanation...
I'm going to the police.
Wait...
Andi.
How'd it go?
Where the hell were you guys?
I was dying over there.
She didn't believe any of it!
Sorry.
I had to wait for the chili cheese fries.
My wife called.
Oh, where you goin'?
To get the stupid soul.
You do know that the creator... didn't make you in his image, right?
The Bible was just being nice.
Where's Jack?
The soul's not gonna come back here, Sam.
He knows you're onto him.
Any other bright ideas?
Yeah.
I found his datebook.
It shows due dates for all his upcoming babies.
But you're too distracted by this business with the girl.
She didn't believe you, did she?
- No.
- They never do.
So what's your solution?
I'll think of something.
I'm a little concerned this thing with Andi... is gonna continue to be a problem.
I want it handled.
I said I'll take care of it.
Yeah.
I know.
You've said that to me before too many times.
I just may have to handle this problem myself.
Andi, it's me.
Again.
Please give me a call back when you get this.
You can't go to the police, all right?
You're in danger.
Not from me... directly.
Just give me a call back, okay?
Guys, I can't find Andi anywhere.
Okay.
Relax, all right?
Take a deep breath.
Relax?
What if she goes to the police?
Sam, I wouldn't worry about that.
Are you kidding me?
You know what happens if she goes to the police?
The devil is going to fix the problem.
Okay?
And we all know what that means.
He has a very different definition of fix than we do.
All right.
Sam, listen to your Uncle Sock, okay?
Everything is going to be all right.
Andi's life is in danger.
She'll be fine.
We... kinda solved that problem.
What does that even mean?
Solved it, how?
Come on, guys, let me outta here!
What are you doing?
Let her go.
Sam!
Hey!
This is the only way to stop her.
What?
Tying her up and throwing her in the trunk... was the only way?
She is very comfortable in there, okay?
I threw in fresh blankies, some pillows... a little bundle of, uh...
- potpourri.
- Potpourri.
Solving the problem?
This isn't solving the problem.
This is adding a felony on top of the problem.
Better this than what the devil would do to her.
He's right, Sam.
Ben speaks truth.
This is a solid plan.
All right, all right.
So, what's the plan?
What are we gonna do with her?
We didn't actually...
We didn't think through that far.
Hey, hi.
How are you?
Brought you a juice box.
Sam, what are you doing?
Get me outta here, all right?
I can't breathe back here.
God, what are you doing?
Get me outta here.
Andi, I can't.
No.
Listen, you know what?
You know what?
I believe you.
Okay?
You work for the devil.
Andi, I know you're lying, okay?
I'll know when you believe what I'm saying.
Fine.
Then if you can't let me outta here... then can I please have that juice box?
The potpourri back here is burning my throat.
Yes, absolutely.
So...
Get me outta this trunk right now... or I'm gonna rip your throat out, you mother...!
Let me guess.
The wife?
Yeah.
She wants me to bring home some half-and-half.
Oh, my God.
The nerve.
I don't...
Well, you tell her... 1,600 bucks may buy her U.S. Citizenship... but it does not buy your wonder twins, all right?
Yeah.
Tell that lazy fog-breather go get her own half-and-half.
Sam!
Sammy, we're here.
Andi, let him go!
Keep breathing, buddy, we gotcha.
Breathe.
When I get outta here, I swear I'm gonna kill all of you.
That was horrifying.
Really, Sam?
Horrifying?
Really?
You stick your head in there, man!
You'll see your own death.
I don't wanna stick my head in the trunk.
Wait.
Wait, that's it.
That's how we make her believe.
We scare it into her.
Slow down, Sock.
You're gonna miss it.
It's up ahead, right there.
Right here?
So that's Tony's little gourmet hideaway, huh?
Yeah.
I asked the landlord... where he was forwarding Tony's magazines to.
Oh, good.
Always wanted to build a log cabin.
Hey, what's that?
They're demons.
- Hey.
- Whoa.
Whoa.
What are you doing?
- No, no.
No.
No.
- Tony, I'm sorry.
It's not safe for you to be coming here like this.
It's okay.
We're...
Shut up.
Get in the circle.
Out of range from you know who.
What's his problem?
Okay, it's safe.
What is wrong with you?
The devil might have followed you here.
What's he gonna find out here?
All of the recruits... the soldiers for the new rebellion.
Look, don't get me wrong.
We're happy to have you.
- It's just a little risky is all.
- Tony... we're not here for the rebellion.
You're not?
Well, what are you here for?
We kinda have another problem.
Okay.
Go right.
Okay, now go right.
Okay.
Let me go, you sickos!
- Andi...
- Whoa, little dogie!
Whoa!
Gonna take it nice and easy like, all right?
Nice and easy.
Sam, she's got nipple!
Sam!
Nipple!
Calm down.
It'll be clear to you... in a few seconds.
You're gonna see proof, okay?
Andi, you remember Tony?
Please tell 'em to let me go.
I do not want to be here.
They will, Andi.
We just need to show you something first... and then you'll be free to do whatever you choose.
What?
Show me what?
Andi, Tony is a demon.
He's a demon from hell.
Show her.
Show her.
Okay.
Oh, a word of warning.
Please do not pee on the carpet.
I just put it down.
Okay.
Where's a good spot?
Okay.
Oh, sweet!
Hold on, fella!
Tony.
See?
It's true.
- Andi...
- Why?
Oh, that always happens... and it always hurts.
- I gotta go get her.
- Oh, don't worry.
There's nothing around for miles.
She has nowhere to run to.
Did you leave the keys in the car?
It's possible.
Thanks for the lift.
Oh, well, believe me... it's always a pleasure hanging out with you boys.
Hey, don't be strangers.
We won't.
Tone-star... can you do that thing one more time, please?
For me?
Come on, please.
Once.
Oh, now I see why Steve loved you so much.
Oh, see, now, that's inappropriate.
That's a compliment.
I know, but it's still offensive.
- You got a nice tongue.
- Thanks again, Tony.
No problem.
Sam.
I hope everything goes well with Andi.
Be patient.
I'm sick of being patient.
It's like every time I get close to her, something happens.
I don't know.
Maybe it's not supposed to happen.
Do you love her?
Yeah.
Do you know how rare love is?
You can't just turn away... just because you hit a few speed bumps.
Now, Steve and I, we...
We had our issues, but we worked through them... because we knew at the end... only love matters.
Love is worth any sacrifice.
Oh, look at me.
Diarrhea of the mouth.
All right.
I better get back... because, um, I get a little nervous... when I spend too much time out of the circle.
Be safe.
You too, Sam, and, hey, we need you.
Vive la resistance.
No sign of Andi.
No one's seen her.
She never clocked in for her shift, either.
Yeah, and she never went home last night.
She could be anywhere.
I doubt she went to the police.
I mean, what's she gonna tell 'em?
"Oh, I saw a big gay demon."
Okay, she's probably hiding, praying heavily right now.
Jack's calendar.
I forgot about this.
If we're gonna keep the devil off our backs... there's one place we need to be.
Is she dilated?
How's her breathing?
Who are you?
The one she'll be thanking later.
Which one's yours?
That one right there.
And that one.
And maybe that one.
Jack's got a busy week.
Real bumper crop of babies.
All right.
We need to split up.
I'll take the emergency exit.
Sock, you take the front.
Ben, go round to the side.
Got it.
Where have you been?
You promised me you'd take care of this Andi situation.
I tried to... but she ran away from me.
I can't find her.
Oh, I fixed that problem.
She's in the trunk.
This is your last chance to get it right.
Andi, are you okay?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know how the hell I got in here.
Are you all right?
You're safe.
You're safe.
Look, I'm sorry you're freaked out.
I didn't know how else...
No.
Sam, no.
It's okay.
I understand.
Okay, after what I saw and what Tony is...
I believe you.
Andi, listen to me.
You have to promise me... you will not tell anyone about this.
Ever.
I promise.
- You do?
- Yeah.
Gee, that's great.
That's great.
That's great.
Listen, I have to go do something... but when I get back, why don't you come over... and we can talk about this and...
No, no, no, no.
I can't.
- Why?
- I can't handle it.
It's too much.
Andi, I love you.
I know this is a weird time to say it, but...
I love you.
I'm... afraid of you.
Excuse me.
Where is the place that women have babies?
Aren't you a little old to just be figuring that out?
No, I know where women have babies.
I was referring to where the room is, yeah.
It's down the hall.
Just make a left.
Okay.
All right.
Cool.
All right.
Is that a Sue Grafton novel?
Y is for yes.
How do you feel about mixed martial arts?
- Hey.
- Hey.
Have you seen the baby ward?
Oh, no.
I thought...
I was following around a pregnant woman for a while... but turns out it was just a bloated dude... with a bad case of the farts, you know?
Whoa.
It's him.
Jack, don't...
Don't run.
Stay back.
Jack, it's over, man.
You're not getting past us.
Goodbye, old friend.
I got it.
You sneaky son of a bitch.
Where are you?
I'm sorry.
Don't mind me.
I'm just having a...
We have a rat problem.
You have delicate wrists.
How do you handle jujitsu?
Benji, need some help.
Runaway hand.
Come on.
I'll be back, and me and you, okay?
Just...
You can't hold me off forever, Jack.
I think you're right.
- Sam?
- Andi, get outta here!
Wait here.
I'll be right back.
It's in here.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's in here.
Okay.
Let's go ahead and bag him, yeah.
Where are you, guy?
Come on.
Get outta there.
Oh, God!
I know you're not gonna let me die today!
- Naked guy!
- Naked!
Naked guy on my back!
Somebody help me!
It's not good!
Oh, Ben, that was horrible.
Oh, God.
It looked horrible.
I can still feel it.
Is there a mark?
Andi?
You think she'll show up?
Andi?
Sure.
She'll definitely be here.
You know what she said?
She was afraid of me.
Aw, come on.
You're lovable.
Oh, who could be afraid of this guy right here?
Look at him.
Look at that little cheek.
Hey.
What?
Oh.
The old ball and chain.
I got some wedding rings.
From e-Bay.
Cool.
Yes.
Well, speaking of cool, um...
I wanted to thank you for the pep talk the other day... because I didn't give up on my list... and I found my Phil Collins, and her name is Cassidy.
Yay.
I'm very happy for you.
But no.
What?
Well, you know, you're married.
Not really.
Well, yes, really.
Look.
Think.
What if Immigration come calling round?
They're cracking down on these green-card marriages.
Listen up.
Problem solved.
You tell them that you have an open green-card marriage.
Thank you, Sock.
Listen, you made a deal, and I expect you to live up to it.
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna go on a date with Cassidy.
I'm not letting you go.
Fine.
Then I'll just report you to Immigration.
Fine.
Then I'll report you extorted money from me... and we will both go to jail.
You know, screw it.
I'll just give her back her money.
Well, now, Benjamin... let's not make any rash decisions here, okay?
'Cause at the end of the day... there may not be all that much money to give back.
We'll talk about it later while we enjoy our floor seats... at the "Blue-Collar Comedy Tour:
Lowest Common Denominator."
Yeah!
Andi, hey.
- So?
- So.
Weird day?
Sort of.
Although you've been a weirdo for months, Sam.
It's just now at least I understand why.
You were trying to protect me.
That's true.
That's completely true.
Although I've gotta say...
I'm stunned you've managed to survive this long.
I mean, I should've never been afraid of you.
I should've been afraid for you.
Yeah, it's a miracle any of us are still alive.
Yeah.
Outside the hospital when you told me that you love me... did you say that because you meant it... or because you didn't want me to go to the cops?
Both.
Uh-oh.
Look at this.
Look how sweet you two are.
I knew that locking you in the trunk of my car... would work out for the best.
You loved it, didn't you?
Come on.
Don't sweat it.
It's just part of the job.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
So does this job pay anything?
Yes.
Sam has to get us beer whenever we demand it.
So, you know, beer.
All we can handle.
- Beer.
- More beer.
Throw your hands up, beer.
I'm going.
I'm going.
Now, what a lovely place.
So rustic, so remote.
What are we doing here?
Sam, Sam, Sam,
I think you know the answer to that.
Remember how quick you were to give up that favor?
So impetuous.
You really ought to think before you act.
There's something going on in there.
Beyond the circle, I can't see or hear.
I need an inside man.
I want details... names, dates, you know, that sort of thing.
You want me to spy on Tony?
You want me to betray my friend?
Oh, please.
Don't be so melodramatic, but yes.
If you want to use those words, yes.
Hey, come on.
That's the deal you made, man.
You tell Andi your secret, you owe me a favor.
Or we could discuss the consequences... for you and Andi if you refuse.
Well, Sam... what's your answer?
Sam?
Hey.
Thought I saw you out here.
Why don't you come on in?
I don't know.
I think you could be a real help.
Come on inside.
There's some people I really want you to meet.
Come on.
Cold out here.
Yeah.
It's freezing.

Hello?
Andi, hey.
Yeah, everything's on schedule.
Dinner might be a little bit late.
No, i want to cook for you.
Heh, no.
No, you won't get food poisoning.
All right, i'll see you in a bit.
"Debone chicken."
All right.
Aaah!
Why?
Why did you betray us?
Tony?
Tony!
I swear i s tricked by the devil!
Look into my eyes.
I didn't betray you!
I... i--I know.
I know, i know, i know, sam.
Come here.
Did i hurt you?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Needs a little garlic.
What's it say next?
Uh, debone chicken.
Ok, easy enough.
Oh.
That's how you do that.
I'm, uh, leaving my apartment,
Dropping out of society altogether.
Except for my bon appit magazines.
They're what keep me sane.
But it's just not safe to be around anymore.
Where are you gonna go?
Oh, steve and i had this little ramshackle place in the country.
We...were gonna retire there.
But now it's perfect for what i need.
To fight against... the devil.
To do what?
To defeat him.
I'm going to rebuild the army.
Pass the paprika.
Sam: tony, i think the better way
To defeat the devil is with steve's plan.
Random acts of kindness, pay it forward.
That's what's going to stop the devil.
Andi: hey.
Hey!
You're early.
Yeah, sorry,
I just felt guilty with you doing everything on your own.
No, it's fine.
Were--Were you talking to someone?
Just me.
Just, i was--I was reading the...cookbook.
Oh. 'Cause i heard 2 voices.
Yeah.
I like to give different voices to the ingredients.
[Deep voice] grr, zucchini.
Well, it smells great.
Yeah.
Um... it's the paprika.
So are we still on for lunch?
Definitely.
Anything you want from the meat truck, my treat.
You, sir, are an amazing boyfriend.
Heh.
Bye.
Bye.
What's goin' on here?
Take a look.
Hey.
Both: hey.
So, you're back together, huh?
Yeah, decided to give the poor thing one more shot,
See how she handles herself, you know?
I hope you guys both know how lucky you are
To have strong, proud, intelligent women.
It's hard to find love.
I should know.
Don't--Just don't, man.
Don't mope.
Don't go down that road.
You want to find a girl,
We will help you find a girl!
You must have your eye on somebody.
I got nothing.
Of course you've got nothing.
You choose to got nothing.
All right, man, come on, show me the list.
What list?
What list?
!
What list?
You got this list.
The one--Benji!
The one you've had in your back pocket
For 10 years, all right?
So let's see, what would you like?
You would like a girl who's funny, sure,
Smart, piercing green eyes,
Delicate wrists, independently weathy,
A trained masseuse.
Essential.
Uh-Huh.
A fan of mixed-Martial arts.
Tough.
Familiar with the works of ms.
Sue grafton.
Intellectual.
Sue grafton, really?
Oh, alphabet novels are sick,
And g is for gumshoe is so off the hook.
[Sighs] point is, ben,
We all want to date this girl,
But it isn't gonna happen, you know why?
She doesn't exist.
Now listen to me, ben,
I am going to spit some scientific fact at you.
The longer most men are in a relationship,
The happier they get.
The opposite is true for the lady folk, ok?
So we would just like to see you happy
Making a woman miserable, like we're both doing.
So, kill the ridiculous list, ok?
Kill the list.
Devil: head's up.
Ow!
Nice header there, becks.
Oh, look at you, man.
I kick a soccer ball right at your head,
And you're grinning like an idiot.
I'm not grinning.
[Laughs] maybe this will put a smile on your face.
You see number five over there?
And the one over there by the jungle gym?
And that one over by the tree?
Sam: don't tell me they're all souls.
No.
They're all related.
They all have different mothers,
But the same father.
Ok.
But they don't know that, see?
As a matter of fact, i don't think
Any of the mothers know that, either.
That this man... is the father.
He now goes by the name jack king.
Yep, ol' jack's not only their father,
He's also the proud father of a few hundred other children.
A few hundred?
Yeah.
He's a true narcissist.
A man after my own heart.
I mean, what is he, a serial rapist?
Wow.
You go to the dark place fast.
No, nothing like that.
No, jack's method of conception
Is somewhat less conventional.
I can assure you that the sperm in our bank
Comes from the highest caliber contributor.
Here is our donor book.
You can start flipping through,
But i have to say,
I think i have the perfect guy for you.
Yeah, i'd have to say, he's pretty much the total package.
Sock: so where do we find him?
Devil says jack opened up shop again at a new sperm bank.
Oh, fun.
Whoa.
Vessel.
Huh?
Oh.
What?
That doesn't look all that--Whoa!
Oh, sweet lord in hell!
Oh, thank you, devil.
Thank you so, so much.
May i?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
He's duncan mcleod, the highlander.
The highlander doesn't have a scythe.
He's duncan mcleod, the highlander, who now has a scythe.
All right, let's just get on with it.
Ok, take it easy, easy.
Sweet, let's go.
Hi.
You ready for lunch?
Oh, um, actually, i already ate.
Oh.
It's my fault.
I challenged sam to an eating contest.
I won, heh.
Yeah.
Yeah, sock brought in a bunch of food.
It was paella.
It's spanish for rice.
But i promise you i'll...
i'll make it up to you, ok?
Ok.
No problem.
Hey, so, uh,
Did the devil happen to mention to you
What this semen demon's special powers are?
I don't think so.
Ok. 'Cause my head has gone
To some pretty awful places with this one.
Hi, uh, we'd like to become donors.
Mm-Hmm.
Fill these out.
Just so you know,
We have an extremely...
rigorous
Selection process.
Oh, that's good.
So do i.
What college did you attend?
Harvard.
I went to oxford.
Yeah, but i also went to yale medical school.
I research alternate power sources.
I have a 4-Foot vertical leap.
[Whispering] hey.
There he is.
[Unsheathes scythe] jack: come in.
Sam: hey, jack.
Hello, heh.
You're not here for a deposit, are you?
I don't know, we may be making one big deposit today--
You back to hell.
Hmm, no.
Come on, you don't think i really belong in hell!
I was just trying to make the world a better place!
And i did!
No, no, please, don't do this!
I--I have children to think of!
Hundreds and hundreds of children!
Did you mean to cut his head off?
!
Uh!
Whoa!
Oh!
They're over here!
Both: aaah!
No, this way.
Sam: i don't know what to do!
I cut him!
Cut him again, cut him again!
You morons!
You're carving up a masterpiece!
You're destroying-- Aah!
All right, now, now,
Hold on one second.
Before you send me back, tell me... how do i look?
Stupid question.
I know i look great.
Sock: so we good?
Sam: yeah.
I feel kinda hungry.
What do you want to get?
I don't know.
I feel like ham for some reason.
Let's do it.
Ben?
Hmm?
Want the rest of my pretzel?
I can't finish it.
Are you kidding?
I know you love your pretzels, are you sure?
It's my fifth one of the day.
Oh, my god, come on, that is not safe.
All right.
What's that?
Uh, nothing.
It's...it's nothing.
What?
Let me see.
No, it's just this stupid list
About everything i want in a girlfriend,
And it's long, and i'm going to cut it down, so i--
This is really great.
Really?
Mm-Hmm.
You know, because the guys think it's unrealistic,
And they think my standards are too high.
Really?
Oh, ben, they are wrong.
This girl is out there.
You just gotta go and find her.
Yeah?
Mm-Hmm.
Soul mates exist.
I really believe that.
Have you met yours?
Yeah.
When i was 12.
I was at the mall,
And i was sipping an orange julius,
And i looked up and there he was.
Phil collins.
You hang on to your list, benjamin.
Your phil collins is out there, ok?
Oh, that's so funny.
What?
I have almost none of these things.
Hmm.
For you, milady.
Oh!
Ow!
What are you doing?
!
I saw you!
What, what?
!
I saw you, sam!
You killed that man!
Ow, ow.
You saw that?
Yeah!
How could you do something like that?
Huh?
How?
I promise you-- I promise you,
There's an explanation.
Fine.
Please,
Explain to me how you chopped
Some guy's head off!
Right.
Right, exactly.
Ok?
Think about that.
Think about how crazy that is.
Me?
Sam oliver,
Chopping a dude's head off?
I mean... who does that?
Ok?
I mean, come on.
There has to be an explanation for that, and there is.
Then what is it?
Um... that's the-- That's the thing,
Is...i can't tell you.
Ok.
I have no other choice.
I have to call the police.
Wait, wait, wait, andi, no, you don't!
All right?
What you saw me doing today,
That was--That--
That was my other job, all right?
Listen, and i need a little time to talk to my boss,
And once i do that, i can tell you the truth.
Sam!
None of this makes sense!
Yeah, but it will!
I promise, ok?
Just...andi, i'm begging you, please.
I need a day.
Just give one day.
I mean, do you really think i would do something like this?
You have 24 hours.
What's this?
It's the vessel, all ready to go.
Just shoot it on down.
What's this?
Nothing.
Just a message for the devil.
Kind of personal.
All right, fine, i-- I'm kind of in a bind here,
And i really need to talk to him about something,
And i didn't know what else to do, so i wrote him a note.
Can you please-- Can you please just send it?
[Sighs] whatever.
Thank you.
Next.
Are you familiar with this actress?
The woman does everything.
Amazing range.
It worked.
You got the note.
And you've got a problem.
The soul is still out there.
What do you mean?
I caught him.
I dropped him off.
Not all of him.
You missed a piece.
Hey.
This isn't a hook-Up spot.
You want to get your jollies off, do it in the alley.
What did you-- Did you kill him?
Is he dead?
!
I don't know, sam, i'm not a doctor.
He's still breathing.
Oh, thank heavens.
Now, look,
Can we just talk about the fact that the soul is still on the loose?
I told you i got him.
Really?
This footage was taken less than an hour ago.
Hey, that's him.
How is that even possible?
Jack's all about multiplying.
He's like a starfish.
Cut off a limb, grow a whole new jack.
You must have missed a piece.
Ok, fine, fine.
I promise, i'll catch him.
But i need to talk to you.
Something happened.
I need to tell andi the truth about you.
What do you mean, something happened?
Well, she sort of... saw me chop jack's head off.
And why did she sort of see that?
Because she followed me.
Because you're getting sloppy, sammy.
Jeez!
She said she's going to the cops!
[Sighs] i don't see another option.
I have to tell her.
I mean, i promise,
I can make her keep the secret,
But i don't--I don't see another way.
Well... maybe we can work out something.
Anything.
Well, one day, i will come to you... and i will need a favor.
Done.
Before you say yes, think on this--
Could be a big favor.
In fact, it probably will be.
Well, hell, let's be honest, it'll be terrible.
Doesn't matter, i'm in.
All right.
All right.
Well, then you keep andi from talking,
And you can tell her...
about us.
But you'll owe me.
Do we have a deal?
Yeah.
We have a deal.
You promised the devil a favor.
Is that--Is that what you're telling me?
That's great, sam.
Another deal with the devil.
That's, um, always a good plan.
What choice did i have?
It's the only way he would let me tell her the truth.
I have to tell her.
Today.
You want us there when you do it?
Yeah, i could use a back-Up.
You got it, homeboy.
Hey, ben,
Could i use your conditioner?
Hi, guys.
Oh, hi.
Yeah, um, it's the one in the green bottle
With the kelp extract.
Nice.
Thank you.
What?
It just helps to tame the frizzyness
And to really maintain manageability--
Not the shampoo, dumb dumb, the girl!
When'd you hook up with sara?
What, no?
No, i--No.
I just...got married.
What the hell are you talking about?
She needed a green card,
And i felt sorry for her, ok?
And, look, it just happened all really quickly.
Ok, so she's living here now?
Just for a little while, you know,
Just to make it look real.
You are too stupid to exist.
Why?
I like sara.
I think she's great.
I think she'd make an excellent citizen,
And she paid me 1,600 bucks.
You know, i take it all back, buddy.
That is awesome.
That is outstanding.
She is beautiful!
Beautiful!
We got married!
Sam: andi, before i tell you what i have to tell you... you should take this.
I'll take it.
Ahem.
Andi,
What i'm about to tell you
Is going to change everything
You think you knew about... the world,
The universe, life, death, everything.
It'll explain all those times i've been weird
Or showed up late to something.
It's that part of my life i told you i couldn't talk about.
Sam works for the devil.
What?
What?
It's not that big of a deal.
[Sighs] my other job
That i was telling you about... i'm a bounty hunter for hell.
Andi, hold on!
Where are you going?
Is this your idea of some sick joke?
Before i was born, my parents got into some trouble.
And to get out of it, they... they sold my soul to the devil.
Oh, shut up.
Hey, i'm not joking, ok?
!
Wait a minute!
When a soul escapes from hell, i have to capture it.
What you saw us doing the other day,
That was an escaped soul.
You only have a few hours left.
If you don't come up with a real explanation,
I'm going to the police.
Wait, andi!
Andi!
How'd it go?
Where the hell were you guys?
I was dying over there.
She didn't believe any of it.
Sorry, i had to wait for the chili cheese fries.
My wife called.
Oh, where are you going?
To get the stupid soul.
Devil: you do know that the creator
Didn't make you in his image, right?
The bible was just being nice.
Where's jack?
The soul's not gonna come back here, sam.
He knows you're onto him.
Any other bright ideas?
Yeah.
I found his date book.
Shows due dates for all his upcoming babies.
But you're too distracted by this business with the girl.
She didn't believe you, did she?
No.
They never do.
So what's your solution?
I'll think of something.
I'm a little concerned
This thing with andi's going to continue to be a problem.
I want it handled.
I said i'll take care of it!
Yeah, i know,
You've said that to me before.
Too many times.
I just may have to handle this problem...myself.
Aaah!
Man on phone: seattle pd.
Hello?
Andy it's me again
Please give me a call back when you get this.
You can go to police, all right?
You're in danger.
Not from me...directly.
Just give me a call back, ok?
Guys, i can't find andi anywhere!
Ok, relax, all right?
Take a deep breath.
Relax?
!
What if she goes to the police?
Uh, sam, i wouldn't worry about that.
Are you kidding me?
You know know what happens if she goes to the police?
The devil is going to fix the problem, ok?
And we all know what that means.
He has a very different definition of "fix" than we do.
All right, sam, listen to your uncle sock, ok?
Everything is going to be all right.
Andi's life is in danger!
She'll be fine.
We...kind of solved that problem.
What does that even mean?
Solved it how?
What are you doing?
!
Let her go!
Sam, sam!
Hey, hey, hey!
This is the only way to stop her.
What, tying her up
And throwing her in the trunk was the only way?
She is very comfortable in there, ok?
I threw her fresh blankies, some pillows,
A little bundle of-- Potpourri.
Potpourri.
Solving the problem?
This isn't solving the problem.
This is adding a felony on top of the problem!
Better this than what the devil would do to her.
He's right, sam.
Ben speaks truth.
This is a solid plan.
All right, all right, so what's the plan?
What are we going to do with her?
Uh... we didn't actually-- We didn't think through that far.
Hey, hi, how are ya?
Brought you a juice box.
[Muffled] sam, what are you doing?
!
Get me out of here, all right?
I can't breathe in here!
Ok, here, here.
God, what are you doing?
!
Get me out of here!
Andi, i can't.
No, listen, you know what, you know what,
I believe you.
Ok?
You work for the devil.
Andi, i know you're lying, ok?
I'll know when you believe what i'm saying.
Fine.
If you can't let me out of here,
Then can i please have that juice box?
The potpourri back here is burning my throat.
Yes, absolutely.
Closer.
Get me out of this trunk right now!
I'm going to rip your throat out, you mother--
Let me guess, the wife?
Yeah, she wants me to bring home some half and half.
[Laughs] oh, my god, the nerve.
All right, look, you tell her 1,600 bucks may buy her u.S. Citizenship,
But it does not buy your wonder twins, all right?
Yeah.
Tell that lazy fog breather,
Go get your own half and half.
Sam!
Sam!
Sam!
Sammy, we're here.
Andi, let him go!
Keep breathing', buddy.
We got you.
Breath!
Andi: when i get out of here,
I swear i'm going to kill all of you!
That was horrifying!
Really, sam, horrifying?
Really?
You stick your head in there, man!
You'll see your own death!
I don't want to stick my head in the trunk!
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, that's--That's it.
That's how we make her believe, we scare it into her.
Right here?
So that's tony's little gourmet hideaway, huh?
Yeah, i asked the landlord where he was forwarding tony's magazines to.
Oh, good.
Always wanted to build a log cabin.
Hey, what's that?
They're demons.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
!
No, no, no, no.
It's not safe for you to be coming here like this.
Ok, it's ok.
We're-- Shut up.
Get in a circle.
Out of range from you-Know-Who.
Ben: what's his problem?
[Exhales] ok, it's safe.
What is wrong with you?
The devil might have followed you here!
What's he going to find out here?
All of the recruits, the soldiers for the new rebellion.
Look, don't get me wrong, we are happy to have you,
It's just a little risky, is all.
Tony, we're not here for the rebellion.
You're not?
What--What are you here for?
We kind of have another problem.
Ok, all right, all right, ok, now!
Ok!
Let me go, you psychos!
Hold on, doggie, whoa!
Take it nice and easy-Like, all right?
Oh, she's got nipple!
Ok, ok, calm down, calm down!
It'll be clear to you in a few seconds.
You're going to see proof, ok?
Andi, you remember tony?
Please tell them to let me go!
I do not want to be here.
They will, andi.
We just need to show you something first,
And then you'll be free to do whatever you choose.
What?
Show me what.
Andi...
tony is a demon.
He's a demon from hell.
Show her.
Show her.
Ok. [Clears throat]
[Inhaling] oh, word of warning,
Please do not pee on my carpet,
I just put it down.
Ok.
Where's a good spot?
[Clears throat] ok.
Phhbbt. [Grunting]
Sock: oh-Ho!
Sweet home alabama!
[Crying] tony!
See?
It's true.
Why?
Ah, that always happens.
And it always hurts.
I gotta go get her.
Oh, don't worry.
There's nothing around for miles.
She has nowhere to run to.
Uh, did you leave the keys in the car?
It's possible.
Thanks for the lift.
Oh, well, believe me, it's always a pleasure
Hanging out with you boys.
Hey, don't be strangers.
We won't.
Tone-Ster.
Can you do that thing one more time?
Please?
For me?
Come on!
Please, once?
All: oh!
Ha ha!
Oh, now i see why steve loved you so much.
That's inappropriate.
That's a compliment, tony.
I know, but it's still offensive.
Hey, thanks again, tony.
No problem.
Sam?
I hope everything goes well with andi.
Be patient.
[Sighs] i'm sick of being patient.
It's like every time i get close to her, something happens.
I don't know.
Maybe it's not supposed to happen.
Do you love her?
Yeah.
Do you know how rare love is?
You can't just turn away just because you hit a few speed bumps.
Steve and i,
We, heh, we had our issues,
But we worked through them
Because we knew at the end... only love matters.
Love is worth... any sacrifice.
[Chuckles] oh, look at me.
Diarrhea of the mouth.
All right, i better get back,
Because, um, i get a little nervous
When i spend too much time out of the circle.
Be safe.
You, too, sam.
And hey, wi@need you.
Viva le resistance.
No sign of andi, no one's seen her.
She never clocked in for her shift, either.
Yeah, and she never went home last night.
She could be anywhere.
I doubt she went to the police.
I mean, what's she gonna tell them?
"Oh, i saw a big, gay demon."
Ok, she's probably hiding,
Praying heavily right now.
Jack's calendar.
I forgot about this.
If we're gonna keep the devil off our backs,
There's one place we need to be.
Is--Is she dilated?
How's her breathing?
Who are you?
The one she'll be thanking later!
Oh!
Which one's yours?
That one right there.
And...that one.
And maybe that one.
Jack's got a busy week.
Real bumper crop of babies.
All right, we need to split up.
I'll take the emergency exit.
Sock, you take the front, ben, go around to the side.
Got it.
Where have you been?
Wha--
You promised me you'd take care of this andi situation.
I tried to, but she ran away from me.
I can't find her.
Oh, i fixed that problem.
She's in the trunk.
This is your last chance to get it right.
Andi!
Are you ok?
I don't know!
Come here.
I don't know how the hell i got in here!
Are you all right?
You're safe!
You're safe.
Look, i'm sorry you're freaked out.
I didn't know how else to--
You know, sam, no, it's ok.
I understand.
Ok, after what i saw,
And what tony is... i believe you.
Andi, listen to me.
You have to promise me
You will not tell anyone about this.
Ever.
I promise.
You do?
That's great, that's great!
Listen, i--I have to go do something,
But when i get back, why don't you come over,
And we can talk about this-- No.
No, no, i can't.
Why?
I can't handle it.
It's too much.
Andi, i love you.
I know this is a weird time to say it,
But... i love you.
I'm... afraid of you.
Excuse me.
Where is the place that women have babies?
Aren't you a little old to just be figuring that out?
No, i--
I know where women have babies,
I was, um, referring to
Where the room is, yeah.
It's down the hall.
Just make a left.
Ok.
All right.
Cool.
Hey, is that a sue grafton novel?
Y is for yes.
How do you...feel about mixed martial arts?
Hey.
Hey.
Have you seen the baby ward?
Huh?
Oh, no, i thought i was
Following around a pregnant woman for a while,
But turns out it was just a bloated dude
With a bad case of the farts, you know?
It's him.
Run.
Jack, don't-- [Sighs] don't run.
Stay back!
Jack, it's over, man.
You're not getting past us!
[All screaming]
Ugh.
Good-Bye, old friend.
I got it.
Oh!
Come on, you little sneawhere are you?
Tch.
Oh... i'm sorry, don't mind me.
I'm just having a...
a bit of a rat problem.
You have delicate wrists.
How do you handle jujitsu?
Benji, need some help!
Runaway hand, come on!
I will be back, and me and you, ok?
You can't hold me off forever, jack!
Jack: i think you're right.
Sam?
Andi, get out of here!
Wait here, i'll be right back.
It's in here.
Yeah, yeah, it's in here.
Ok, let's go ahead and bag him, yeah?
Ha ha!
Where are you?
Get out of here!
Ben: naked guy!
Sock: naked guy!
Naked guy!
Naked!
Naked guy on my back!
Somebody help!
Doctors!
Oh-Ho, benji!
Oh, ben, that was horrible.
Oh, god.
It looked horrible.
I can still feel it.
Is there a mark?
Andi!
Think she'll show up?
Andi?
Sure, she'll definitely be here.
You know she said she was afraid of me?
Oh, come on, you're loveable.
Oh, who could be afraid of this guy right here?
Look at him!
Look at that little cheek!
Hey, hey.
What?
Oh.
The old ball and chain.
I got some wedding rings!
From ebay.
Cool, well... well, speaking of cool,
Um, i wanted to thank you
For the pep talk the other day.
'Cause i--I didn't give up on my list.
And i found my phil collins.
And her name is cassidy.
Yay.
I am very happy for you, but no.
What?
Oh, you know, you're married.
Um, not really.
Um, yes, really.
Look, think.
What if immigration come crawling around?
They are cracking down on these green card marriages!
Listen up, problem solved.
You tell them that you have an open green card marriage.
Thank you, sock.
Listen.
You made a deal,
And i expect you to live up to it.
I'm sorry, but... i'm gonna go on a date with cassidy.
I'm not letting you go.
Fine, then i'll just report you to immigration.
Fine, then i'll report you extorted money from me,
And we'll both go to jail.
You know, screw it, i'll just give her back her money.
Well, well, now, benjamin,
Let's not make any rash decisions here, ok?
'Cause at the end of the day,
There may not be all that much "money" to give back.
We'll talk about it later
While we enjoy our floor seats
At the blue collar comedy tour.
Lowest common denominator.
Yeah!
Oh.
Andi!
Hey.
Um... so... so... weird day?
Sort of.
Although, you've been a weirdo for months, sam.
It's just now at least i understand why.
9a you were trying to protect me.
It's true.
It's completely true.
Although, i've gotta say,
I'm stunned you've managed to survive this long.
I mean, i should have never been afraid of you.
I should have been afraid for you.
Yeah, it's a miracle any of us are still alive.
Yeah.
Outside the hospital when you told me that you loved me... did you say that because you meant it,
Or because you didn't want me to go to the cops?
Both.
Uh-Oh.
Look at this.
Look at how sweet you two are.
I knew that locking her in the trunk of my car
Would work out for the best.
You loved it, didn't you?
Come on.
Don't sweat it,
It's just part of the job.
Really?
Mm-Hmm.
So does this job pay anything?
Yes.
Sam has to get us a beer whenever we demand it,
So, you know.
Beer.
All we can handle.
Beer.
More beer!
Beer, beer, beer, beer.
Throw your hands up, beer, throw your hands up!
Devil: darling... yeah, what a lovely place.
So rustic, so remote.
What are we doing here?
Sam, sam, sam, i think you know the answer to that.
Remember how quick you were to give up that favor?
So impetuous.
You really ought to think before you act.
There's something going on in there.
Beyond the circle i can see or hear.
I need an inside man.
I want details.
Names, dates, you know, that sort of thing.
You want me to spy on tony?
You want me to betray my friend?
Oh, please, don't be so melodramatic.
But, yes, if you want to use those words, yes.
Ugh.
Hey, come on.
That's the deal you made, man.
You tell andi your secret,
You owe me a favor.
Or we could discuss the consequences
For you and andi if you refuse.
Well, sam?
It's your answer?
Sam?
Hey!
Thought i saw you out here.
Why don't you come on in?
I don't-- I don't know--
I think you could be a real help.
Come on inside.
There's, uh... there's some people i really want you to meet.
Come on.
Cold out here.
Sam: yeah, it's freezing.
It's a blind alley
Ok, next
Jojo
Yes
I am envy of you, Eunice
You are so talented in sports
Don't flatter me
I am an idiot in sports
I am not talented in sports
No, there is no such thing
Eunice, you don't have to comfort me
Anne
Yes
Try harder
Anne, work hard
I can't do it actually
Anne
If you want to sleep
Go home and have a good sleep
I know
Get up now
Yes
Okay
Next, Eunice
Yes
You are great
Eunice
Have you ever heard of the case... that another high school girl was vanished?
Yes
It is so scary
They said that the disappeared girls... are all talented in sports
So Eunice, you have to be careful
Okay, I will take care of myself
In fact, I think Anne, you have to be careful, too
I don't have to be worried
My weakness is my goodness because... when talking about sports,
I am no better than a 2 year old kid
Even so, you don't have to say out loud about it
Don't worry
Even if I cry out loud nobody will understand what I am saying
What happen to you
You seem to mock at yourself
As a superior sports girl
Eunice, you will not understand my situation
Don't say that
Right
Why is your breast seems so plump recently?
It's a secret
Tell me, now
No, I won't tell you
Yes, they are our target
See you tomorrow
Anne
You have to take care of yourself
Okay, I will take care of myself
Anne
That kind of case will happen at any time
I know it
The public order is not so good recently
Never mind, I will take good care of myself
Okay
See you tomorrow
See you
Mmmm
It seems that you are Eunice Eunice
Oh?
What's up?
Stop it
What happened?
Masked Girl
Eunice Eunice
Eunice Eunice

Beside this,
I am not Eunice Eunice
You don't have to worry about it
It only needs a little bit more longer to complete the Brain Wash Surgery
Brain Wash Surgery?

Why am I here?
What happened?

An intruder has entered our base
Go to get the intruder
I need to catch the intruder alive

We need to care about this at any time
Hurry
Please turn around
I know
Change your clothes now
Yes
Go this way
Teacher
What a hell is this place?
And about those people in the room...
They keep on yelling to me... that I need the Transformation and Brain Was surgery...
What are they talking about?
Okay
Go this way
Teacher
This is a blind alley
Then, we have to do this
We have to jump up to escape
What?
Anne
Don't worry, you can do this now
Impossible
It is impossible to do this
Do you know how far between here and the window?
It is too far away
Don't worry
Having the surgery by the organization
You possess... an incredible power to jump
Trust me
Trust you?
What is the transformation you are talking about?
About me now...
What happened to me?
You have become...
I find you finally
Don't fight back anymore
Anne
You have no choice
You have to jump up now
What?
Jump quickly
Jump?
Anne
Good job
Teacher
Anne
Don't worry about me
Leave this place now
What?
Teacher
Don't worry, I will be fine
You leave this place first
Anne

Teacher
Are you alright?
Anne
Okay
Go now
Don't chase them
Anne
Eunice
Where have you been?
I am worry about you
I phoned you but you didn't answer
Eunice
What happened to me now?
Teacher
Teacher
Please tell me honestly
What happened to me now?
I understand
Let me tell you the truth
But you have to calm down when you here the truth
Anne
You are transformed by the Clown Organization
And you've got supernatural power now
What?
You said that I am a transformed girl now?
Correct
What?
I am being transformed?
About the Clown...
What is that organization?
Clown is an organization that... is aiming at conquering the whole world
Conquering the whole world?
Yes
Clown is an organization that will select... those people who are talented in sports then transformed and brain washed them and then send them around the world
Those people who have been transformed, will possess superman's power and they can do incredible thing
You said they are aiming at sportsmen
Yes
So they must be targeting at Eunice
Sorry
Wait, teacher
I was so careless that I mixed up the photos of you and Eunice
If I didn't mixed up the photos then, you will not...
Teacher
Please don't be like this
So...
What am I going to do?
You have to crush the ambition of the Clowns
And destroy the organization completely
What?
You mean I have to fight?
I am just an ordinary girl
I am just a high school girl
Wrong
From now on, you are no longer an ordinary high school girl
You are a transformer now
It seems that I cannot change the fact
I accept the Transformation Surgery now
I have no choice but to become a fighter and to fight for justice
Anne
That's good
Okay
I want to ask...
Why were you there?
About this matter...
Oh...
So bad
I have to go to class now
Anne
You have to be careful from now on
Yes
Anne
Are you alright?
Oh...
I am fine
In fact, Eunice
What's up?
Nothing
There's nothing
Really?
It seems that you are hiding some secret
But I still trust you as before
If anything happened
Please tell me honestly
Both of us are a pair of trustworthy friend
We are very good friend and we can die for one another
Yes, right
Okay
See you tomorrow
Okay
See you tomorrow
Bye-bye
Yeah, Eunice
What's up?
You have to take care of yourself
Mmmm
Ah...
No...
I can't go on like this
I have to fight against them sooner or later
Right
Where is Eunice?
I don't know
Is she sick today?
Really?
Yes
That guy is so funny
Eunice
I supposed you didn't come to school today
Mmmm
I didn't attend the class today
There is something that...
I really want to tell you
What's up?
About the case...
In fact, I have something... to tell you, too
Anne, please speak up now
Mmmm
Although this is an unbelievable case,
I hope you will not mock at me
Mmmm
Eunice, in fact...
I am a transformer
You are a transformer?
Yes
The night I was disappeared
I was captured by the Clown Organization
They processed a Transformation Surgery on me
Such Clown Organization, is said to be an organization that... is aiming at conquering the whole world
And I was lucky enough to escape... before they do the Brain Wash Surgery on me
If the Brain Wash Surgery was done,
I will become one of their apprentice
Are you surprised by this?
But I am still the same person as Anne
I didn't change anything
The only thing is that I am more sportive now
And I am more active than before
Really?
Eunice
What happened?
You are not surprised by this?
Of course I am not surprised
Because...
I am also a transformer now
Oh...
Why do you betray the Clowns
What?
You are a betrayer
Eunice
What happened?
Stop it
Eunice
Sorry
Are you alright?
Betraying the organization, you have no way to live
You said I am a betrayer
I have no impression that...
I am one of the member of the Clowns
Eunice
Please recover your memory
Eunice
Have you forgot that we are best friend?
No more bull shit
Go to hell now
You are my best friend in school
Have you forgot that we are best friend?
We can die for each other
Eunice
Eunice
Sorry
Are you alright?
Eunice
Please don't die
What happened?
Eunice
Don't...
Eunice
Anne?
Eunice
Have you recovered your memory?
What have I done?
I remember now
It seems that I was hit by a monster person
Don't worry, it's fine now, Eunice
What's up?
It is over
Let's go home now
Please listen to me
I have no mood to deal with you
I don't want to fight now
Get away from me
Okay
Let me play with you
Who are you?
Both of you have betrayed the Clowns
I will not let you be alive
I have said it before
I have no impression that...
I have ever joined your organization
But maybe she will have a bit impression
Oh...
Go and get them
Anne
Eunice
Can you fight?
No problem
Kill them
Eunice
Anne
Eunice
Teacher
I brought the consolidated armor to you
But sorry
I have only got one piece ready at the moment
Eunice
Go and put it on
Anne
It should be you who put it on
Yes
The size of this armor is...
The breast size of this armor is 32A
What?
No way
I cannot put this on
Okay, I will put on it
Come on
Put it on
Yes
Teacher
Don't look at me
Sorry
Anne, are you ready
Wait for me
I am nearly finished
Eunice
Sorry for keep you waiting
Anne
You look so cool on it
Thank you, Eunice
You are an idiot
Even if you put on an armor
Do you think you can win?
Let's see
It works
Go
Success
Don't think that you can destroy us easily
From now on,
The Clown Organization will keep on manufacturing other monsters in order to eliminate all the betrayers like you!
I have said it before
I have no impression that...
I have ever joined your organization
Anne, you look so cool
Let's give you a new title
Call me Masked Girl
No way
Isn't it great
Okay
Anne, put your armor down now
This consolidated armor does not belong to you
What's up?
I think it is for me
Not yet
There is something we need to improve
What?
I think it has no need to improve
After wearing it
I can crush down the monster so easily...
Don't say it
You have to put it down
Why do you often ask me to change my clothes?
Are you aiming at seeing my body... when I am changing my clothes?
What are you talking about?
Change your clothes now
You are so troublesome
Don't be like this
She is really...
Okay...
It's your turn now, Jojo
Yes
Good
Anne
Yes
What's up?
Anne
You have to work hard from now on!
(More to come after the song... )
The consolidated armor is almost finished
From the experimental research, the power is more advanced
But...
To send my own students to try this cruel experiment
My conscience is not so easy to pass this
Conscience?
You've got conscience in your body?
I don't think so
I believe that everybody will have this thing
Everyone will have conscience in one's body
Chan
What are you planning in your mind?
What?
I am a member of the Clowns
I am so loyal to the Clowns Organization
What's happening?
It's for you
Thank you
Goodbye
Goodbye
Oh, Lord!
Now I'm locked out!
He's at the tavern and she can't come downstairs!
Perhaps I can be of some assistance, madame.
I see there is a little window up there.
(HE WHISTLES)
Are you a burglar, sir?
No, madame!
I am here on business with Mrs Clennam!
Oh!
Oh!
Toujours gai!
Oh, he'll murder her and then Jeremiah'll murder me!
- Will you step in, madame?
- Affery!
- Oh, good Lord!
- Who's this?
(WHISPERING) Death of my soul!
- How did you get here?
- I could ask the same of you.
Well, you see, I got locked out.
He's here on business with the missus and he climbed...
That's enough from you, old woman!
You shall have such a dose for this.
In you go!
(HE GROWLS)
This way, sir.
Sir!
You!
Sit down, and don't stir till I say so!
(HE GROWLS)
MRS CLENNAM:
Who's there?
What's going on down there?
!
(BANGING)
Perhaps you could take me to your mistress now, if you would be so kind, monsieur?
Your name?
Blandois.
From Paris.
And yours, sir?
Jeremiah Flintwinch.
Ah, of course!
You know, you are so like a friend of mine.
Well... shall we go up?
(CREAKING)
What the devil is that?
This is an old house, Monsieur Blandois.
(BANGING) MRS CLENNAM:
Where's my tea?
!
It's late!
Affery!
Tea!
Ow!
FLINTWINCH:
Monsieur Blandois.
On business.
Madame.
You were expecting me, I think?
- I was not, sir.
- Ah.
Here is my letter of introduction.
The House of Arromanche.
BLANDOIS:
Just so, madame.
And they speak well of you, sir.
The House of Clennam, of course, carries great respect.
That is why, when we thought of opening up a line of business here, naturellement, we came to you, madame.
Have you been long with the House of Arromanche, monsieur?
I was formerly in Marseilles, and before that...everywhere!
You have no ties, I suppose.
You are not married?
I adore your sex, madame... (HE INHALES DEEPLY)
(WHISPERING) ...but, madame, I am not married.
(NORMAL VOICE) Never was.
MRS CLENNAM:
Affery!
What is the matter with you?
I don't know.
It ain't me.
It's him!
Don't pay no heed to her, sir!
She shall have a dose, she shall have such a dose!
Get along with you, while you know you're Affery, and before you're shaken to yeast!
Take sugar, sir?
No, thank you.
No tea for me.
That is a remarkable watch.
Very fine.
What is this?
"Do not forget".
I wonder...what is it, dear madame, that you wish never to forget?
Some...youthful indiscretion?
A lost love?
That is my concern, sir, not yours.
The watch, please, Monsieur Blandois.
There are secrets in all families, I suppose.
Yes.
Yes, there are.
There are the devil's own secrets in some families.
Huh?
(WHISPERING) N'est-ce pas...ma cherie?
Monsieur Blandois, have we business to do or have we not?
Let us not be over-hasty.
Be assured, Blandois will return.
But for now, I must wish you good evening.
Au revoir.
Affery!
MRS CLENNAM:
Show Monsieur Blandois out.
This way, please, sir.
Don't follow too close.
Well, Flintwinch?
Didn't care for the smell of him.
'Ere.
Where's me brother?
He's gone, Mr Flintwinch.
- Did he leave anything behind?
- No, Mr Flintwinch.
Have you got a Frenchman, name of Blandois, staying here, by any chance?
Did have, but he paid his bill and left this morning.
Right.
ARTHUR:
Over and over and over before he died, he pressed it into my hand saying, "Your mother, Arthur, put it right. "
What did he mean?
What have we done?
Mr Dorrit!
Are you on your way to see your brother?
- That's right, sir.
- So am I. May I walk with you?
An honour, sir.
An honour.
Were you always a musician, Mr Dorrit?
No, I was a gentleman of leisure, sir.
Owned a boarding house for young ladies of the theatrical profession, but that had to be sold, sir many years ago.
Everything was lost.
Except my old clarinet, fortunately, so I had the means of making a living.
Might I ask how it was lost?
They showed me something I had signed - a surety for William, I think it was called.
They spoke of something called "unlimited liability".
I think unlimited liability must be a terrible thing.
- It is.
- But here we all are!
Life's not so bad.
We jog along, Mr Clennam.
We jog along.
I used to know your father very well, you know.
You knew my father?
Long ago.
Before you were born.
He used to visit, at the boarding house, now and then.
A very pleasant and quiet-spoken gentleman.
Why didn't you say anything before?
Long-gone days, sir.
Long-gone days.
Best not talked about.
Well, here we are.
I believe Tip is here today, as well.
(KNOCKS ON DOOR)
(DOOR OPENS)
William.
Mr Clennam!
You are very welcome, sir.
Edward, give Mr Clennam your chair.
No.
I don't see why I should.
- Tip!
- Mr Clennam,
I must apologise for the inexcusable...
Perhaps I should leave.
I feel like I'm intruding.
It is for him to leave!
How dare you treat my guest in such a manner, sir!
It's got nothing to do with you, Pa.
It has everything to do with me!
Your behaviour is unfilial!
Unchristian!
You're no son of mine!
Mr Clennam, please,
- please forgive us.
- Nothing to forgive.
- But I will be on my way.
- Do you see what you've done?
!
Never speak to one of my guests in that manner again!
Do you understand?
!
Mr Clennam!
Please don't be offended by Tip.
He behaved very badly, but don't judge him too harshly.
He feels that no-one respects him... so he demands respect, but in all the wrong ways.
I know why he's angry.
I didn't give him the money he asked for.
- It's all right, I'm not offended.
- Thank you.
I should go back.
No, don't go.
It's really you I came to see.
I was worried about you when Maggy had said you'd been unwell the other day.
Are you feeling better now?
What?
What is it?
Nothing!
Nothing...it's nothing.
It's just all that in there.
It's painful to me.
But you are sad.
What is it?
I, um...
I fancied I was in love with someone.
The girl I spoke to you about.
And now I know that she's in love with someone else, and is to be married to him, someone much nearer her own age.
Well, I've learnt my lesson.
I don't know why I'm telling you all this, Amy.
PANCKS:
Pancks, the gypsy!
Excuse me.
I should go back.
Pancks, the gypsy!
Fortune-telling!
And what a fortune, eh?
What are you doing here, Pancks?
You're not drunk, by any chance, are you?
Possibly I am.
But it makes no odds.
I've been treating 'em all round, haven't I, Mr Rugg?
Mr Rugg, Mr Clennam.
Mr Clennam, Mr Rugg.
He has, sir.
Been treating 'em all round.
We're all drunk!
I...
I am coming into my property, Mr Clennam, and I can afford to be liberal.
Roast beef and plum pudding for everybody!
A quart of double stout a head!
A pint of wine, if you like it!
And to think of him, up there, old Dorrit, making his speeches, and her up there in that little dress, and neither of 'em knowing what's coming to 'em, upon my soul,
it's enough to make me want to...
Make a back, Mr Rugg!
Go on, bend over!
A little higher.
That'll do!
(CHEERING)
Look here, Mr Clennam...
look here.
Have you made a discovery?
We rather think so.
- Does it...implicate anyone?
- How, implicate?
- In any wrong-doing of any kind?
- Can't say for sure yet. (SPITS)
We shall be all set soon.
You shall tell her, and then she shall break it to him.
But what, for God's sake, what?
!
Just you wait and see, Mr Clennam.
Just you wait and see.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
MAN:
Mrs Gowan, ma'am.
- My dear soul, pity me.
- Henry?
Henry.
- The thing is settled?
- It is.
He is to marry the Miggles girl.
My poor dear.
I feel for you.
I, too, have a son.
How they make us suffer!
I should dearly like to know what you think of it.
What society will think of it.
It sounds mercenary to ask what the gentleman will get with his marriage, but then...
society is a little mercenary.
From what I can make out, Henry will be relieved from his debts and the father will give them an allowance, which, in Italy...
- Oh!
Going to Italy?
- Yes.
Henry's to study...that dreadful art.
- An amateur he may be, but...
- I see.
Of course, the girl's family have made strenuous efforts to capture Henry.
- Of course they have.
- And I have persisted in every objection.
Of course you have, my love.
But all of no use.
Now, tell me, my dear, am I justified in at last yielding my most reluctant consent to Henry's marrying among people not in society?
Or have I acted with most inexcusable weakness?
My dear Mrs Gowan, society... will understand, society will absolve you.
All will be well.
Thank you.
Thank you, my dear.
Thank you.
Good day, Clennam.
I was in the neighbourhood, thought I'd pay a visit.
I'm sorry about my mother, by the way.
She did seem to have got hold of the wrong end of the stick about the Meagleses.
She knows very well I shall be dependent on Mr Meagles' wealth and generosity when I marry Pet, but she needs to make out she's doing the world a favour by condescending to have anything to do with it.
It is a bore and it is a sham.
But then isn't everything in this jolly old world a bit of a sham?
Including love?
Marriage?
I hope you're not intending to treat your marriage to Pet as a sham.
(LAUGHING) What a capital world it is, eh?
What a jolly, excellent, lovable old world!
(SIGHING) I quite envy you as a bachelor, you know, being about to put my head in the noose.
- In the noose?
!
- I know.
She's a beautiful and charming girl, and I love her with all my heart.
Still, at one time, I had other prospects... and here I am without them.
And here you are... what a comfortable life.
- And you deserve it.
- Gowan, would it be very rude of me to ask you the purpose of this visit?
As a matter of fact, um,
I wanted to ask you if you'd stand up with me.
Stand up with you?
In what sense?
As my best man, of course.
Never you mind, old fellow.
(SQUAWKING)
I know.
It's excruciating.
Just the same at the office - a lot of pompous fools.
It makes a fellow...itchy.
Hmm?
Eh?
Yes, it does.
Should we attend Henry Gowan's wedding or not?
Hmm?
(CLICKS HIS TONGUE)
Hmm?
Mr Merdle, do you listen to a single word I say, I wonder.
Mr Merdle!
Yes?
I might be better off talking to the bird.
He would at least have screamed.
Would you like me to scream, Mrs Merdle?
I would like you to behave like a proper member of society, Mr Merdle.
I mean, really, you ought not to go into society unless you can accommodate yourself to society.
- What?
- Who does more for society than I do?
Do you see this furniture?
Hmm?
Do you look in the glass and see yourself?
Do you know the cost of all this?
And you tell me I oughtn't to go into society?
Pray don't be violent, Mr Merdle.
Violent?
!
You are enough to make me desperate!
You carry your business cares about wherever you go instead of leaving them in the City, and there is a positive vulgarity about that.
- You think that, do you?
- If you doubt my judgment, ask Edmund Sparkler....
Edmund!
We want you here.
What is it, Mater?
Evening, Guv'nor.
What do people say about your father?
I...
I don't know.
Nothing at all, I should think.
Think, Edmund!
Er...well, um...
I have heard fellows saying the guv'nor's tremendously rich and knowing, perfect phenomenon in the banking line, and all that, but that the shop sits a bit heavy on him.
Which is exactly my complaint.
Edmund.
(CHURCH BELLS PEAL)
Oh, Gowan, take care of her!
Take care of her!
Don't be so broken-hearted, sir.
By heaven, I will!
Pet!
Pet!
Did you remember your warm shawl?
PET:
It's in the trunk.
- Bye.
- Goodbye, Mama.
Well, it's done, and we must bear it bravely as best we can.
St Aldegonde, so it's said, had a taste for marriages and public executions.
Very similar events on occasion.
Oh, my poor boy!
PANCKS:
Mr Clennam!
Mr Clennam!
Mr Clennam.
It is all done, Mr Clennam!
It is all signed, sealed and copper-bottom guaranteed!
And you may tell her now, sir, as soon as you like, and she may tell him!
And won't they be amazed, eh?
- Won't they be flabbergasted?
- What do I have to tell her?
Remember I asked you if you were one of the Clennams of Cornwall?
I said I wasn't.
What of it?
Nothing.
But I never then imagined who would turn out to be one of the Dorrits of Dorsetshire!
In fact, you could say THE Dorrit of Dorsetshire, or his direct descendant!
- You mean...?
- Yes!
The Father of the Marshalsea!
Little Dorrit's pa!
He is heir to a great estate that is long untouched, unclaimed and accumulating!
No more Marshalsea for him!
He is a very rich man!
- He's a very rich man, indeed!
- How did you find all this out?
Ah, I moled it out, sir, grain by grain.
I tracked down every Dorrit in the land, and I kept on until I'd ruled out every last one of them except for our friend in the Marshalsea.
I spent all I had, and I borrowed, too, from my old proprietor.
You know what he charged me?
20%!
You shall be recompensed fully by me, Mr Pancks.
And rewarded too, I imagine!
£1,000 would see me right, Mr Clennam, and that's nothing to Mr Dorrit now.
But I leave that to you, sir, and also to break it to the family.
Yeah, can't be done too soon, in my opinion, sir.
(SNORING)
(DOOR OPENS)
- Mr Clennam, ma'am.
- Oh!
Um...
Arthur...
Doyce and Clennam.
Ooh!
What a sight you must think me.
Pray excuse the wrapper, and a faded check too, which is worse... (LAUGHING)...but our little friend is making me a skirt and there was to be a trying-on after breakfast.
I apologise for calling so early.
Oh, Arthur, Doyce and Clennam, Papa need never know you are here and, as you are well aware, our little friend can be fully trusted
- to be discreet.
- Um, Flora... it is our little friend that I came to see.
Oh.
Yes, of course.
(SHE CLEARS HER THROAT) Amy!
Flora, would you mind leaving us alone for just a moment?
Amy, I have some very important news about your father.
There's something up, John, I feel it in my bones.
I feel it in my bones, too, Pa.
(DOOR OPENS)
Amy, my dear.
Father...
I have been made so happy this morning.
Mr Clennam brought some wonderful news about you!
If he had not prepared me for it, I do not think I could have borne it.
What is it?
- What is it?
- ARTHUR:
Sir, compose yourself... and think of the best surprise that could possibly happen to you.
The very best.
Do not be afraid to imagine it.
The very best...that could happen to me?
Yes.
What would it be?
To to be free.
ARTHUR:
You shall be.
And very soon.
And there is more.
You shall be prosperous.
You are heir to a great fortune.
Pancks was the one that found it out.
I shall be free?
You shall be free, Father.
And rich?
And you can be as you were again.
Oh, Father...
Father.
Thank God, thank God!
And, er...
I-I-I can leave the Marshalsea?
As soon as you're ready to.
And rich?
I shall be rich?
No doubt of it.
I shall be rich.
Mr Clennam, am I to understand that I could pass through the gate at this very moment?
I think not quite yet.
- So I am still confined?
- It is but a few hours, sir.
A few hours.
You talk easily of hours, sir.
How long do you think an hour is to a man who is choking for want of air?
But perhaps it's perhaps it's, um...for the best.
Yes, for the best.
Yes, perhaps it is as well.
- Father, I think you should rest now.
- Yes, yes, I'm, er...
It's all been, um...
Yes...very tired.
Oh.
I shall be rich.
I shall be free.
Oh, Lord!
Now I'm locked out!
He's at the tavern and she can't come downstairs!
Perhaps I can be of some assistance, madame.
I see there is a little window up there.
(HE WHISTLES)
Are you a burglar, sir?
No, madame!
I am here on business with Mrs Clennam!
Oh!
Oh!
Toujours gai!
Oh, he'll murder her and then Jeremiah'll murder me!
- Will you step in, madame?
- Affery!
- Oh, good Lord!
- Who's this?
(WHISPERING) Death of my soul!
- How did you get here?
- I could ask the same of you.
Well, you see, I got locked out.
He's here on business with the missus and he climbed...
That's enough from you, old woman!
You shall have such a dose for this.
In you go!
(HE GROWLS)
This way, sir.
Sir!
You!
Sit down, and don't stir till I say so!
(HE GROWLS)
MRS CLENNAM:
Who's there?
What's going on down there?
!
(BANGING)
Perhaps you could take me to your mistress now, if you would be so kind, monsieur?
Your name?
Blandois.
From Paris.
And yours, sir?
Jeremiah Flintwinch.
Ah, of course!
You know, you are so like a friend of mine.
Well... shall we go up?
(CREAKING)
What the devil is that?
This is an old house, Monsieur Blandois.
(BANGING) MRS CLENNAM:
Where's my tea?
!
It's late!
Affery!
Tea!
Ow!
FLINTWINCH:
Monsieur Blandois.
On business.
Madame.
You were expecting me, I think?
- I was not, sir.
- Ah.
Here is my letter of introduction.
The House of Arromanche.
BLANDOIS:
Just so, madame.
And they speak well of you, sir.
The House of Clennam, of course, carries great respect.
That is why, when we thought of opening up a line of business here, naturellement, we came to you, madame.
Have you been long with the House of Arromanche, monsieur?
I was formerly in Marseilles, and before that...everywhere!
You have no ties, I suppose.
You are not married?
I adore your sex, madame... (HE INHALES DEEPLY)
(WHISPERING) ...but, madame, I am not married.
(NORMAL VOICE) Never was.
MRS CLENNAM:
Affery!
What is the matter with you?
I don't know.
It ain't me.
It's him!
Don't pay no heed to her, sir!
She shall have a dose, she shall have such a dose!
Get along with you, while you know you're Affery, and before you're shaken to yeast!
Take sugar, sir?
No, thank you.
No tea for me.
That is a remarkable watch.
Very fine.
What is this?
"Do not forget".
I wonder...what is it, dear madame, that you wish never to forget?
Some...youthful indiscretion?
A lost love?
That is my concern, sir, not yours.
The watch, please, Monsieur Blandois.
There are secrets in all families, I suppose.
Yes.
Yes, there are.
There are the devil's own secrets in some families.
Huh?
(WHISPERING) N'est-ce pas...ma cherie?
Monsieur Blandois, have we business to do or have we not?
Let us not be over-hasty.
Be assured, Blandois will return.
But for now, I must wish you good evening.
Au revoir.
Affery!
MRS CLENNAM:
Show Monsieur Blandois out.
This way, please, sir.
Don't follow too close.
Well, Flintwinch?
Didn't care for the smell of him.
'Ere.
Where's me brother?
He's gone, Mr Flintwinch.
- Did he leave anything behind?
- No, Mr Flintwinch.
Have you got a Frenchman, name of Blandois, staying here, by any chance?
Did have, but he paid his bill and left this morning.
Right.
ARTHUR:
Over and over and over before he died, he pressed it into my hand saying, "Your mother, Arthur, put it right. "
What did he mean?
What have we done?
Mr Dorrit!
Are you on your way to see your brother?
- That's right, sir.
- So am I. May I walk with you?
An honour, sir.
An honour.
Were you always a musician, Mr Dorrit?
No, I was a gentleman of leisure, sir.
Owned a boarding house for young ladies of the theatrical profession, but that had to be sold, sir many years ago.
Everything was lost.
Except my old clarinet, fortunately, so I had the means of making a living.
Might I ask how it was lost?
They showed me something I had signed - a surety for William, I think it was called.
They spoke of something called "unlimited liability".
I think unlimited liability must be a terrible thing.
- It is.
- But here we all are!
Life's not so bad.
We jog along, Mr Clennam.
We jog along.
I used to know your father very well, you know.
You knew my father?
Long ago.
Before you were born.
He used to visit, at the boarding house, now and then.
A very pleasant and quiet-spoken gentleman.
Why didn't you say anything before?
Long-gone days, sir.
Long-gone days.
Best not talked about.
Well, here we are.
I believe Tip is here today, as well.
(KNOCKS ON DOOR)
(DOOR OPENS)
William.
Mr Clennam!
You are very welcome, sir.
Edward, give Mr Clennam your chair.
No.
I don't see why I should.
- Tip!
- Mr Clennam,
I must apologise for the inexcusable...
Perhaps I should leave.
I feel like I'm intruding.
It is for him to leave!
How dare you treat my guest in such a manner, sir!
It's got nothing to do with you, Pa.
It has everything to do with me!
Your behaviour is unfilial!
Unchristian!
You're no son of mine!
Mr Clennam, please,
- please forgive us.
- Nothing to forgive.
- But I will be on my way.
- Do you see what you've done?
!
Never speak to one of my guests in that manner again!
Do you understand?
!
Mr Clennam!
Please don't be offended by Tip.
He behaved very badly, but don't judge him too harshly.
He feels that no-one respects him... so he demands respect, but in all the wrong ways.
I know why he's angry.
I didn't give him the money he asked for.
- It's all right, I'm not offended.
- Thank you.
I should go back.
No, don't go.
It's really you I came to see.
I was worried about you when Maggy had said you'd been unwell the other day.
Are you feeling better now?
What?
What is it?
Nothing!
Nothing...it's nothing.
It's just all that in there.
It's painful to me.
But you are sad.
What is it?
I, um...
I fancied I was in love with someone.
The girl I spoke to you about.
And now I know that she's in love with someone else, and is to be married to him, someone much nearer her own age.
Well, I've learnt my lesson.
I don't know why I'm telling you all this, Amy.
PANCKS:
Pancks, the gypsy!
Excuse me.
I should go back.
Pancks, the gypsy!
Fortune-telling!
And what a fortune, eh?
What are you doing here, Pancks?
You're not drunk, by any chance, are you?
Possibly I am.
But it makes no odds.
I've been treating 'em all round, haven't I, Mr Rugg?
Mr Rugg, Mr Clennam.
Mr Clennam, Mr Rugg.
He has, sir.
Been treating 'em all round.
We're all drunk!
I...
I am coming into my property, Mr Clennam, and I can afford to be liberal.
Roast beef and plum pudding for everybody!
A quart of double stout a head!
A pint of wine, if you like it!
And to think of him, up there, old Dorrit, making his speeches, and her up there in that little dress, and neither of 'em knowing what's coming to 'em, upon my soul,

The zipper goes in frontl
- I forgot.
- That's OK.
Go on.
One foot.
Two feet.
You made a drawing?
- Thank you.
- She's the queen?
No, Mom.
It's you.
Me?
Show me.
It's beautiful.
I'm hungry.
What's to eat?
It's summer so I made your favourite.
Angel cake.
Elise, put on your shoes!
Goodbye, Mr Plumeau Thanks, see you!
Who was it, Bobino?
Hi, kids!
I thought it was a customer.
- But it was Mr Plumeau!
- Mr Plumeau?
Yes, look out the window.
Why didn't you come?
What's that?
A go-kart.
With a two-stroke motor?
- Like you're an expert?
- I am too!
What a know-it-all!
My uncle's a mechanic.
And mechanics is hereditary.
Bernie, you're full of it.
I am not.
The Martineaus, we have gas in our veins, not blood.
- Look at this.
- Where'd you get it?
You stole money?
Who said I stole it?
Catch, Tracto!
What'll you do with $10?
- Money buys everything.
- Buy red gas!
-And bum your motor?
-You could buy the new Beatles 45.
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Hi, guys.
Hi, Rom.
- I have a flat.
- Come on in.
Stay away from the river!
I used to go wandering along the mountain track
I love to sing, my knapsack on my back
Hi
I baked a cake.
My favourite!
It looks delicious.
Go get changed, Coco.
Wonderful.
He scares me.
Don't be a baby.
You wanted to come.
- I'm not a baby.
-Then let's go.
They're magnificient.
Little gems.
They look like real insects.
Perfect imitations.
No fish anywhere would suspect.
I'll take the Dark Montreal.
Yes, one.
And three salmon streamers.
Three.
Three lake salmon streamers.
How much?
How much?
$5.
It's a steal.
He's a grumpy SOB, but he makes beautiful flies.
I want to learn to fish this summer.
In that case, let a fisherman give you an advice.
If you want 'em to bite, you need faith.
Otherwise you'll never catch a thing!
Faith in what?
That's for you to discover.
Coming?
Faith!
I caught one!
Attack!
What are you doing?
I said not past your ankles.
Bye, Dad
Tractor, Bernard!
Look what we found for Coco in my dad's barn.
Can I get on?
Grab it here.
Mr Fly's back for the summer.
Don't let him hear you.
He's deaf.
Slow down!
I told you, he's crazy.
Hold tight, Benoit.
Why's Mr Fly's cheeck dirty like that?
The sign of the devil!
It's not the devil, it's coagulated blood.
Put on your shoes.
See you later?
Call me.
My lawnmower!
You said it was broken.
I'd have had it fixed.
Romeo, how's your mom?
Still the same.
Guess I'll have to buy a new lawnmower.
For your go-kart.
What is it?
It's from my tractor.
Will you tell me how it ends?
You'll never learn to read like that.
Elise is right.
Practice makes perfect!
Maybe he needs glasses.
Leave him alone.
He's going at his own speed.
When I was 6, I could read Tintin.
I was here.
You see?
In Afghanistan.
The cholera epidemic is so virulent, it's spread to Iran and Iraq.
A nasty business.
I'll never be like you, a specialist in tropical diseases, studying people's shit all day to find disgusting parasites.
What's studying shit to find disgusting parasites?
It's microbiology.
I'm going to be a truck driver.
Or a singer like the Beatles.
I'm never growing up.
What are 7 league boots?
They're boots that can take you to the end of the world.
See you.
"They fit his feet and legs as perfectly as if..."
OK, kids.
Bedtime.
No fair, I go to bed after him.
Good night.
- Will you sing me a song?
- Just one.
- I'm going to the hospital.
- Are you on call?
It's the summer schedule.
You haven't practised piano.
Play a little now before bed.
Stop, piano's important.
Move over.
What would you like me to sing?
The Country Life, Margot,
Beautiful Francoise, It Scares the Birds...
Beautiful Francoise.
Thanks, Grandma.
What a lovely roast beef!
Can't we eat like everyone?
That looks like cattle feet.
Brown rice still has all its nutrients.
White rice has nothing.
It's unhealthy.
Enjoy!
700 million Chinese eat white rice and they're not all sick.
But their skin is yellow.
- Stop fooling around!
- It's ok, bunny.
For wine stains, nothing beats salt.
Why doesn't Mr Fly put salt on his stain?
Elise, I told you.
Stay away from the river.
Remember Guillaume who drowned?
You've stold us that story 100 times.
And I wont stop!
Mr Fly...
He hates children.
I hear he even cooks them.
He cooks children?
Leave the poor man in peace.
1:00.
I have to go.
- Where?
- My golf tournament.
Didn't I tell you?
A fundraiser.
Can I work as your caddy?
You're too young.
Let him earn some money.
What's he need money for?
At his age?
I have to buy some bolts.
Mommy, I'm full.
Three more bites.
Frogs don't eat cereal.
What do they eat?
They eat maggots, stuff like that.
What's a maggot?
Maggots are... maggots.
Why are you sad?
My mom's sick again.
You can't imagine, having a mom with migraines.
I'm not allowed to breathe.
What are migraines?
They're like... a hammer pounding on your head non-stop.
There you go, missy.
Thanks.
When's the pool man coming?
I have to call him.
That tickles!
It tickles!
Mommy?
What's a maggot?
A maggot?
It's somone who has no backbone, who lacks all dignity.
Mommy, I saw the flag was up.
Thanks, bunny.
Come have lunch.
What about our holidays?
I thought about Tortoise Island.
Any tortoise?
Go to Haiti, with the kids?
We can stay at Dr. Campeau's dispensary.
That's your idea of a holiday, a leper colony?
Travel broadens you, right kids?
What's a leper?
A contagious disease.
Why not Cape Cod?
Over my dead body.
Parasols, ice boxes, water wings, suntan lotion, Noxzema, picking sand out of your sandwich, swimsuits, sleeping bags...
No, thank you.
Plus the icy water with seaweed and jellyfish.
Who wants lemonade?
What's jellyfish?
I never realized.
she hated camping so much.
Mommy, what's a jellyfish?
It's like floating jello.
Coco, not with your mouth full.
In English it's a jellyfish.
It's a marine animal.
A cnidarian, to be precise.
Get me the dictionary.
I knew it!
I have some big news!
Elise is going to boarding school next fall.
I'm not going to boarding school!
You're not going here.
We talked about it.
It's a fine school.
You can keep up your piano.
You'll come home on weekend.
You'll love it.
Dad, you can't let her force me!
It's reactonary.
And with the educational reform...
Please, stay out of this.
It'll ensure you get into university.
You yourself said those nuns smell like cat piss!
They may smell bad, but they can teach.
Anyway, the matter is closed.
May I leave, too?
Sure, go ahead.
Here, cnidarian.
"Radially symmetrical marine animal, 6 or 6 main classes.
"Digestion via stomach push.
"Possessing cells that can sting or kill."
Want to play with me?
Mom's sending me to a school run by stinky nuns.
Poor you!
You should pull a fit like my sister Anna.
Then dad gives her whatever she wants.
What does she do?
Why don't you try that, too?
With me, it won't help.
Dad doesn't care.
I'm not his son.
I'm skinny, he's fat.
I'm the son of an Austrian prince.
Mom told me.
Screw boarding school!
Are you there?
I'm over here.
What's up, bunny?
Does boarding school hurt?
No, it doesn't hurt.
It's true you sometimes feel homesick.
But you learn not to.
Stop, you didn't!
You really said that?
What are you doing?
You see I'm on the phone!
Shut the door, please.
Why did you do that?
Hello, could you watch the girls for two hours?
I'm off to SOS Somalia with books and pencils.
You look ill.
Education's the key.
Even Blacks deserve schools.
Despite our prejudices.
While I'm at it,
I have a petition here opposing clotheslines.
We can't let our lovely bungalows be sullied.
by badly bleached unmentionables!
This isn't Italy!
Do you aggree?
I don't give a damn about clotheslines.
You can pick up the girls later.
The nerve!
Do you want to skip rope?
What's wrong with you?
She threw the coffee at your dad?
That's how he takes it.
Let's go.
Jelly in the bowl!
Jelly in the...
What are you waiting for?
Jelly in the bowl!
Jelly in the...
You're such pests!
Wiggle waggle, wiggle waggle Jelly in the bowl!
Sausage in the pan
I'm not playing.
-What's with her now?
-I don't know.
Mom?
It's Sunday, it's not garbage day.
What's wrong?
Did your chain jump?
Don't worry.
I can fix it.
Romeo?
Come help me.
I gotta go.
What are you doing with Dad's stuff?
Throwing it out.
He'll leave the hospital.
He'll get better.
No.
He won't get better.
Come on...
You'll be OK.
Did you see Barnard?
He was going to help me with the hay.
He went to Mass with his parents.
Mom says the church keeps us in the dark.
Don't you have electricity?
Chocolate, please.
I want the London posting.
I can leave in a week.
The meeting is over.
Simone, please stay.
Jacques, close the door.
What's going on, Simone?
If I don't leave, I'll die.
I'll prepare your contract.
Thank you.
Choose Steve McQueen.
Josée?
Marlon Brando.
Louise?
- James Dean.
- That's me.
Ok, we're on for 15 minutes.
I don't need your consent.
I can't refuse this offer.
I'm a journalist, not just an ornament.
What are you thinking?
London?
It's ridiculous.
The kids can't be without their mother.
And Benoit?
He's already retarded.
I forbid you to say that.
He's perfectly normal.
He's slow, if you prefer.
You can't raise him from there.
They can come join me later.
Forget it.
We're not moving to London!
I didn't include you.
What's got into you?
There's something I'm missing.
When was the last time we made love?
Do you remember?
-What do you mean?
-Stop it!
Stop pretending.
You know what I mean.
This is ridiculous.
I'm talking about your golf mates.
You reproach me for playing golf?
That's exactly it.
- Stop it!
- Leave me alone!
Let go, you're hurting me!
Shit.
Simone!
Come out.
Stop, Simone!
I've been searching for you.
You know Princess Sissi,
Elisabeth of Wittelsbach?
The Austrian empress who was assassinated?
She had a son with Franz Joseph I.
I figure I'm a direct descendant.
You know the film, The Sound or Music?
Did you notice the resemblance?
The youngest son of the Trapp family.
I'm sure I'm him.
I mean, it's possible that...
Let's go!
I'm the son of an Austrian prince!
It's mom!
When are you coming home?
When's not just yet?
Where are you?
Where's London?
Where's Europe?
Is it far?
Where's my sweatshirt with the zipper?
No, it's not in my top drawer.
OK, I love you too.
Bye.
Elise, Mom's on the phone.
I'm not here.
Yes, it's me.
No, they're fine, just great.
You can't do this to us.
Can you listen to me for one second?
Can you listen to me for a second, pl--
Hello?
Benoit, it's OK.
I'm here.
When you miss Mom, just close your eyes.
You'll see her at the piano.
You'll hear Beethoven in your head.
I don't see anything.
It's all dark in my head.
Try again.
Hello, Grandma.
Yes, everything's fine.
He can't talk right now.
He's sleeping, he has a cold.
Sure you can get a cold in summer.
I'll tell him to call you, OK?
I have to go, my toast's burning.
I'm warning you, Jean.
Keep out of it!
Take the dog inside.
But Daddy, they're too little to go to the pet shop!
Stop your whining!
Move it!
Daddy, no!
Move away!
Come witness the fantastic launch of the super go-kart!
Super go-kart?
- Ready?
- Sure.
Take it away!
You can do it!
Go on!
Wait.
Not so hot.
Bummer!
Some launch!
I told you a two-stroke motor wouldn't work.
The problem's the alternator.
Lawnmowers don't have alternators.
One day, Bem, someone's gonna smack you good
What for?
I want to fish.
I got a nibble!
Hello, Mr Lanthier.
Hi, Elise.
Can you get rid of these?
A two-storey bus!
Give me that.
Hel... lo...
Look what I caught.
Mom says stay away from the river.
I don't care about Mom.
I do what I want.
She abandoned us.
She didn't abandon us.
If there were water in the pool we could swim.
Elise, don't start.
Your mom's not here to watch over Benoit.
Aren't we going to Dairy Queen?
What are you doing?
We don't break toys!
You could have hurt yourself.
What'll I do with him?
Aren't we going to Dairy Queen?
Anybody home?
Hello, Mom.
What's all this?
Hi, Grandma.
Hi, Conrad, sweetie.
When did you start smoking?
What are you doing here?
I know it's Sunday.
I'm with the residents in favour of clotheslines.
Is your mother home?
She's at the hairdresser's.
I'll come back later.
Goodbye, kids.
Will someone explain?
She left.
Good Lord!
It can't be.
The first thing to do is... find a housekeeper.
Easier said than done.
Never!
The spitting image of her mom.
We're managing.
Besides, I'll be on holiday soon.
Dad didn't dare slap me when I said that Mom had slept with an Austrian prince.
He said he'd never hit a child.
But he uses bad words.
Words can hurt more than a good slap to the face.
When I answered,
"So why are you fat when I'm skinny?"
he turned all red and grabbed me by the arm.
I thought I'd had it, but just then Mom came back.
Play Nasty Words?
- Vater, grob.
- Housekeeper.
- Drachen, Weihnachten!
- Cat piss!
Isn't it a nice day for a picnic on the mountain?
Well?
You can't slay cooped up in the garage all summer.
I like it in the garage.
Young man, young man, do you know how to play?
Do you know how to play this violin?
I feel sick.
Dad, Benoit's sick.
Hold on, we're almost there.
- He's going to throw up.
- He won't.
No, shit!
Not in my panama, Benoit!
Isn't it beautiful?
Dad, can I ask you something?
Sure, what?
Did Mom leave because of me?
No, it's not your fault.
You're not to blame, Elise.
Then why did mom leave?
And don't answer with a proverb.
I didn't make her happy.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Don't lie.
I heard you crying.
I wasn't, idiot.
I have a cold.
You can't catch a cold in summer.
Yes you can.
That's gross.
It's not gross.
I'm cleaning it.
We don't fish for fun, like your town folks.
We fish 'cause we have nothing else to eat.
Know what we do with our worries?
We take them and throw them in the river.
Then they're gone, good riddance!
How big is your worry?
Like that.
That rock can't be budged.
You always have to exaggerate.
You can't just have a normal worry.
It's OK, she'll be better now.
But you have to let her rest, OK?
It's hard for her since your dad got sick.
It's not easy for you, either.
Remember, the grass is always greener on the other side.
Don't shout!
I hate clowns.
It's dark here.
Don't, I'm not allowed to open them.
- Close your eyes.
- I don't want to close my eyes.
Then leave them open.
Relax, you're all stiff.
Let's try again.
What's wrong?
What do you think?
I've got a hard-on!
Before that summer,
I thought eveyone was happy.
But behind the smiles lay so many sorrows and secrets.
Nothing had changed around me, the forbidden river, the cornfields, the mountain, the cracked asphalt...
My landmarks, Mom.
Heat up the macaroni for lunch.
I found a housekeeper for the fall.
We don't need a housekeeper!
Your go-kart's nice.
- Come help!
- Why?
It's my Mom.
She fainted in the shower.
It's all her medicine.
I don't want to see my mom naked.
Can you put on her bathrobe?
If you say my mom's weird,
I say your mom's gone.
I swear.
Spit on it.
Not in your house.
I'll let you see my aunt naked for a buck.
Too much!
This isn't Montreal.
She's not Brigitte Bardot.
It's not much.
This is all I have.
$20 What if your dad sees you?
Dad never sees me.
I don't have money.
I'll pay for him.
Can I owe you?
Free for girls.
No fair!
I'm the only one who paid.
Can we see her naked now?
Yeah, come on.
What if she needs some clothes?
It's my uncles closet.
I can't manage on Albert's pension.
A dead man's clothes?
Nice doggie!
Sorry, Jewel.
It won't take long.
Jean, it's your dad!
Keep quiet, Bernie.
Well, your dad-
Shut up, understand?
Jean!
I told you!
What are you doing?
You crazy?
I'm looking.
Looking for what?
For why Mom left.
In a golf bag?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
He has a migraine.
Give me that.
No cookies before supper.
Alright!
What's this book about?
An unhappy boy who learns how hard life is.
Myself, I'd never write about unhappy kids.
It's too banal.
"Myself".
Such grammar!
Be careful, Benoit.
Go get changed.
Put on your PJs.
It was an accident.
He has a coordination problem.
It's his motor development.
What are you saying?
Benoit's motor is fine.
It's me with the motor problems.
I need spark plugs.
We can't keep Benoit here without your mother.
He needs supervision.
I asked a psychiatrist friend for advice.
There's a school where he'll get help.
You're putting him in an asylum?
I didn't say an asylum.
I'm talking about a school.
That's ridiculous.
Thanks, Dad!
You can't knock over your glass.
Is Daddy sending me to an asylum?
No, that's for crazy people.
Maybe I'm crazy.
No, you're not crazy.
You're just different.
What's different?
Well, for example...
Bernard.
His hair's carrot-red.
He's different.
My hair's not carrot-red.
Well, like Mr Fly...
He has a birthmark on his face.
He's different.
You're different inside your head.
If it's inside my head, then no one can see it.
That's right, no one can see.
Are my girls here?
I can't find them.
I haven't seen them.
Where's your mom?
At the hairdresser's.
What's that noise?
I don't know.
What's he doing?
It's not a toy, it's dangerous.
Stop it!
He's crazy!
I always said that boy was strange.
Can't you behave like other people?
I've searched for an hour!
What are you doing?
Come here right now!
Voyeur!
Come, Elise!
- You're not my mother.
- You don't have one.
What's taking so long?
It's alright, they're specialists.
What kind of specialists?
Specialists for children.
Specialists, my ass!
What kind of language is that?
Go sit with your sister.
What did the specialists say?
He's gifted and dyslexic with personality disorders.
A whiz kid who mixes his Bs and Ps.
Bravo, who'd have thunk it?
What'll they do now?
It's more complicated than that.
There's a program that's opened, inspired by Dr. Bettelheim.
He's a leading expert on infantile problems.
Where's this infantile program?
In Sherbrooke.
Sherbrooke?
That's three hours away!
I don't care about the world, when Frederic reminds me of our loves when we were 20, our woes, our home not to forget
our best friends, today dispersed
to the four winds
We were neither poets nor priests, nor geniuses, but Dad loved us anyway...
Look at this year's corn!
It's perfect!
Lovely pale yellow kernels...
Where's Benoit?
It'll be cold.
Benoit, come eat!
Plus, it's healthy.
If you have your health, you have everything.
Not everything, just your health.
Conrad, sweetie, pass me the butter.
Why do you always call him that?
Well, it was your father's name.
And if you hadn't insisted, we'd have chosen differently
Mom will come back.
Mom will come back.
What is it, Elise?
Bring our Mom back!
Bring our Mom back!
OK, go ahead.
C'mon, quick!
He can't, it's too long.
Quiet, let him concentrate.
Stop!
Benoit, no!
Don't do it!
Hurry, Jean!
Benoit, get out of there!
I don't understand.
The garage almost burnt down!
What were you thinking?
Haven't I told you to watch him?
You stay out of the garage!
No more go-kart!
Where's Elise?
No, she's not here.
I were you, I'd keep an eye on her.
She went off with Mr Fly.
That reprehensible man.
I have two daughters, and I don't intend to let them...
Pass me your wife.
Thanks anyway.
I'll fetch Elise.
You stay here.
Real nice work.
But I can't give you more than...
$1,50 each.
His gems are worth more.
$1,50.
Here in London, DeGaulle's speech drew varied reactions.
On his visit to the Cambodian capital
France's president spoke in the stadium inaugurated by Prince Sihanouk and openly criticized the involvement of the US in Vietnam.
The general asked the United States on ways to end the war.
Simone Gauvin for Radio-Canada in London.
What's wrong with her?
Don't cry, dear.
I was worried to death.
Do you realize what time it is?
You won't spend all the summer in the garage.
Now go to bed.
He smashed the TV set with a hammer.
Will you buy a new one?
Yes, of course I will.
On the river bank, I fell asleep dreaming of heaven and earth
I was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight
Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down
My darling kids,
It rains a lot here.
In London the sky is always grey.
I'm looking for a big appartment so you can come stay with me.
Every morning the minute I open my eyes, I think of you.
Your loving Mom.
It's not fair.
I was supposed to go to boarding school.
Come on, Benoit!
Elise, don't!
Where will we go?
We're going to London.

MOMMY IS AT THE HAIRDRESSER'S
Elise, your brother wet his pants.
Don't worry, we're almost home.
Enjoy your summer, kids!
Say hi to your moms
Happy vacation!
Quiet, Jewel!
Hi, Mrs Corbeil
Hello, children!
My pants are all wet.
"Hundreds of thousands of US troops will cross
"the Pacific Ocean to fight
"in the jungle and rice paddies. "
I could write, "This marks a new escalation in the undeclared war
"waged by the US and their South Vietnamese allies "
Good, I'll talk to you next week.
Hi, bunny
Hi, Mom
Hold it!
Just a second
Your pants are on backwards again.
What did I tell you?
The zipper goes in frontl
- I forgot.
- That's OK.
Go on.
One foot.
Two feet.
You made a drawing?
- Thank you.
- She's the queen?
No, Mom.
It's you.
Me?
Show me.
It's beautiful.
I'm hungry.
What's to eat?
It's summer so I made your favourite.
Angel cake.
Elise, put on your shoes!
Goodbye, Mr Plumeau Thanks, see you!
Who was it, Bobino?
Hi, kids!
I thought it was a customer.
- But it was Mr Plumeau!
- Mr Plumeau?
Yes, look out the window.
Why didn't you come?
What's that?
A go-kart.
With a two-stroke motor?
- Like you're an expert?
- I am too!
What a know-it-all!
My uncle's a mechanic.
And mechanics is hereditary.
Bernie, you're full of it.
I am not.
The Martineaus, we have gas in our veins, not blood.
- Look at this.
- Where'd you get it?
You stole money?
Who said I stole it?
Catch, Tracto!
What'll you do with $10?
- Money buys everything.
- Buy red gas!
-And bum your motor?
-You could buy the new Beatles 45.
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Hi, guys.
Hi, Rom.
- I have a flat.
- Come on in.
Stay away from the river!
I used to go wandering along the mountain track
I love to sing, my knapsack on my back
Hi
I baked a cake.
My favourite!
It looks delicious.
Go get changed, Coco.
Wonderful.
He scares me.
Don't be a baby.
You wanted to come.
- I'm not a baby.
-Then let's go.
They're magnificient.
Little gems.
They look like real insects.
Perfect imitations.
No fish anywhere would suspect.
I'll take the Dark Montreal.
Yes, one.
And three salmon streamers.
Three.
Three lake salmon streamers.
How much?
How much?
$5.
It's a steal.
He's a grumpy SOB, but he makes beautiful flies.
I want to learn to fish this summer.
In that case, let a fisherman give you an advice.
If you want 'em to bite, you need faith.
Otherwise you'll never catch a thing!
Faith in what?
That's for you to discover.
Coming?
Faith!
I caught one!
Attack!
What are you doing?
I said not past your ankles.
Bye, Dad
Tractor, Bernard!
Look what we found for Coco in my dad's barn.
Can I get on?
Grab it here.
Mr Fly's back for the summer.
Don't let him hear you.
He's deaf.
Slow down!
I told you, he's crazy.
Hold tight, Benoit.
Why's Mr Fly's cheeck dirty like that?
The sign of the devil!
It's not the devil, it's coagulated blood.
Put on your shoes.
See you later?
Call me.
My lawnmower!
You said it was broken.
I'd have had it fixed.
Romeo, how's your mom?
Still the same.
Guess I'll have to buy a new lawnmower.
For your go-kart.
What is it?
It's from my tractor.
Will you tell me how it ends?
You'll never learn to read like that.
Elise is right.
Practice makes perfect!
Maybe he needs glasses.
Leave him alone.
He's going at his own speed.
When I was 6, I could read Tintin.
I was here.
You see?
In Afghanistan.
The cholera epidemic is so virulent, it's spread to Iran and Iraq.
A nasty business.
I'll never be like you, a specialist in tropical diseases, studying people's shit all day to find disgusting parasites.
What's studying shit to find disgusting parasites?
It's microbiology.
I'm going to be a truck driver.
Or a singer like the Beatles.
I'm never growing up.
What are 7 league boots?
They're boots that can take you to the end of the world.
See you.
"They fit his feet and legs as perfectly as if..."
OK, kids.
Bedtime.
No fair, I go to bed after him.
Good night.
- Will you sing me a song?
- Just one.
- I'm going to the hospital.
- Are you on call?
It's the summer schedule.
You haven't practised piano.
Play a little now before bed.
Stop, piano's important.
Move over.
What would you like me to sing?
The Country Life, Margot,
Beautiful Francoise, It Scares the Birds...
Beautiful Francoise.
Thanks, Grandma.
What a lovely roast beef!
Can't we eat like everyone?
That looks like cattle feet.
Brown rice still has all its nutrients.
White rice has nothing.
It's unhealthy.
Enjoy!
700 million Chinese eat white rice and they're not all sick.
But their skin is yellow.
- Stop fooling around!
- It's ok, bunny.
For wine stains, nothing beats salt.
Why doesn't Mr Fly put salt on his stain?
Elise, I told you.
Stay away from the river.
Remember Guillaume who drowned?
You've stold us that story 100 times.
And I wont stop!
Mr Fly...
He hates children.
I hear he even cooks them.
He cooks children?
Leave the poor man in peace.
1:00.
I have to go.
- Where?
- My golf tournament.
Didn't I tell you?
A fundraiser.
Can I work as your caddy?
You're too young.
Let him earn some money.
What's he need money for?
At his age?
I have to buy some bolts.
Mommy, I'm full.
Three more bites.
Frogs don't eat cereal.
What do they eat?
They eat maggots, stuff like that.
What's a maggot?
Maggots are... maggots.
Why are you sad?
My mom's sick again.
You can't imagine, having a mom with migraines.
I'm not allowed to breathe.
What are migraines?
They're like... a hammer pounding on your head non-stop.
There you go, missy.
Thanks.
When's the pool man coming?
I have to call him.
That tickles!
It tickles!
Mommy?
What's a maggot?
A maggot?
It's somone who has no backbone, who lacks all dignity.
Mommy, I saw the flag was up.
Thanks, bunny.
Come have lunch.
What about our holidays?
I thought about Tortoise Island.
Any tortoise?
Go to Haiti, with the kids?
We can stay at Dr. Campeau's dispensary.
That's your idea of a holiday, a leper colony?
Travel broadens you, right kids?
What's a leper?
A contagious disease.
Why not Cape Cod?
Over my dead body.
Parasols, ice boxes, water wings, suntan lotion, Noxzema, picking sand out of your sandwich, swimsuits, sleeping bags...
No, thank you.
Plus the icy water with seaweed and jellyfish.
Who wants lemonade?
What's jellyfish?
I never realized.
she hated camping so much.
Mommy, what's a jellyfish?
It's like floating jello.
Coco, not with your mouth full.
In English it's a jellyfish.
It's a marine animal.
A cnidarian, to be precise.
Get me the dictionary.
I knew it!
I have some big news!
Elise is going to boarding school next fall.
I'm not going to boarding school!
You're not going here.
We talked about it.
It's a fine school.
You can keep up your piano.
You'll come home on weekend.
You'll love it.
Dad, you can't let her force me!
It's reactonary.
And with the educational reform...
Please, stay out of this.
It'll ensure you get into university.
You yourself said those nuns smell like cat piss!
They may smell bad, but they can teach.
Anyway, the matter is closed.
May I leave, too?
Sure, go ahead.
Here, cnidarian.
"Radially symmetrical marine animal, 6 or 6 main classes.
"Digestion via stomach push.
"Possessing cells that can sting or kill."
Want to play with me?
Mom's sending me to a school run by stinky nuns.
Poor you!
You should pull a fit like my sister Anna.
Then dad gives her whatever she wants.
What does she do?
Why don't you try that, too?
With me, it won't help.
Dad doesn't care.
I'm not his son.
I'm skinny, he's fat.
I'm the son of an Austrian prince.
Mom told me.
Screw boarding school!
Are you there?
I'm over here.
What's up, bunny?
Does boarding school hurt?
No, it doesn't hurt.
It's true you sometimes feel homesick.
But you learn not to.
Stop, you didn't!
You really said that?
What are you doing?
You see I'm on the phone!
Shut the door, please.
Why did you do that?
Hello, could you watch the girls for two hours?
I'm off to SOS Somalia with books and pencils.
You look ill.
Education's the key.
Even Blacks deserve schools.
Despite our prejudices.
While I'm at it,
I have a petition here opposing clotheslines.
We can't let our lovely bungalows be sullied.
by badly bleached unmentionables!
This isn't Italy!
Do you aggree?
I don't give a damn about clotheslines.
You can pick up the girls later.
The nerve!
Do you want to skip rope?
What's wrong with you?
She threw the coffee at your dad?
That's how he takes it.
Let's go.
Jelly in the bowl!
Jelly in the...
What are you waiting for?
Jelly in the bowl!
Jelly in the...
You're such pests!
Wiggle waggle, wiggle waggle Jelly in the bowl!
Sausage in the pan
I'm not playing.
-What's with her now?
-I don't know.
Mom?
It's Sunday, it's not garbage day.
What's wrong?
Did your chain jump?
Don't worry.
I can fix it.
Romeo?
Come help me.
I gotta go.
What are you doing with Dad's stuff?
Throwing it out.
He'll leave the hospital.
He'll get better.
No.
He won't get better.
Come on...
You'll be OK.
Did you see Barnard?
He was going to help me with the hay.
He went to Mass with his parents.
Mom says the church keeps us in the dark.
Don't you have electricity?
Chocolate, please.
I want the London posting.
I can leave in a week.
The meeting is over.
Simone, please stay.
Jacques, close the door.
What's going on, Simone?
If I don't leave, I'll die.
I'll prepare your contract.
Thank you.
Choose Steve McQueen.
Josée?
Marlon Brando.
Louise?
- James Dean.
- That's me.
Ok, we're on for 15 minutes.
I don't need your consent.
I can't refuse this offer.
I'm a journalist, not just an ornament.
What are you thinking?
London?
It's ridiculous.
The kids can't be without their mother.
And Benoit?
He's already retarded.
I forbid you to say that.
He's perfectly normal.
He's slow, if you prefer.
You can't raise him from there.
They can come join me later.
Forget it.
We're not moving to London!
I didn't include you.
What's got into you?
There's something I'm missing.
When was the last time we made love?
Do you remember?
-What do you mean?
-Stop it!
Stop pretending.
You know what I mean.
This is ridiculous.
I'm talking about your golf mates.
You reproach me for playing golf?
That's exactly it.
- Stop it!
- Leave me alone!
Let go, you're hurting me!
Shit.
Simone!
Come out.
Stop, Simone!
I've been searching for you.
You know Princess Sissi,
Elisabeth of Wittelsbach?
The Austrian empress who was assassinated?
She had a son with Franz Joseph I.
I figure I'm a direct descendant.
You know the film, The Sound or Music?
Did you notice the resemblance?
The youngest son of the Trapp family.
I'm sure I'm him.
I mean, it's possible that...
Let's go!
I'm the son of an Austrian prince!
It's mom!
When are you coming home?
When's not just yet?
Where are you?
Where's London?
Where's Europe?
Is it far?
Where's my sweatshirt with the zipper?
No, it's not in my top drawer.
OK, I love you too.
Bye.
Elise, Mom's on the phone.
I'm not here.
Yes, it's me.
No, they're fine, just great.
You can't do this to us.
Can you listen to me for one second?
Can you listen to me for a second, pl--
Hello?
Benoit, it's OK.
I'm here.
When you miss Mom, just close your eyes.
You'll see her at the piano.
You'll hear Beethoven in your head.
I don't see anything.
It's all dark in my head.
Try again.
Hello, Grandma.
Yes, everything's fine.
He can't talk right now.
He's sleeping, he has a cold.
Sure you can get a cold in summer.
I'll tell him to call you, OK?
I have to go, my toast's burning.
I'm warning you, Jean.
Keep out of it!
Take the dog inside.
But Daddy, they're too little to go to the pet shop!
Stop your whining!
Move it!
Daddy, no!
Move away!
Come witness the fantastic launch of the super go-kart!
Super go-kart?
- Ready?
- Sure.
Take it away!
You can do it!
Go on!
Wait.
Not so hot.
Bummer!
Some launch!
I told you a two-stroke motor wouldn't work.
The problem's the alternator.
Lawnmowers don't have alternators.
One day, Bem, someone's gonna smack you good
What for?
I want to fish.
I got a nibble!
Hello, Mr Lanthier.
Hi, Elise.
Can you get rid of these?
A two-storey bus!
Give me that.
Hel... lo...
Look what I caught.
Mom says stay away from the river.
I don't care about Mom.
I do what I want.
She abandoned us.
She didn't abandon us.
If there were water in the pool we could swim.
Elise, don't start.
Your mom's not here to watch over Benoit.
Aren't we going to Dairy Queen?
What are you doing?
We don't break toys!
You could have hurt yourself.
What'll I do with him?
Aren't we going to Dairy Queen?
Anybody home?
Hello, Mom.
What's all this?
Hi, Grandma.
Hi, Conrad, sweetie.
When did you start smoking?
What are you doing here?
I know it's Sunday.
I'm with the residents in favour of clotheslines.
Is your mother home?
She's at the hairdresser's.
I'll come back later.
Goodbye, kids.
Will someone explain?
She left.
Good Lord!
It can't be.
The first thing to do is... find a housekeeper.
Easier said than done.
Never!
The spitting image of her mom.
We're managing.
Besides, I'll be on holiday soon.
Dad didn't dare slap me when I said that Mom had slept with an Austrian prince.
He said he'd never hit a child.
But he uses bad words.
Words can hurt more than a good slap to the face.
When I answered,
"So why are you fat when I'm skinny?"
he turned all red and grabbed me by the arm.
I thought I'd had it, but just then Mom came back.
Play Nasty Words?
- Vater, grob.
- Housekeeper.
- Drachen, Weihnachten!
- Cat piss!
Isn't it a nice day for a picnic on the mountain?
Well?
You can't slay cooped up in the garage all summer.
I like it in the garage.
Young man, young man, do you know how to play?
Do you know how to play this violin?
I feel sick.
Dad, Benoit's sick.
Hold on, we're almost there.
- He's going to throw up.
- He won't.
No, shit!
Not in my panama, Benoit!
Isn't it beautiful?
Dad, can I ask you something?
Sure, what?
Did Mom leave because of me?
No, it's not your fault.
You're not to blame, Elise.
Then why did mom leave?
And don't answer with a proverb.
I didn't make her happy.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Don't lie.
I heard you crying.
I wasn't, idiot.
I have a cold.
You can't catch a cold in summer.
Yes you can.
That's gross.
It's not gross.
I'm cleaning it.
We don't fish for fun, like your town folks.
We fish 'cause we have nothing else to eat.
Know what we do with our worries?
We take them and throw them in the river.
Then they're gone, good riddance!
How big is your worry?
Like that.
That rock can't be budged.
You always have to exaggerate.
You can't just have a normal worry.
It's OK, she'll be better now.
But you have to let her rest, OK?
It's hard for her since your dad got sick.
It's not easy for you, either.
Remember, the grass is always greener on the other side.
Don't shout!
I hate clowns.
It's dark here.
Don't, I'm not allowed to open them.
- Close your eyes.
- I don't want to close my eyes.
Then leave them open.
Relax, you're all stiff.
Let's try again.
What's wrong?
What do you think?
I've got a hard-on!
Before that summer,
I thought eveyone was happy.
But behind the smiles lay so many sorrows and secrets.
Nothing had changed around me, the forbidden river, the cornfields, the mountain, the cracked asphalt...
My landmarks, Mom.
Heat up the macaroni for lunch.
I found a housekeeper for the fall.
We don't need a housekeeper!
Your go-kart's nice.
- Come help!
- Why?
It's my Mom.
She fainted in the shower.
It's all her medicine.
I don't want to see my mom naked.
Can you put on her bathrobe?
If you say my mom's weird,
I say your mom's gone.
I swear.
Spit on it.
Not in your house.
I'll let you see my aunt naked for a buck.
Too much!
This isn't Montreal.
She's not Brigitte Bardot.
It's not much.
This is all I have.
$20 What if your dad sees you?
Dad never sees me.
I don't have money.
I'll pay for him.
Can I owe you?
Free for girls.
No fair!
I'm the only one who paid.
Can we see her naked now?
Yeah, come on.
What if she needs some clothes?
It's my uncles closet.
I can't manage on Albert's pension.
A dead man's clothes?
Nice doggie!
Sorry, Jewel.
It won't take long.
Jean, it's your dad!
Keep quiet, Bernie.
Well, your dad-
Shut up, understand?
Jean!
I told you!
What are you doing?
You crazy?
I'm looking.
Looking for what?
For why Mom left.
In a golf bag?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
He has a migraine.
Give me that.
No cookies before supper.
Alright!
What's this book about?
An unhappy boy who learns how hard life is.
Myself, I'd never write about unhappy kids.
It's too banal.
"Myself".
Such grammar!
Be careful, Benoit.
Go get changed.
Put on your PJs.
It was an accident.
He has a coordination problem.
It's his motor development.
What are you saying?
Benoit's motor is fine.
It's me with the motor problems.
I need spark plugs.
We can't keep Benoit here without your mother.
He needs supervision.
I asked a psychiatrist friend for advice.
There's a school where he'll get help.
You're putting him in an asylum?
I didn't say an asylum.
I'm talking about a school.
That's ridiculous.
Thanks, Dad!
You can't knock over your glass.
Is Daddy sending me to an asylum?
No, that's for crazy people.
Maybe I'm crazy.
No, you're not crazy.
You're just different.
What's different?
Well, for example...
Bernard.
His hair's carrot-red.
He's different.
My hair's not carrot-red.
Well, like Mr Fly...
He has a birthmark on his face.
He's different.
You're different inside your head.
If it's inside my head, then no one can see it.
That's right, no one can see.
Are my girls here?
I can't find them.
I haven't seen them.
Where's your mom?
At the hairdresser's.
What's that noise?
I don't know.
What's he doing?
It's not a toy, it's dangerous.
Stop it!
He's crazy!
I always said that boy was strange.
Can't you behave like other people?
I've searched for an hour!
What are you doing?
Come here right now!
Voyeur!
Come, Elise!
- You're not my mother.
- You don't have one.
What's taking so long?
It's alright, they're specialists.
What kind of specialists?
Specialists for children.
Specialists, my ass!
What kind of language is that?
Go sit with your sister.
What did the specialists say?
He's gifted and dyslexic with personality disorders.
A whiz kid who mixes his Bs and Ps.
Bravo, who'd have thunk it?
What'll they do now?
It's more complicated than that.
There's a program that's opened, inspired by Dr. Bettelheim.
He's a leading expert on infantile problems.
Where's this infantile program?
In Sherbrooke.
Sherbrooke?
That's three hours away!
I don't care about the world, when Frederic reminds me of our loves when we were 20, our woes, our home not to forget
our best friends, today dispersed
to the four winds
We were neither poets nor priests, nor geniuses, but Dad loved us anyway...
Look at this year's corn!
It's perfect!
Lovely pale yellow kernels...
Where's Benoit?
It'll be cold.
Benoit, come eat!
Plus, it's healthy.
If you have your health, you have everything.
Not everything, just your health.
Conrad, sweetie, pass me the butter.
Why do you always call him that?
Well, it was your father's name.
And if you hadn't insisted, we'd have chosen differently
Mom will come back.
Mom will come back.
What is it, Elise?
Bring our Mom back!
Bring our Mom back!
OK, go ahead.
C'mon, quick!
He can't, it's too long.
Quiet, let him concentrate.
Stop!
Benoit, no!
Don't do it!
Hurry, Jean!
Benoit, get out of there!
I don't understand.
The garage almost burnt down!
What were you thinking?
Haven't I told you to watch him?
You stay out of the garage!
No more go-kart!
Where's Elise?
No, she's not here.
I were you, I'd keep an eye on her.
She went off with Mr Fly.
That reprehensible man.
I have two daughters, and I don't intend to let them...
Pass me your wife.
Thanks anyway.
I'll fetch Elise.
You stay here.
Real nice work.
But I can't give you more than...
$1,50 each.
His gems are worth more.
$1,50.
Here in London, DeGaulle's speech drew varied reactions.
On his visit to the Cambodian capital
France's president spoke in the stadium inaugurated by Prince Sihanouk and openly criticized the involvement of the US in Vietnam.
The general asked the United States on ways to end the war.
Simone Gauvin for Radio-Canada in London.
What's wrong with her?
Don't cry, dear.
I was worried to death.
Do you realize what time it is?
You won't spend all the summer in the garage.
Now go to bed.
He smashed the TV set with a hammer.
Will you buy a new one?
Yes, of course I will.
On the river bank, I fell asleep dreaming of heaven and earth
I was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight
Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down
My darling kids,
It rains a lot here.
In London the sky is always grey.
I'm looking for a big appartment so you can come stay with me.
Every morning the minute I open my eyes, I think of you.
Your loving Mom.
It's not fair.
I was supposed to go to boarding school.
Come on, Benoit!
Elise, don't!
Where will we go?
We're going to London.

ZACH:
I bet you're wondering why I called you here this morning.
See, in the criminal justice system, the State can't put a person on trial on my say-so alone.
As Deputy Attorney General, I present you with the evidence.
You, the grand jury, decide if we proceed to trial.
You will see evidence of an attorney's behavior that crossed the line from flamboyant to criminal.
You will see attorney misconduct so egregious that today, a registered sex offender, a man who admitted to killing a 12-year-old boy, is walking the streets a free man.
And that's why I feel confident to return a felony indictment for subornation of perjury and jury tampering against this lawyer, Elizabeth Canterbury.

LIZ:
You first.
(MATT GROANS)
MATT:
Why can't we just stay like this all day?
(LAUGHS) I can, but you can't.
Hmm.
Why not?
Someone has to teach those students to think like lawyers.
What time is it?
Oh!
I gotta go.
(GIGGLES)
Save me some hot water.
This was big stuff, wasn't it, Officer Callahan?
Hell, it even had its own name.
The Heidi bandit.
Cute.
Catchy.
A lady bank robber sells papers.
Let's just be clear.
It wasn't possible to see the robber's face on the videotape made by the bank security cameras, was it?
No.
She wore a mask.
CALLAHAN:
All that was visible were her blonde pigtails.
Ergo, Heidi.
Tell us, Officer.
When you arrested my client, two weeks after the robbery, was her hair in pigtails then?
No.
But she was blonde.
Ooh!
Ought to be a law, right?
Did you arrest every blonde that you saw over that two-week period?
Your client was sitting in the parking lot of another bank.
I suspected she was casing it for another robbery.
When I searched the trunk, I found a gun and a ski mask.
The real issue here is whether you had probable cause to search her car in the first place.
I've already ruled on this, Ms. Canterbury.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot.
Being blonde in the state of Rhode Island means you kiss your constitutional rights goodbye.
Objection.
LIZ:
Withdrawn.
Officer Callahan, have you ever said to yourself,
"He just looks guilty."
Sure.
Arrested him?
Yeah.
Was he convicted?
CALLAHAN:
Some were, some weren't.
So, sometimes you were wrong.
Sometimes those who looked guilty weren't.
Your client had the mask and the gun in the trunk...
Yes or no?
Yes.
One last question.
How many of those acquitted were blonde?
(JURY LAUGHING)
Elizabeth.
You mind?
Go ahead.
Yeah?
Same.
BARTENDER:
You got it.
You don't even know what I'm having.
After five hours in a grand jury,
I don't care.
BARTENDER:
There you go.
Well, I hope it was a nice, juicy, class A felony.
Matter of fact, I think you would have liked this one.
Unfortunately, what happens in the grand jury stays in the grand jury.
Well, good luck to you.
More clients for me.
The Heidi bandit?
How do these people find you?
I'm just glad that they do.
Mmm.
You know, this is nice.
Me, you.
Two traveling pilgrims, resting their weary souls at the Tabard.
The Tabard?
What, did you Google me and end up on a Chaucer site?
Hey, I read a book now and again.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
Fast jury.
Yeah?
Be right there.
Uh-uh.
On me.
That's so unlike you, Zach.
Mmm.
I'm feeling generous.
Go get your verdict.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
God.
(BANGING ON DOOR)
All right.
All right.
Hold on.
Who is it?
(BANGING CONTINUES)
God.
What do you want?
Mr. Angstrom?
Let me check my driver's license.
We have a warrant to search the premises, Mr. Angstrom.
FRANK:
For what?
Wait a minute.
For what, guys?
Hey.
Seriously.
She's legal, by the way.
(PHONE DIALING)
(RINGING)
Son of a bitch.
Who made this coffee?
The thing is, Russell, coffee's supposed to be hot.
You know what?
Screw it.
Let's sue.
We're insured.
Put some cold water on it, and if you trip on the way to the sink, make sure you break a rib or a collarbone.
We're talking windfall.
Don't you have a trial to get ready for?
Free Heidi!
Which leads me to...
She's coming tomorrow with the checkbook.
Guys, I got a new one.
When a lawyer dies, why do they bury him 30 feet under the ground?
Okay.
We'll give.
'Cause deep down, they really are nice guys.
Yo, I killed on open mike night with that.
Call Annabeth.
Tell her anytime tomorrow's good.
Okay.
Hey, Chester.
Your old man called.
Yeah, take a message.
I did.
He says it's important.
You know, at my last job, the lawyers all hated each other.
We're one big happy family.
Yeah, I was out of there as soon as the in-house shrink showed up.
Oh!
Hey, your bar review tutor called.
I thought you took the bar already.
(WHISPERING) Not so loud.
Your secret's safe.
There's no secret.
Of course.
Now?
But I...
Okay, so does anyone besides me think Martin's a little too friendly?
Are you okay?
Something's come up.
I have to go.
Family?
Cover for me in court.
His name's Artie Flom.
He sells Christian literature.
He's wanted for operating a vehicle under the influence.
Just stand there and ask for an adjournment.
But what if the judge won't...
It's what happens when you pass the bar.
So act like a lawyer.
Hey, Russ.
Hey, how are you on Article 9?
It wasn't my favorite.
Yeah.
Me neither.
Well, Mel Kreiger just declared bankruptcy, and we're his biggest creditor.
I'm sorry.
This isn't your problem.
So...
So Chester wants me to fill in for him in court today.
Yeah?
Congratulations.
I'm sorry I can't be there to cheer you on.
(INTERCOM BEEPS)
Yeah?
Mel.
You're the exact person I need to talk to.
Yeah, I got...
I got half of it.
No.
No, no, no.
That's okay.
Hey, Liz.
That's unbelievable on the Heidi bandit.
Yeah.
You win some.
Yeah.
So, Chester handed off his trial to me.
Oh?
First-time jitters?
You'll get your sea legs after your first witness.
Second, tops.
I don't know, Liz.
Hey, I only took the case to give Chester more court time experience.
His loss has just turned into your gain.
I don't think you understand.
My first time, it was fine after I finished puking.
Two words of advice.
One, do not eat Mexican before a trial.
And two, whatever happens, you get to go home and we get paid.
It'd be nice if you'd answer your phone every once in a while.
It's you who's been calling.
(CHUCKLES)
Liz, the cops searched both my apartment and my office.
They had a warrant, but they confiscated some files.
I'll get you a good lawyer.
What'd you do this time?
They said it was something about wiretapping, but I'm pretty sure, from what they seized, it was about you.
Me?
What did I do?
Well, other than making Zach Williams look like an ass in court...
Well, he is an ass, in and out of court.
And they took the Foster case file.
Ethan Foster was acquitted.
Last I looked, double jeopardy.
Liz, listen to me.
They took the file on Patti Murphy.
Better known as Juror Number Seven.
PATTI:
Sorry.
I don't know him.
Never saw him in your life?
Nope.
Not that I remember.
ZACH:
Okay.
Now, during the week that you sat as Juror Number Seven for the Ethan Foster murder trial, did you visit the doctor?
The judge adjourned early one day.
My sinuses were killing me.
You still don't recognize him?
His name is Frank Angstrom.
PATTI:
Sorry.
He was in Dr. Boyton's office at the same time you were.
I was sick.
I really wasn't looking at the other patients.
He wasn't a patient.
Do you know how I know that?
Because Rita, Dr. Boyton's receptionist, told me so.
She said she thought you two were there together.
Why...
Why do you suppose she would say that?
Maybe I do remember talking to him.
Rita told our investigator that you two left together.
Why do you want to ruin my life?
Why are you lying to this grand jury?
I'm married.
So you're saying that you two were intimate.
It's the first time...
Did he tell you that he was a private investigator that worked for Elizabeth Canterbury?
Of course not.
He did talk about the trial with you.
PATTI:
I didn't even know his real name.
Did you talk about the trial with him, Mrs. Murphy?
He wanted to know what direction we were leaning in the case.
ZACH:
Which was?
We didn't believe Ethan Foster's alibi.
So what, if anything, unexpected happened in the trial the following day?
Mrs. Murphy?
If I had known...
No, answer the question, Mrs. Murphy.
The lawyer...
Elizabeth Canterbury.
She put Ethan Foster on the stand.
He said he had been lying about his alibi all along.
So, the defendant changed his story after you told Ms. Canterbury's private investigator that the jury wasn't buying it.
Now, if you're interested, what Canterbury did is called subornation of perjury.
Steroids are against the rules, which makes it cheating.
So's a spitball, but they still put Gaylord Perry in the hall of fame, didn't they?
Nothing wrong with a little cheating, as long as you don't get caught.
No way to live your life.
No.
No, it isn't.
Unless, of course, it's essential you win.
(SIGHS)
The problem, my friend, is, what goes around...
That's a subpoena to testify in front of the grand jury investigating Elizabeth Canterbury.
Drink up, pal.
Next one's on me.
MAN:
Yeah, he was there with Mr. Gooden.
They were definitely having a good time.
As in, they were drinking?
It was a bar, and it was Mr. Gooden's birthday.
Mr. Flom was celebrating with him?
Him and three, four other guys.
Do you recall what time Mr. Flom left your bar?
10:15.
I was just going on break.
No further questions, Your Honor.
Um...
The defense asks the court to reconsider its motion for an adjournment.
You don't give up, do you?
No, Your Honor.
JUDGE:
Neither do I. Motion denied again.
Cross-examine or forever hold your peace.
Um... (STUTTERING)
Was Mr. Flom drunk when...
KLEIN:
Objection.
Calls for a conclusion.
JUDGE:
Sustained.
Was he acting odd...
KLEIN:
Objection.
Sustained.
Did any of the other customers complain...
Objection.
Calls for hearsay.
JUDGE:
Sustained.
That's strike three, counselor.
Was Mr. Flom acting any differently than he's acted on any of the other occasions when you served him drinks?
I watch a lot of Law and Order.
You might want to consider going pro Se, Mr. Flom.
Any objection, Mr. Klein?
I object.
Congratulations.
Your tuition wasn't a complete waste.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Hey!
Look who's here.
My reason for getting up in the morning.
Henry, come here.
Shake hands with my son.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Summa cum laude at Howard U.
Top two percent of his class at Georgetown Law.
Small class.
Listen, be good to him, Henry.
He's on the road to judge.
I'm in a rush, Dad.
Moving and shaking, huh?
Come on.
Come in.
Don't you ever get tired of that?
No, I don't.
Yeah, well, I'm supposed to be in court, so I'd appreciate...
A successful man kibitzes...
CHESTER:
Good-bye.
Your boss is about to self-destruct.
Listen, in my position, I hear things.
Zach Williams is presenting to the grand jury, as we speak.
For what?
I don't know.
Something to do with that Ethan Foster case.
Canterbury's going down, and everybody around her is going along for the ride.
Listen.
I can make a call, get you in at Merriweather Marx.
You never give up, do you?
I'm sorry you can't brag about me to the boys at the club, but this is my life.
Excuse me.
But even a rat knows when it's time to haul his butt overboard.
(SIGHS)
Is it true?
What are we talking about?
Damn it, Russell, this is my future, too.
So Liz isn't being investigated by a grand jury?
It's an old AG trick, you know?
Put fear into the defense bar, try and keep them in line.
Besides, I second-seated Liz on the Ethan Foster case.
Do I look worried?
No, you don't.
But I didn't mention the Ethan Foster case.
Nice!
A '61 Haut-Brion.
It's not our anniversary.
MATT:
We're celebrating your verdict.
It was all over the news.
To kicking butt.
Thank you.
Free Heidi.
Now, I want to talk about something, and I want you to think about it before you react.
You got tickets to the Yankee-Sox game?
No, I'm trying to be serious.
You got me those passes to the designer trunk show?
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
Forget it.
Honey, come on.
I'm just screwing with you.
You know I'm game for anything.
Oh.
Sorry.
We can't go on ignoring the pink elephant in the room, Beth.
I know.
You're right.
I want to have a funeral for Sam.
He's not coming home.
And without giving up hope, we have to accept that and try to move on.
Some maniac took our son, Matt.
Where exactly do you propose we move on to?
All right.
Forget I brought it up.
Look, I know what you're trying to do.
But having some phony ritual isn't going to make us forget.
It's not a phony ritual.
Oh, baby.
Time.
That's all we need, is time.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
What we need is to stop jumping every time the phone rings.
(RINGING CONTINUES)
See?
I'm not jumping.
Just promise me you'll leave that phone home Thursday night.
Just me in my skimpiest.
Maybe it won't be so horrible.
Come on.
We'll have fun.
Besides, I like being scrutinized.
Yes.
I noticed.
I'll be the perfect little wife.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
(RINGING CONTINUES)
FRANK:
I won't testify.
He'll nail you for contempt.
I'll lie.
Ask Scooter Libby how well that worked out for him.
You just love this, don't you?
Coming in on your white horse, saving the damsel in distress.
Actually, I just love being thanked.
By you.
You know, the Ethan Foster case was the first time I've ever...
You don't have to explain to me.
You did what you had to do.
KATE:
Even if they realize that he's lying, you still can't prove that she put him up to it.
Res ipsa loquiter.
The thing does not speak for itself.
Canterbury finds out from Frank that her horse is stuck in the gate.
She jumps on another one midstream.
Yeah, but you still can't prove that she sent Frank to go seduce a juror.
I'm just getting started.
ZACH:
When did Ms. Canterbury decide to let you testify, Mr. Foster?
It was my idea.
Oh.
Of course it was.
Of course it was.
But she did tell you what to say, didn't she?
Right?
Mr. Foster?
I told the truth.
When you testified that Scott Jasper's father beat him?
That's right.
So what you're saying is that your mom and dad lied when they signed statements under oath, saying that you were asleep the night of the murders.
It would be wonderful, wouldn't it, Mr. Foster, if you could have it both ways?
KATE:
Thanks.
Here you go.
Mmm.
Bribing a public official.
Better impanel a grand jury.
You know I can't say anything, Russell.
I think you just did.
Look, if it were up to me...
How bad is it?
I shouldn't be talking to you.
Oh, right.
Two old friends talking.
Two former colleagues.
Zach might indict us.
Zach is Zach.
Nobody knows that better than you, right, Katie?
Look, what do you want from me?
You know Zach's not going to overlook two felony counts.
Canterbury's his golden goose.
Kate.
Two felonies?
You didn't hear that from me.
Done.
How bad?
It's really bad.
Buy me lunch.
I'm just going to say this.
I'm being investigated by the grand jury.
I know.
So do I.
Well, aren't I the jerk?
Oh.
Well, at least one of us is earning her keep.
Look, it's not like I shot anyone.
Zach Williams just thinks I crossed the line in the Ethan Foster case.
Okay, I did.
But it was only to prevent Ethan Foster from going to prison for the rest of his life for something he didn't do.
And if you must know, I would do the exact same thing again tomorrow.
He can't prove anything, right?
Well, okay, then.
It's not the end of the world.
I mean, sure, an indictment's bad, but it's a long way from conviction.
I'll start researching a motion to dismiss tomorrow.
Excuse me, but you have a trial to finish.
What can I say?
Artie Flom likes you.
I've already started drafting the papers.
(DOOR CLOSES)
(LIZ CLEARS THROAT)
Look, if anyone wants to bail, I will totally understand.
It's a lot worse than you think.
Don't worry.
I will testify under oath that you had no idea what I was doing.
Sure, why not add a perjury count to the indictment?
Okay, you're angry.
I get it.
And if I were you, I would resign and get as far away from me as you can.
That's right. 'Cause I'm just a flunky with a degree on the wall who's on a need-to-know basis.
You know what pisses me off?
What?
You think I would just turn my back, abandon you.
You think it's my own ass I'm worried about.
This isn't about a rap on the knuckles, Russell.
I'm looking at jail time.
You had nothing to do with it.
We're partners!
We share profits and expenses.
We didn't sign some kind of blood oath.
So if I were the one being investigated?
You're not!
This is my problem, and I will deal with it.
Isn't it true, Ms. Canterbury, that Frank Angstrom's been your private investigator for the last three years?
Leave, Russell.
Frank Angstrom was working on the Ethan Foster case.
Correct?
Tell me, how would a file containing personal information on one of the jurors which, by the way, contained your handwriting, wind up in Mr. Angstrom's office?
You always instruct your private investigators to sleep with jurors?
What?
Look, I don't care what your personal relationship is with Frank.
What is that supposed to mean?
Like I said, this is a lot worse than you think.
Oh, God.
Anderson controls, not Shapiro.
Unless, of course, you're out in California.
Nobody knows what the loony birds out there will do.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Since it is likely that more of you will end up as criminals than criminal lawyers, it's a good idea to learn this stuff either way.
Now, for next week, I want three cases.
Okay?
Three cases.
Class dismissed.
What's up?
Matt, I think I might have really screwed up.
What?
What, is something wrong?
What?
What's wrong?
Yeah, I...
Well, you know, the black dress with the little frills?
(STUTTERS)
I forgot to take it to the cleaner, and there's wine all down the front of it.
(LAUGHS)
So?
You'll wear the one you wore to Casey's wedding.
I just want tomorrow night to work out for you.
(CHUCKLES) Thank you.
That's very sweet.
LIZ:
What the hell are you doing?
Just paying my bill.
Oh, no.
It's illegal for me to take proceeds from a criminal act as compensation.
Hello?
You got me off, remember?
I'm innocent.
Ergo, this can't be proceeds of a crime.
Don't you love Latin?
I didn't prove you innocent.
I proved you not guilty.
You say tomato...
And I got you off because the cops screwed up.
Well, looks like someone's grown a set of scruples.
Excuse me?
Come on.
You took my case.
You had to know...
That the cops violated your rights by searching your trunk without probable cause.
And if I let it slide for you, that might be a free pass for them to do it to someone who's actually innocent.
What about my false arrest suit against the city?
Goodbye.
But you said that...
Get out.
I am done with you.
Go.
Martin!
Martin!
Hey.
I need Molly.
Where is she?
She's at her bar review class.
What?
What?
Oh, afternoon Mass.
Oh, my God.
Drinks are on me when we win.
No, when I get my car back from the impound, we'll open up the 25-year-old single malt.
It was in your car?
Oh, no, it's not what you think.
The bottle was a birthday present for my boss...
Right.
And it was in your car.
Yeah, I was going to give it to him in the morning.
LIZ:
Molly?
(WHISPERING) Go to the men's room.
I don't have to.
Just go.
Look, before you fire me, I think we can win this.
LIZ:
Officer Benson, what time does your tour typically end?
That would be midnight.
So why on that particular night, did you clock out at 12 minutes past 1:00?
Oh, trust me.
I already spoke to your desk sergeant.
Tell me this.
Did you search my client's car after you arrested him?
Yes.
Did you make an inventory list?
BENSON:
Of course.
Is this it?
Yeah.
Was there any alcohol listed here?
All the booze in that car was in your client.
(PEOPLE LAUGHING)
LIZ:
What if I told you that when Mr. Flom left the bar that night, he went to Regal Liquor down the block and purchased a $200 bottle of scotch?
I'd tell him the $10 bottle works just as good.
Funny.
Isn't it true that you and your partner took that $200 bottle from Mr. Flom's car?
No.
Isn't it true that you and your partner sat in your squad car and drank my client's scotch, and that's why you clocked in over an hour late that night?
I said no.
What was your blood alcohol level that night, Officer, as you cruised the streets of Providence?
I didn't take...
No?
Well, where's the bottle?
The only difference between you and my client is you have a badge.
Objection.
Sustained.
The State requests that Your Honor instruct the jury to disregard all testimony regarding this $200 bottle of scotch, as there is no evidence that it ever existed.
Fine.
Then we'll wait.
Are you done with this witness, counselor?
Oh, no.
Not by a long shot.
We'll continue when Mr. Flom's assistant arrives with a time-stamped receipt from Regal Liquor.
OFFICER:
I don't see what relevance...
It was purchased at 10:27, the night of the arrest, eight minutes before Officer Benson arrested my client.
Since it isn't on the inventory list, that leaves three possibilities.
One, Mr. Flom drank the entire bottle of scotch in under eight minutes, which is highly unlikely, because if he had, he'd be dead.
Or two, Mr. Flom tossed the bottle of scotch out the car window when Officer Benson signaled for him to pull over, also unlikely because A, a good cop would have seen it, and B, $200 is $200.
You said there were three possibilities.
Three,
Officer Benson isn't just a liar.
He's also a thief and a drunk.
Hey.
Am I that predictable?
Superstitious might be a better word.
That's the worst part of trying a case, when there's nothing left to do.
Yeah.
Listen, about Molly...
I'll just assume you didn't know.
But how'd you know about me...
My old man.
Let me guess.
He advised you to cut and run.
Hey, I don't listen to his advice.
Way I see it, you did what you had to do.
That's why we play the game, right?
To win.
First off, Ethan Foster didn't kill anyone.
Second, a criminal trial is not about the lawyers.
Really?
What is it about?
I'm going to give you a hint.
It starts with a J.
You can't even say it.
Liz, with all due respect, but justice?
If anyone gave a damn about justice, we wouldn't have exclusionary rules and privileges.
Hell, we wouldn't have any rules of evidence at all.
The notion of justice is a fiction, a rationalization of what the criminal justice system is really serving.
Which is?
The attorney's ego.
You think Zach Williams gives a damn whether or not Ethan Foster was put in prison or not?
He could care less.
His only concern is that he lost and you won.
And do I think for a minute you may have suborned perjury because you wanted to serve the greater good?
Please...
Don't make me fire you, Chester.
Hey, it's why I wanted to work for you.
And I thought you just wanted to stick it to the old man.
I like winning.
I crave it.
I need it.
I'm just like you, boss.
Oh, I assure you we have less in common than you think.
Hmm.
So why'd you hire me?
There's all kinds of diversity, Chester.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
Yeah?
JUDGE:
Have you reached a verdict?
We have.
On the sole count of operating a vehicle under the influence, we find the defendant,
Arthur S. Flom, not guilty.
Thank you.
When I was 12, I came in second in the city-wide spelling bee.
Prerogative.
Left out an R.
My dad was sitting there with all his friends, and I screwed up.
I locked myself in my room for two weeks and studied the dictionary.
My mom had to leave my dinner by the door.
Next year, I won.
Look, I don't fail, Liz.
I'm just not good at it.
I mean, I would have locked myself in my room, but it's just not that simple anymore.
We could have been sued.
I know.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Can I ask you something?
Yesterday, in court, that whole liquor store receipt thing?
What would you have done if the judge called your bluff?
Deny, deny, deny.
Yeah, Flom was guilty, so what's the difference, right?
Maybe guilt is relative.
God, I hope so.
I'm going to pack up my desk.
Hey.
If putting this firm in jeopardy was the standard,
I would have been out of here a long time ago.
You know, there's a lot of great lawyers in this country that failed the bar the first time.
There was...
What's his name?
You know, and...
Oh, and...
Go home.
Just get rest.
MAN:
It's a matter of substantive due process, that's why.
LIZ:
When was the last time anyone took Griswold seriously?
Exactly my point.
And Lawrence v. Texas?
Forget about it.
I couldn't agree with you more.
Just this morning at breakfast,
Matt was saying how the entire court should take a remedial class in the fifth amendment.
I believe I said it was the 14th amendment.
That's right.
You did.
I do that all the time.
Well, you could have said the fifth.
The missus.
She's a keeper, Matthew.
Yes.
I know.
Excuse me.
Thank God.
I was running out of cases.
I've been wanting to say hello to you all night, Elizabeth.
I mean, Ms. Canterbury.
This is Carly O'Keefe, one of my better students.
Working my way through law school.
Good for you.
It can't be...
I feel like I know you.
Matthew discusses your cases and trial techniques.
The winners, I hope.
From what I hear, you hardly ever lose.
I'm blushing.
I'll get you another drink.
Well, thank you.
She's a good kid.
Very bright.
Is she?
"Matthew."
"Matthew."
MATT:
♪ In Dublin's Fair City
♪ Where the girls are so pretty ♪
You owe me big time, fella.
Yes, I do.
Why don't we go upstairs?
We can pretend we got lost.
You asked the chairman of the board of trustees to come back here for a nightcap.
Yeah, but wouldn't you rather get naked, go three rounds under the sheets, you know?
You can tell him...
Just tell him that he had a fantastic time, and he'll never know the difference.
No, Beth, come on.
Fine.
"Matthew."
(DOORBELL RINGS)
Not now, Beth.
Didn't know I was saying anything.
SANDY:
Hi!
Come on in!
I know you were just trying to help.
Heroes with clay feet, hard to take.
She's hardly my hero.
You turned down a job with a major firm in Boston.
Spending my life dotting i's and crossing t's on 200-page contracts...
Sure.
That's it.
Let's not dwell on past mistakes.
I'll call Merriweather Marx first thing.
I wouldn't be surprised if they've doubled your salary overnight.
I'm not leaving Canterbury, Dad.
Then what are we doing here?
I was thinking maybe you could pull some of those strings you're always talking about to get the AG off of Liz's back.
Why would I do that?
Because I asked.
In the real world, Son, when somebody scratches my back, sooner or later, they're going to show up at my office with their shirt off.
Did you know that Rhode Island is the only state that calls a D.U.I. an O.U.I.?
Thank you.
Kind of funny, don't you think?
I mean, have you ever met a Frenchman that didn't say oui to another drink?
(ALL LAUGHING)
You should be on the faculty.
No.
Real world doesn't scare me.
No, sir.
Nothing scares my Beth, as long as she can deny it afterwards.
SANDY:
I've been begging Wallace to give up his practice and teach.
No way.
I need the action.
Boston, New York...
I'm sure there's plenty of action in the law school.
Matthew, would you like to enlighten us on that topic?
He's adorable.
How old is he?
Sam's eight.
Looks just like Matt, doesn't he?
Beth.
In the eyes.
SANDY:
Yes, I see it.
LIZ:
He's strong, too.
He's going to be a rugby player.
Tell them how...
How strong he is, honey.
I played rugby.
I knew it!
(LAUGHS)
You don't have to worry about our Sam.
That boy can take care of himself.
Would you like to meet him?
That's not a good idea.
He's...
He needs his sleep.
Do you think you'll have more?
MATT:
Yes.
No way.
Well, as you can see, we're discussing it.
Well, why would we want another one?
"May God be praised for woman
"that give up all her mind
"A man in no man may find
"a friendship of her kind."
Give an Irishman a whiskey, Yeats starts pouring out.
Why is that?
Well, I know I'm impressed.
He was a cad, that W.B.
Mmm-mmm.
Married to a babe, and he was running around with...
What's her name?
Carly!
Maude Gonne.
You see, his marriage was a complete farce.
Well, it happens to the best of us, doesn't it?
Yeah, whose fault is that, my dear?
Hey, do you know, just before you got here,
I asked Matthew to take me upstairs...
You see, Beth has had a little bit too much to drink, I think.
...and at least pretend to be a husband.
Haven't you, sweetheart?
Sandy, is it always this bleak?
I think we should go.
LIZ:
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
We're having fun!
SANDY:
We'll see ourselves out.
This was great.
It's great.
Let's do this again some time.
Good night.
I apologize.
Great.
Just great.
Good night.
(DOOR CLOSES)
That was priceless.
Great.
So you'll get a real job.
Thanks, Beth.
I happen to like teaching.
Of course you do.
It's nice and safe.
Shut up and give me a break.
At least I didn't give up, Dr. Freud.
Know what?
You're drunk and pathetic.
Why don't you go to bed?
Well, it was your girlfriend who kept filling my glass.
Well, kudos to you, sweetheart.
You've attained the state of martyrdom reserved for cuckolds.
No, wait.
I'm a cuckold.
Literally speaking, that is.
It's...
It is a gender thing.
You want to talk about infidelity?
Let's talk about Frank.
Yeah, that's right.
Frank Angstrom.
Oh, yeah?
Well, what about your little "I'm just working my way through law school"?
I mean, really, Matt.
How does it feel to be such a cliche?
Well, maybe if we had more than drunken, sloppy sex, once every five or six weeks...
Well, you know what?
What's the point?
I'm going to bed.
Oh, yeah.
That's right.
Just walk away.
It's what you do best.
Oh, and by the way, I was sober with Frank.
Oh, yeah?
Of course you were.
Yeah.
Because that makes it especially demeaning.
You know what the good thing is, Beth?
I don't really care anymore.
I don't.
Why don't you just say it?
What?
Why don't you just say it?
Just say what you have been dying to say to me for the past three years?
It's so typical.
You talk this great game about pink elephants being in the room, but when push comes to shove...
It's your fault!
He was with you!
It's your fault.
You were with him!
What were you doing?
What kind of a mother is too preoccupied with herself that she couldn't keep an eye on her own baby boy?
There.
Said it.
Happy now?
No more, Beth.
Because we're finished.

Will you stop wriggling?
Okay.
Stop wriggling.
You smell like coconut.
It's slimy and disgusting.
I love coconut.
Mom, stop tickling me.
Okay.
Go ahead.
Go play.

Be brave.
Go ahead.
I'm watching.

What happened?

She broke the law.

She won.
You lost.

What about him?
He was Canterbury's second chair in the Foster case.

PAUL VI THE POPE IN THE TEMPEST
We want all those who will undertake this Via Crucis in preparation for Easter to experience the deep feeling...
Rome, Via Fani, March 16th 1978
...which will entail enormous joy,
and to know that they are immensely... loved.
This is the mystery of the cross.
President Moro, come with us!
Come in.
Your Holiness...
Come in, Don Pasquale.
I was completing the meditation... for the Via Crucis.
What is it?
I have some bad news.
It seems that an attempt was made on President Moro's life.
Aldo?
My child...
They loaded him into a car and they escaped, leaving no traces.
- What about his guards?
- I don't know.
- Have you heard?
- Yes.
Cardinal Villot, you know what's happened to his guards?
Four men were killed and one injured.
It seems he's close to death too.
Can you hear this too?
What, Your Holiness?
The silence that has descended upon Rome.
This is the car with the bodies.
of the officers who were the Honourable Moro's bodyguards.
Their bodies are covered with sheets.
Two bodies are in the car.
another is inside the one that was following them.
Four men were killed and one was injured.
It seems the Honourable Moro has been kidnapped.
My colleague is telling me that he was injured too.
Eleonora...
Dearest Mrs Elenora Moro, we wish to express our deepest sympathies for the attack which took place and which took away your beloved spouse.
And which ended the lives... of five innocent young officers.
"In this hour of trepidation, we make a special prayer to the Lord
to reach the hearts of those responsible for this tragic attack so that they return your relative to his loving family.
As a pledge of paternal comfort, we offer to you and your children... the Pope's blessing.
Paul VI."
Thank our Holy Father.
His Holiness has been greatly moved by this tragic event.
I know.
He is like a father to Aldo.
- I have news, Your Holiness.
- Come in.
I'll come back this evening.
Make sure he gets plenty of rest.
I don't think he will get much rest during the next few days.
- Well?
- Aldo Moro is alive.
Thank Heavens.
Anything else?
The Red Brigades have claimed responsibility for the kidnapping.
What do they want?
An exchange of prisoners?
What then?
Don Pasquale, please, tell me.
They will be putting Moro on trial.
he may be sentenced to death.
The terrorists sent this photo along with their statement.
Aldo kidnapped... put on trial...
Why?
He's always been a fair man.
a free man.
Free men always create fear.
I learnt this many years ago in this same city.
You know why I've brought you here today?
Are the fascists to blame for the Tiber being so dirty too?
No.
I've brought you here because a man was kidnapped here today.
The Honourable Matteotti.
Because he had the courage to tell the truth.
And the fascists... imposed themselves with violence.
Matteotti is a good man.
He's a fair and free man, that's why he was kidnapped.
They've also taken our freedom.
Listen to this passage by this French philosopher.
He's called Jacques Maritain, I've mentioned him to you before.
"If one day a global political society will be founded..."
What are you doing here?
Good morning.
- We were reading.
- You can't stay here.
- Why?
- You're obstructing right of way.
I see.
- Is that the only reason?
- Of course, why else?
Maybe...
I'll go up here then, that way we're not obstructing anyone.
Well...
I was saying...
"If one day a global political society will be founded..."
Is this all right?
"it will only be thanks to freedom.
In fact, thanks to freedom, the people of the world will want to live alongside each other in harmony."
Things have become impossible here in Rome.
Working with my students has become impossible.
I think I'll go to Milan.
The Catholic University has made me a good offer.
- That's a shame.
- Why?
There's more freedom there.
Yes, I'm sure.
And in Milan you'll be closer to Brescia and home, right?
It's not because of that.
I just want to carry out my work with young people.
Of course.
Just today...
I've heard that you'll be offered a position at the Vatican.
at the Secretariat of State.
The Secretariat of State?
- I want to work with people
- That's what you'd be doing.
You'll work with lots of people, young and old from all over the world.
- I don't want your recommendations.
- You've never needed any.
The Curia already know of your work with the FUCI students.
They must be mistaken, I want to be a priest, not a diplomat.
You're right, they're mistaken.
They don't know what a rebel you are.
We need you here.
we need men who won't give in to fascism.
who have the freedom of their followers at heart.
We at the Italian Popular Party can do nothing in Parliament.
Italy has become a dictatorship.
That's why you must remain here in Rome, Battista.
In Rome, at the Secretary of State, alongside the Pope.
Goodbye, Your Eminence.
Tell Count Grossoli not to worry.
He trusts me and I know I can count on you, my dear Gaspari.
- Don Giovanni Battista Montini?
- Yes, Your Eminence.
This young man is from Brescia.
Cardinal Marchetti Selvaggiani.
- He will be my assistant here.
- I'm pleased for you.
Thank you.
You'll be better off reading documents here than French philosophy by the Tiber.
Follow me, Montini.
- How old are you?
- I'm 27, Your Eminence.
I'm almost three times your age.
Old age is a crown of dignity.
You needn't quote the Bible to console me.
I'm the luckiest one of us.
I've witnessed the Papal States.
I was 18 when the Piedmontese stripped the Pope... of what he'd owned for centuries.
They wanted to demote him as king into an ordinary citizen.
This will all be over soon.
You're here to help with a special task.
His Holiness Pius XI wants to negotiate in order to become sovereign of an independent state.
Negotiate with Mussolini?
With the Italian State.
The fact that Mussolini is leader of the government is irrelevant.
Can you read French?
Of course, I studied in Paris.
These are diplomatic treaties from the last century.
We must be sure there's no evidence that will hinder negotiations.
Read them and make a summary for His Holiness.
When will His Holiness need that?
Tomorrow.
Tell me...
Have you found any precedents that will hinder negotiations?
The lack of them won't suffice.
The Church has never been faced with such an Anti-Christian regime.
Montini, it's not your place to pass judgements.
Leave politics to your father.
Calm down.
Your Holiness, I was just saying that...
What news do you have?
Don't do it, Your Holiness.
What should the Pope not do?
Don't negotiate with Mussolini.
Think of the consequences.
An agreement would confer undeserved prestige for him.
What do you know what the consequences will be?
In order to predict the future one must have a position of power.
Do you think you're as powerful as the Pope?
- Forgive him, Your Holiness.
- You may go.
Montini!
You stay.
How's life in Brescia?
If I were there, I'd be happy.
I'm from Brianza so the Brescian dialect is as familiar to me as the Roman dialect.
I haven't spoken it for so long.
I sometimes use it with my father.
I know your father, he's a good man.
You see?
I know it's risky to negotiate with that devil Mussolini but the Church has been in conflict with Italy for sixty years.
A painful conflict for many people.
You know something?
For the good of people, I'd negotiate with the devil himself.
If ever you become Pope, you'll understand.
Rome, February 11th 1929
Can I have one?
A GREAT POLITICAL AND SPIRITUAL VICTORY FOR THE REGIME
- Father Giulio!
- You thought I was Father Christmas?
Why are you here in Rome?
I brought these.
Let me help you.
It's great to see you!
- Have you been waiting long?
- I don't know, I fell asleep.
It's the Blackshirts' fault.
I was ordered to leave Brescia by my superiors.
- Were they afraid they'd harm you?
- No, they thought I'd harm them!
And you, are you gaining respect in the holy offices?
I don't know.
Maybe.
What's wrong?
I've been your spiritual father for 20 years.
I don't know why I'm here.
I thought I'd be helping Catholics defend their freedom but I'm helping the Pope to negotiate with Mussolini.
He's referred to at the Vatican as the man of providence.
Of course he's the man of providence!
The providence will use him as a weapon to beat the Church!
Repeatedly, just like one does with an old mattress!
Who knows...
Maybe with this agreement the Providence will allow us to have greater freedom of action with our students.
That's why you have to stay here, the worst is yet to come.
Justice does not only concern the attitude of people but also the order of things.
"From the flowers to the stars", as Greek philosophers said.
But other Greek philosophers said that justice is a weapon of power.
They were wrong.
Plato proved that in "Gorgias" and in "The Republic".
- What's your name?
- Aldo Moro.
I invited him.
He's studying Law in Bari.
Well, I think he'll complete his studies before you.
Nobody move, you've been accused of anti-patriotic activities!
This is a Catholic club, how dare you!
Check everywhere.
Roberto!
Stop.
We have other things to do.
It's time to say Vespers.
Shut up, priest!
So Mussolini respects agreements by beating students and priests?
That's what fascism is:
truncheons used to beat these young people.
We teach religion, not politics and freedom.
But we need freedom for religion.
They talked about freedom in Russia too but priests were killed.
Gentlemen, please, listen...
I'm about to retire, don't ruin my last weeks here.
- Your Eminence, in this case...
- Take advantage of this moment.
Go back to your family in Brescia, take a rest.
You'll have plenty of work when the new Secretary of State arrives.
Your Eminence, how can I?
What about my students?
It's an order, Don Battista.
Your students will find their place in other organizations.
Battista!
- Mother, I've not been to war.
- Yes, but look at the state of you.
- You're all skin and bones....
- She's been cooking for days.
She couldn't wait to see you!
Tell me about your journey.
Your brother Ludovico is getting married next year.
I hope your brother Francesco will also meet a nice girl at the hospital.
- Leave it, thank you.
- Let's hope so.
What good news do you have?
I have news, but not good news.
And never as good as the scent of these fields.
Our countryside is splendid in June.
- That's true.
- The air is so clean...
The warm soil, the scent of ripe wheat, it's special.
You want to leave your post at the Secretary of State, don't you?
I don't think I ever had one.
Have you heard about Piero?
- No, why?
- His wife died during labour.
She left him with five children.
He won't talk to anyone anymore, he never goes out.
Piero!
Piero!
Why?
- Why?
- Piero...
Why?
Piero...
No!
Why?
Piero, Piero...
The Lord keeps all his promises.
Death isn't the last word.
I believe, I hope...
I love, in Your name, oh Lord.
And I ask myself once again why you called me... and why you chose me.
Look what I found.
- The alb I wore at my first mass?
- Yes.
I had it made from my wedding dress, remember?
I was so excited on that day!
Has that excitement gone now?
No, it hasn't.
It's just that...
I know I have to make a decision... but I can't.
I understand how you feel.
Your father passed onto you the testimony of his struggle.
but what matters to us most is knowing that you're happy.
I know, mother.
Therefore... if you have to make a choice, make it freely.
You don't have to prove anything to us.
Thank you.
Please look after this precious gift for me.
It must have been hard to use your wedding dress.
No, I thought it was a good idea.
I haven't studied as much as you, but I think priesthood is like marriage.
The barren times you endure... only help to prepare for fertile times.
Thank you for these wonderful days.
Show them what you're worth.
Thank you.
- Your superior has been replaced.
- Yes.
- Do you get on with the new one?
- I haven't met him yet.
He's from a noble family, his name's Eugenio Pacelli.
Cardinal Pacelli wants to see you one at a time.
- In what order?
- Alphabetical.
- Amide.
- Follow me.
Well, I'll be brief.
I hope you will be too.
If you were in my position and one day the Russians arrived in Rome... what would you do?
I'd ask France to help us defend ourselves... like they did in 1849 with the Roman Republic.
I'd negotiate with the Russians.
I speak a bit of Russian.
I would take up arms to defend the Pope.
I'd take up the sword.
I'd say mass as usual.
What did you say your name was?
Don Giovanni Battista Montini.
Welcome back, Don Battista!
Have some of this!
Instead of the usual books on philosophy, you should bring some of this cheese to our meetings!
No, it's Father Giulio's.
He'll decide who deserves it.
- Father Giulio...
- Right!
I fought in the war to earn it, I won't give it to him!
- Don Battista.
- Yes, Aldo.
I wanted to give you a copy of my thesis.
I'll look forward to reading this.
What did I say?
I know, but I've got a good reason.
What would that be?
Her.
She's a beautiful reason, I can't argue with that.
- We're engaged.
- I'm Maria.
Pleased to meet you.
You'll need the patience of a saint to put up with him!
- Let's make a toast.
- Yes, a toast!
To our future!
They can close our university halls.
forbid us from reading boring philosophy books on the Tiber.
they can beat Don Battista...
- ...and Father Giulio...
- I don't think so.
...but they can't stop us from having faith or from loving our country.
Like Don Battista taught us to do.
Here's to the future!
Wake up!
- Hooray for the happy couple!
- Congratulations!
This is a joyous wedding even during a dictatorship.
The fascist dictatorship will crumble too, just like a sand castle.
I think so too, La Pira.
It will, but will the Italians be able to cope?
Aldo, I believe that with a good constitution, it can be avoided.
Fanfani, that's not enough.
We need good parties, good politicians.
You're good politicians.
Come on!
You could look after the interests of our nation and make us proud to be Italian.
If you continue being good men like you've been until now.
Aldo, what do you think?
I'd prefer to remain at the university.
You're sure?
The Pope is dead.
This is a moment of tough decisions for everyone.
I know just the place in Rome where you can think properly.
Look.
You can see all of Rome.
- Come closer.
- I'm scared of heights.
I'd rather stay here, I can see how beautiful it is.
You know...
When I was your age...
I too preferred a university hall to the Vatican.
- What made you change?
- My father's example.
He always kept his position, not because he preferred it but because God needed him there.
I...
Politics and power...
I'm not ready.
I've just been elected president of FUCI.
Italy needs men like you.
Look around, you're here!
- There are more suitable men than me.
- Yes, but you're here now.
Come on!
- I'm scared, Don Battista.
That's what friends are for.
Come on.
Come forward, Aldo!
I won't abandon you.
There.
You're right, you can see all of Rome from here.
If you look carefully, you'll see the whole of Italy.
and the world!
Don Battista, look!
White smoke.
We have a new Pope.
Rome, March 2nd 1939
Thank you, Your Eminence.
Your Holiness...
- What a nice surprise.
- We're surprised, Montini.
We need you now more than ever.
I prayed to God for someone else to be chosen but he chose us.
Now that Europe is about to fall into the abyss.
The arms have not been heard, maybe we still have time.
Your Holiness...
The sound of cannons has been heard.
The Germans have invaded Czechoslovakia.
We have to make their names public.
Everyone must know who is sending Europe into the abyss.
It's very gratifying to be the accusers.
but is it for the best?
It's the fairest option.
The same was said about the encyclical against Nazism in '37.
and then our German followers paid a very high price.
The Nazi's reaction against the Catholics proved that the encyclical was true and needed to be written.
But Hitler remains in his position.
Don't take sides, Your Holiness.
Propose a peace conference, so that we can avoid a war.
But the war is imminent.
The Germans have already invaded Czechoslovakia.
Europe is in turmoil.
You must take a stance, Your Holiness.
People have to know that empires that are not founded on justice... do not have God's blessing and that the politics of emancipation betrays those who support it.
As long as peace reigns, nothing is lost but everything could be lost with a war.
His Eminence Marchetti Selvaggiani is right.
- The Pope cannot take a stance.
- Your Holiness, I...
You think we don't wish to show our disapproval?
We'd save our reputation in the eyes of the world, but we need to save lives not our reputation.
Don Battista, you don't know... that it's easy to advise the Pope, when one isn't the Pope.
You may go, I want to remain alone to write my message.
Rome, August 24th 1939
- Don Battista?
- Yes, Your Holiness.
One day, you will understand my prudence.
Now tell me if my words are convincing.
We can begin.
"Today,... the tension of spirits has reached such a height... to make the terrible unfolding of a war very probable.
We are making a fresh and more heartfelt appeal to those in government and to the people.
Empires which are not founded on justice do not have God's blessing.
The politics of emancipation betrays those who support it."
This speech makes me think of Don Battista.
"There's still time.
As peace reigns, nothing is lost but everything could be lost with war."
Now let us go to say mass, as you said to when we met at the Secretary of State.
Rome, July 1943
- Castel Gandolfo?
- There are thousands of refugees.
We'll put them in our convents.
- What about our rules?
- I'll get a dispensation.
And I had another idea.
Tell the editor of Radio Vaticana to make a daily broadcast... with the names of the missing people and where they can be found.
- Did you get that?
- Yes.
How's the film going?
De Sica's been occupying St Paul's for months with his set.
It's going on forever!
I know, I told him to make it a lengthy affair.
Many of his actors and technicians are Jews wanted by the regime.
If they're there, working on the film, they'll be safe.
You may go!
The report we needed has arrived.
It looks like the district of San Lorenzo.
And they're Americans.
Take me there.
- Pardon, Your Holiness?
- I want to go to San Lorenzo.
It's dangerous!
The Pope hasn't left the Vatican for 100 years.
We can't ignore the suffering of innocent people, let us share it.
Have my car made ready.
I'm sorry, it's no go.
The Pope's car won't start.
It hasn't been used for so long...
- Do you have a car?
- Yes, but it's not fit for a Pope.
Don't worry, go and get it.
Right away!
They've bombed Rome too.
How can this happen?
Do not despair, Your Holiness.
Mon.
Tardini's dealing with it.
With God's help, he'll convince the allies to stop bombing us.
Rome, June 5th 1944
Why are they cheering the Pope?
I didn't set Rome free.
No... but if you don't mind me saying the king and Badoglio made a run for it, whereas you stayed here with them.
Look.
The people need to celebrate with you.
PEACE REIGNS IN THE WORLD
JUNE 2ND:
INSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM
The war is not over.
I saw believers deported in Russia and churches turned into stables.
If the communists won the elections, instead of incense at St Peter's... there'd be the scent of dung.
We have to support the royalists, the Christian-socialists...
Montini, what do you think?
I think that Cardinal Tisserant is right but I think that Cardinal Selvaggiani is underestimating... the electoral situation in Italy.
We mustn't waste the Catholics' votes but make them for one party alone.
Which?
Your Christian Democrat party is a party of schoolmasters
I know them all.
They have faith, they are able.
- They're free.
- When they no longer need us who'll guarantee they'll still be Democrats and Christians?
The Church has alwas wanted people to trust it.
It's time it puts trust in them.
The Holy See will support your party.
- Congratulations!
- We did it!
Let's have a photo!
Congratulations!
But they're still fascists!
An alliance with the Social Movement is the only way... to avoid that Rome has a communist mayor.
- Does the Holy Father approve?
- Of course.
- I need to speak to him.
- He's unavailable.
He asked me to ask you, as substitute to the Secretary, to inform the leaders of the CD of his proposal.
All right.
President, we cannot accept.
We won the elections in '46 and in '48.
If we're allies with the ex-fascists, we'll destroy the government.
But if we're not, we'll lose the backing of the Holy See.
And you, Don Battista... what do you think?
You're the party secretary, Honourable De Gasperi.
You need to decide according to your conscience.
I'll do that.
But we'll both pay the price for my decision.
How can De Gaspari ignore indications from the Pope?
For decisions that don't concern faith or moral issues, the President decides according to his conscience and to the voters.
That's democracy.
So thanks to democracy, we'll end up in the hands of Stalin!
We need to have faith in our followers.
- Let them have freedom!
- Freedom?
Freedom...
Freedom is a great gift, but also a great burden.
Are you sure your followers can endure it?
You may go.
Monsignor Montini is an idealist.
I wonder if in the long run... his attitude will cause problems for us.
Your Eminence.
- Did you want to see me?
- Yes, I have good news for you.
His Holiness wants to make you archbishop.
You'll be in charge of the diocese in Milan.
A promotion to get rid of you.
I'll be in charge of the diocese in Milan.
It's the biggest one in the world.
Maybe it's not a punishment.
Remember De Gasperi's prediction?
This is the price you'll pay for not having obeyed the Pope.
The Christian Democrats have won without becoming fascist allies.
Your stance should have been sanctioned.
Years ago, you wanted to go to Milan, they've granted your wish.
This is the irony of life.
- Or of Divine Providence.
- Right, Divine Providence.
Whatever their reasons for sending you to Milan are, you'll be better off out of Rome.
You need to get your hands dirty!
You need to work with people, not documents.
Are you a priest or not?
You're right, Father Giulio.
Now kneel down and confess yourself properly...
We won't be seeing each other for some time.
Milan, January 6th 1955
Can we open the roof of the car?
Your Excellency, it's raining!
When it rains on the flock, it rains on the shepherd too.
Long live the archbishop!
Hooray for the archbishop!
- Welcome.
- Don Pasquale, right?
Don Pasquale Macchi, at your disposal.
No, I'm here at your disposal.
It's a shame it's raining, less people came to welcome you.
You blame the rain, do you?
92% of the children are baptized, receive communion and confirmation.
More than 40% of young people belong to Catholic associations... and Sunday mass is attended by 60% of citizens.
Well, that's a reassuring result.
Yes, but it's false.
These figures are misleading.
The truth is that the Church is losing its followers.
You're too pessimistic, Don Leone.
No, I'm realistic.
According to the symptoms in my parish.
So it's a problem to do with your parish, not the whole diocese.
- I wish that were true.
- He's right.
What he's saying doesn't only concern the diocese in Milan but the whole of Europe.
- You're Don Primo Mazzolari?
- Have you been warned about me?
Yes, but they didn't scare me enough.
Your Excellency, if you could see what we're talking about, you would be scared.
Well, I think I have no other option... but to visit your parish.
A pastoral visit?
We could organize it during the confirmations, in four months.
I didn't mean an official visit... just an informal one.
How about this afternoon?
These are my parishioners.
They're working class families.
from the South and Sicily.
Good evening, Father.
I've brought some friends.
I ask myself... how can a city which allows this call itself a Christian one?
Is a Christian someone who goes to church every Sunday, but who only loves his wealth?
These people would rather have faith in Stalin... than in God.
A village where the shanty town is?
Houses, shops, parks, a church...
- How will we pay for that?
- I'll sell some of my inheritance.
- How?
- I know, it's not much.
But it's a start.
I'd like to meet some of them, but not in church.
In the factory, where they spend most of their time.
- An archbishop in the factor?
- Yes, let me see.
I could attend the dedication to Saint Clare on behalf of Magneti Marelli from Sesto San Giovanni.
Sesto San Giovanni?
That's Italy's Stalingrad!
Wait till you hear what I have in mind for Christmas Mass.
This is the last stage.
Now the batteries are ready to be installed into the cars.
This line produces 12,000.
- 12,000 per year.
- No, per day!
Per day...
- The microphone is up there.
- Good, well...
- My stole?
- It's here.
This way, Your Excellency.
- Could I borrow your hat?
- Of course.
Thank you.
- How does it look?
- Fine, Your Excellency.
Brothers...
I cannot tell you how to work, you know that better than me.
I could perhaps tell you how to pray...
You see...
A misunderstanding has been created concerning work and religion.
concerning you and us...
A misunderstanding... that needs to be resolved.
Let's start resolving it, do you agree?
Hooray for the workers' archbishop!
- It's the archbishop!
- Hooray!
Not bad for your first time at the factory.
And my second time will be even better.
There'll be a second visit?
The subway construction site is one of Italy's biggest.
I'll arrange a visit as soon as possible.
Is everything ready for Christmas mass?
On this special night,
I invite you to make a special gesture.
Shake hands with each other, as a sign of peace.
The peace which is needed in Milan and which is needed... all over the world.
Milan, January 6th 1957
Thank God no one was injured.
What did the police say?
They're convinced it was a right-wing activist.
- They're convinced?
- That's their theory.
I see, but on what basis?
They think it was a message... to the workers' archbishop.
Milan is infected, the bomb's just a symptom.
- It may have been a senseless act!
- No.
A disease is spreading through our city.
We have to stop it before it's too late.
Your Excellency, what are you thinking about?
A mission for Milan?
Milan's no place for missions.
- We're not in Africa!
- Yes, I know.
Milan isn't Africa.
but...
I can see signs of drought.
In terms of the people, not only religion.
We have to do something.
Or soon our diocese will be as arid as a desert and with it, the Church.
Milan is just a reflection... of a problem that affects the whole world.
What do you mean by "mission"?
We'll go back onto the streets, we'll get everyone involved.
Priests, seminarists, laymen...
Our only objective will be to announce the Gospel and God's paternity as if they have never been announced.
Because our civilization must become a civilization of love or it will perish.
Rome, 16th October 1958
Before an imposing crowd, people from all over the world have come to Rome to mourn Pope Pius XII.
The Supreme Pontiff's coffin enters Saint Peter's church.
Pius XII makes his last journey through his beloved Rome.
You miss him already, don't you?
Yes.
Who can succeed a Pope like him?
You, according to international press.
Journalists!
Someone should inform them that I'm not even a cardinal.
We all know that's not a necessary requirement to become Pope.
You needn't worry, the Holy Spirit will decide.
Cardinal Roncalli, how nice to see you!
Montini!
You should be grateful to Pope Pacelli.
He sent you to Milan so you could see things for what they are.
It's thanks to him if you've been nominated as the next pope.
And the next pope will make you a cardinal.
We've never had a bishop to lunch.
Maria, don't start.
You and Roberto are my friends, I'm still Don Battista.
Matteo, it's thanks to him that I became senator.
He doesn't seem that impressed.
He's just a bit shy, but he's a good student.
Tell him what mark you got for your composition.
Be patient.
Your father's proud of you because he wrote terrible compositions.
I know, when he makes his speeches, everyone falls asleep.
Listen to him!
You send them to school and this is the result!
We're interrupting this programme.
We've just received news from the Vatican.
White smoke has risen from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel.
- A new Pope!
- Praise the Lord!
Rome, 18th December 1958
I told you the new pope would make you cardinal!
Thank you, Your Holiness.
Don't thank me, many people wanted you to be the new pope.
Your Eminence...
Your Eminence...
- Sorry.
- Didn't you hear me?
I haven't got used to my new title yet.
It's not just a title, it's a big responsibility.
I'm aware of that.
From now on, you'll have to avoid making hasty decisions.
What are you referring to?
Like inviting Don Primo Mazzolari to preach at the mission.
That was a hasty decision.
Don Primo will be summoned to the Holy Office for that.
Be more careful.
Don Primo, he seems more interested in social demands... than in the mission.
He's like a prophet, censoring him would mean censoring... all of his many followers.
What should I do, Your Holiness?
When you're in Milan, speak to him and be firm.
Inform him of his errors.
It won't be easy to be firm with Don Primo.
You'll have to be.
When you're the pope, you'll need to be firm.
Ask him to come here and tell him... that I have a surprise for him and for all the Church.
Milan, Archbishop's Palace
Did you want to see me, Your Eminence?
I wanted to tell you that I'm very worried.
I'm worried about your position.
Because there's more criticism than admiration for the Church, more talk of revolutions than conversions.
I can see that you want to change the world rather than be its humble servant.
I always thought you were on my side, Your Eminence.
Don Primo...
Don Primo... you're a very progressive priest.
Be patient with us, we're struggling to keep up with you.
Or you'll suffer and so will we.
The Holy Father told me to tell you that he wishes to meet you.
The Holy Father?
Me?
Don Primo Mazzolari is here.
The pope will inform him that the Holy Office will investigate him.
Don Primo!
- Your Holiness!
- No, stand up!
Here's the voice of the Holy Spirit from the Po Valley!
I would like to inform you too of my plan... for a new ecumenical council.
- A council, Your Holiness?
- Exactly.
We'll invite all bishops to Rome so we can hear their opinions... along with the extreme opinions of Don Primo.
Do you not think it is risky to convene a council now...
- with all the problems we have?
- That's why we need everyone's advice.
But making hundreds of bishops discuss before the world... will make the Church look weak and divided.
Quite the opposite, it'll appear sincere and open.
Rome, 13th October 1962
Venerable fathers, to help you choose the members of the committees, you have a list of bishops who have carried out the preparatory work.
They'll have us choose who they want.
They've already decided!
Excuse me!
Maybe it would be a good idea to ask us our opinion.
We do not need your advice, Cardinal Tisserant.
we want the chance to speak.
We are not here to ratify decisions that have been taken.
we have come to meet each other, talk and make decisions.
but together!
These preordained lists do not respect the status of the church collegiate!
The election is annulled.
Your Excellencies!
Cardinal Suenes' request cannot be fulfilled.
we cannot waste time.
Your Excellencies, please!
Excuse me.
I propose a compromise.
May the lists be distributed but give us three days at least to get to know each other before the work starts.
All right, I accept Cardinal Montini's proposal.
The meeting is over.
Your Eminence!
Please to meet you, I'm Karol Wojtyla.
Auxiliary bishop in Krakow, Poland.
Poland...
I remember when I was younger.
I spent five months at your nunciature.
You're still remembered in Warsaw.
What's the situation in Poland?
The communist repression is widespread.
That is why I need to ask you for some advice... as you've experienced both fascism and Nazism.
Years ago, I'd have told you to take a firm stance.
No discussions, no compromises... just hard-line opposition.
But... over time I've realised... that one needs to use the strategy of patience.
A silent opposition... and one must not fear discussion, ever.
Milan, June 3rd 1963
I've made up my mind, Your Eminence.
Being a priest is not enough for me.
I want to be a worker and live like one.
In their factories, in their homes...
I want to be among them.
Don Leone...
You've taught me a great deal, but you're wrong now.
We do not need priests becoming workers, but proper priests, who preach about Jesus and who understand people.
You're saying that to justify the Church's lack of interest.
I just want to extend the mission to Milan, your mission.
But you're missing the point, that's not the objective here!
Your Eminence!
Pope John is...
My God!
- Did you take my passport?
- Yes, just in case.
Don Pasquale, we're going to Rome.
After the conclave we're leaving for Ireland as planned.
I knew I'd find you here.
Aldo!
It's the best place in Rome to come to think.
How good to see you!
And who needs to think more than the future pope?
No, luckily it's the Holy Spirit who will decide.
That's why you'll be chosen.
Aldo, I'm not the right man.
- There are better candidates.
- Perhaps... but you're here now.
By the way, there's something I want to show you.
Remember what you said to me?
"Do not be scared.
We won't abandon you."
The conclave began today at 17:00.
All the doors have been closed.
There will be two votes.
The crowds in St Peter's Square await the white smoke.
Various candidates have been mentioned...
I'd like it to be Lercaro or Confalonieri.
Montini or Lercaro.
- Which one?
- Montini.
- Maybe he really will be pope!
- And Aldo the Prime Minister.
- Hi, Matteo.
- Hi.
What's up?
- Look at your father's friends.
- I got a D for Latin.
How come?
Another low mark?
Latin is essential if you want to study law.
- I don't want to study law.
- Why?
- You could be a magistrate.
- Forget it.
It's impossible to talk to him.
Instead of telling him what you think, try asking him what he'd like to do.
Your Eminence...
We're sorry to bother you, but we need to talk to you.
Have a seat.
No, thank you.
We've been sitting down long enough.
We believe we know... which person has won the votes of the cardinals.
It's a special person.
who's cultured, authoritative and who understands tradition.
But also capable of understanding the right direction for the world.
An experienced pastor, capable of speaking to everyone.
We're talking... about the archbishop of Milan.
The Council is a great opportunity.
but the problems in question are serious and tensions between the Council members are increasing.
You know... that unless the Council is guided by a knowledgeable leader
it could be the end for the Church.
It's an enormous responsibility.
There are times when one listens to God and preaches to men.
There are others... when one must bear one's cross and follow him.
If He calls me,
I will answer.
Rome, June 21st 1963
The sleeves are a bit short.
This one will do for now, we'll make another... made-to-measure.
- Your Holiness.
- Thank you.
You won't expect me to call you "Your Holiness"!
Father Giulio!
I'm the only one who knows your sins.
- How did you get in?
- The conclave is over.
Good heavens, I've become the Pope's confessor!
You see what they've done to me?
These things happen to cardinals!
I really need your help now.
I have a plan.
- That's not a sin.
- Maybe it is.
I can picture it so clearly that I feel I'm lacking humility.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Great thoughts need to be developed.
I want to tell the world about the only truth that can save it.
that is stronger than any army or theology.
I want the Church to contribute to the birth of a new civilization.
founded on Jesus' most important teaching.
A civilization of love.
Follow your aspiration.
It comes from God, not from presumptuousness.
I think this idea could breathe new life into the Council and reunite the different souls of the Church, but...
I can't do it alone.
God put you in this mess and you have every right to expect Him to help you.
How can I avoid being crushed?
Continue saying your mass, every day.
Now rise.
Give me your blessing.
Look, he's wearing the emperor's crown!
They're stuck in the Middle Ages!
We'll auction it off.
Your Holiness, forgive me...
- You'll auction it?
- Yes.
It's the most honest way of increasing its value... to give the profit to the poor.
Well said, an extraordinary gesture, a great message for the world.
You have my admiration too, I have to say... but may I suggest an alternative?
Donate its value to the poor but do not renounce... a symbol of tradition.
As archbishop of Milan,
I have to follow the traditions of St Ambrose and St Lawrence.
The poor are the real treasure of the Church.
What is ours, is theirs.
The papal tiara represents the power Christ himself gave to Peter.
To sell it would scandalize simple folk.
No, quite the opposite.
I ask myself:
what did the world see today?
A man... on a Roman palanquin... being fanned like a pharaoh.
Noble guards, military corps...
Extremely eminent cardinals...
In your opinion, is this ostentatious glorification true to the Gospel of Christ or not?
Renouncing the tiara is an important message for the world.
I'm not renouncing it, nor what it represents,
I just want it to go to those who are less fortunate.
I'd do it even if the world didn't understand.
You see to it.
Rome, March 18th 1978
- Your Holiness.
- Come in, Don Pasquale.
This is a statement for the press about Moro's kidnapping.
You also think I should avoid getting involved?
No.
I've shared too many things with Moro, many hopes.
In his moment of need, he has to know... that his friend, the Pope, is with him.
Knowing you, I should've known.
In a statement from the Holy See, the Pope declares he is ready to intervene to find a solution to the tragic Moro case.
The pope has decided to intervene in person.
Today the party said there would be no negotiations with the kidnappers.
- What's the Pope got to do with it?
- He must not intervene.
Guess who has to inform him.
You?
You have to persuade the Pope to do nothing to save Aldo?
- Have you thought about his family?
- Of course.
I want to do my best to help him, I miss him too.
But we must have respect for the victims of Via Fani.
- By causing another death?
- It's the only possible position... in a democratic State.
Since when?
Since when has the State mattered more than a man's life to a Catholic?
Parliament is putting pressure on the government to act.
but the democratic institutions do not intend to be overthrown.
I'm here about Aldo, Your Holiness.
I cannot tell you what to do, but the government and the Christian Democrat party would be in trouble if the Holy See... were to act in contrast with the line of not negotiating with the terrorists.
- You're referring to my statement?
- Yes.
It caused controversy in the world of politics
If we cannot use official means, we'll find alternative ones.
Of course, no one can stop the Pope from being the Pope.
We'll use all possible means, we'll involve all organizations that gravitate around the Church.
Perhaps we could offer ransom money.
I doubt they'd accept money when they want political acknowledgment.
We'd better go back inside.
Let's try making contact through the prison chaplains.
I'll call Monsignor Curioni.
We need to act quickly, we really must.
Before this trial ends... and he is sentenced.
Your Holiness.
The Honourable Moro's trial is over.
He's been sentenced to death.
That can't be true!
But not everything is lost.
They proposed an exchange:
Moro's life in exchange for 13 political detainees.
We've got 48 hours.
- Maybe this will change things.
- The government won't accept.
The state would never release Red Brigade members.
Hello?
Yes, good morning.
You can tell me, I'm Villot.
All right.
I'll tell His Holiness.
Unfortunately Monsignor Curioni's treaty has fallen through.
The intermediary was just a braggart.
What can we do before this ultimatum expires?
Rome, April 20th 1978
- Are you Don Pennini?
- Yes.
I have a letter for Mrs Moro.
This is addressed to the Holy Father.
Good morning.
"I'm writing to you to ask you to contact the relevant Italian government authorities in order to find a solution for the release of the prisoners... and my safe return to my family.
With profound gratitude, hope and my deepest respect,
Aldo Moro."
Moro is asking me to convince the government to accept the exchange.
What are you going to do?
These words deeply upset me, Cardinal Poletti.
It's a real cry for help.
I cannot ignore it.
I'll write to the President asking him to intervene.
Maybe we should hear the Prime Minister's opinion first.
The credibility of the Holy See is at stake.
All right.
I wonder if we're really doing all we can for Aldo.
You mustn't doubt yourself.
But time's passing.
There's no alternative.
The parties and the government will not change their position.
What must I do?
What does God want me to do?
Everyone's telling me to be cautious... and to not jeopardize the credibility of the Holy See.
Like when I decided to keep the Council open.
Rome, July 1963
Your Holiness, Cardinal Tisserant is here.
Good morning, Cardinal.
You wanted to see me.
Yes.
I wanted to discuss the controversial matter of the Council.
Your Holiness.
Why controversial?
I don't mean the Council, but the location of it.
What do you think I should do?
I would close it.
Your Eminence...
I've spent many years in these rooms... telling popes what I'd have done had I been them.
And they always told me that it is easier to know what the Pope should do than to be the Pope.
You know something?
They were right!
I fully understand your worries.
Getting thousands of bishops to agree is risky.
It'd be easier if we decided everything ourselves, but I think a mutual decision is best in the long run... and will reap more fruits.
Let us pray that these fruits won't be withered by a sudden autumn chill.
Don't worry, look outside.
It's spring!
Invited by Paul VI to resume the Council the bishops and delegates from all over the world gather in Rome with renewed enthusiasm.
Deciding to resume the Council was a brave decision.
A Don Battista-style decision.
I've always said I don't fear freedom.
I couldn't disappoint you by silencing the bishops.
- Uncle, where am I?
- Who's this?
I heard a voice, but can't see anyone.
Where are you?
Who are you?
Here's the little rascal.
Matteo, come here?
Do you remember this young lad?
Young lad?
- He's a man now.
- Not yet.
But he'll become a fine magistrate.
I'll study philosophy, not Law.
Going against one's father's wishes is a trend now.
He won't listen to what I say.
Maybe he just needs to find his way.
I'd appreciate it if you could have a word with him.
Of course, but only if Matteo agrees.
Your Holiness, could I speak to you for a minute?
- There's something I want to say.
- Of course, Aldo.
I've been asked to form a new government.
I know, you've been waiting for this moment all your life.
- You'll be good for this country.
- But it'll involve brave decisions.
Meaning?
It'll include socialists.
- As external aids?
- No, as members.
They'll be members of the government.
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.
- It's the Pope's eye.
- It's one of the Council rooms.
Yes.
I thought that if I were sitting there during the meetings, many of them would feel intimidated.
But I want the bishops to say what they really think... if we're to meet the needs of people today.
Aldo, what I'm trying to say... is that you don't need my permission for your government.
You and your colleagues have to run the risk of losing your freedom.
Just as I'm taking a risk by hearing all the council members' opinions.
Abandoning the tridentine ritual and Latin would be a serious offence to our faith.
The fathers of this venerable Council mustn't change the tradition we have inherited.
The world is hungry, in the literal sense of the word.
And you want to preach the Gospel with the ancient Roman's language?
I was a missionary in Africa for more than 30 years.
Africa, Monsignor Lefebvre?
The Africa of the European colonies?
Spend 30 days in Latin America and you'll see for yourself.
Monsignor Corral, I won't allow this.
They're conciliar bishops but they're not very conciliating.
We'll all end up losing our faith.
What did I say?
Venerable fathers.
I'm afraid that this Council, has got off to a bad start.
This is what I feared would happen.
By questioning everything, we'll risk dividing the Church.
Your Holiness, if we oppose all revisions, we cannot complain if the Church is divided.
Well said.
He's right.
I pray to you, Lord.
Do not remain silent, my God.
If you do not speak,
I am like those who descend into the pit.
The Lord is the strength of his people.
A safe refuge for his consecrated people.
Save your people and bless your inheritance.
Guide them and help them always.
Venerable fathers.
Venerable fathers.
Venerable fathers.
Jesus said:
"I am the vine and you are the shoots."
We cannot produce anything unless we remain embodied in Him.
Let us remember who we are and where we come from.
We cannot talk about the Church or discuss it... without remembering who entrusted it to us.
For this reason... we invite you all to pray.
Let us unite with Christ once again
So that his brilliant light on the face of the Church... can illuminate all man by preaching the Gospel to everyone.
By being united with Him, we'll find the strength to be united amongst ourselves.
Only by doing this.
I have decided to go to Jerusalem, to the Holy Land.
Where Christ was born.
Where the Church was born.
Your Holiness, it's the first time that a pope has taken a plane, organized a press conference and visited the Holy Land since the days of Peter.
What else will you do?
You see... in our hearts we believe that it's time for many new ventures.
Thank you.
So you will be a "Travelling Pope".
No.
My successors will travel a lot too.
Excuse me, Your Holiness.
Do you not think that the money spent on this trip could be used in a better way?
For the poor, for example.
We are going to a tortured country... to bring a message of peace.
You know how many lives are lost because of wars?
Thank you.
Why did you choose the Holy Land as your first destination?
Because the Holy Land is where everything began.
The Church can only be authentic in its mission, by following Christ's footsteps.
Thank you.
That's all for now, Your Holiness.
All right.
Have a good flight then.
Thank you.
Jerusalem, January 1964
Your Holiness!
- Your Holiness.
- Long live the Pope.
Let me through.
Let me through.
Sorry.
Go away.
- I'm the Pope's secretary!
- And I'm Queen Elizabeth's.
I really am the Pope's secretary.
Let me through!
Please.
You have been resurrected.
You are not here.
You have been resurrected.
- Maria.
- Here I am.
Hi, darling.
There are some incredible photos of Don Battista in the Holy Land.
Where's Matteo?
He's in his room.
Something bad's happened.
He's been suspended from school.
He was caught smoking and instead of apologizing, he told his teacher to get lost.
- Does he smoke?
- So it seems.
What's this about you smoking and being rude to your teachers?
You want to jeopardize your studies?
Get rid of that.
Answer me.
- What?
- Why were you rude?
- I don't know.
- Don't you?
- It just happened.
- You've even been suspended!
- Is the inquisition over?
- You're a good-for-nothing.
- This is an excuse to stop studying.
- Studying what?
That school is useless, only you don't think that.
Who's been telling you this nonsense?
They make us study what they want.
They just teach us about World War I.
Not about fascism or the Resistance.
And we have to study Manzoni.
Who gives a damn about that and about what you think?
I will not be spoken to like that.
Right, you pontificate, as you always do.
Carry on!
Where are you going?
You always end up fighting.
- Talk to him, he pontificates...
- And get a hair cut!
I'm embarrassed to see you going around like that.
The papers speak well of your visit to the Holy Land.
Were you at the Holy Sepulchre yesterday?
No, I had a problem with the forces of order.
Christians cannot be united not even where Christ died and was resurrected.
Everything is divided, rituals, liturgies...
You know what they told me?
To avoid offending anyone, a Muslim family has the keys.
On a ledge above the entrance, there's a wooden ladder.
They told me a workman left it there after carrying out some repairs.
Since Catholics and the Orthodox Church can't agree on whose right it is to repair the facade, no one can remove it.
It'll just be a matter of time, they'll agree.
You know how long that ladder has been there?
16 years.
The workman left it there when he escaped the bombs during the Arab-Israeli war.
The Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church have been divided for 910 years.
No, Don Pasquale, time won't resolve matters.
For this reason, unless we do something now that ladder will still be there in 16 years' time and the Catholic and Orthodox Churches will still be divided.
Here they are.
What will you say... to the patriarch Atenagora?
Nothing.
Words have only divided us for a thousand years.
Brother.
Yes, brother.
May the Lord help our Churches become united.
Jesus will be happy with us.
We're witnessing a historical moment.
Pope Paul VI and Atenagora, the Orthodox Patriarch greeted each other affectionately.
The Churches have been divided for ten centuries.
Pope Montini surprises us again with unexpected prophetic gestures.
Pope Paul.
My father is very sick.
Wait.
I beg you.
Leave him.
- Let him speak.
- My father is very sick.
I beg you.
He's paralyzed and in great pain.
He wants to meet you, but we're poor.
We can't afford to travel.
I promised him I'd come and tell you.
Where do you live?
Your Holiness, we must go to the airport.
The plane won't leave without the Pope.
Come on, let's go.
We're Christian Arabs.
We've suffered a lot because of our faith.
Especially my father.
And now, after so many sacrifices... here he is.
Today is the most wonderful day of my life.
Praise the Lord Jesus.
Jesus would have healed you... because of your great faith.
You have given me a great gift.
You have made me feel proud to be a human being.
Welcome to my home.
And you've taught me how much work the Pope still has to do.
You are Peter.
Rome, January 6th 1964
The city's been transformed.
They really love you.
I just tried to remind everyone that God exists.
That He created the world and that he loves everyone.
Everyone!
When you have that twinkle in your eye, trouble lies ahead.
No, it's just that there's still so much to do.
Just tell me where you want to begin.
We'll start by nominating some new cardinals.
They're making you a cardinal, father.
Congratulations, let me kiss you.
It's great news!
- Who told you?
- My nephew who can read.
It was in the papers.
Let me introduce him to you.
- I'd love to...
- But...
- I'd love to work in Rome.
- Stand up.
You've been misinformed.
I've not heard anything yet...
Your Eminence, it's the Pope on the telephone for you.
If you call me "Your Eminence" again,
I'll ask the Pope to send you on a mission with cannibals.
- Hello?
- Father Bevilacqua, are you happy?
I've dreamed of this all my life.
- I feel like Padre Pio.
- I had to reward you in some way.
You have done so much for me... and for the Church.
All right, I'll agree to become a cardinal.
But only if you'll let me come back to my parish here and work in peace.
You'll be the first cardinal of the Holy Roman Church to carry on working as a parish priest.
At least, I'll be able to embrace you in Rome.
We'll give you a great welcome.
Would you like a band to greet you at the station?
Why not?
You've plenty of windbags to blow into the instruments!
Goodbye.
It was extraordinary seeing so many Romans greet you upon your return.
Your invitation to reflect on God was beneficial to us all at the Council.
I'm glad.
Talking of the Council, we're mostly in agreement about the issues in question.
Except for a few bishops.
Really?
Who would they be?
Lefebvre, Corral and a few others.
But they're a minority.
I'll listen to their objections.
I hope God helps us to unite whether we're a majority or not.
Well, I have to admit that resuming the Council was a risk worth taking.
Good.
- I'll leave feeling content.
- Where are you going?
I've decided to take part in the Eucharistic Congress.
- It's being held in India.
- Great.
I've never been to India, India has never seen a Pope...
Well, keep me posted on matters.
Cardinal Tisserant, what's worrying you?
You see, the Council will issue four constitutions, three declarations, nine decrees.
Every aspect of the Church will be renewed.
The Gospel is forever young, but we have to keep renewing ourselves, in order to understand the people of today.
We need to know and understand the world.
Its expectations and aspirations.
The Church cannot ignore them.
That's why this Council is so important.
Yes.
But... it will be difficult to execute all these changes.
The Holy Spirit inspired them, The Holy Spirit will execute them.
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.
India, December 1964
The body of Christ.
The body of Christ.
The body of Christ.
The body of Christ.
This famine is one of the worst that India has experienced.
But the real problem isn't only freeing the people... but removing the dead from the streets.
I would like to do more to help you.
I've ordered a cargo of wheat from Europe.
When I return to Italy, I will start raising money.
In the meantime, take my car.
- You can sell it.
- How will you get back to the hotel?
I'll find a lift.
I know that soon you'll be speaking at the UN assembly in New York.
- Yes.
- Make yourself heard.
The world needs to listen to you and believe in God.
October 4th 1965
There will be no more conflict among us.
It's incredible, the UN is listening to the Pope's words.
Only Don Battista could achieve that.
Listen to the words of a deceased man.
Four years ago, John Kennedy proclaimed:
"Humanity must put an end to war
Or war will put an end to humanity."
Now that the whole world can hear us, it's time to say the more uncomfortable truths.
Mother Theresa is right, mankind needs to find its faith in God again.
Only this way can it survive and truly become a civilization of love.
I'd like to explain this in the two new encyclicals.
The first will speak of love between peoples.
The second will speak of love between women and men.
What do you think?
You know why Mother Theresa is so convincing?
Because she doesn't speak about love.
She practices it.
Rome, Regina Coeli prison
Rome, Bambino Gesù Hospital
Your Holiness.
Your Eminence.
I read the first draft of the first encyclical.
- I'd like to discuss it with you.
- All right.
I'm listening.
There are some phrases which could be misinterpreted.
- Which ones?
- This one.
"Private property doesn't constitute an unconditional and absolute right."
Someone may interpret that as a Marxist comment.
Someone with little faith.
It's what the fathers of the Church have said for centuries.
And this one: "The assets of people call for expropriation if certain possessions prove to be obstacles for collective prosperity."
That's like saying an armed revolution is legitimate.
You're right.
I'll be more specific about the conditions for expropriation.
Maybe we should avoid the topic entirely.
No.
When I was in South America
I saw favelas on the edges of huge land estates.
In Africa, populations of starving people.
In India, men so poor that they had no burial places.
How can there be a civilization of love... if the opulent people ignore the starving people's cry for help?
Ecclesiastical tradition has always considered the purpose of sex to be procreation.
But let's be honest, this isn't something the Church can impose on its followers.
We cannot make couples feel guilty... for limiting the number of children they have.
Your encyclical on love between men and women, is our opportunity to understand them.
The world is about to explode, there are too many of us.
If families could plan births, the benefit for developing countries would be immense.
The pill would resolve women's problems.
Only planned and truly desired children would be born.
Less tensions in families, less anxieties, less separations.
On the other hand, we have to say... that we cannot predict the long term consequences of a direct intervention on sexuality on such a large scale.
Very well.
Have you reached a unanimous decision?
No.
But the majority is in favour of the lawfulness of contraceptive methods that prolong the infertile period.
Of course.
Sterilizing the poor makes the rich feel less guilty.
And then again...
I understand the genuine hardship felt by many families.
This is why I need some time to reflect.
And to pray.
Do you need any more information?
We have to study more.
We have to try and have a deeper understanding.
Do not try to avoid obstacles.
Obstacles are a gift.
We are trying to understand the meaning of love.
What's more important than that?
Be strong.
Your Eminence!
- Are you hearing confessions?
- No.
I'm here to sell roast chestnuts.
- Are you feeling all right?
- Are you here to confess yourself?
Yes.
Forgive me for I have sinned.
I've not been to confession for a while.
I forgive you in the name of the Father, the Son... and the Holy Ghost.
Father, I'm not finished yet.
But I have, my dear child.
Your Eminence!
Your Holiness.
Father Giulio has passed away.
We thought the times of war were over.
How can we build a civilization of love... if people continue abandoning themselves to all this evil?
How much longer will you allow this?
How much longer?
Forward, people!
Rome, March 1967
This newspaper uses this title for its article on the encyclical.
They always interpret it using the same Marxist concepts.
As you said.
After all, you did warn me.
Every encyclical needs time to be understood.
Your words have just been misunderstood.
- That's obvious to everyone.
- No.
Not to everyone.
Do you remember, during the Council, the Nicaraguan bishop, Corral?
Yes.
He told me that after reading Populorum Progressio, one of his priests decided to take up arms to take part in the revolution against the dictatorship in Somoza.
I wanted to convince people to love each other... instead my words have been used to encourage followers... to take up arms.
No to the war in Vietnam!
Rome, summer 1968
Free Vietnam!
Join us.
Come on, sisters, The Church is siding with the Vietcong.
The Church is with the Vietcong.
Jesus is against America.
Jesus is against America.
Maria.
Your Holiness.
How great...
No.
Thank you for seeing me.
I needed to speak to you.
Come.
Is your family well?
Not really.
We're having problems with Matteo...
especially Roberto.
They're not speaking to each other.
I'm so scared of losing Matteo.
I'd really appreciate it if you could talk to him.
- I'd love to help.
- Really?
- Can I tell him to come here?
- Of course.
But, let me give you some advice.
Don't put him under pressure.
Just tell him he's welcome anytime.
He needs to come of his own accord... if our meeting is to be productive.
All right.
Thank you.
No.
Now I need to ask you for your advice.
Let's sit down.
I need your opinion as a woman and as a mother.
It's a delicate matter.
In your opinion... do you think that the Church can say contraceptive methods are legitimate?
I've been married to Roberto for thirty years.
Of course, I haven't loved my husband just to be with him... or just in order to have children.
But for both reasons.
That's all.
And that was a positive thing.
I don't know if the Church should say... that contraception is legitimate.
But what I do know is that I'm sure you'll know what to say and in the right way.
Thank you.
- Thirty years.
- I know.
Joyful years because of your love.
That's what I'll talk about:
true love in marriage.
Bastards!
Murderers!
Get in the car!
Where's Matteo?
Thank God, you're here.
Leave me alone.
Why were you arrested?
- What did he do?
- What do you think?
A few petrol bombs, the usual clashes with the police...
The truth is that he's an imbecile!
You've been brainwashed by your so-called communist friends who are just little rich kids.
I defend people's rights.
I'm with the Vietcong, not the Americans like you.
I want the war in Vietnam to end.
You do?
They're dropping bombs non-stop.
Bombs!
But you don't care.
What do you hope to obtain with violence?
Nothing is obtained with violence, I've taught you that.
- Can't you stop shouting?
- You've taught me nothing.
You're too old-fashioned.
Even the Pope is more progressive than you.
Stop it.
He says that it's right to rebel against tyranny.
Have you read it?
You wouldn't understand, you're a fascist.
Have some respect for your father.
You know nothing about our lives.
I should've known, you're a slave to him.
Stop it, Matteo.
Your Holiness.
Yes.
Come in, Cardinal Suenens.
I've read the first draft of your new encyclical, Humanae Vitae.
What did you think?
I'm talking to you as a friend rather than as a brother.
Don't publish it.
The world has long awaited an encyclical that discusses sex.
You cannot publish one... that says... the same things that a Pope would've said a century ago.
What will our followers and women, in particular, think when they read:
"Any action that impedes procreation must be avoided."
How much longer can we ignore the needs of the modern world?
I didn't write this encyclical to discuss sex, but to talk about love... about life... about men and women.
I've asked myself what's the value of love and of life.
Of men and women.
What will become of this civilization of love, of men... and of women?
What will a population in search of personal pleasure be like?
Won't these contraceptive methods make us lose respect for women?
Won't they transform women into an object of pleasure?
Won't they give us the illusion of freedom... in exchange for losing faith in the parental roles?
How can love deny the transmission of life?
Isn't life... the greatest gift God has given us?
These are questions which... have no right answer.
Right.
The Pope cannot say something is right... if it is not.
Your Holiness.
Monsignor Lefebvre is here.
I want to persuade him to try to avoid a conflict.
The Church does not need stubborn bishops like him.
Can a shepherd abandon a lost sheep?
This gift, Monsignor Lefebvre, signifies our immense desire to continue celebrating the same mass with you.
We know how dedicated you have been to the Church... and how you continue to be so.
Precisely for this reason, I cannot stand for you being offended.
Why do you say that?
Do not see signs of renewal?
You call it renewal.
Churches, convents and seminars are empty,
pop concerts are held in parishes.
Priests are renouncing their sacred roles, tradition has been abandoned.
Tradition isn't only about repeating the same things.
We must try to imagine our Christianity... like a tree in an eternal spring.
Sprouting new flowers and fruits.
New fruits?
What fruits?
The world is losing its faith.
You are doing nothing to stop this.
I'm sorry, Your Holiness.
We wanted to make the Church... the essence of a new civilization, but... the essence has evaporated.
"Le Monde" says... that with the new encyclical, the Roman Pope has sided with the conservationists and opts for political sclerosis.
While the "New York Times" says:
"It is tragic that this Pope will be remembered for his encyclical whose sole purpose is to advocate war and poverty."
So the Church is to blame for this as well now.
It's all right.
What do the Catholics say?
Certain theologians and bishops are on the Pope's side.
But many believe that the encyclical is unsuitable.
Unsuitable?
Some theologians have said it will damage the Church.
Some bishops published it with their negative comments.
Suenens?
Don't be afraid, tell me.
He declared that the Pope is a prisoner of a bureaucratic and conservative Curia.
In other words, I'm unfit for office.
- If you don't go, I will.
- You're not going anywhere.
He'll come back of his own accord.
When he's run out of money and has no place to go.
This time, I'm really worried.
He hasn't been in touch for weeks, he's never done this.
- I want to know that he's okay.
- You're too kind.
- I know.
- And he's always abused that.
He wanted freedom.
I've had enough.
We have to be firmer.
Both of us.
Then he'll change.
- How?
- You'll see.
Thank you for granting me an audience.
Your Eminence, we're friends now.
How's the situation in Poland, Cardinal Woityla?
The government is becoming more hostile.
It uses any means to remove God from the hearts of my people.
For example, they're building a new city, for thousands of workers.
It will be called Nowa Huta.
They want it to become the first Polish city without God.
They've forbidden us to build any churches there.
Have a seat.
It's hard for people to practice their faith in the Western world too.
Here believers are lost because the world keeps changing and tries to destroy any certainty about faith.
Meanwhile, we have our duty to do.
Do you think we were wrong... to start a dialogue?
No.
A dialogue requires strength, patience and perseverance.
You taught me that.
The new Church will be built sooner or later.
That's what the people want.
And when that time will come... we will give you the first stone with which you shall build that church.
That's a promise.
- I bet you were an altar boy!
- Right!
Someone's at the door.
- Who is it?
- Matteo, it's for you.
Why are you here?
- You've lost weight.
- No.
I'm fine.
Who told you I was here?
I bet you asked around about me.
I'm asking you, please.
Come home.
Things will change.
You always say that too.
- You know your father talks...
- Forget it.
I'm not coming back.
I know what my father's like.
Come on, I'll see you out.
Bye, mom.
- Promise you'll call?
- Yes.
- Can I tell your father...
- Come on, it's late.
Bye.
Matteo.
I went to see the Pope some time ago.
If you want to talk to him, he'll listen.
I'm not interested.
Bye.
- Your Holiness.
- Yes.
This will cause you great sadness.
- What is it?
- Cardinal Seper sent it.
It's a list of priests who have returned to their lay status.
- There are hundreds of them.
- I know, it's a lot.
Lord... give me the strength to guide the Church out of this tempest.
Your Holiness.
You haven't slept.
Don Macchi, you know how many they are?
An infinite quantity, that's just in the last month.
And...
- Look.
- What is it?
This name.
Do not ask me to reconsider.
I won't.
Just tell me why.
I want my freedom back.
- Your freedom?
- Yes.
The freedom to fight in the front line for justice.
The front line is at the altar, Don Leone.
No.
Today, the front line is on the outskirts...
In the factories where people die, in the starving Third World.
That's where I should be.
Go there as a priest.
- What's stopping you?
- Attendance at mass has dropped.
Young people don't come anymore.
The Lord does not ask us to be popular.
Everyone wants to be popular now.
The Lord just asks us to be loyal.
He will reward us when the time is right.
I want to be a member of a political party.
To be able to take action.
Only by taking part in social battles will we achieve justice.
I'm talking about the poor, the exploited people...
But as a priest,
I can't take part in politics.
Politics is...
The highest form of charity, you taught me that.
Yes, it is but politics alone cannot save the world.
I...
I've met a woman.
I love her.
If the Church would allow me to marry...
These things don't concern the Church.
You loved the Church.
You swore to remain faithful to it.
You want it to accept your betrayal?
You'll be granted an exemption.
You've always had your freedom.
Now make good use of it.
The number of priests who are abandoning priesthood is rising.
The religious orders evidently experiencing a crisis.
Attendance at mass is dropping.
The voice of the Church is increasingly solitary.
A state of uncertainty seems to reign among God's people.
And...
What should the Pope do?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
He looks like a protester.
Those who protest seek the truth.
Young people always fight against something, including our mistakes.
Show him in.
Come in, Matteo.
I'm glad you accepted the invite I made through your mother.
That's not why I came.
- Why are you here then?
- To understand.
Come and sit down.
Talk to me.
You can tell me, in fact, you must tell me what's on your mind.
You are the Pope of the Populorum Progressio.
But if you don't mind me saying... you've done nothing to help the progress of the people.
I see.
You're disappointed with me?
You're not the only one.
But I can tell you that... guided by my conscience, I've always tried to follow the will of God.
Even when this meant disagreeing with followers, and at times, priests.
What's God's will got to do with it?
Go on, I'm listening.
First you said that dictatorships could be defeated then you condemned the priests who did it.
Justice cannot be obtained through violence.
How, then?
The rich always become richer.
- ...and the poorer get poorer.
- You're right.
You haven't achieved anything.
You see, Matteo,
I want to tell you a secret.
Right from the start, this Pope decided... to trust in men's freedom.
If it's God's will, he'll reward me for doing so.
It was stupid of me to come here.
I knew it would be useless.
Goodbye.
May God be with you.
Bombs exploded this afternoon in Milan and Rome.
December 12th 1969
The most serious one was in Milan.
In the main hall of the "Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura".
14 people died in the explosion.
Poor Milan.
Do you remember?
12 years ago we started our great mission for a civilization of love.
God hasn't shown us any fruits.
I have no fruits to show.
Only God knows when the time is right.
I know.
But a man of faith can complain too.
Remember Jeremiah.
David, Job.
Forgive me.
My God, where are you?
Satan's smoke has entered your temple.
The demon is human, he is mysterious and fearful.
This is the terrible truth.
People no longer have faith in the Church.
Their hearts are filled with doubt.
We hoped the Council would announce the arrival of spring, but winter has arrived instead.
Why, my Lord?
Why?
You're unfit for office.
You ignored the problems of the Church.
The poor will make you pay for this!
You'll pay...
You'll pay for this!
You've achieved nothing, you got it all wrong.
Coward!
"We believe in one God alone, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit,
the creator of all things... like this world... where we lead our fleeting lives.
along with all things.
We believe in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
He lived among us, full of grace and truth.
He announced the kingdom of God.
He led us to God.
He gave us his new commandment, to love thy neighbour, like He loved us.
He suffered because of Pontius Pilate...
He is the lamb of God who carries the sins of the world.
He died on the cross for us.
And he came back to life on the third day."
"The regime, after many protests by the workers, after great insistence, has listened to the people.
It has authorized the construction of a new church in Nowa Huta.
Your gift, the first stone, is for me a precious and eloquent sign.
As I think of your efforts and the suffering endured in order to make this happen,
I think of the words of the Gospel.
"If the grain of wheat that falls to the ground does not die, it is alone, if it dies, it bears many fruits."
The true meaning of an apostle's life is to give one's all for one's faith."
Rome, April 20th 1978
Your Holiness, it's time for supper.
During my meditation I went on a long journey.
Now the path I must take is clearer to me.
I will write a public letter to Aldo Moro's captors.
You'll write to those criminals?
Why?
Because dialogue is like a seed which is eternally sprouting.
Even when you least expect it, in the most complicated situations.
Let's hope so.
Thank you.
Monsignor Casaroli?
Yes?
There's been a phone call from the Pope's office.
The Pope wishes you to be on call, he may need your help.
All right.
Your appeal will be ignored, just like your appeal against abortion.
The State is about to legalize it.
But we cannot remain silent, Cardinal Villot.
Your actions will wreak havoc in the world of politics.
Writing to the Red Brigades will give them the acknowledgement they desire.
It'll be a victory for them to have driven the Pope to do this.
They are human beings.
And I'm appealing to their humanity.
But they have committed atrocious acts.
I'm sure they too have a heart.
Now, if you don't mind,
I would like to recite the rosary.
Would you care to join me?
Perhaps your letter could be effective in saving Moro's life.
They may be satisfied with your acknowledgement:
you are a head of State and a spiritual guide for the majority of the world.
Now, please, take it to Casaroli,
Thank you.
Simply, without conditions.
Your Holiness,
His Excellency suggests a few changes.
"I write to you, inflexible, unknown adversaries, of this man worthy of..."
Wait.
"Inflexible" isn't right.
It doesn't convey the right meaning.
"Implacable" is more suitable.
- Just change that word, it's late.
- I don't want to send it like this.
Dictate it to me.
"I write to you, members of the Red Brigade..."
Do you really want to do it now?
You're tired...
Just continue, please.
"I request that you set free, the Honourable Aldo Moro
and allow him to return to his family and to his civilian life."
We'll attack the carabinieri barracks using hand grenades in two days.
Colonna's branch say you can be one of us.
- Do you feel up to it?
- Of course.
You're sure?
Yes.
The carabinieri may respond to the attack.
Here.
Have you ever used a gun?
No.
But I'm ready to.
We have to continue attacking the State and keep up our armed struggle.
It'll be tomorrow night.
Count me in.
Rome, April 21st 1978
This is a special bulletin.
His Holiness, Pope Paul VI has a message for the Red Brigades
"I'm writing to you, members of the Red Brigade to request that you set free the Honourable Aldo Moro.
Allow him to return to his family and to civilian life."
The Holy See will be criticized.
But such noble words cannot be ignored.
"I do not know you and have no contact with you.
So I've written a public letter,
I'm taking advantage of the time left before the death sentence you have declared for him expires.
He is an honest and good man, who has committed no crimes.
He cannot be accused of social negligence.
Or of not serving justice or civilian peace.
I have no warrant for him, nor do I have any personal interest in connection with him.
But I feel affection for him.
we were students together, and above all... because he shares my faith and is a son of Christ's Church.
In the name of our supreme Christ I appeal to you, unknown and implacable foes of this worthy and innocent man.
I plead with you to free the Honourable Aldo Moro.
Simply, without conditions.
Not because of my humble and benevolent intervention.
but in virtue of his dignity as brother of mankind."
We've mourned too many victims and deprecated the death of people who were carrying out their duty.
We must all live in fear of hate degenerating into a vendetta, or causing acts driven by despair.
We must fear God who will avenge the deaths of innocent people.
Members of the Red Brigades, allow me to continue, as interpreter of your fellow citizens, to hope that in your hearts, a victorious glimmer of humanity still exists.
I await, with unchanged affection for you, for proof of this."
Let me help you.
Any news?
We have received no further news about Aldo Moro.
We waited anxiously yesterday, as the deadline set by the executioners was reached,
We are still waiting anxiously, hoping and praying,
This is the Red Brigades.
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.
We are fulfilling the president's final request, by informing his family of where his body is located.
Meaning?
Inform his family that the body of the Honourable Aldo Moro is in Via Caetani
Lord, listen to our prayers.
You alone can hear our suffering.
Lord of life and death, you did not respond to our appeal
Rome, May 13th 1978 to save Aldo Moro's life.
This kind, humble, wise and innocent friend.
But you, Oh Lord, have not abandoned his immortal spirit, marked by his faith in Christ through resurrection and therefore a new life.
For him...
Lord, hear our prayers.
Please remember that he is very tired.
Your Holiness,
- Do you recognise me, Father?
- How are you, Matteo?
Sit down.
Well?
What did you decide to study in the end?
Law or Philosophy?
Neither.
But I didn't become a murderer either.
What do you mean?
That...
I almost became one.
I harboured... such angry feelings.
I don't know why.
It was like...
I was filled with rage
but something lived inside me.
In the end, all of that was worth it, because it brought me here.
I came to thank you.
It was your letter to the Red Brigades that... disarmed me.
You've brought me great joy.
No, Father.
You gave me the immense joy of being able to decide to stop, of my own accord.
When you go home tonight, give your mother my best regards.
Your Holiness, you're very weak.
You're riddled with arthritis.
Could you not celebrate your anniversary of priesthood with a more intimate ceremony?
There's no better way to celebrate an anniversary than how I've planned,
Long live the Pope!
- I can manage.
- Your Holiness, you shouldn't...
Don't worry.
Now, like Paul, I feel I can say...
"I have fought a worthy battle.
I have reached my objective.
I have preserved faith."
Previously on "Men in Trees"...
Sometimes I think our whole relationship has been backwards.
I haven't been able to get you out of my head.
I flew across the country for you.
Maybe we're just too different.
Will you marry me?
You bet.
Cash?
What's your one trouble?
None of your business.
Patrick... you're okay!
Who's Patrick?
I'm your mother.
I'm your dad.
Yeah, right!
Patrick doesn't even remember who I am.
I got this job - offer

I'll pass on the vino.
What?
You haven't even tasted it.
Wine from Alaska?
Honey, that's like oysters from Oklahoma.
Just give it a try.
Okay.
I'll send you a case of cabernet when I get back to the city.
I can't believe you're leaving in three days.
Don't go.
New york needs me, and by that, I mean my dry cleaner, my mother, and my therapist.
How's sam doing?
Oh, he seems excited.
If he's freaking out, he's doing a hell of a job hiding it.
Have you heard from Jack?
Uh, no.
But I'm sure he'll call the second his ship-to-shore phone gets back in range.
It's hard, huh?
Yeah.
But I'm getting used to it - captain's widow and all.
And, hey, look at the sweater I'm making for him.
Oh.
The midriff wool pullover.
You don't see that much.
Want me to make one for sam?
I'm not sure it's a new york look.
Oh, I'm so excited to be in the city with sam.
I'm gonna take him to the mets and the whitney and movie nights in Bryant park.
God, I miss Bryant park.
I mean, I love it in Elmo, but would it kill people once in a while to get a little cultural?
Hey, you know what I'm gonna do?
Move back to the city?
I'ing to do a movie nit - bring a little piece of Manhattan to Elmo - a classic movie under the stars.
Elmo's done so much for me.
It'll be nice -
Hello?
Not much in the fridge.
I'm sorry.
You'll have to let me know next time you plan on breaking and entering.
Just entering.
The back door was open.
Uh, cash, what are you doing here?
- Hey, cash.
- Hi, jane.
Can I interest you in a glass of alaska's finest?
Sure.
Box and bear winery - they make a kick-ass blueberry zin.
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.
What's going on?
I landed this great roofing gig in town.
I was hoping I could crash here for a couple days.
Cash.
I'll even keep my shirt on if you want me to.
Oh, that's not necessary.
Jane, would you excuse us a minute?
You can't just do this.
What's the matter, princess?
I haven't heard from you in weeks, and then all of a sudden, you just show up out of nowhere?
Exciting, huh?
No, it's not fair.
You can't just come and go as you please.
I'm not running a flophouse.
Okay, I get it.
Bye, jane.
Bye, cash.
Bye, princess.
I'm sorry.
You could have at least had him try on the sweater.
Hey.
Holy god.
What is that smell?
Me.
I picked up some work today down at the dock, gutting fish.
You're gutting fish now.
Well, bills apparently do not pay themselves.
Is matty still up?
Just went to bed.
Oh, man.
I promised him I'd play him a game of madden football.
It's okay.
I filled in.
Scored like six touchdowns.
Never seen him so impressed.
I... may have underestimated what it takes to build a church from the ground up.
Just time.
And money.
I don't have an office.
I don't have a place to meet or to worship.
I mean, I-I don't want to stand on a street corner and preach
, but I'm running out of options.
Well, how about moving in here?
Here?
Just temporarily, until things get rolling.
Seriously?
It would be completely chaste.
You could sleep on the couch, save up some money.
And do you think that we can handle that?
Why not?
We're adults.
And what about matty?
He loves having you around, you know that.
And I don't completely hate it.
And you know, maybe this could be my little way of doing god's work, too.
Plus, think how good you'll get at madden football.
When you put it like that, that... so you'll do it?
Yes.
I will.
Thank you, sara.
Do I really smell?
Unbelievably bad.
Hey -
That's quite a shirt.
Oh, yeah.
Found it in the back of my closet.
It's funky, right?
Funky.
I think I can see the outline of your spleen.
Patrick, what are you doing?
Having a beer.
It's 8:00 A. M.
I know.
It one of the new things I've discovered - beer is really good in the morning.
That's disgusting.
What?
I didn't used to burp?
No.
Man, I was missing out.
What a release
Okay.Well, here we go - eggs a la Patrick.
What the matter?
These eggs.
They don't look right.
They're super-runny.
That's how you like them.
Tastes like egg water.
Patrick.
I'm sorry.
I don't li them.
- You do.
- I did.
I don't anymore.
You know, I appreciate you having me over for breakfast, but if this is gonna work you're gonna have to start focusing on who I am and not who I was.
Fine.
I'll just put them back on the stove.
Oh, no, no.
I'm good with beer.
Egg-water burps.
Not as good.
MOVIE NIGHT one for you.
One for you.
One for you.
One for you.
"Movie night.
" That's right, people, the first of many.
Yeah, but we don't have a movie theater.
No, but we have something so much better.
We have the woods, the sky, and the stars.
Oh, you're gonna build a movie theater.
"Movie night under the stars.
" It'll be just like Bryant park.
Exactly.
Outside?
Picture this -a clearing in the woods, a blanket on the ground, a picnic under the stars, as bette davis and joan crawford take turns chewing the scenery.
Oh, it'll be fabulous.
I can hardly wait.
I knew it was on a matter of time before you start classing up this joint, miss Frist - classing it up.
What do you think, mai?
Can I do the concessions?
I guess so.
- I'm in.
- Okay.
- Theresa?
- I think it sounds nice.
Ben?
I don't know.
What's to know?
Well, why would I want to go sit on the ground out in the woods to watch a movie?
I mean, they finally got stadium seating at the sitka cineplex, with cupholders.
Buzz:
Plus, it's really been hot out there.
I mean, mosquitos are out in full force.
And who knows what kind of critters you're gonna attract up there with all them pic-a-nic baskets.
It's basically an invitation to a bear mauling.
Yeah, but a bear mauling under the stars.
You guys could not be serious.
You're men - alaskan men who are not allowed to whine and complain about being outside.
Movie night is happening, and attendance is mandatory.
- Okay.
- Fine.
I'm in.
Good.
So, which "die hard" movie are you gonna show?
I cannot wait to take u shopping for some new clothes in new york.
Am I gonna have to start essing like donald trump?
Or P. Diddy.
It's your choice - the donald or the diddy.
I'm gonna miss this boat.
You could always just park it on the hudson river and live there.
Oh, my god.
I could not be less serious.
Yeah, I got that.
Look at that.
We almost threw out this shirt.
Oh, don'you have like 20 of those?
Yeah, but each one's unique.
Look, this one's missing three buttons, and it's got all these cool holes.
I see.
I guess we shouldn't keep the hamper so close to the trash can.
Guess not.
Almost lost a shirt.
Almost.
Would you pack that for me?
I'm gonna take a shower.
- Will do.
- Thanks.
You have to take this shirt.
Why?
It's sam's, and I hate it.
Oh, come on.
It's cute and worn-in.
The term is "ratty.
" And it is not making the flight to new york.
Are we having a sewing circle?
We're making the screen for the movie.
Ooh, right.
What are we watching?
- "Giant.
- " Ah, fun.
Never heard of it.
Really?
It's rock hudson and elizabeth taylor.
I live in alaska and date a pastor.
I don't get out much.
How are you two doing?
I sort of invited him to move in with me.
Wow!
So much for "operation:
No sex.
" We're still celibate.
It's just so he can save up some money.
Church-building is slow going.
I ink it's wonderful you two moved in together.
Wonderful and insane.
- Jane.
- What?
Imagine living under the same roof as Jack and not being able to have sex.
I'm not going to be having sex with him for about nine months.
Besides, this is different.
Eric is a pastor.
Yeah, but sara's not.
I'm with jane.
This could be difficult.
- Hi.
- Hello.
I'm looking for mr.
Morrissey.
I don't know who that is.
Leonard morrissey?
Sorry.
Leonard cassius morrissey?
Oh, cash.
Yes, I, uh, I do know who that is, but doesn't live here.
Oh, wellthis is his last known address.
His doctors at the hospital are looking for him.
Why are they looking for him?
Mr.Morrissey missed his last couple of appointments, so they sent me over to see if he was okay or in need of transportation to the hospital or anything.
What does he need to go to the hospital for?
I really can't say, but please, if you see him, will you let him know that we came by?
And he can reach us at this number.
****
- HI BEN
- HI
IS THERE ANONE Has anyone seen cash?
I didn't even know he was back in town.
Yeah, he's roofing the barker place over on elm.
Oh, good.
So he's not dead or anything.
Well, I ho not, 'cause that roof is more bowed than my legs.
Barker'S.
Thanks.
HI GUYS
Oh, hi, Marin.
Oh, my god.
There he is.
There who is?
My victim - the boy I almost killed.
- Patrick?
- The bobby pin!
Does no one remember the bobby pin?
I put the bobby pin in Patrick's hair, and that's why he got struck by lightning.
That wasn't your fault.
You are a good woman, theresa.
True.
Uh, can I get a club soda, ben?
Sure thing.
How's he doing?
Not so good.
We all just went swimming down at the dock.
He kind of freaked out.
Freaked out?
How?
He just stood there, watching us.
Nobody could get him to jump in.
But he's always been a very good swimmer.
I know.
It was so sad.
Broke my heart.
hey, there.
Oh, hey, buzz... dad.
Ah, you always called me "buzz.
" You got the next game?
Oh, no, no.
You go ahead.
You don't want to play?
I sort of don't remember if I can.
You were no minnesota fats, but you could play.
Oh, good to know.
I heard about the swimming.
Yeah, it's kind of frustrating.
Couldn't remember that either, huh?
Not so much.
People are always telling me what I used to be able to do and what I used to like to do, but I'm not really sure I remember any of it.
Must be a lot of pressure.
I'll say.
I just don't want to make a fool out of myself, you know?
Yeah.
Well, if you have the time and the inclination
, I'd be happy to teach you , try to help you remember some stuff.
Yeah?
Sure, absolutely.
We could start with pool.
Okay, yeah.
Yeah?
I'd like that.
Okay.
Hey, we got next.
Hey!
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Looking for a fiddler.
It's a reference - the roof.
Never mind.
Can I talk to you?
Talk.
Down here.
Kind of grooving up here, princess.
Fine.
But if I fall and break my neck and you have to rush me to the hospital, that'll be quite ironic.
It's kind of nice up here.
Yeah, peaceful.
What's up?
So, uh, a woman came by from alaska general looking for you.
Oh?
Said you missed a couple of appointments.
Seems like the doctors are kind of worried about you.
Yeah, it's no big deal.
I'll go next week.
Cash, why are you going to the hospital?
No big deal.
Well, if it's no big deal, then why don't you tell me?
It's just a kidney thing.
What do you mean, "a kidney thing"?
It's no big deal.
It doesn't sound like no big deal.
Then none of your business.
Look, I can't focus with you staring at me likehaT.
Okay.
I'll go.
Wow, this new kfc toasted wrap is good.
Ah, thank you, ed.
I really appreciate it.
We'll talk soon.
Okay.
God bless.
How's it going?
That was ed popper from my old church.
I've known him and his wife since before I married them.
They are definitely gonna follow me wherever I land.
So the good news is that i officially have a flock of two.
Now all I need is a church and a choir and about 300 more parishioners.
It's only a matter of time.
I don't know what I'd do without your support.
I really admire what you're doing, eric.
It takes a lot of courage.
Well... you know, I should probably get back to work
- yeah, me too - 'cause I got A... well, not work, but let you work.
Yeah, okay.
Okay.
I can't believe Jack still hasn't called.
Well, he'll call when he can.
You must be so frustrated, though.
I'm okay.
But you haven't heard from him in over a week.
Don't you feel bad?
You have to feel bad.
I would feel terrible.
Well, I wasn't, but I'm starting to.
Oh, sorry.
It's okay, annie.
Here.
What's this?
A list of rules regarding proper behavior and conduct for your movie night.
I expect you to photocopy and distribute to all participants.
Okay.
In addition,
I've taken t liberty of photographing the area from multiple angles to ensure that you leave it as pristine as you found it.
If you do not, I'll be forced to impose a stiff fine for which you and you alone will be responsible.
That sounds great, chief Celia.
Thank you so much for your help.
Geez, what is with her?
I think she's taking movie night personally because watching old movies was her thing with Patrick.
Like how doing mime was my thing with Patrick.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
We did it as a stress reliever.
You'd be surprised how being trapped in an invisible box can really calm the nerves.
Well, I'll have to try that sometime.
Now?
Oh, uh, you know, maybe later, when I'm feeling more stress.
Well, I'll be here when you're ready to mime it out... alone with my ex-fianc?
s mother and our memories.
You know, annie, you two are kind of in the same boat.
Maybe you should reach out to her.
Yeah... maybe.
Wait.
What - what is all this?
Oh, it's nothing.
"Kidney disease"? "Kidney failure"?
Oh, my god.
Marin, are you sick?
No.
Do you have kidney disease?
Are you dying?
I don't think I can handle this right now.
First Patrick and now you - what is going on?
Annie.
Annie, calm down.
It's not me.
It - it's not?
It's cash.
What's wrong with cash?
I don't know yet.
That's why I'm doing this research.
It's been a very tumultuous year.
I know.
Thanks for taking all this time with me, buzz.
What's a father for?
How you feeling?
Good.
A little nervous.
Well, that's to be expected, but your pool game came back to you pretty quick, didn't it?
- Yeah.
- Huh?
I guess it did.
Yeah.
Well, you ready to learn how to swim?
- Definitely.
- Okay.
And what's the first lesson?
All right, now use those arms!
Come on, Patrick!
Kick those feet!
Let that sense memory kick in!
Come on, you can do it, Patrick!
Kick those legs!
Swim, Patrick, swim!
Come on, paddle!
Patrick!
I got you, son.
Here you go.
Thanks for the drowning lesson, buzz!
Patrick.
Patrick?
Hi, chief Celia.
These are for you.
Why?
Because I have something I want to ask you.
C - can I come in?
No.
Oh, okay.
Chief Celia, you look lovely today.
I'm wearing my uniform.
But it's very flattering.
Are you drunk?
No.
I
- I was just wondering if you're not doing anything tonight, maybe you'd like to go with me to movie night?
I have a boyfriend.
All right, he's out of town, but I don't need a date.
I know that.
I
- I just figured, since you're not planning on going with Patrick to movie night and I'm not planning on going with Patrick, we're kind of in the same boat, so maybe you'd like to go together?
You and I are not in the same boat.
Patrick is my son.
I have loved and cared for him all his life.
You were his girlfriend for a year.
Those are very different boats.
So, I-is that a no?
Yes.
- hey.
- Hey.
I got that same shirt.
Oh, yeah?
See you around.
Say "hi" to jane.
Will do.
Damn.
Hey.
I've been looking all over for you.
Well, here I am.
I went to the house you were roofing, but you weren't there.
That's 'cause I'm here.
What's all that?
This is research I have been doing - kidney research.
Please tell me you have kidney stones.
I don't have kidney stones.
Oh, I was afraid you were gonna s that.
This other stuff is really serious, cash.
I know how serious it is.
- You do?
- Yes.
I, uh, I have degenerative kidney disease.
Oh, my god.
This is why I don't tell people.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
This is terrible.
What - what did the doctor say?
Look, I'm working so I can pay for the treatment I need.
Okay.
That's good.
Okay, that's a good thing.
Unfortunately, I got fired today.
- What?
- Princess.
Well, sorry.
Yeah.
Apparently, word got out about condition, and the boss said he had no choicbut to let me go.
Too risky.
I don't know how he found out, but I guess you go to the hospital a few times, people are bound to notice.
Oh, cash.
I'll figure it out.
Well, there's got to be something that we can do.
We dot need to do anything.
Okay?
I can handle this.
What?
Do you have some sort of medical degree I don't know about?
I've got it under control.
Well, what does that mean?
What are you gonna do?
Find another job.
Who wants a mai dud?
What is a mai dud?
It's like a milk dud, only not so chewy and demanding.
I made them last night.
First one'free.
Second one's gonna cost you.
I got mai duds... and five kinds of flavored popcorn for movie night.
I'm gonna make a fortune.
Not bad, huh?
Yeah, not bad.
Hey, maybe you and I make a deal.
I'll do exclusive concessions at all your hockey games, and you get a nice cut.
Well, I already have a concessions guy, but if you can undercut him, I'll think about it.
Good man.
Have another mai dud.
We'll talk.
What did I say?
mari I am so sorry.
What for?
I had no idea cash would get fired.
This about the kidney thing?
How did you know about the kidney thing?
Did you tell her about the kidney thing?
No.
I heard it from ben.
How did ben know?
He heard it from theresa...
- how did - - who heard it from jerome, who heard it from buzz, who heard it from mai, who might have kind of heard it from me.
Annie.
I am so sorry!
But I only told one peon.
A- and if you think about it, you only told one person.
So, in a way, we're both kind of equally innocent or guilty, depending on how you look at it.
So it's my fault that cash got fired?
I'm sorry, Marin.
He has no money, no health insurance, and now, thanks to me, no job.
Who wants to try a "mai-ice creamandwich"?
No, thanks.
No?
Bad timing?
Talking about the kidney thing?
Okay, I'll come back.
right on time.
hey.
God, you look pretty today.
- Patrick.
- Sorry.
You okay?
You're looking a little blue - pretty, but blue.
I'm okay.
Is it the cash thing?
Wait.
How -
Yes.
That's tough.
I got to do something.
I would loan him the money, but he would never take it.
Maybe you can do some sort of fundraiser or something.
Hey, yeah.
That, Patrick, is a fantastic idea.
I'll make movie night a fundraiser for cash.
Cash for cash.
Cash for cash.
And now we're on.
Hello, Elmo.
Big news, Elmo.
Marin Frist's movie night is now a fundraiser.
Okay, we're announcing it.
It's for cash... morrissey.
Cash morrissey.
Now, I don't remember him - nothing unusual about that - but I'm sure you all do and would love to help the guy out.
That's right, Elmo.
Tonight at movie night, we will be screening the academy award-winning epic "giant.
" Not only will you be enjoying one of the most moving and romantic movies of all time, but you will be raising money for a worthy cause.
It's gonna be a giant night all around.
It's gonna be huge!
So come on out, bring your picnic baskets, but more importantly, bring your wallets, 'cause let's face it, Elmo, isn't it better to give than receive?
Take off your shirt.
Jane, please, not here.
Give it to me.
But I thought you hated this shirt.
I do, but sam loves it, even more than before, since he saw you looking all cute in yours.
Yeah.Now he wants to wear it tonight at movie night, and I don't want him to discover what a terrible person I am.
We've only been married a few weeks.
It's too soon.
I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.
She runs like a dork.
That's old polo.
He's head vaquero.
He's been here longer than many of us, I guess - since grandpa benedict's time.
Look at them, honey.
There's never beennything like them in this world, I can tell you.
Hey, sorry we're late.
Oh, don't worry about it.
I'm so glad you came.
Oh, we wouldn't have missed it.
Oh, ben.
Thanks.
There's plenty of room down front.
Enjoy.
Mai:
Mai duds!
MaI, how's it going?
Oh, pretty good.
Be better next time, though, if we don't allow food.
Then I can really Jack up the prices.
Well, I'm sure cash will be very grateful.
Yeah, maybe to you.
Mai duds!
No, good, thanks.
Mai, this is a fundraiser for cash.
Cash for cash, not cash for mai.
That wasn't part of the deal.
Mai.
Okay, fine, but I still got to pay for my labor and expenses.
Shh!
You "shh!
" Shut up!
Shut up!
Sell your goods back there!
Oh, one thing I will not miss about Elmo - my allergies.
Here you go.
What's this?
Oh.
That's mine.
It's a needle... for sewing or knitting or really anything you need a needle for.
You sew?
Constantly, obsessively.
Oh, I live for it.
Okay, that's a lie.
She was wearing your shirt when you saw her at the chieftain.
Don't get mad, but I tried to throw it away.
This shirt?
Several times.
The damn thing just won't die.
Why would you do that?
Because I don't like it.
It's old and ripd, and you look like a street urchin.
So you just throw it out and don't tell me?
Well, that was the plan.
Backfire.
You know, I don't like those red pants you wear sometimes, but I would never just throw them away behind your back.
Of course not.
Those pants cost $300.
Shh!
Thanks.
Hey, you mind if I join you?
Do you want a beer?
Uh, no, thanks.
So, uh, what's this movie about?
It's about people shutting up.
Patrick, about pushing you in the water today -
I uid have drowned.
I could never let anything happen to you.
You're my son.
I was just trying to get you to overcome your fear, but it was a mistake, and I'm sorry.
Well, uh, you meant well.
I did.
I really panicked.
You did.
Thanks for saving me.
No problem.
Well, one good thing came out of you losing your memory.
Yeah?
What's that?
Well, it gave me a chance to be the dad I never was.
I know you feel you have to live up to everyone's expectations, but I don't have any expectations.
Not me.
You know, this could be the start of a new beginning for both of us.
I do feel relaxed around you.
Yeah.
I can just be who I want to be.
Yeah.
I can wear cool t-shirts and have a beer for breakfast and burp whenever I feel likeurping.
You can do all that stuff.
I can open up a business teaching dogs to dance.
You can do that stuff, too.
Teaching dogs to dance?
Yeah, I was just spitballing.
No sense sitting alone, hmm?
- I agree.
- Yeah.
Wine?
Mixed nuts?
Jett!
Hold on a minute.
I want you to take mrs.
Benedict back in with you.
Honey, you go along with jett and get out of all this heat.
Technical difficulties!
Technical problems!
We're good!
I got it oh, come on!
This is what happens when you show a classic on a quilt!
CASH FOR CASH PLEASE DONATE
I got it.
Cash, hey, how you feeling, man?
What is all this?
It's for you.
****
Me
- I'm gonna get out of here one of these days.
This is my husband's land.
This is his home.
Hey.
What the hell is this?
It's a donation jar.
You know what, Marin?
From now on, why don't you just mind your own business?
Okay, the last thing I need is a public pity party.
This isn't a pity party.
These people are your friends.
They care about you.
- They want to help.
- I don't need their help.
I can take care of myself.
No one said you can'T.
This isn't even out me.
You're just doing thiso make yourself feel better.
What?
Marin Frist to theescue, everybody's savior.
Well, what does that mean?
It means that you're always trying to fix people.
Maybe I don't want to be fixed by you.
I can't believe you are reacting like this.
You really ought to learn how to appreciate when somebody tries to do something nice for you.
Hey, if I need something from somebody, I'll ask.
So, why don't you ever ask for it, then?
I did!
I asked if I could stay with you, and you said "no.
" Jane:
I'sorry, sam.
I'm sorry I tried to get rid of your shirt.
That was stupid.
The truth is, I don't care what you wear.
You look great in everything... and out of everything.
Well, you look great in those red pants and out of them.
I guess I'm just nervous about moving back to new york with you.
I want it to be perfect, even though I know it's not gonna be.
Throwing out my shirt or my entire wardrobe doesn't change the fact that there are fundamental differences between the two of us.
I know, but our differences are what make us such a good fit for each other.
You believe that, right?
I do, totally.
Me too.
Seriously, $300 for those pants?
knock, knock.
Anybody home?
Cash, are you in there?
I'd really like to talk to you for a minute.
Can I come in?
Can you come out?
Look, I want to apologize for overstepping.
It was presumptuous of me.
But please understand, I was just trying to do something as your friend.
We're friends, right?
Yeah, we're friends.
Well, normally, with my friends, we talk about everything - the good stuff and bad.
And when the bad comes, we rally.
That's what we do.
That's what I do.
I
- I... rally for my friends.
But if that's not what you want from me, if that's not the kind of friend you want me to be, I can handle that.
I can mind my own business and keep my mouth shut... you know, for the most part.
You're - you're a private person.
I get that.
I
- I respect that.
Are you still apologizing?
Yeah, trying to.
Apology accepted.
Thank you.
Now, as your friend, I was wondering if you would like to stay with me.
Well, I'm no charity case.
No, it's not charity.
I could use a live-in chef, and you're the best ck I know.
Come on.
I'll even kee my shirt on in the house.
All right, just till I finish treatment.
Okay.
Oh.
We raised over $2, 000last night, if you're interested.
Cash for cash, huh?
Catchy, right?
thank you, Marin.
Yore welcome...
leonard.
Hey.
Oh, hey.
Are you up?
Yeah, getting there.
So, listen, I know this living situation's difficult.
It is much harder than I thought it would be.
I know.
But I-I think I've come up with something - a solution to our sexual frustration.
Oh, yeah?
Can I interest you in some chamomile?
Please.
Here you go.
Oh, thank you, lenny.
Yeah, how long is this "leonard" thing gonna last?
Mmm, till I get sick of it or it stops bugging you, so neverish.
When alaska was just a land of trees, t ribes created community through barter - beads for a fur, a canoe for a cow.
Trading partners became friends.
Friends became family.
As far as I can tell, not much has changed up here.
That's it.
We're still giving and receiving - an equal trade.
There we go!
It's coming back to you, huh?
Yeah.
When the system is working both sides come away happy, neither feeling like they've compromised, but rather, getting something better in the deal.
In those moments, we are just a community of people sharing... proving every day that it can be just as fulfilling to give as to receive...
And sometimes, just as hard.
Hey, Celia.
I've got some terrible news.
Jack's ship went down in the bering sea, and they rescued survivors.
Jack wasn't among them.
Previously on "men in trees"... sometimes I think our whole relationship has been backwards.
I haven't been able to get you out of my head.
I flew across the country for you.
Maybe we're just too different.
Will you marry me?
You bet.
Cash?
What's your one trouble?
None of your business.
Patrick...you're okay!
Who's patrick?
I'm your mother.
I'm your dad.
Yeah,right!
Patrick doesn't even remember who I am.
I got this job -- offer -
- I know.
I took it.
Jack is on a boatresearching whales.
Jack,if we don't get rescued soon hey,we're gonna get out of here.
* I'm breathing I feel my heart beat... *
I'll pass on the vino.
What?
You haven't even tasted it.
Wine from alaska?
Honey,that's like oysters from oklahoma.
Just give it a try.
Ugh.
I'll send you a case of cabernet when I get back to the city.
I can't believe you're leaving in three days.
Don't go.
New york needs me, and by that,I mean my dry cleaner, my mother,and my therapist.
How is Sam doing?
Oh,he seems excited.
If he'king out,he's doing a hell of a job hiding it.
Have you heard from jack?
Uh,no.
But I'm sure he'll call the second his ship-to-shore phone gets back in range.
It's hard,huh?
Yeah.
But I'm getting used to it -- captain's widow and all.
And,hey,look at the sweater I'm making for him.
Oh.
The midriff wool pullover.
You don't see that much.
Want me to make one for sam?
I'm not sure it's a new york look.
Oh,I'm so excited to be in the city with sam.
I'm gonna take him to the mets and the whitney and movie nights in bryant park.
God,I miss bryant park.
Oh.
I mean,I love it in elmo, but would it kill people once in a while to get a little cultural?
Hmm.
Hey,you know what I'm gonna do?
Move back to the city?
I'm going to do a movie night bring a little piece of manhattan to elmo a classic movie under the stars
Elmo's done so much for me.
It'll be nice
Hello?
Not much in the fridge.
I'm sorry.
You'll have to let me know next time you plan on breaking and entering.
Just entering.
The back door was open.
Uh,cash,what are you doing here?
Hey,cash.
Hi,jane.
Can I interest you in a glass of alaska's finest?
Sure.
Box and bear winery -- they make a kick-ass blueberry zin.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
What's going on?
I landed this great roofing gig in town.
I was hoping I could crash here for a couple days.
Cash.
I'll even keep my shirt on if you want me to.
Oh,that's not necessary.
[ Sighs ] Jane,would you excuse us a minute?
You can't just do this.
What's the matter,princess?
I haven't heard from you in weeks, and then all of a sudden,you just show up out of nowhere?
Exciting,huh?
No,it's not fair.
You can't just come and go as you please.
I'm not running a flophouse.
Okay,I get it.
Bye,jane.
Bye,cash.
Bye,princess.
I'm sorry.
You could have at least had him try on the sweater.
Hey.
Hey.
Holy god.
What is that smell?
Me.
I picked up some work today down at the dock,gutting fish.
You're gutting fish now.
Well,bills apparently do not pay themselves.
Is matty still up?
Just went to bed.
Oh,man.
I promised him I'd play him a game of madden football.
It's okay.
I filled in.
Scored like six touchdowns.
Never seen him so impressed.
Huh.
I...may have underestimated what it takes to build a church from the ground up.
Just time.
And money.
I don't have an office.
I don't have a place to meet or to worship.
I mean,I-I don't want to stand on a street corner and preach, but I'm running out of options.
Well,how about moving in here?
Here?
Just temporarily,until things get rolling.
Seriously?
It would be completely chaste.
You could sleep on the couch,save up some money.
And do you think that we can handle that?
Why not?
We're adults.
And what about matty?
He loves having you around,you know that.
And I don't completely hate it.
And you know,maybe this could be my little way of doing god's work,too.
Plus,think how good you'll get at madden football.
When you put it like that,that... so you'll do it?
Yes.
I will.
Thank you,sara.
You're amazing.
Do I really smell?
Unbelievably bad.
Hey -- hey.
Wow!
That's quite a shirt.
Oh,yeah.
Found it in the back of my closet.
It's funky,right?
Funky.
I think I can see the outline of your spleen.
Patrick,what are you doing?
Having a beer.
It's 8:00 A.M. I know.
It's one of the new things I've discovered beer is really good in the morning.
That's disgusting.
What?
I didn't used to burp?
No.
Man,I was missing out.
What a release!
Okay.
Well,here we go -- eggs a la patrick.
What's the matter?
These eggs.
They don't look right.
They're super-runny.
That's how you like them.
Tastes like egg water.
Patrick.
I'm sorry.
I don't like them.
You do.
I did.
I don't anymore.
You know,I appreciate you having me over for breakfast, but if this is gonna work, you're gonna have to start focusing on who i am and not who i was.
Fine.
I'll just put them back on the stove.
Oh,no,no.
I'm good with beer.
Egg-water burps.
Not as good.
* Won't take real long now... * * yeah... *
one for you.
One for you.
One for you.
Oh,good.
Uh-huh.
One for you.
"Movie night." That's rightpeople,the first of many.
Yeah,but we don't have a movie theater.
No,but we have something so much better.
We have the woods,the sky,and the stars.
Oh,you're gonna build a movie theater.
"Movie night under the stars." It'll be just like bryant park.
Exactly.
Outside?
Picture this --a clearing in the woods, a blanket on the ground,a picnic under the stars, as bette davis and joan crawford take turns chewing the scenery.
Oh,it'll be fabulous.
I can hardly wait.
I knew it was on a matter of time before you start classing up this joint,miss frist -- classing it up.
What do you think,mai?
Can I do the concessions?
I guess so.
I'm in.
Okay.
Theresa?
I think it sounds nice.
Ben?
I don't know.
What's to know?
Well,why would I want to go sit on the ground out in the woods to watch a movie?
I mean,they finally got stadium seating at the sitka cineplex,with cupholders.
Buzz:
Plus,it's really been hot out there.
I mean,mosquitos are out in full force.
And who knows what kind of critters you're gonna attract up there with all them pic-a-nic baskets.
It's basically an invitation to a bear mauling.
Yeah,but a bear mauling under the stars.
You guys could not be serious.
You're men -- alaskan men who are not allowed to whine and complain about being outside.
Movie night is happening,and attendance is mandatory.
Okay.
Fine.
I'm in.
Good.
So,which "die hard" movie are you gonna show?
I cannot wait to take u shopping for some new clothes in new york.
Am I gonna have to start dressing like donald trump?
Or P. Diddy.
It's your choice -- the donald or the diddy.
I'm gonna miss this boat.
You could always just park it on the hudson river and live there.
Oh,my god.
I could not be less serious.
Yeah,I got that.
Look at that.
We almost threw out this shirt.
Oh,don'you have like 20 of those?
Yeah,but each one's unique.
Look,this one's missing three buttons, and it's got all these cool holes.
I see.
I guess we shouldn't keep the hamper so close to the trash can.
Guess not.
Almost lost a shirt.
Almost.
Would you pack that for me?
I'm gonna take a shower.
Will do.
Thanks.
You have to take this shirt.
Why?
It's sam's,and I hate it.
Oh,come on.
It's cute and worn-in.
The term is "ratty."
And it is not making the flight to new york.
Are we having a sewing circle?
We're making the screen for the movie.
Ooh,right.
What are we watching?
"Giant." Ah,fun.
Never heard of it.
Really?
It's rock hudson and elizabeth taylor.
I live in alaska and date a pastor.
I don't get out much.
How are you two doing?
I sort of invited him to move in with me.
Wow!
So much for "operation:
No sex." We're still celibate.
It's just so he can save up some money.
Church-building is slow going.
I think it's wonderful you two moved in together.
Wonderful and insane.
Jane.
What?
Imagine living under the same roof as jack and not being able to have sex.
I'm not going to be having sex with him for about nine months.
Besides,this is different.
Eric is a pastor.
Yeah,but sara's not.
I'm with jane.
This could be difficult.
Hi.
Hello.
I'm looking for mr.
Morrissey.
I don't know who that is.
Leonard morrissey?
Sorry.
Leonard cassius morrissey?
Oh,cash.
Yes,I,uh,I do know who that is, but doesn't live here.
Oh,wellthis is his last known address.
His doctors at the hospital are looking for him.
Why are they looking for him?
Mr. Morrissey missed his last couple of appointments, so they sent me over to see if he was okay or in need of transportation to the hospital or anything.
What does he need to go to the hospital for?
I really can't say,but please,if you see him, will you let him know that we came by?
And he can reach us at this number.
Hey,ben.
Has anyone seen cash?
I didn't even know he was back in town.
Yeah,he's roofing the barker place over on elm.
Oh,good.
So he's not dead or anything.
Well,I hope not,'cause that roof is more bowed than my legs.
Barker'S.
Thanks.
Hey,guys
Oh,hi,marin.
Oh,my god.
There he is.
There who is?
My victim -- the boy I almost killed.
Patrick?
The bobby pin!
Does no one remember the bobby pin?
I put the bobby pin in patrick's hair, and that's why he got struck by lightning.
That wasn't your fault.
You are a good woman,theresa.
True.
Uh,can I get a club soda,ben?
Sure thing.
How's he doing?
Not so good.
We all just went swimming down at the dock.
He kind of freaked out.
Freaked out?
How?
He just stood there,watching us.
Nobody could get him to jump in.
But he's always been a very good swimmer.
I know.
It was so sad.
Broke my heart.
Hey,there.
Oh,hey,buzz... dad.
Ah,you always called me "buzz."
You got the next game?
Oh,no,no.
You go ahead.
You don't want to play?
I sort of don't remember if I can.
You were no minnesota fats, but you could play.
Oh,good to know.
I heard about the swimming.
Oh.
Yeah,it's kind of frustrating.
Couldn't remember that either,huh?
Not so much.
People are always telling me what I used to be able to do and what I used to like to do, but I'm not really sure I remember any of it.
Must be a lot of pressure.
I'll say.
I just don't want to make a fool out of myself,you know?
Yeah.
Well,if you have the time and the inclination,
I'd be happy to teach you or,at least, try to help you remember some stuff.
Yeah?
Sure,absolutely.
We could start with pool.
Okay,yeah.
Yeah?
I'd like that.Okay.
Hey,we got next.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Looking for a fiddler.
Huh?
It's a reference -- the roof.
Never mind.
Can I talk to you?
Talk.
Down here.
Kind of grooving up here,princess.
Fine.
But if I fall and break my neck and you have to rush me to the hospital, that'll be quite ironic.
Oh.
It's kind of nice up here.
Yeah,peaceful.
What's up?
So,uh,a woman came by from alaska general looking for you.
Oh?
Said you missed a couple of appointments.
Seems like the doctors are kind of worried about you.
Yeah,it's no big deal.
I'll go next week.
Cash,why are you going to the hospital?
No big deal.
Well,if it's no big deal, then why don't you tell me?
It's just a kidney thing.
What do you mean,"a kidney thing"?
It's no big deal.
It doesn't sound like no big deal.
Then none of your business.
Look,I can't focus with you staring at me likethat.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll go.
Eric:
Ah,thank you,ed.
I really appreciate it.
We'll talk soon.
Okay.
God bless.
How's it going?
That was ed popper from my old church.
I've known him and his wife since before I married them.
They are definitely gonna follow me wherever I land.
So the good news is that i officially have a flock of two.
Now all I need is a church and a choir and about 300 more parishioners.
It's only a matter of time.
I don't know what I'd do without your support.
I really admire what you're doing,eric.
It takes a lot of courage.
Well... you know,I should probably get back to work 'cause I got A... yeah,me too -- well,not work,but let you work.
Yeah,okay.
Okay.
Okay.
I can't believe jack still hasn't called.
Well,he'll call when he can.
You must be so frustrated,though.
I'm okay.
But you haven't heard from him in over a week.
Don't you feel bad?
You have to feel bad.
I would feel terrible.
Well,I wasn't,but I'm starting to.
Oh,sorry.
It's okay,annie.
Here.
What's this?
A list of rules regarding proper behavior and conduct for your movie night.
I expect you to photocopy and distribute to all participants.
Okay.
In addition,I've taken the liberty of photographing the area from multiple angles to ensure that you leave it as pristine as you found it.
If you do not,I'll be forced to impose a stiff fine for which you and you alone will be responsible.
That sounds great,chief celia.
Thank you so much for your help.
Geez,what is with her?
I think she's taking movie night personally because watching old movies was her thing with patrick.
Ohh.
Like how doing mime was my thing with patrick.
Really?
Oh,yeah.
We did it as a stress reliever.
You'd be surprised how being trapped in an invisible box can really calm the nerves.
Well,I'll have to try that sometime.
Now?
Oh,uh,you know,maybe later,when I'm feeling more stress.
Well,I'll be here when you're ready to mime it out... alone with my ex-fianc?
s mother and our memories.
You know,annie,you two are kind of in the same boat.
Maybe you should reach out to her.
Yeah...maybe.
Wait.
What -- what is all this?
Oh,it's nothing.
"Kidney disease"?
"Kidney failure"?
Oh,my god.
Marin,are you sick?
No.
Do you have kidney disease?
Are you dying?
I don't think I can handle this right now.
First patrick and now you -- what is going on?
!
Annie.
Annie,calm down.
It's not me.
It -- it's not?
It's cash.
What's wrong with cash?
I don't know yet.
That's why I'm doing this research.
It's been a very tumultuous year.
I know.
I know.
Thanks for taking all this time with me,buzz.
What's a father for?
How you feeling?
Good.
A little nervous.
Well,that's to be expected, but your pool game came back to you pretty quick,didn't it?
Yeah.
Huh?
I guess it did.
Yeah.
Well,you ready to learn how to swim?
Definitely.
Okay.
All right,now use those arms!
Come on,patrick!
Kick those feet!
Let that sense memory kick in!
Come on,you can do it,patrick!
Kick those legs!
Swim,patrick,swim!
Come on,paddle!
Patrick!
I got you,son.
Here you go.
Thanks for the drowning lesson,buzz!
Patrick.
Patrick?
Hi,chief celia.
These are for you.
Why?
Because I have something I want to ask you.
C-can I come in?
No.
Oh,okay.
Chief celia,you look lovely today.
I'm wearing my uniform.
But it's very flattering.
Are you drunk?
No.
No.
I-I was just wondering if you're not doing anything tonight, maybe you'd like to go with me to movie night?
I have a boyfriend.
All right,he's out of town, but I don't need a date.
I know that.
I-I just figured,since you're not planning on going with patrick to movie night and I'm not planning on going with patrick, we're kind of in the same boat, so maybe you'd like to go together?
You and i are not in the same boat.
Patrick is my son.
I have loved and cared for him all his life.
You were his girlfriend for a year.
Those are very different boats.
So,I-is that a no?
Yes.
* There it goes * hey.
Hey,Sam
I got that same shirt.
Oh,yeah?
See you around.
Say "hi" to jane.
Will do.
Damn.
Hey.
Hey.
I've been looking all over for you.
Well,here I am.
I went to the house you were roofing, but you weren't there.
That's 'cause I'm here.
What's all that?
This is research I have been doing -- kidney research.
Please tell me you have kidney stones.
I don't have kidney stones.
Oh,I was afraid you were gonna say that.
This other stuff is really serious,cash.
I know how serious it is.
You do?
Yes.
Oh.
I,uh,I have degenerative kidney disease.
Oh,my god.
This is why I don't tell people.
Oh,I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
This is terrible.
What -- what did the doctor say?
Look,I'm working so I can pay for the treatment I need.
Okay.
That's good.
Okay,that's a good thing.
Unfortunately,I got fired today.
What?
!
Princess.
Well,sorry.
Yeah.
Apparently,word got out about my condition, and the boss said he had no choice but to let me go.
Too risky.
I don't know how he found out, but I guess you go to the hospital a few times, people are bound to notice.
Oh,cash.
I'll figure it out.
Well,there's got to be something that we can do.
We dot need to do anything.
Okay?
I can handle this.
What?
Do you have some sort of medical degree I don't know about?
I've got it under control.
Well,what does that mean?
What are you gonna do?
Find another job.
Who wants a mai dud?
What is a mai dud?
It's like a milk dud, only not so chewy and demanding.
I made them last night.
First one'free.
Second one's gonna cost you.
I got mai duds... and five kinds of flavored popcorn for movie night.
I'm gonna make a fortune.
Not bad,huh?
Yeah,not bad.
Hey,maybe you and i make a deal.
I'll do exclusive concessions at all your hockey games, and you get a nice cut.
Well,I already have a concessions guy, but if you can undercut him,
I'll think about it.
Good man.
Have another mai dud.
We'll talk.
What did I say?
!
Marin,I am so sorry.
What for?
I had no idea cash would get fired.
Ohh.
This about the kidney thing?
How did you know about the kidney thing?
Did you tell her about the kidney thing?
No.
I heard it from ben.
How did ben know?
He heard it from theresa... how did -- ...who heard it from jerome, who heard it from buzz, who heard it from mai, who might have kind of heard it from me.
Annie.
I am so sorry!
But I only told one person.
A-and if you think about it,you only told one person.
So,in a way,we're both kind of equally innocent or guilty, depending on how you look at it.
So it's my fault that cash got fired?
I'm sorry,marin.
He has no money,no health insurance, and now,thanks to me,no job.
Who wants to try a "mai-ice cream sandwich"?
No,thanks.
No?
Bad timing?
Talking about the kidney thing?
Okay,I'll come back.
* We met on a rainy evening in the summertime... * right on time.
Hey.
God,you look pretty today.
Patrick.
Sorry.
You okay?
You're looking a little blue -- pretty,but blue.
I'm okay.
Is it the cash thing?
Wait.
How
Yes.
That's tough.
I got to do something.
I would loan him the money, but he would never take it.
Maybe you can do some sort of fundraiser or something.
Hey,yeah.
That,patrick,is a fantastic idea.
I'll make movie night a fundraiser for cash.
Cash for cash.
Cash for cash.
And now we're on.
Hello,elmo.
Big news,elmo.
Marin frist's movie night is now a fundraiser.
Okay,we're announcing it.
It's for cash... morrissey.
Cash morrissey.
Now,I don't remember him -- nothing unusual about that -- but I'm sure you all do and would love to help the guy out.
That's right,elmo.
Tonight at movie night, we will be screening the academy award-winning epic "giant."
Not only will you be enjoying one of the most moving and romantic movies of all time, but you will be raising money for a worthy cause.
It's gonna be a giant night all around.
It's gonna be huge!
So come on out,bring your picnic baskets, but more importantly,bring your wallets, 'cause let's face it,elmo, isn't it better to give than receive?
Take off your shirt.
Jane,please,not here.
Give it to me.
But I thought you hated this shirt.
I do,but sam loves it,even more than before, since he saw you looking all cute in yours.
Oops.
Yeah.
Now he wants to wear it tonight at movie night, and I don't want him to discover what a terrible person I am.
We've only been married a few weeks.
It's too soon.
I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.
She runs like a dork.
That's old polo.
He's head vaquero.
He's been here longer than many of us,I guess -- since grandpa benedict's time.
Look at them,honey.
There's never beennything like them in this world,
I can tell you.
Hey,sorry we're late.
Oh,don't worry about it.
I'm so glad you came.
Oh,we wouldn't have missed it.
Oh,ben.
Thanks.
There's plenty of room down front.
Enjoy.
Mai:
Mai duds!
Mai,how's it going?
Oh,pretty good.
Be better next time,though,if we don't allow food.
Then I can really jack up the prices.
Well,I'm sure cash will be very grateful.
Yeah,maybe to you.
Mai duds!
No,good,thanks.
Mai,this is a fundraiser for cash.
Cash for cash,not cash for mai.
That wasn't part of the deal.
Mai.
Okay,fine,but I still got to pay for my labor and expenses.
You "shh!" Shut up!
Shut up!
Sell your goods back there!
Oh,one thing I will not miss about elmo -- my allergies.
Here you go.
What's this?
Oh.
That's mine.
It's a needle... for sewing or knitting or really anything you need a needle for.
You sew?
Constantly,obsessively.
Oh,I live for it.
Okay,that's a lie.
It's marin'S.
She was wearing your shirt when you saw her at the chieftain.
Don't get mad,but I tried to throw it away.
This shirt?
Several times.
The damn thing just won't die.
Why would you do that?
Because I don't like it.
It's old and ripped,and you look like a street urchin.
So you just throw it out and don't tell me?
Well,that was the plan.
Backfire.
You know,I don't like those red pants you wear sometimes, but I would never just throw them away behind your back.
Of course not.
Those pants cost $300.
Thanks.
Hey,you mind if I join you?
Do you want a beer?
Uh,no,thanks.
So,uh,what's this movie about?
It's about people shutting up.
Patrick,about pushing you in the water today --
I could have drowned.
I could never let anything happen to you.
You're my son.
I was just trying to get you to overcome your fear, but it was a mistake,and I'm sorry.
Well,uh,you meant well.
I did.
I really panicked.
You did.
Thanks for saving me.
No problem.
Well,one good thing came out of you losing your memory.
Yeah?
What's that?
Well,it gave me a chance to be the dad I never was.
I know you feel you have to live up to everyone's expectations, but I don't have any expectations.
Not me.
You know,this could be the start of a new beginning for both of us.
I do feel relaxed around you.
Yeah.
I can just be who I want to be.
Yeah.
I can wear cool t-shirts and have a beer for breakfast and burp whenever I feel likeurping.
You can do all that stuff.
I can open up a business teaching dogs to dance.
You can do that stuff,too.
Teaching dogs to dance?
Yeah,I was just spitballing.
No sense sitting alone,hmm?
I agree.
Yeah.
Wine?
Mixed nuts?
Jett!
Hold on a minute.
I want you to take mrs.
Benedict back in with you.
Honey,you go along with jett and get out of all this heat.
Technical difficulties!
Technical problems!
We're good!
I got it oh,come on!
This is what happens when you show a classic on a quilt!
Shh!
I got it.
Cash,hey,how you feeling,man?
What is all this?
It's for you.
Seems like everybody else is trying to get away from here.
Me
- I'm gonna get out of here one of these days.
This is my husband's land.
This is his home.
Hey.
Hey.
What the hell is this?
It's a donation jar.
You know what,marin?
From now on,why don't you just mind your own business?
Okay,the last thing I need is a public pity party.
This isn't a pity party.
These people are your friends.
They care about you.
They want to help.
I don't need their help.
I can take care of myself.
No one said you can'T.
This isn't even about me.
You're just doing this to make yourself feel better.
What?
Marin frist to the rescue, everybody's savior.
Well,what does that mean?
It means that you're always trying to fix people.
Maybe I don't want to be fixed by you.
I can't believe you are reacting like this.
You really ought to learn how to appreciate when somebody tries to do something nice for you.
Hey,if I need something from somebody, I'll ask.
So,why don't you ever ask for it,then?
I did!
I asked if I could stay with you, and you said "no."
Jane:
I'sorry,sam.
I'm sorry I tried to get rid of your shirt.
That was stupid.
The truth is,I don't care what you wear.
You look great in everything... and out of everything.
Well,you look great in those red pants and out of them.
I guess I'm just nervous about moving back to new york with you.
I want it to be perfect, even though I know it's not gonna be.
Throwing out my shirt or my entire wardrobe doesn't change the fact that there are fundamental differences between the two of us.
I know,but our differences are what make us such a good fit for each other.
You believe that,right?
I do,totally.
Me too.
Seriously,$300 for those pants?
* I've had enough of this parade... * knock,knock.
Anybody home?
Cash,are you in there?
I'd really like to talk to you for a minute.
Can I come in?
Can you come out?
Look,I want to apologize for overstepping.
It was presumptuous of me.
But please understand,
I was just trying to do something as your friend.
We're friends,right?
Yeah,we're friends.
Well,normally,with my friends, we talk about everything -- the good stuff and bad.
And when the bad comes,we rally.
That's what we do.
That's what I do.
I-I...rally for my friends.
But if that's not what you want from me, if that's not the kind of friend you want me to be,
I can handle that.
I can mind my own business and keep my mouth shut you know,for the most part.
You're -- you're a private person.
I get that.
I-I respect that.
Are you still apologizing?
Yeah,trying to.
Apology accepted.
Thank you.
Now,as your friend, I was wondering if you would like to stay with me.
Well,I'm no charity case.
No,it's not charity.
I could use a live-in chef, and you're the best cook I know.
Come on.
I'll even keep my shirt on in the house.
All right,just till I finish treatment.
Okay.
Oh.
We raised over $2,000 last night, if you're interested.
Cash for cash,huh?
Catchy,right?
* ...
Closer lean on me now lean on me now closer... * thank you,marin.
You're welcome...
leonard.
* ...
Lean on me now *
Hey.
Oh,hey.
Are you up?
Yeah,getting there.
So,listen,I know this living situation's difficult.
It is much harder than I thought it would be.
I know.
But I-I think I've come up with something -- a solution to our sexual frustration.
Oh,yeah?
Can I interest you in some chamomile?
Please.
Here you go.
Oh,thank you,lenny.
Yeah,how long is this "leonard" thing gonna last?
Mmm,till I get sick of it or it stops bugging you,so neverish.
Marin:
When alaska was just a land of trees, tribes created community through barter -- beads for a fur,a canoe for a cow.
Trading partners became friends.
Friends became family.
As far as I can tell,not much has changed up here.
Buzz:
That's it.
We're still giving and receiving -- an equal trade.
There we go!
It's coming back to you,huh?
Yeah.
When the system is working, both sides come away happy neither feeling like they've compromised but rather,getting something better in the deal
In those moments,we are just a community of people sharing... proving every day that it can be just as fulfilling to give as to receive...
* Make room... * marin: ...
And sometimes,just as hard.
Hey,celia.
I've got some terrible news.
Jack's ship went down in the bering sea, and they rescued survivors
Jack wasn't among them.
MOVING UP
Good morning.
- Good morning, Knud.
- Hi, Manfred.
Allow me.
Aggression response.
It was developed when we lived among animals on the plains.
We fought for our lives.
When we're angry or aggressive we regress to a lower developmental stage.
And we choose fight or flight.
That's all for today.
Remember to hand in your papers next time.
And remember:
The contents, and only the contents, are important.
Forget about colorful layouts.
Right.
Dismissed.
- We're set for the new ass. prof.
- Right.
Poul is starting tomorrow.
- I hope he'll feel welcome.
- Of course.
- We studied together.
- I know.
He's funny.
- He was always in his stocking feet.
- That sounds strange.
Well.
- I'm closing the door.
- Yes.
We regret to inform you that the position as professor has been filled.
I heard.
Have you already heard?
- Sigurdsson got it.
- Where the hell did you hear that?
- I talked to Kaj Brudholm.
- Why the hell did he tell you that?
- I'm head of administration and ...
- What did he say?
- That they'd chosen Sigurdsson.
- Didn't he mention me?
No.
Nothing worth mentioning.
- Nothing worth mentioning?
- He's impressed by your articles.
But?
He still doesn't think you're professorial.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
He used the word 'colorless'.
Colorless?
Do you have to be a drunk to be interesting?
- Do you have to be a drunk?
- Stop it.
You're very talented.
You know that.
Manfred, you're not like all the others.
- That's what I like about you.
- But that's not the point.
It doesn't matter what I am, or what I am not.
It's all about being in the limelight, being pushy and sucking up to the right people.
Hey!
Let me through!
Don't you know what a bell means?
- I think you're taking it well.
- What?
It's not easy being rejected like that.
That's not how I see it.
- Then how do you see it?
- I wasn't meant to go to Aarhus.
- How's that?
- I'm not a careerist.
You've always wanted to be a professor.
It's just a title.
They're a bunch of narcissists.
I'm not like that.
I have different values.
If I were a professor, we wouldn't have much time together.
And that's why -
- I've decided not to go to the conference in Aarhus.
Oh, no.
Why?
It's all small talk and brownnosing.
It's so superficial.
It's usually fun.
I'm going.
We could've had a nice weekend.
- Can't you stay in Copenhagen?
- No, I have to talk to some people.
I see.
It's a very popular event.
It's overbooked.
I know.
I've been to several of them, and I don't think I'm missing anything.
- Then I'll give your place away.
- Fine.
Let someone else benefit.
- Now your name has been deleted.
- Good.
Eva!
Yes?
- Have you seen my extension cord?
- Sorry, I forgot.
- Gundesboll borrowed it.
- He borrowed it?
- Why?
He has his own.
- He said his was too short.
- For what?
- I don't know.
Gundesboll?
I heard you took my cord ...
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Knud.
What the hell was he thinking?
- He must have been miserable.
- Who isn't?
- But we don't hang ourselves at work.
- We had no idea he was suicidal.
- It's extremely alarming.
- Making that statement was alarming.
- Statement?
- Now he wants me to feel guilty.
- He's punishing me.
- I don't think so.
Yes?
Come in, Therese.
- How are you, Manfred?
- Okay.
Knud, he left this on his desk.
"To Knud."
"Dear Knud.
I've let you and the department down."
"I can't live with myself anymore." Yes, we realize that.
"Please extend my apologies to Professor Pjotr Levski in Prague."
I don't fucking believe this.
- What does it say?
- I don't fucking believe this.
- Knud, what is it?
- I don't fucking believe this.
- He cribbed his articles.
- What?
First there was Niels Jensen's little trick with his doctorate.
Then Mogens Mogensen's affairs with clients, and now this.
I work my butt off here and now I'll be reprimanded by the vice chancellor.
It's not fair.
The vice chancellor called this morning.
- Is he still angry?
- Rather.
Be glad you're an ass. prof.
- And not head of the department.
- Is it that bad?
Sometimes I feel more like a dustman than a psychologist.
Knud.
Let me know if there's anything I can do.
You can behave yourself.
I can't take any more scandals.
Of course.
Depression.
A state of mind characterized by a low vocal pitch insomnia, lack of energy and severe self-recrimination.
Any questions or comments?
- Yes, Kasper?
- I was wondering ...
I have no idea.
- What do you think?
- I don't wallow in tragedies.
And neither should you.
Please hand in your papers.
- Shouldn't you talk to someone?
- No, that's not necessary.
- Are you sure?
- I'm fine.
How about going to my place, hanging out tonight?
- Okay.
That's fine.
- I'd like that.
Manfred.
Can I ask you a question?
Are you going to apply for the job?
The professorship?
Gundesboll's professorship?
- The man just ...
- You're an obvious choice.
But ...
What?
Can I help you?
It's me.
Don't you recognize me?
Poul.
I'll be damned.
Manfred.
- How are you?
- Fine.
Fine.
- How about you?
- I'm good.
Fantastic.
Berkeley is a fantastic university.
Amazing.
- I thought you went to Iowa.
- I did at first.
Then I was at UCLA, and I was at Harvard, too.
As a guest lecturer.
- Why did you come home?
- My wife, Marianne, wanted to.
- Also for our daughter's sake.
- How old is she?
Five.
- That's cute.
- She is cute.
Do you have kids?
- No, not yet.
- You?
- No, me neither.
- Get going.
- It's absolutely fantastic.
- Some people say so.
- Are you glad to be back?
- Very much so.
Everything's much more simple here.
- Competition is rough in the US.
- And there are more competitors.
Won't there be a lack of challenges here?
Not right away.
I also have a report to finish.
- What kind of report?
- It's for the Ministry of Health.
It might be published internationally.
It's fantastic.
Oxford is interested.
Sorry.
Something got caught ...
Thanks, Poul.
In the back of my throat.
What do you think of him?
He's nice.
And funny.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Do you need any help?
- No thanks.
Is it that bad, Knud?
Yes.
After the supervisory committee heard about Gundesboll they chose to put us under close supervision.
- What does that mean?
- That the vice chancellor is furious.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- He demands a plan of action.
We have to reestablish our credibility and prove that we take the situation seriously.
Of course.
I thought you'd like to make a suggestion for that plan of action.
I'd like to hear your ideas.
- Give it some thought.
- I certainly will.
We need more of your kind here.
Why did I hire Gundesboll?
I should have seen through him.
I won't make that mistake again.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes.
Are you applying for the professorship?
- Gundesboll's?
- Yes.
- I haven't thought about it.
- I promise you ...
Make a good plan of action.
Then I'll look ...
How should I put it?
I'll look favorably on your application.
I have a lot of clout.
The dean follows my lead.
- I didn't know that.
- Oh, yes.
The question is whether you're ready.
I'll look forward to your plan of action.
And Manfred ...
- This talk is strictly confidential.
- That goes without saying, Knud.
Knock, knock.
Come in, Manfred.
- Would the ass. prof. like a coffee?
- How nice of you.
Thanks.
- You haven't wasted any time.
- No.
- I haven't.
I've been busy.
- Yes.
- Are you still working on bulimia?
- No.
It's been cutters lately.
- Yuck.
- I'm doing a survey for the Ministry.
- So you said.
- Right.
Sorry.
Take a look at this.
I've done over 500 interviews.
I had two assistants.
It took over two years to collect the data.
This is the most comprehensive survey of its kind in the world.
That's ...
When does the report have to be done?
- In three weeks, so ...
- Interesting.
There's plenty to do.
What about you?
Depression, right?
Yes.
The last few years I've worked on a big project on tackling anger.
- Anger management.
- Sort of.
I have my own method.
Let me know if you need articles.
I have a huge network in the US.
- It's at your disposal.
Let me know.
- That sounds great.
- We should help each other.
- I really think so.
- Are you set on returning to the US?
- No.
I don't think so.
I see.
I'd prefer a professorship here in Copenhagen.
- Yes.
- That's all we dream about, right?
Nah.
You can't count on it.
You can't base your life on it.
- What about the dead professor?
- Gundesboll?
- Yes.
It's sad.
- His position has been advertised.
- I didn't know.
- It's right here.
Take a look.
- Yes, so it is.
- Are you going to apply?
No, I don't think so.
I don't think so.
No, I don't think so.
Well, see you later.
- Thanks for the coffee.
- You're welcome.
We were having coffee and talking.
We haven't seen each other for ages, so he talked about America and I talked about my projects.
Then he shows me pictures of cutters.
Suddenly, out of the blue, he says he's applying for the professorship.
- It's too much.
- I've heard they want a foreigner.
- I haven't heard that.
- Many people have said so.
- And preferably a woman.
- I don't think so.
- Why not?
- I just don't.
Do you know something?
- Maybe.
- What have you heard?
- Promise not to tell anyone?
- Of course.
No, I can't tell you.
Knud asked me.
- What do you mean 'asked'?
- He wants me to apply.
- You're kidding.
- I talked to him today.
He says I'm an asset to the department.
Really?
But you don't want to be a professor.
- I didn't mean it like that.
- Oh ...
- I thought you said ...
- This is damn disappointing.
- Aren't you happy for me?
- Yes, I'm very happy.
I think it's wonderful.
Manfred, dear.
Let's celebrate.
A glass of wine.
Do you have any?
I have a bottle of whisky.
- I'm very proud of you.
- Let's see how things go.
- Isn't it definite?
- Yes, but I have to apply.
It's just a formality.
Let me know if there's anything I can do.
Here.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
This is strictly confidential.
Of course, dear.
I'm crazy about you, Manfred.
You and your clever head.
What's this then?
My goodness.
Christ!
Wake up, Therese.
You have to leave now.
- Come on.
- What time is it?
It's late.
Yes?
- Can I come in?
- Of course.
- Working late?
- Sometimes it's necessary.
- What are you working on?
- Just some ideas.
- An article?
- It's something internal.
What's it about?
- It's confidential.
- Sorry.
- I wanted to show you this.
- What is it?
- I found it in a packing box.
- Christ, it's the two of us.
From when we got the traveling scholarship in 1990.
- Do you remember the trip?
- Yes.
Vienna.
The source.
Yeah.
We wanted to help people.
- And understand ourselves.
- Exactly.
That's a long time ago, Poul.
- I often think about that trip.
- Me too.
Really.
You can keep it.
- No.
- Yes, it's for you.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
It's yours.
Thanks.
I've written something on the back.
"Dear Manfred.
From your old friend and colleague."
"With the memory of and hope for a good time."
- I won't disturb you any longer.
- It's no problem.
Yes.
- Hi, Manfred.
- Am I interrupting?
- Come in.
- I can come back later.
- Have you worked something out?
- Yes.
- Is this okay?
- In front of Poul?
I've told him about the problems.
We were just talking about it.
- Okay.
- Let me see it.
What the department needs is an ethical code.
An ethical code.
An ethical code.
Something that indicates that we take the situation seriously.
And something that can change our image in the media.
I've chosen to call the plan of action 'Clean Hands'.
- Clean Hands.
- Yes.
That's interesting.
What do you think, Poul?
I like it.
It's serious and unpretentious.
As researchers we should sign an ethical code of practice which will be included in our contracts.
Take a look, Poul.
- This looks really good, Manfred.
- It's damn good.
I'll present it to the vice chancellor at 2 pm.
- Do you have time to accompany me?
- At 2 pm?
I have a class then.
So perhaps ...
- I'd prefer that there were two of us.
- I can cancel ...
No, no.
You mustn't do that.
No, no.
- It'll be fine.
- Can I help?
- Yes.
Do you have time?
- I'm free this afternoon.
- If you don't mind, Manfred.
- Not at all.
Good.
That's a deal.
Poul will come.
- Well done, Manfred.
- Thanks.
Well done.
Anything else?
- Manfred!
- What?
- Are you eavesdropping?
- No, I was just ...
It's not illegal, is it?
The three moral feelings.
Does anyone know them?
Kasper can't be the only one who knows.
Come on.
- Kasper?
- Embarrassment, shame and guilt.
That's correct.
- Hi, Knud.
- Hi.
- Sorry I couldn't go with you.
- No problem.
Poul did.
- How did it go?
- It was great.
- We just have to follow the plan.
- Really?
I have some more ideas I'd like to present to you.
- Could the two of us meet?
- It's not a good time.
- When would be a good time?
- We can talk about it in Aarhus.
- Aarhus?
- Yes, at the conference.
Are you going to the conference?
Of course.
Aren't you?
- Yes, indeed.
- Then we'll get together over there.
This is Ass.
Prof. Manfred Finnemand from the Department of Psychology.
Do you remember that we talked recently?
No.
- I cancelled my attendance.
- Yes.
- And now I've changed my mind.
- What do you mean?
I'd like to attend.
The conference is overbooked.
But I was invited ...
I'm sorry.
We have an event in the fall ...
Put me through to Kaj Brudholm.
- He's in Poland.
- Could I have his cell phone number?
No, sorry.
Would you like to attend the event this fall?
Shit.
- So you're off?
- Yes.
- Have fun.
- Thanks.
- It's a pity you aren't coming.
- It's just a conference.
Everyone will be there.
It's stupid not to go, dear.
I'll be fine on my own.
- Goodbye, dear.
- Have a good trip.
See you on Monday.
- Therese?
- Hello?
- It's me.
- I can't hear you.
- It's me.
Manfred.
- Hi.
- Are you having fun?
- Is that you, Manfred?
- I asked if you're having fun.
- Yes.
It's too bad you're not here.
- Are you at a party?
- Yes.
Poul was my dinner partner.
- He's in a festive mood.
- Who did Knud sit next to?
He sat on Poul's other side.
They just sang a duet on stage.
- A duet?
- What?
- I said it sounds like fun.
- What did you want?
- Nothing in particular.
- I can't hear you, Manfred.
- I said nothing in particular.
- What?
- Forget it.
- What did you say?
See you on Monday.
Bye.
Where were you?
I decided to stay home and work on 'Clean Hands'.
- That wasn't part of the plan.
- No, but I had some good ideas.
I'd like to present them to you in the conference room at 2 pm.
- Okay.
It sounds impressive.
- Do you have time?
That'll be fine.
- What's that?
- Danish pastry.
- I asked you to buy cinnamon rolls.
- They ran out.
- Fuck!
Knud eats cinnamon rolls.
- They were sold out.
- Then go to another bakery.
- I'm very sorry.
But I don't think a Danish pastry will kill Knud.
- Bon appetit.
- Thanks.
- I'm all set in the conference room.
- Excellent.
- I'm anxious to hear your thoughts.
- It will be interesting.
- Manfred.
What time was it?
- 2 pm.
- Right.
See you later.
- Fine.
- Coffee?
- Just a little.
- There's Danish pastry.
- No cinnamon rolls?
- No.
- No matter.
- I'm on a diet anyway.
- I'll have one.
I still have a headache.
Can we proceed?
Of course.
I've continued working on 'Clean Hands'.
I've added some things I'd like you to see.
Here we go.
Is the projector working?
Yes.
As you can see, I've given it some thought.
Yes, I can see that.
The problem is that I've given the project to Poul.
Why did you do that?
It was easier.
He was at the meeting with the vice chancellor.
And we talked about it in Aarhus.
- But it's my project.
- Yes, but now I've given it to Poul.
- What about all my work?
- Give it to Poul.
He'll definitely be very pleased.
It's just paper-pushing, Manfred.
Knud!
Knud!
Yes?
Do we still have a deal?
What do you mean?
- About my application.
- What about it?
We ...
Don't you remember?
Remember what?
- Knud gave 'Clean Hands' to Poul.
- What do you mean?
Poul will finish the ethical code.
Wasn't it his idea?
What?
It was my idea!
- That's just what I heard.
- Where?
- That's the rumor in the halls.
- In the halls?
Yes.
It was my idea!
Manfred.
Dear, take it easy.
It's just an extra workload.
It's not an extra workload.
Knud said that if I made a good plan of action he would look favorably on my application for the professorship.
Oh.
- That's not what you said before.
- No.
But you have to help me.
Find out the lie of the land regarding my application.
If I asked Knud about that, he would find it suspicious.
- I'd do the same for you, Therese.
- I can't.
Do you like me at all?
Of course I do.
You know that.
No, actually I don't.
Because then you'd do it for me.
I'd do it for you.
Just a minute.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Am I interrupting something?
- No, we're just ...
Hi, Therese.
Thanks for helping me with my bowtie.
What do you want, Poul?
Are you okay with me taking over 'Clean Hands'?
That's fine.
Good.
That's what Knud said, but I wanted to be sure.
- It's quite alright.
- Our working together is important.
Yes, indeed.
I just wanted to say that.
See you.
Hi.
- Where are all the others?
- Many have switched.
- Switched to what?
- Poul Sondergaard's class.
Well, that's up to them.
God damn it!
Typical.
- Morning, Eva.
- Morning.
- Hi.
- Hi, Poul.
- Thanks for bringing in my mail.
- You're welcome.
- Morning, Poul.
- Someone from the Data Board called.
- Was her name Anita?
- Yes.
- That woman is driving me crazy.
- Who is she?
A meddlesome woman that keeps harassing me.
- What does she want?
- She supervises my data.
- And she's extremely thorough.
- When is the report due?
- Next Tuesday.
- That's soon.
- I'm looking forward to reading it.
- I'm looking forward to the reviews.
I'm going to get a coffee.
- How about you?
- Yes, please.
I'd like one too, please.
- Jesus H. Christ.
- What?
You have a lovely student worker.
My goodness.
Yes.
- There are three candidates.
- Three?
You, Poul and a Norwegian.
- Who's the Norwegian?
- I don't know.
But don't worry.
Knud calls him 'the mountain monkey'.
He hates Norwegians.
Thank God.
What did he say about me?
Not very much.
But what?
He mostly talked about Poul.
- Knud is very keen on him.
- What did he ...?
And he's impressed with what he's done with 'Clean Hands'.
How can he take all the credit for that?
But Knud hasn't made up his mind.
He's waiting till next Tuesday.
- Next Tuesday?
- Yes.
He didn't say why.
It's the report.
Everything I've done the last 20 years doesn't count.
But some silly report about teenage cutters will settle the matter.
- It's grotesque.
- Yes, it is.
But you could make a bigger effort.
- And how should I do that?
- Be a bit more active.
Active?
What do you mean?
I'm doing my job.
You could position yourself better.
- What position should I assume?
- You know what I mean, dear.
No, actually I don't.
And don't call me dear when you don't mean it.
Where did that come from?
Why can't you leave me alone?
Because I'm fond of you.
Then don't be.
I can't stand it.
Thank you.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes.
Are you applying for the professorship?
No.
Why?
I've applied for it.
- And I think I'm going to get it.
- I see.
I've talked to Knud, and he says ...
It sounds like he's decided to give it to me.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
I'm going this way.
See you.
- This seems very messy.
- Yes.
I'm just as flabbergasted.
- Good morning.
- I'm glad to see you.
This is Anita.
- Manfred Finnemand.
- She's here to supervise the data.
I'm closely supervising it.
The department doesn't have a spotless past.
- What's happened?
- The thing is ...
I had a black box full of raw data in my office.
It's gone.
It's very unfortunate and strange.
It's gone.
This man has seen the box.
You know I had the box in my office.
What do you mean, Poul?
- I don't remember that.
- Manfred.
Stop it.
You remember the day I arrived.
We talked about my survey.
- I showed it to you.
- I haven't seen any box.
This is getting ridiculous.
First of all, it's irresponsible and illegal according to the Data Law to have a box of sensitive information lying around in an office.
I know.
I've tried to get it properly stored.
And secondly, and this is even more serious it seems like the box never existed, which is punishable.
Are you accusing me of falsifying data?
I have to take the matter further.
Take it easy.
We'll work it out.
I'm sure the cleaners took it.
- The box is in the department.
- Then find it and call me.
For now, you have to verify that I've been here.
- Do you have a pen?
- Will that one do?
- Thank you.
- What happens now?
The department will hear from us.
Thank you.
- Is that necessary?
- I'm afraid it's standard procedure.
Bye.
For Christ's sake, Manfred, you must remember seeing that box.
Sorry, but I can't.
I'm sorry, Poul.
What was that about?
What a meddlesome bitch.
- She's just doing her job.
- Yes, but still ...
I'll be out on my ear when Knud hears about this.
- What makes you think so?
- I just know it.
I drew up the ethical code.
Knud will have to suspend me.
We'll find the box.
Did you put it in the storage room?
I'm sure it was in my office.
I'm positive.
It's strange that Manfred can't remember it.
What do you mean?
- Maybe he's the one who took it.
- Manfred would never do that!
This is Eva.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Yes.
Of course.
I will.
- Who was it?
- Knud.
He wants to see you now.
- He certainly doesn't waste time.
- It'll be fine.
Congratulations on the professorship, Manfred.
Welcome to the club.
Thank you, Knud.
Thank you, Knud.
- You can't be a professor.
- Why not?
- You know perfectly well why.
- No.
Why?
Sorry.
It was ...
Freud said ...
That it isn't possible to ...
I'm not myself.
You can't interpret a dream ...
We have to ...
Where was I?
I was on my way to your office.
Have you heard?
Knud sent Poul home.
He's been suspended.
They suspect him of fabricating his data.
He claims it was stolen.
Knud is livid.
He was counting on Poul to replace Gundesboll.
Don't you see what this means?
- Don't you?
- Yes.
- Eva?
- Oh, God.
Hi, Manfred.
Where is the Madrid report?
Right there.
Great.
- Eva, come in here for a moment.
- What for?
- I want to talk to you.
- About what?
Just get in here!
- Is something wrong?
- Sit down.
- What were you doing in here?
- Getting the report.
That's not true.
It's not true!
Yes, it is.
I have to fire you.
Why?
- Due to lack of confidence.
- You can't do that.
Can't we talk about it?
No, I've made up my mind.
Manfred, I'm very fond of my job.
Please pack your things.
I'm sorry it had to end this way.
I'm sorry.
I do like you.
But when you abuse my trust, it's your own fault.
I don't have any choice.
Clear your desk.
- Hello?
- It's me.
- Hi, Knud.
- Would you come to my office?
- Yes, what's it about?
- I'll tell you when you get here.
- Is it about Poul?
- Yes.
How did you know?
- I was just guessing.
- Come on up.
I want to discuss it.
Yes, of course.
I'll be right there.
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.
- Poul says his raw data was stolen.
- So I heard.
It's absurd.
I wouldn't go that far.
I've seen a thing or two in my time.
Why would I do that?
We're old friends.
No one has accused you, Manfred.
No.
Did you do it?
That's what I mean.
I'd never do that, Knud.
- You know me, Knud.
- Yes.
That's why I'm offering you the professorship.
I talked to the evaluation committee this morning.
And we agreed to ask you.
- Really?
- What do you say?
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.
Thanks very much, Knud.
- What will happen to Poul?
- He's finished.
Finished?
How?
He'll never work at a university again.
I promise you that.
Yes?
- Poul?
- Am I interrupting something?
No, come in.
What do you want?
I mean ...
- I wanted to congratulate you.
- Thank you.
- This is for you.
- My goodness.
That's nice of you.
Are things going well?
Yes ...
I can't come to your inaugural lecture.
I'd like to but Knud won't let me, so ...
That's alright.
How are you doing?
It's totally absurd, Manfred.
I can't figure out what happened.
It torments me.
I wish I could help.
Why can't you remember that I showed you the questionnaires?
What do you mean?
The day I started, you and I talked in my office.
I told you about my report.
I simply can't remember, Poul.
Why are you lying to me, Manfred?
I'm your friend.
- You have to leave now.
- Not until you explain.
Leave now.
Since you started here, you've fucked everything up for me.
Since day one, you've sucked up to Knud.
And you've fondled every woman in the department.
And you've tried to take credit for my work with 'Clean Hands'.
My hard work on 'Clean Hands'.
- I've never seen this side of you.
- My hard work on 'Clean Hands'.
Good luck.
Manfred?
Manfred.
Manfred?
What are you doing?
It's after two.
- I can't.
- Why are you lying on the floor?
- I can't go down there.
- You have to.
Everyone's waiting.
Get up.
I'm frightened, Therese.
Nonsense.
Now get up.
There you go.
- It's my fault that Poul was fired.
- No, it isn't.
- Yes.
- Poul messed up.
You know that.
I ruined his data.
What?
I took the interviews and happened to put them in the paper shredder.
I see.
Is "I see" all you can say?
What do you want me to say?
Pull yourself together.
You've been working towards this for years.
- But I haven't deserved it.
- Let me tell you something, dear.
No one deserves what they have.
You just have to enjoy what you get.
Do you understand?
After your tremendous lecture -
- I feel sure that the department will benefit from your expertise.
While you've worked diligently in your field you also have an unshakeable integrity and commitment to the department.
Let these traits be an example to others.
One example is the ethical code 'Clean Hands'.
An important job that's reestablished the department's reputation in a difficult time.
If anyone deserves this, it's you, Manfred.
Congratulations on your professorship.

-What's up, man?
-Hey.
-Oh, my God.
-How you doing?
Oh, my God.
-Hey.
-Hey.
How are you?
Good, good.
Can't complain.
This is crazy.
I'm sorry.
This is nuts.
I lust watched Blown _way this week, so I'm like....
Okay.
Did you like it?
Yeah.
No, I did.
I thought it was really well done and everything.
I thought it was cool.
Yeah.
Good.
You were awesome.
I mean....
What?
I said you were awesome.
Cool.
What?
I'm sorry.
I'll bet you get that all the time.
I'll be quiet.
Sorry.
No, I don't.
What are you talking about?
What.. .?
Okay.
Whatever, man.
Are you gonna go to Carol's later tonight?
You know Carol?
That's....
How do you know Carol?
I'm going to her....
What the fuck is your problem?
I dated Carol for two years, man.
I'm Zach.
Yeah, I know Carol.
-Oh!
Oh, my God.
-What is wrong with you?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I thought you were Forest Whitaker.
I'm sorry.
What?
You know the actor?
Forest Whitaker?
Yeah, I know who Forest Whitaker is.
-See, he was in Blown _way.
-l know he was in Blown _way.
So I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have thought you were Forest Whitaker.
No, you shouldn't have thought I was Forest Whitaker.
I'm not even black.
Yeah, I shouldn't have thought you were Forest Whitaker 'cause I lust came back from the doctor's office, and he lust told me that I have this disease where l think that everybody is Forest Whitaker.
I'm so stupid.
I don't know.
You lust came from the doctor just now, and yet you still thought I might be him?
Yeah, well, I thought the odds were crazy.
-But I don't know.
-What's up, guys?
Hey -- Oh, my God!
You guys going to Carol's?
Busted!
Did you hear us?
We were lust talking about you.
See, my friend and I had this little confus--
Oh, my God!
What the...?
is this some kind of weird cloning thing?
Okay.
Get it together.
You lust came back from the doctor, and he said you have a disease where you think everybody is Forest Whitaker.
So that means....
You're not the real Forest Whitaker.

Do that thing where you grab the tip of your penis really hard.
Okay, King.
No, no, no, no.
Be gone, court jester.
Not even your tomfoolery could turn this frown upside down.
My liege, what is the problem?
What wind could calm your restless soul?
You have every earthly desire at your fingertips.
You have the finest drink and entertainment in the land, and yet you are morose.
I am morose!
I long for the touch of a maiden.
We have maidens by the score that would tend to your every desire.
No, no. I long for the touch of a maiden of the sea.
For ages I've sent my finest fleets to the end of the seven oceans.
And yet every spring they return to me empty-handed.
Your Highness, perhaps the tales of these merwomen have been exaggerated and the sailors who have seen them have been deceived by their own eye.
Nonsense.
Who is this man?
That man is Captain Maximilian Crunch of the Ottoman Empire.
Our cursed enemies!
Yes, but also the greatest sailor known to man or wolf.
I come with a gift, a peace offering between our two nations.
I have seen this mermaid.
Captain Crunch, you've seen one of the mythical merwomen?
Not only have I seen this mermaid, but I've brought one here today.
You toy with me!
I do not.
My land offers her to you.
I present Ariel of the sea.
Oh, my God.
She is gorgeous!
Her eyes shimmer like the seas.
Her hair flows like the oceans.
And her breasts swell like the ocean.
Uh, Your Highness, I think that's a manatee.
Silence!
Do not offend the most beautiful creature I have ever seen, that will one day be my queen.
No. I'm being serious.
I think that's an actual manatee.
They lust put a wig on it.
Egads!
There are barnacles stuck on her.
Yeah.
Probably because she's a manatee.
Manatees get barnacles stuck to 'em.
Oh!
She's been assaulted!
A scar runs the length of her body.
Probably from a motorboat.
Manatees tend to get hit by motorboats.
Fear not, fair Ariel, for my nation will offer you protection.
For millennia -- nay, trillennia -- l've dreamed of meeting one of these mythical merwomen, for my body to merge with hers as one so that we might usher forth a new generation of sea-land men
that might one day inherit the world.
Ariel, will you be my bride and welcome my advances?
Joyous!
Let us commence here on the floor.
Your Highness, please stop.
I think the Ottomans are playing a trick on you.
Let him do it.
Ariel, may I begin by touching you sexually?
Your Highness, I beg you.
Please do not finger-bang that manatee.
Silence!
The king needs privacy.
Your Highness, look, look!
He's got a camera.
He's taking pictures.
Hey, guys, look.
Trumeter fell asleep at his desk.
What an asshole.
[ Laughter ]
-We should totally mess with him.
-Yeah.
We should throw his computer down the stairs.
No, we should punch him in the face.
Hey, you know what we should do is we should use a book idea.
We should hit him in the nuts with a book.
No, no, no, no.
I read in a book that if you whisper suggestions to people while they sleep, you can affect their dreams.
-Whoa!
-Yeah.
-Can we make him gay?
-No, no, no.
But you can do all kinds of crazy stuff to him in his dreams.
Oh.
Can we make him gay in his dreams?
No, dude.
Can we hit him in the nuts in his dreams?
No.
Guys.
Watch me.
Here we go.
All right, Trumeter.
It's your first day of skydiving.
And you're up next to jump out of the plane.
Here we go.
You're gonna jump in 3.
1, 2, 3!
You're out of the plane.
You're falling.
Oh, it's so beautiful.
This is the most fantastic experience you've ever had.
You feel the wind in your hair.
Right?
It's great.
Now, get ready to pull your chute.
Here we go.
You're gonna pull the cord in 3.
1, 2, 3!
Oh!
Oh, no!
It didn't work!
Your chute didn't open!
You keep falling and falling!
You're so scared!
You're so scared that you start to pee your pants.
You start peeing your pants.
You lust keep peeing and peeing and falling and falling.
There's some other dude falling beside you, and he's super hot.
No, dude.
Come on.
You're falling and peeing and falling.
Oh, no, Darren.
Here comes the ground.
What are you gonna do?
You're gonna hit it.
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
3, 2, 1!
Splat!
His head exploded!
Scatter!
We made his head blow up.
-Did anyone see us?
-Do you know what this means?
They're gonna suspend us with no pay.
No, this means we can physically affect objects in the real world by manipulating people's dreams.
They're not gonna let us have lunch in the office anymore.
Shut up!
I've got an idea.
How long do you think it'll take you to pass out?
Not long.
-Here.
Let me press on your neck.
-Okay.
-All right.
-Okay, he's out.
Sam, you're outside of a bank.
You walk towards it.
You go inside.
-You're gay.
-Shut up!
You go into the vault.
You grab two big bags full of million-dollar bills.
And you come back to the office where you hide them in the file cabinet next to the microwave.
It lust does that.
It just does that.
-Scatter.
-Yeah.
No one can know that we have this power.
I know.
I'm serious.
Don't tell anybody about this.
I won't. I don't want to have to eat in the cafeteria.
Okay.
So mum's the word.
Honey, I'm home.
I had a weird day.
She was sleeping.
Good.
So was the kid.
Why does everybody go to bed so early in this house?
So you see, as soon as the Mayflower arrived, the Indians immediately attacked the boats, saying, "You've got to fight us, or we'll go back to Europe and rape all your babies."
-Hello, Margaret.
-Who are you?
I am the fairy of womanhood.
Oh, no!
That's right.
Today is your special day.
-You mean...?
-Yes.
Today's the day I turn on your womb.
Not now. I'm in the middle of social studies.
Oh, Margaret.
Womanhood waits for no one.
Now spread those legs 'cause here we go!
Wait!
No!
Stop!
Margaret, do you have a problem with our forefathers' treatment of the savages?
-No.
-Good.
All right, now, these godless assholes had the nerve...
All right.
Let's clear out those cobwebs and fire up those ovaries.
Listen, fairy, I don't want to become a woman here in the middle of class.
Could we at least wait till I get home?
Oh, Margaret, there's nothing to be nervous about.
The shedding of one's uterine lining is a symbolic transition from childhood to adulthood.
Nothing could be more natural.
Now, here I go!
Wait, no!
Oh!
Margaret.
That wasn't very nice.
Now, spread those legs and accept your fate.
No, you'll never get me!
Never!
What's happening to me?
Oh, my God!
It's not going to be that bad.
Now stop making me angry.
You'll never get me.
Never.
Margaret, what's going on around here?
Who are you?
I'm rationality.
Rationality?
That's right, Margaret.
Don't you think it's a little pointless to try and avoid an inevitable part of growing up?
Yeah, I guess so.
Every woman has to menstruate.
It's a part of life.
And besides, there are plenty of cool things to come along with growing up, like wearing makeup, driving cars, or getting dick.
I suppose.
Don't fight Mother Nature.
Just relax and bleed.
Okay.
Thank you, rationality.
Good-bye, Margaret.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Rationality.
Will I ever see you again?
I'm afraid not.
You can't have both.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Rationality.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Rationality.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Rationality.
Good-bye.
Well, I see no one showed up for the first day of ninja school.
Or did they?
Oh, you must be our new "haybenar" guy.
Yes, AR guy.
Matthew Williams.
So are there any new bands I should know about?
I have some good news and some bad news for you.
Only good news, I hope.
Well, the good news is that I found this amazing new band.
That's great.
They're young, they're good-looking, they're talented.
They have a sound all their own.
They're kind of like a cross between the Beatles and the Arcade Fire with a hip-hop twist.
All those things make money.
Yes, I know, I know.
And what's even better is that they want to sign with us.
-We're their first choice.
-Well, let's sign 'em.
Here's the thing, though.
The name of the band is Our Label Is Run By Homos.
But then people would think that we're....
-l know.
-But we're not!
I know.
Well, they will have to change their name.
That's the one point they won't move on, sir.
Okay.
Let me get this straight.
If we were to sign this band....
Our Label Is Run By Homos.
We'd have to put out T-shirts and CDs and posters that say....
Our Label Is Run By Homos.
This better make a lot of money.
-Whoo!
-Yeah!
Yeah!
Whoo!
We'd like to thank everyone for coming out to our CD-release party.
-Whoo!
-Yeah!
And to all our fans and all the press that's here, we couldn't have done it without you.
And without further ado, I'd like to introduce the head of our label,
Mr. Jim Gibblecost.
-Jim!
-Gibblecost!
Whoo!
[ Applause ]
Thank you.
I'd like to thank the members of the press for coming out this evening.
We're very excited to be working with this particular band.
They've got a great sound.
And we're very proud to be in business with...
Our Label Is Run By Homos.
[ Laughter ]
And I hear a lot of snickering.
So I'd like to take this moment to point out that the band's name is just a name.
It has nothing to do with myself or any of my colleagues at our fine label.
So without further ado, I present to you their debut CD:
[ Laughter ]
And I'd like to take a moment and reiterate that this is lust the name of the CD.
We have no control over what they title things.
That was in their contract.
Now, the CD itself has 12 cuts on it of various titles.
And the first single has been getting a lot of positive publicity from the --
-What's the single's name?
-Yeah.
What's the single's name?
The first single is titled...
"l'm Really Sorry I Keep Lying About Being Gay.
I'm Just Really Concerned About How People Will Take It,
So I've Called This Press Conference and Am Using This Band and CD
As Sort of an Excuse to Test the Waters."
[ Laughter ]
And again, I know this sounds particularly specific, and this may be confusing.
And I want to make sure everybody understands this because I see a lot of the press is frantically writing stuff down.
We do not have control over --
Mate, be brave.
Come on, now.
You know what's going on here.
Excuse me.
Yes?
Rick Simmons.
Rolling Stone magazine.
What are some other track names?
Read him some more names, mate.
Yeah.
Read them.
[ Laughter ]
Umm....
Well, there's....
"So, Seriously, What Do You Guys Think?
Will You Still Respect Me, and Can I Drop This Charade?"
Which, again, is lust a name.
There's... .
Nope.
Nope.
"l've Known For a While Now, Since Secondary School, but I've Been in Denial."
Which is silly.
I think we all know what they're doing.
It's the same thing over and over.
It's not very funny.
I don't think anyone here finds it funny.
-Read them Track 4.
-Yeah.
Track 4!
No.
You know what?
I think I won't read Track 4.
I think I'm done reading the track names.
If anybody is interested in the CD, they're in the lobby on the way out.
I think that's all well and good.
We can lust....
Yes?
_ou _now Rolling Stone is doing the cover on the boys here?
Yes.
And thank you for that, Rick.
What is the name of Track 4?
[ Laughter ]
Right on.
Track 4 is....
And this is childish.
"l, the Person Standing Before You at This Press Conference Drink Ball Juice."
[ Laughter ]
And again....
Rock 'n' roll!
[ Humming ]
-What's up, man?
-Hey.
-Oh, my God.

What an asshole.
[ Laughter ]
-We should totally mess with him.
-Yeah.
We should throw his computer down the stairs.
No, we should punch him in the face.
Hey, you know what we should do is we should use a book idea.
We should hit him in the nuts with a book.
No, no, no, no.
I read in a book that if you whisper suggestions to people while they sleep, you can affect their dreams.
-Whoa!
-Yeah.
-Can we make him gay?
-No, no, no.
But you can do all kinds of crazy stuff to him in his dreams.
Oh.
Can we make him gay in his dreams?
No, dude.
Can we hit him in the nuts in his dreams?
No.
Guys.
Watch me.
Here we go.
All right, Trumeter.
It's your first day of skydiving.
And you're up next to jump out of the plane.
Here we go.
You're gonna jump in 3.
1, 2, 3!
You're out of the plane.
You're falling.
Oh, it's so beautiful.
This is the most fantastic experience you've ever had.
You feel the wind in your hair.
Right?
It's great.
Now, get ready to pull your chute.
Here we go.
You're gonna pull the cord in 3.
1, 2, 3!
Oh!
Oh, no!
It didn't work!
Your chute didn't open!
You keep falling and falling!
You're so scared!
You're so scared that you start to pee your pants.
You start peeing your pants.
You lust keep peeing and peeing and falling and falling.
There's some other dude falling beside you, and he's super hot.
No, dude.
Come on.
You're falling and peeing and falling.
Oh, no, Darren.
Here comes the ground.
What are you gonna do?
You're gonna hit it.
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
3, 2, 1!
Splat!
His head exploded!
Scatter!
We made his head blow up.
-Did anyone see us?
-Do you know what this means?
They're gonna suspend us with no pay.
No, this means we can physically affect objects in the real world by manipulating people's dreams.
They're not gonna let us have lunch in the office anymore.
Shut up!
I've got an idea.
How long do you think it'll take you to pass out?
Not long.
-Here.
Let me press on your neck.
-Okay.
-All right.
-Okay, he's out.
Sam, you're outside of a bank.
You walk towards it.
You go inside.
-You're gay.
-Shut up!
You go into the vault.
You grab two big bags full of million-dollar bills.
And you come back to the office where you hide them in the file cabinet next to the microwave.
It lust does that.
It just does that.
-Scatter.
-Yeah.
No one can know that we have this power.
I know.
I'm serious.
Don't tell anybody about this.
I won't. I don't want to have to eat in the cafeteria.
Okay.
So mum's the word.
Honey, I'm home.
I had a weird day.
She was sleeping.
Good.
So was the kid.
Why does everybody go to bed so early in this house?
So you see, as soon as the Mayflower arrived, the Indians immediately attacked the boats, saying, "You've got to fight us, or we'll go back to Europe and rape all your babies."
-Hello, Margaret.
-Who are you?
I am the fairy of womanhood.
Oh, no!
That's right.
Today is your special day.
-You mean...?
-Yes.
Today's the day I turn on your womb.
Not now. I'm in the middle of social studies.
Oh, Margaret.
Womanhood waits for no one.
Now spread those legs 'cause here we go!
Wait!
No!
Stop!
Margaret, do you have a problem with our forefathers' treatment of the savages?
-No.
-Good.
All right, now, these godless assholes had the nerve...
All right.
Let's clear out those cobwebs and fire up those ovaries.
Listen, fairy, I don't want to become a woman here in the middle of class.
Could we at least wait till I get home?
Oh, Margaret, there's nothing to be nervous about.
The shedding of one's uterine lining is a symbolic transition from childhood to adulthood.
Nothing could be more natural.
Now, here I go!
Wait, no!
Oh!
Margaret.
That wasn't very nice.
Now, spread those legs and accept your fate.
No, you'll never get me!
Never!
What's happening to me?
Oh, my God!
It's not going to be that bad.
Now stop making me angry.
You'll never get me.
Never.
Margaret, what's going on around here?
Who are you?
I'm rationality.
Rationality?
That's right, Margaret.
Don't you think it's a little pointless to try and avoid an inevitable part of growing up?
Yeah, I guess so.
Every woman has to menstruate.
It's a part of life.
And besides, there are plenty of cool things to come along with growing up, like wearing makeup, driving cars, or getting dick.
I suppose.
Don't fight Mother Nature.
Just relax and bleed.
Okay.
Thank you, rationality.
Good-bye, Margaret.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Rationality.
Will I ever see you again?
I'm afraid not.
You can't have both.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Rationality.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Rationality.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Rationality.
Good-bye.
Well, I see no one showed up for the first day of ninja school.
Or did they?
Oh, you must be our new "haybenar" guy.
Yes, AR guy.
Matthew Williams.
So are there any new bands I should know about?
I have some good news and some bad news for you.
Only good news, I hope.
Well, the good news is that I found this amazing new band.
That's great.
They're young, they're good-looking, they're talented.
They have a sound all their own.
They're kind of like a cross between the Beatles and the Arcade Fire with a hip-hop twist.
All those things make money.
Yes, I know, I know.
And what's even better is that they want to sign with us.
-We're their first choice.
-Well, let's sign 'em.
Here's the thing, though.
The name of the band is Our Label Is Run By Homos.
But then people would think that we're....
-l know.
-But we're not!
I know.
Well, they will have to change their name.
That's the one point they won't move on, sir.
Okay.
Let me get this straight.
If we were to sign this band....
Our Label Is Run By Homos.
We'd have to put out T-shirts and CDs and posters that say....
Our Label Is Run By Homos.
This better make a lot of money.
-Whoo!
-Yeah!
Yeah!
Whoo!
We'd like to thank everyone for coming out to our CD-release party.
-Whoo!
-Yeah!
And to all our fans and all the press that's here, we couldn't have done it without you.
And without further ado, I'd like to introduce the head of our label,
Mr. Jim Gibblecost.
-Jim!
-Gibblecost!
Whoo!
[ Applause ]
Thank you.
I'd like to thank the members of the press for coming out this evening.
We're very excited to be working with this particular band.
They've got a great sound.
And we're very proud to be in business with...
Our Label Is Run By Homos.
[ Laughter ]
And I hear a lot of snickering.
So I'd like to take this moment to point out that the band's name is just a name.
It has nothing to do with myself or any of my colleagues at our fine label.
So without further ado, I present to you their debut CD:
[ Laughter ]
And I'd like to take a moment and reiterate that this is lust the name of the CD.
We have no control over what they title things.
That was in their contract.
Now, the CD itself has 12 cuts on it of various titles.
And the first single has been getting a lot of positive publicity from the --
-What's the single's name?
-Yeah.
What's the single's name?
The first single is titled...
"l'm Really Sorry I Keep Lying About Being Gay.
I'm Just Really Concerned About How People Will Take It,
So I've Called This Press Conference and Am Using This Band and CD
As Sort of an Excuse to Test the Waters."
[ Laughter ]
And again, I know this sounds particularly specific, and this may be confusing.
And I want to make sure everybody understands this because I see a lot of the press is frantically writing stuff down.
We do not have control over --
Mate, be brave.
Come on, now.
You know what's going on here.
Excuse me.
Yes?
Rick Simmons.
Rolling Stone magazine.
What are some other track names?
Read him some more names, mate.
Yeah.
Read them.
[ Laughter ]
Umm....
Well, there's....
"So, Seriously, What Do You Guys Think?
Will You Still Respect Me, and Can I Drop This Charade?"
Which, again, is lust a name.
There's... .
Nope.
Nope.
"l've Known For a While Now, Since Secondary School, but I've Been in Denial."
Which is silly.
I think we all know what they're doing.
It's the same thing over and over.
It's not very funny.
I don't think anyone here finds it funny.
-Read them Track 4.
-Yeah.
Track 4!
No.
You know what?
I think I won't read Track 4.
I think I'm done reading the track names.
If anybody is interested in the CD, they're in the lobby on the way out.
I think that's all well and good.
We can lust....
Yes?
_ou _now Rolling Stone is doing the cover on the boys here?
Yes.
And thank you for that, Rick.
What is the name of Track 4?
[ Laughter ]
Right on.
Track 4 is....
And this is childish.
"l, the Person Standing Before You at This Press Conference Drink Ball Juice."
[ Laughter ]
And again....
Rock 'n' roll!
Fold here right?
Ya.
This is for who?
Although I'm trying my best to make this for her, but seems like it's very difficult.
No problem, Mizuki sure will make it.
Thank you, Hisako-san.
Ready, throw...
Yes, I win.
These guys were playing this game all along, won't they feel bored?
That's true.
Touga-kun...
Mizuki
Oneechan.
You were here, should we go home?
Ya, let's go home.
Everybody, see ya.
Hibara, see ya.
See ya.
I've never seen that kid with blue shirt before.
Ah...that's Touga-kun.
His father come back to their hometown for holiday.
I see...
Touga-kun told us something weird just now.
He ask me did I heard something about seeing spook from the river...
Spook?
Yeah, spook.
Oneechan heard before?
Never.
I see.
But Mizuki don't always go to that river... it's dangerous especially you.
It's ok, I'll be careful.
But now things happen to grandma... don't do things that make us worry.
THE FACE
He is Sugita's grandson.
They were staying here during holiday as thought it's because of their family.
Touga-kun is looking for the spook seriously.
Does grandpa know about the spook which appear in the river?
I don't know.
But it's really weird, he said he wants to see the spook...
I won't see if it was me, I feel frightful.
Oneechan will feel the same too, right?
If it's a relative, I might be looking forward to see.
Is that true?
Mizuki feel that even though it¡¯s a relative might be frightful too?
Huh?
I don't really know.
Oh, yes...
This is for grandma.
Such a nice boat, thanks Mizuki.
Let's do together after you've get well.
There's a lot of flower bloom out at the riverside, you'll like it.
I see.
Are you alright, grandma?
Mizuki, will you help to hang those cleaned clothes?
Days before, grandma had become weaker.
Grandpa, will grandma get well?
With grandpa there must be no problem right?
Tougo-kun.
Hibara-san...
Why were you come to this place?
Just feel like coming.
You don¡¯t like river, right?
Just a little.
But I like the scenery of the river.
How about you?
What are you doing here?
Just having a walk.
Have you found the spook that appear in the river?
Where did you heard that from?
Nothing.
This kind of thing happen frequetly.
I like to listen story about spook.
Then why don't you come my house...my grandpa know these a lot... you can hear a lot.
Nevermind.
Aren't you dislike of river?
Let's hurry then.
What do you mean?
I'm telling you this because of you like to hear spook stories.
Actually...
I'm not looking for spook.
My father had past away since this spring...
I see...
After then I always dream of him... having fun with him at the river.
Catching fish and crabs with father in the dream... really happy.
You always play with your father at the river, right?
Err... never.
Never once I play with my father at the river.
Is it?
My father always busy and have no time.
Even though he always said that he wants to play with me at the river when summer comes... said that he wants to teach me a lot of things.
Therefore you think that he had become a spook in the river?
I don't believe on that.
But still having the same dream all night.
That's why I think there might be possible...
I wants to...see father...
Is it... this river?
Touga-kun playing with father at this river in dream.
I don't know, I think should be somewhere around here.
There's a lot of river here, is there any characteristic?
I think, there's a buddha at the riverbank.
The face was scrape, it looks frightful.
That¡¯s not here then.
There's no buddha around here.
I'll help you to find out!
Let's ask the others.
I wish I could see it.
I've finished.
Mizuki, where are you going?
Go to look for Touga-kun's father.
Bye.
Huh!
Mizuki.
I'm leaving.
Grandpa, Touga-kun's father...should be...
Will Mizuki be alright?
Leave her alone.
It's better to go for a walk then staying at home.
Mizuki seems like very busy.
Looks like she is helping Touga-kun to find something.
It's the river with spook?
That spook looks like it's Touga-kun's father which have past away.
Oh, I see.
The river they are looking for is where the place Touga-kun dream of playing with his father.
So to let Touga-kun meet with his father, Mizuki is trying so hard.
How great if they get to find it.
Mike-san, today we went to look for the buddha... but nobody know where is it.
Can we find it?
Let's continue tomorrow.
Grandma will get well right?
After then grandma's health is getting worse.
The river in Touga-kun's dream were not found.
I am worry.
It turns cool in the evening.
What's wrong, Mizuki?
Come here.
While after the holiday...
Mizuki, you were here.
Just now I called mother to come over...
No...won't be something happen to grandma.
Hey, Hibara.
What's wrong?
Takatsu they found the buddha at the upside of the river.
Really, that's great.
Mmm...
Tomorrow...
I'll be going back.
Thanks... a lot...
Hey Touga, let's go to have a look at the buddha.
Is Hibara coming along?
But...now...my grandma is...
Mizuki!
Grandma!
Is it ok?
Is it fine to come out?
Yes...it's fine.
Really?
Of course.
That's great.
Hibara, are you going?
We're not waiting for your.
Wait for me.
Grandma?
Grandma...
Buddha...
This is it.
Really?
Yes, I'm sure.
That's great.
We found it at last.
But it's too far from the river.
Sounds like...true.
It's at the riverbank in my dream.
Mizuki...
Huh?
Really?
Touga-kun, listen to me...
This buddha was moved here earlier as there's a project in progress at the riverbank.
Really?
Ya, beside the river.
Quickly.
Hey, Mizuki...wait!
It's the same.
That's great, there's really something.
As expected...it¡¯s impossible.
But...not every dream will appear in the real life, right?
Huh?
Where's grandma?
Grandma!
Grandma!
Mizuki...
Grandma, where are you?
Grandma...
Takatsu,Kasama... did you saw my grandma?
Grandma?
What's wrong?
My grandma...isn't she's here with us just now?
This is where my grandma told me.
What are you talking about?
Only we came here.
That's right.
Are you ok?
You guys...
What are you talking about?
Touga-kun saw her, right?
My grandma came along with us.
I feel weird all the while.
Is there someone pass away in your house?
What are you talking about?
Grandma will be fine, she'll get well.
Mizuki.
Oneechan, let go of me.
Oneechan, let go of me.
Mizuki...
Grandma...
No, I'm not listening.
Grandma...grandma!
Grandma.
That's great... you've awake.
I've...fainted.
I'm sorry, I just left for a while.
Sorry for leaving you alone.
It's frightening, but...
I'm ease.
Grandma just get well, better get some rest.
Ya.
Thank you.
Where are you going?
To tell grandpa that you've awake.
That's nevermind, grandma, please stay.
Nothing, I'll always be with you.
Grandma.
It come to my place.
Seems like it went to Chitose place too.
Such a mannered women.
How's that?
Feel afraid?
Feel like want to meet her again.
You'll see her.
But just can't see her as like before.
She'll always be with us just change into a different method...
Who knows someday she'll come back.
I don¡¯t want that way.
Holding my hand... petting my head... bathing together... eating together...
Chating a lot...
I can't see her when feel like seeing her...
I don't want!
Mizuki.
Sometime even living you can't get to see her also.
If you shout like this she'll be tire.
Nay when she is alive we've make her troublesome.
Before she get use to life at there... let her have a good rest.
Although grandpa did not cry, but he's crying inside...
I can feel it.
Is grandma looking at the same blue sky at somewhere else?
...the situation in the Berlin borough of Kreuzberg last night.
Despite the lack of rioting on the night of the 30th, police reportedly made 1 19 arrests:
Many more than last year.
Today some 5,000 police will be in Kreuzberg.
Thanks for the lift home.
-Call me.
I will.
Now what?
I've got to go.
Uwe.
Are you a man at all?
Weren't you all there last year?
A few burning rubbish containers.
That was all.
But in France...
-But we're not in France.
I just thought...
No one plays up here anymore.
Uwe!
What's up, Uwe?
Trouble at home?
That's enough, Schroeder.
No, I knowwhat Uwe needs.
Uwe should go on a rampage, get himself some protester, and smack him right in the head!
I said that's enough!
Pay particular attention to groups consisting of the type just described.
In addition, our inter-regional units, i.e. those from Brandenburg, will be allocated local scouts.
You know, back then it was...
It was almost like paradise.
Suddenly we just looted a supermarket.
It wasn't hard.
We just broke in.
The first ones to go in were restrained in taking stuff.
They ducked around like criminals.
Took two beers, cottage cheese.
Breakfast, in a word.
Then more came and took what they needed.
Then all of Kreuzberg was there.
No shit, all of Kreuzberg.
Believe me, the cops took over four hours, four-and-a-half hours, just to get there!
The streets were closed:
Barricades.
Skalitzer St. Urban St.
all of them.
Luckily the Berlin Wall was on the other side.
For four whole hours, Kreuzberg was the only stronghold of Anarchy in the whole fucking world.
You know what?
Every year we long for the same thing:
Just one damn day when you can take everything.
Because it all belongs to you.
Monday 07 :00 hours, entry three.
What?
-You not got a bigger note?
No.
-Have a look.
Nothing smaller, sorry.
I've no change, I just came on shift.
You'll have to get off.
-What?
I'm catching the Berlin train.
-I'm not a charity, off you get.
Come on, take it!
-What is it?
It's your action suit, man.
Wow.
Really?
Where from?
-Internet.
Excellent.
Can't have been cheap.
Cheap?
What's cheap then?
And what about you?
You.
Plain-clothes.
To break cover unexpectedly.
We should have brought helmets.
Helmets?
Will it really be that bad?
-Always, sure.
You alright?
Or are you shitting your pants?
No, but I'll shit in your pants.
You're melting my heart.
You fag.
Don't touch me!
...approaching Berlin Ostbahnhof.
Thank you for using Deutsche Bahn.
Two cops!
There are more where they came from.
Here you are.
-Thank you.
Feel safe with a gun, huh?
Hey, Yavuz!
Watch your mouth!
Excuse me.
Watch your mouth.
Cop lover?
-Got a problem with that?
You said we'd take out a cop today.
-Me?
Are you stupid?
I never said that!
Fikret said we could because they beat up Hasan last year.
-What?
Fikret?
Fuck those stoners, okay?
Well?
You want a smack or what?
-You're too weak!
Come here, you little fucker.
Got you.
Look what I collected.
For the demo!
To play marbles?
Look at this.
Me and my brother wanna take out a cop.
Bad!
If this got your head, you'd be so dead.
No way, I don't believe you.
-Should I?
No, no.
I believe you.
Stay cool.
And I'll join you!
-We'll see, it's not a game.
Come on.
Is this all there is to Alexander Platz?
I like the structure.
I like the tits.
Yeah... me too.
But I also like the structure.
So?
Where's the problem?
-There isn't one.
Well then.
Why finish school when I've got work with Dad?
Is it a shit job?
-Not at all.
Working for Daddy is uncool?
-Better than living with Grandparents.
I don't live there, I'm just staying.
-Since you were 12.
What do you mean?
That's something else.
My Dad travels.
I'll move out soon.
I just don't knowwhat I should do.
Then finish school, it's only two more years.
You'll knowthen.
Or get real and be honest with your parents.
What do you mean by honest?
-Only you can know.
You knowwhat?
I'll get some study advice.
What?
What is it?
Know what honesty is?
-No.
This is being honest.
You can't be serious.
What?
-Well, that!
Is it real?
-Of course!
This is a crisis-area.
-Where's the crisis?
It doesn't work anymore, so sit down now.
It doesn't work?
-Of course not, it's an antique.
Swear.
What?
-On your Dad's life.
On your Dad's life?
-Your Dad's.
I swear on my Grandpa's life.
You've sworn.
-You fucker.
You're wearing a red T-shirt?
-So what?
You stand out.
Like saying "Please fuck with me!"
Let's go!
-And Bülent?
Bring him too.
I don't know.
-Come on.
Are we off to the demo?
-You're staying here.
Mama's due home.
You promised!
I did not.
Who'll look after Cem?
I watch my little brother, you watch yours.
Bülent is not my brother, he's Fikret's.
Yavuz, there are punks, Nazis, and drunk hippies: all playing war!
Off to hospital!
What do I tell Mama?
Don't make trouble, I'm warning you!
Yes!
Yavuz is the loser!
You lost, you lost!
I'm warning you, fucker!
Ingrid?
I don't understand.
I've given her so much.
Clothes.
Shoes.
You shouldn't buy women shoes.
-Why not?
They run off.
Should we?
-Yes.
Let's go.
Come on Uwe, time to rumble!
What's up?
-Seen my brother?
Back there with the other idiots.
Why isn't he looking after you?
It's dangerous.
Why aren't you with them?
Scared?
-I'm watching my car.
That's why.
-Why park here?
I park when and where I want to.
Someday you'll understand what I mean.
You alright then?
-You still with Janine?
The blonde with the sexy ass?
-Sexy ass?
How do you know her, asshole?
My brother Nebi.
-Nebi?
How?
What do you actually want?
-Do you still sell guns?
What do you want?
A gun?
-Yes.
You got big balls now?
Why a gun?
To kill a cop.
You want to kill a cop, huh?
You stupid fucker.
You serious?
You really serious, shit-for-brains?
You alright there?
Go home!
You little shit head.
Knowwhat?
Janine said you fuck like a pig, stink and snort.
I'll hit you.
Just watch it.
My brother fucked her after Hasan's party.
Come here!
Come here...
Watch out man!
Stop!
The line-up is as follows:
The crowd should come after the main banner, followed by the coalition banners, so no organisations...
Hello Nebi?
Hey man, when you hear this message call me right away.
It's urgent.
It's really important, okay?
Where are they all going?
-The punks?
No, Schroeder and them.
-Oh right.
That's the "Dolores".
"The best brothel in Berlin."
How's it going, Schroeder?
Not on the list?
-What list?
The list.
Best get the chief to sign you up.
No, rubbish.
We'll use the zip system:
As long as it's quiet, we alternate with the locals.
I'll be off then.
Hey, boys.
De-escalate...?
De-escalate!
I had no idea.
There's a lot you've missed out on...
Hmm?
Really.
No.
-Perhaps you'll feel better.
I'm married.
-Yes, so is your wife.
...it'll hurt me, not you.
-No way, I won't do it.
If I could do it on my own, I would.
-No thanks.
You knowwhat you're asking of me?
It's perverse.
You're my best friend, do it!
-Your best and only.
What?
Your Granddad's going to kill you.
Won't be the first time.
Should I do it?
What?
I can do it, I don't mind.
Well, I do...
Go on, do it.
Monday, 14:30 hours, entry eighteen.
What's with you?
You bought a ticket?
No, have you?
"Have you?"
What do you want, cunt?
Fucky-fuck?
What's up with you?
She was sweet.
I don't go for lesbians.
She's about as lesbian as you are aristocratic.
Tell me what it is, get it up the ass.
I'll put this up your ass, my friend.
Stay still.
Are you sure?
-Yes!
Three... two... one.
Show me, show me.
Come on!
Fuck Grandma.
Monday, 15:00, entry...
Nineteen!
-Nineteen.
CHANGE THE WORLD!
We are not hooligans, we're Maja Bumble-Bee fans!
Maja Bumble-Bee!
Check it out.
Go home!
That's too much traffic now.
-No Harry, don't.
Sit your ass back down.
Leave it out, Harry.
The same old shit, every year.
Come on, give me a hand.
-No, not me.
We're with you in spirit.
Free Harald!
Free Harald...
Give me a hand then.
You're strong, aren't you?
Got it?
-Yes.
Leave the kid alone, Harald.
I'm Harry.
Who are you?
Yavuz.
-Better go home, kid.
Turkish or Kurdish?
-Turkish.
Leninist or Maoist?
-Maoist.
Maoists are softies.
Stalin sounds like steel.
Here's Yavuz, Turkish Stalinist.
Yes, right!
-Shut your gobs, you Maoists queers!
Will you help me, Stalinist?
-What is it?
An A1 street barricade.
But we've got to be fast.
Before the cops come.
-Okay.
Stuff like that is just trouble.
-Want a beer, sister?
Go to the demo instead, hear Arniches talk on deportation.
Educate yourselves.
You do Africa.
We'll do Berlin.
WARM MAOlST BEER 100 YEN
... with the butcher's son, of all people!
Really?
From "Raddatz' Pork"?
He's only eighteen.
-And she's vegetarian.
It's totally disgusting.
You know what?
In a relationship, there's one strong one, one weak.
I like Ingrid, but you've got to show her.
How am I supposed to do that?
If one of you has an affair, it should be you, not her.
Where are the Anarchists then?
What a waste of time!
Nothing's going on.
What a lot of shit!
-Wait!
Hey.
What a lame waste of time.
What?
-What a lame waste of time!
Up with international solidarity!
-The fair at home's more exciting.
Fuck, what do I know.
-Obviously not much.
Shit, who was that?
Cops!
Don't run.
Stay together!
Where's the shit head...?
Okay, now it's started.
There are the fucking wankers.
Yavuz!
I live here, come on.
Come on.
What a stupid move.
Taste good?
-Really good.
Are you stupid?
What's wrong with you?
We just had more action than during the whole demo.
No idea.
It just really got to me.
And now?
A döner, please.
Fuck it, make it two.
What's up?
That's your third, isn't it?
-I'm growing.
So, now... 06:45 there's a train to Minden.
We could still get it.
Or take the last one and see a film.
A film.
-Or we get the 06:45, and go to Charlotte's party.
Back to your favourite pastime.
I said, back...
-I heard.
And that is?
Giving up, being a loser.
Got a better idea?
You said it all happens here.
If it's not here, then somewhere else in town.
Just wait till dark.
You can always go home.
What's this "Charlotte's party"?
Mate!
We've planned this.
Want to buy some?
Shit.
Well?
Now for a beer.
Here's to the action leadership.
Harry, are you gay?
Me?
No.
I'm an atheist.
That was my first demo.
My father took me with him.
1st of May is Worker's Day.
-So why does no one work?
Because they take to the streets to defend their rights.
Hey, spud heads.
Want something to smoke?
-Got anything harder?
What do you mean?
Just something harder.
I don't knowwhat you mean.
No idea...
Cocaine?
Ecstasy?
No coke.
And I only sell "E" to grown-ups.
What?
I'm 21 and he's 19!
He looks 16!
Seriously.
Can you prove your age?
Prove it?
Show our id, or what?
For example.
21, huh?
-18, big deal!
Okay, for how much then?
-For the two of us.
How much for 100 bucks?
-Enough.
So.
-What?
Cash!
-Only when I've got my pills.
Obviously.
-Yeah.
It's a bad world, huh?
Wait here.
Now she's got your id.
Is that bad?
-Don't know.
You can sell them too.
Shit!
One chair, not bad.
One chair, one brother.
Where is Uwe?
1st of May, huh?
-But I'm not here officially.
No, sure.
Well then?
Let's get cosy then, shall we?
What's your name then?
-Uwe.
So Uwe, what's it going to be?
Let's go, she's not coming back.
Man, fuck your bloody lD.
It's not about that.
What then?
-I don't take shit.
Now shut up.
I think they're speaking Turkish.
Definitely Turkish.
Just look at the names, they're almost all Turks here.
You always want a reason to give up.
Not true!
-Oh really?
Sorry to bother you...
I have a slight problem.
A friend and I have got into a transaction with an unknown woman, well started it...
The problem now is or rather my friend's problem now is that... the person involved was a... young, Turkish... speaking woman, who...
What's up?
-Don't know.
Just cleared off or what?
-Looks that way.
No wonder.
What do we do now?
-No idea, this is great!
I'd say it's the wrong apartment.
-Yes, but the right time.
That's your father, right?
-You could say that.
No, that's Karl Liebknecht:
Freedom fighter and Communist.
What's a computist?
-Communist.
Yes, you know...
Communists are...
They're people who share everything they work for fairly.
That's why we've both got a beer.
That's an original "Hoffman's Drinks" bottle.
We scored that in '88.
Yavuz, how old are you?
I'm sixteen.
Doesn't matter.
1st of May demonstrations are over 100 years old.
But real rioting began in '87.
The Bolle Supermarket was looted and burnt.
It was burnt right down.
I was there.
Where they're building the new mosque now.
Did you light it?
Who knows?
Nebi and me wanted to take out a cop.
-How "take out a cop"?
Finish.
Do him in.
Kill.
Want to join us?
Kill them?
Why?
Why not?
Hey kid.
Rioting's fine, but you don't just kill someone.
What then?
Get out there once a year.
When you're older...
-When I'm older
I'll do more than steal a beer bottle.
Yeah, right.
What is that?
Leave it.
It's not a toy.
That can shoot steel balls.
Dangerous.
Nebi?
At Harry's.
We barricaded a street.
And he's got a sling shot.
No, he's not a gay.
He's a freedom fighter and a computist.
Yes, okay.
Are you his brother?
Don't worry,
He's really safe here.
Hello?
Hello?
You crazy?
Don't let go!
Are you crazy?
-Don't touch me!
I'm sorry.
Same as my brother:
Talk big, then steal a fucking beer.
Faggot shit, 1st of May!
Faggot shit, 1st of May?
Hey kid, that's not you.
Yavuz.
Take out a cop?
Kill them or what?
Mean it?
Come on then.
Come on.
Got some pent up aggression?
Let it out, come on!
Have a go.
Feel aggressive?
Then let it out.
I might not be a cop, but have a go!
Come on!
You see?
You are a good kid.
You see, my wife, she also...
Uwe.
We need you, we're on now.
Oh shit!
Shit!
I'll be right there.
Attention those not involved must immediately vacate the area around the burning dustbin.
Come here.
Wait.
Very pretty, baby.
-Yeah, yeah.
I have to say, Adolf was simply the best.
Adolf, you little Nazi fucker.
Hey!
Man!
-Why is it so dark in here?
Maybe because the gate is closed.
Man, you've topped him.
Hey man, you okay?
It's fine.
What are you?
His Mama?
You okay?
Where are you from?
Where are you guys from?
Minden.
-Shut your gob!
Good.
This is Berlin, got it?
Berlin, understand?
Alright in Minden?
Lots of girls, right?
This is Berlin, okay?
Got it?
-I got it:
You're all fucking wogs here.
Are you retarded or what?
Hey mate, he's a fucking Nazi.
-What did you call us?
Hey, watch it!
He's a fucking Nazi.
-You talking shit?
Real tough, uh?
-Don't talk shit.
Hey, Fikret!
Don't push her man!
Stay cool...
I threwthe bottle by mistake.
Get lost!
Fuck you, asshole.
-Get lost.
You wanker!
Hey, my id!
And the pills?
Bloody awesome, mate!
Awesome?
Are you totally fucking crazy?
Are you aware I almost killed someone?
-Yes.
What?
What's your problem?
The gun works!
It works and you swore it didn't.
You broke your word.
I didn't know it worked.
How stupid do you think I am?
Not particularly.
Pelle?
The greatest chances lie in the moment between life and death.
I think you are the problem.
Oh shit.
What a stupid move.
We want to put out the fire and you run right in.
Where's your gun?
Calling K7.
Yes, 7 here.
-Report to headquarters.
On my way.
Get you holster on or the chief will kill us.
See you at the hospital later.
Nebi, it's me, Yavuz.
Please call me.
Public announcement for uninvolved parties on Wiener Street:
Leave now!
Do not provide criminals a human shield.
Harry?
Are you there?
Wait.
I'll take the gun till we get home and we'll throw away the ammo.
Immediately.
Yes.
Horsti...
Keep fucking.
What's that?
Sveni!
I'll call you back.
Where is the gun?
Where?
Man!
-That won't work here.
I decide what works here from now on!
What do you want to know?
What's happened?
Okay, I still have fifteen...
Rubbish!
Sixteen years to pay off my fucking house.
And I'll lose my job, because you won't give me my fucking gun!
Easy.
Have a beer on the house...
Beer?
I don't want a beer.
I want my gun.
Calm down.
-What do you mean?
What now?
Won't your Grandpa miss it... the pistol?
He won't notice.
Nowwhat?
Dance, get drunk..
Just a half for me.
If you reckon.
I get this feeling more and more often.
It's not always acute, but it's always there.
Even here, now... the idea of it just makes me sick.
I get the shakes...
I just don't know how it should go on.
What?
This.
All of it.
I see howthings go wrong and how... you and your intelligence, and the potential within you, is gone to waste...
Just like me, so...
I don't know.
The first step is a radical change.
Stop and realise, wrong direction, then...
Where is the next way out?
This line of thought, you know?
-Yes.
No idea if I'm right...
It's...
At home it's...
It can't go on.
It just can't go on.
Man, should we stay on a few days in Berlin?
-ln Berlin?
Berlin, or somewhere else, but not home.
Later of course.
-Remember what you were saying,
I'm getting a drink.
Can I help you?
Was a man called Harry brought here?
Do you know his last name?
I don't know.
I couldn't find anyone called Harry.
Do you know exactly when he was brought in?
No.
What did he say, Sveni?
Horsti, I think he wants his gun.
I'd have left your gun behind the counter, it would've been fine.
If I give you your gun now, you won't try anything will you?
Horsti?
What's your name anyway?
-Uwe.
Thanks, Sveni.
Where's the fucking hospital then?
Bye-Bye.
-Yes, Bye.
If you want to drop in again...
It'll be on the house.
Okay then, Bye!
What is a real girl then?
-Well...
Have you ever met one?
Got a euro for a coffee?
Hey Cop, hello!
Have you got a euro for coffee?
It's from the nurses.
What are you staring at?
I thought I'd seen you earlier.
How did it happen?
Did we do it?
No.
And did we do that?
I fell into my own beer bottle, drunk.
It actually only happened because my wife...
Shit.
You're wife beat you up?
-No.
My wife is fucking someone else.
Shit.
My guy too.
With some country bumpkin slut.
I heard that in a relationship...
One is the strong one, the other weak.
The stronger one, does what they want.
And the weak one...
So you always have to try to be the stronger one.
What stupid crap!
It's not about who suffers more or less.
Do you still love her?
I've got to go.
Bye.
Wait a moment...
What's your name?
What's yours?
-Uwe.
Then good luck, Uwe.
I'm sorry, man.
I'm really sorry.
I just lost it.
How is he?
Because of a stupid slut.
I didn't want to hit him that hard.
Yavuz...
Why didn't you stay home?
Why don't you listen to me?
Why did you tell him I screwed his girlfriend?
It's obvious he's going to lose it.
It's my fault.
Telling that to a kid.
Have a seat then.
Sit down.
You want to be a grown up?
Thanks.
You can sit down.
The doctor will come out.
Don't forget your camera.
Pelle, you old drifter.

Good morning, Mr. Pelletier.
I'm Dr. Wrelle...
From intensive care.
Your friend is there.
... serious drug intoxication currently stable.
... very close.
I think you should talk to him when he comes round.
Okay.
Then get some sleep, too.
Right.
Good night then.
Last night Kreuzberg the most peaceful 1st of May in 20 years.
The "Mayfest" concept has been a great success.
Fantastic atmosphere.
Many people contributed to this success...
Five of them, really?
There were six or seven!
They ran off.
-And plain-clothes police, not Nazis?
I can smell cops.
-Because of a barricade!
I'll call Marion from the paper.
-You think so?
Resistance Harry, it's on again.
-Back soon.
Hello.
The police beat you up?
I'm sorry.
What a day, huh?
I'll get going.
You've got to tell Ingrid...
-Leave it.
As your eyes are following me
Thoughts move behind them silently.
Maybe wishes, they could be more,
Whatever they hold I'll like for sure.
Illusions, illusions!
The most wonderful things in the world.
Illusions, illusions!
Keep us alive in their hold.
Illusions, a reward!
Without sense or purpose.
Please don 't think, just let go!
Because who knows, who knows where I will be tomorrow?
Please don 't think, just let go!
Because who knows, who knows where I will be tomorrow?
It seems we 're here together,
All caught here on this ball.

No day without night,
No you without me,
Or me without you.

Yesterday doesn 't matter,
The moment is always there.

Ah, mister...

Mister Leroldi, what can I do for you?
You know why I'm here

My partner died, remember?
Well, the wheel of commerce keep on turning, don't they?
I need time to get the money straight.
Enzo, he did all the books.
That's not my problem.
Unlock my fucking shop!
I'll tell you what.
I got a better idea
You walk away from the rediculous lease my father-in-law gave you.
And we call it even.
Consider it a retirement gift.
That barbershop, that is my retirement.
And the lease is good, until I decide to quit.
July and August, 2500, in full by the end of the month.
Or the padlock is permanent.
Hello.
- Who's this?
You called me.
- Could you put my mom on the phone?
Val, it's your kid again.
Oh, hey baby-girl.
- Are you drunk?
How are you?
- You know what, never mind.
Sweetie...
I'm here about the add.
- Yeah.
I've always wanted to try this.
I see... hair...

I prefer to cut hair naked, if that's cool with you..
I also do make-up.
Can I keep the hair I cut?
I'm all about orientation and exploration.
Cuase I got things I can do with it in my apartament.
Oh, are these Boss samplers?
So, how much does the position pays there, pops?
Don't you call me "pops"!
Right.
How goes the search?
Sorry I missed it.
So, what now?
I'll probably have couple of beers.
No, I mean after that?
I think I'm probably...

Can I have one?
You gonna let me cut your hair?
It's 700 sq. feet.
That'll be 4000 a month.
What the hell are you doing in my shop?
Good morning.
I thought you didn't come in until 8, so.
Get out!
- Come on.
Get outta here, go, get!
Chop, chop.
It's not for rent.
- Fred, Sheila?
If only your wife's old man knew how you treat his tenants.
There're not "his" tenants any more, are they?
I did not put with his shit, my wife's shit just to make a squat on this shack.
I'm not gonna wait for another old man to croak before I make some money on this place.
Ah, relax, you'll get paid.
We don't do ladies hair ma'am, sorry.
I hired a new barber.
- Job's been filled?
Where is?
- The new barber.
I'm a licensed cosmetologist.
You're full of crap, Leroldi.
- I'm good with books, too.
You're an accountant?
- Did it for my grandfather's shop.
You wanna meet my new barber?
Here's my new barber.
Uh...
- Gloria.
Now, get the hell outta my shop.
Sorry, you want one?
- It's 8:05 in the morning.
Yeah, well, I have a headache.
So...
I have the job?
You said something about books.
- Also said something about cutting hair.
The ad was for a barber...
- Yeah, barber, male barber.
Doesn't say "male barber".
It just says "barber".
Well it's implied.
How do you spell your last name?
- Excuse me?
Your last name, so my attorney can file a lawsuit.
Haven't you hear of gender discrimation?
You said I'm qualified, then you told this douchebag I had the job now I don't because I am a woman.
- What?
You can't discriminate against me based on my sex.
This'll do.
Well, I'm gonna head to the court now, to file that lawsuit.
Good luck with your books, Art Leroldi.
Hey baby.
Why can't you park in the lot?
- I gotta to talk to you.
Yeah, I gotta talk to you too.
You wanna go first?
- You wanna shut this thing off?
I guess...
I'm not sure how to say this, but I met someone.
We're gettin' married.
What?
- I know, shit's crazy, right?
What's your news?
- Are you fucking kidding me?
Anything else I need to know?
- Yeah, uh...
I'm gonna need the trailer back.
Alright...
Whatever.
I'll be back, get your shit outta my trailer!
Good morning.
- Oh, yeah...

I can't hire anybody until I get this junk cleaned up.
Hellooo?

Who's on time?
Look, I'm gonna try couple people first first.
I want 200 for the books, cash, today.
Alright, Stanley, you paying attention?
- Yes, sir.
Think you can do that?
- Yeah, yeah.
Spread your feet apart, you need some balance.
No, no you go against the green, otherwise you're not cutting.
Who the hell is this kid?
- It's OK Johnny, relax.
Give me that!
It's about confidence.
There you go.
Love the feeling of a close shave.
- You gotta nice touch there honey.
Art, I'm gonna want her to shave me from now on.
I think I got it, now.
No Stan, you don't got it.
- I don't got it?
Do you need this smock back?
I gotta... step out for a few minutes.
You want us to write you a check?
- I said cash.
Well, business hasn't picked up.
- You better hope it does.
You're 1700$ in the whole.
I'll figure out a way to get you the cash.
You don't gotta figure out a thing, alright?
Come again?
For now, I'm your new partner.
Oh, it's my lucky day.
921 dollars?
That's nuts.
There's no way.
Johnny, I need some pantyhoes and hurry up, we're gonna be late.
One second.
Hey, Art.
- Give me couple of the nasty ones.
Keep the change.
He was before me, Jim.
Thanks.
- Yeah.
There you go.
Jimmy, you're still out of whipped cream.
For crying out loud...
Good morning.
- Of course.
This is where you're gonna work.
This station here.
There you go, that's for you.
It's kinda frumpy, but It'll do, for now.
Thanks.
Excuse me.
Haircuts are 8 dollars.
I'll go the lunch from 1 to 2, you'll go to lunch from 12 to 1.
Any questions?
- Do I have to go from 12 to 1?
I'm just kidding.
We don't open for a few minutes yet, so if you wanna take a walk...
I, uh... gonna...
- Yes, sorry, leave you to it.
Hey.
- Hi.
Can I get espresso, please?
- Sure.
Oh, would you make that decaf?
- Sure.
What's with the...
giant smock?
I'm a barber.
That little shop down the street.
Really?
What happened to the old guys?
Well, it's old guy now, singular.
Apperantly.
And me.
Hopefully.
How much?
- Two.
Thanks.
It's a coffee club card.
Bye one, get one free.
Thanks.
Priest and a nun, bent over the pew.
He is giving it her, right...
Who's next?
I'll wait for Art

Hold on a second, Tony.
- Alright.
Yes?
- Gonna help me out here, or what?
What do you want me to do?
You still owe me 200 bucks.
- They prefer a male barber.
Jesus, it's not like I'm gonna give them all a prostate exam.
Hey, you, college kid.
In the chair!
Yeah, you, come on.
Hello.
- Jesus.
Is Art here?
No, he went to the post office.
How long ago?
- Uhm... couple of minutes.
Uhm...
Can I get a... quickie?
Yeah, sure.
Just a trim.
I'm Gloria.
- I know, Art says your name a lot.
Really?
- No!
It's a joke.
Kind of.
He's a barker, not a biter.
Who?
- Art.
He is not a biter.
- Yeah, I know.
Enzo.
- No, it's not about Enzo.
It's about Emma
- Who's Emma?
His wife.
- He is married?
He was married.
Oh, he's divorced
- No.
I don't think he'll ever get a divorce.
Hey, Art.
See you tomorrow.
Hello.
- Hello.
Mecca... mecca... tiar
- Mcintire.
I...
I'm... wiat.
I don't know what kind of deal you have with Leroldi, but
I'll be happy to give you some money to cut hair elsewhere.
How much money?
- How's 500 sound?
Pretty cheap for a bribe.
- Bribe?
I think you misunderstood.
I'm trying to look out for you.
It's like severance pay.
Like a favor.
Nope, still a bribe.
- It's not a bribe.
I can check with a friend, a cop?
- Cop?
No.
Look, I misspoke.
Lets just forget it.
Are you sure, because I wouln't mind checking.
Anyways, I was wondering if you might be able to move this trailer off my lot?
Or not...
Hello.
- Yes, hi.
This is mr.
Roy over at the flower shop.
Mr Jacobi has ordered flowers for his wife.
We just wanna check on the proper address, if you don't mind?
That's sweet.
Sure, do you need his home address?
Yes, the delivery address, yes.
Mr. John Jacobi
- Yes?
Oh, that's great, fabulous.
Alright, bye bye dear.
This is for you.
- Thank you.
So long.
- See ya, Fritz.
Catch that?
Five dollar tip.
That's more than fifty per cent.
Take the tip jar and stick it in some drawer, would you?
How've managed to stay in business all these years?
No tip jar, people don't tip.
- People tip.
Really?
How much have made today?
- I don't know.
I don't keep a tally.
Well, take tally. 5 bucks says I got more than you do.
Yeah?
Your 5$ plus the 200 I owe you.
How do you like those apples?
I don't like apples
What happened to your smock?
- Lunch time...
Thanks for the coffee cards.
- You're welcome.
I do it for all the cute barbers in town.
Ahh, and here I thought I was special.
You're the only cute barber I'd consider asking out.
Date?
I don't think I'm ready for the whole dating thing.
I'm a patient man.
What time is it?
- It's after 1.
I gotta go.
- Hey, smock!
Sorry.
Post time for the race in San Junatito in 1.22.
8 min. to ge to the neeva, 5 to park, 3 to walk to the window.
Just enough time to get a dog and a draft, before he places his bet.
He's off schedule by 7 minutes.
So?
He can shift the dog and draft, but if he wants to make post time
He's gonna have to shave 4 minutes somewhere.
How do you know all this?
He's done the exact same thing for lunch everyday.
So?
It's where he met Emma?
They used to have lunch there together.
He still goes.
Except... he bets more, drinks more now.
Hey, from the barbershop.
You're the naked barber, eh?
- You guys still hiring?
Hey, Rita, do yourslef a favour and go sit over there.
Rickert?
That's a unique name for a girl.
Yeah, never really been a big fan.
He'll be out in a few minutes.
- Thanks.
I'm really sorry for coming back late from lunch.
I lose track of time sometimes.
- Buy a watch.
If it wasn't for me, you'd still be in jail, right now.
I've got a simple schedule.
It's up on the wall, for Christ's Sake.
What schedule, to gamble and drink?
- You wouldn't understand.
Oh, I understand.
You need to get...
I need to get?
- You need to get laid.
You're fired!
Can't fire me, you owe me 500 bucks for bail.
Pick you up at 7.
- I'll take a cab.
You can't afford one.
Five bucks, pops.
In or out?
Don't call me "pops".
I'm sorry.
Art Leroldi?
My god, It's been so long.
Josey.
- Yes!
Yes!
So, how've you been?
- I'm OK.
What are you doing here?
- I'm working, hopefully.
I know, Emma probably wouldn't approve.
But you know, the top goes off, the tips go up.
And I got a mortgage now.
So, you're a dancer?
- Oh, no, god no.
Just drinks, no dancing.
Can you imagine me up there?
I don't think so.
Put your groceries down, stay a while.
I've gotta go, thanks.
- No, my shift's almost over.
I'm gonna buy you a beer.
Are you gonna put something on?
- Funny.
Go at the bar, I'll meet you there.
Go on.
God, we used to have great barbecues here.
Yeah, we sure did, Josey.
You don't meet many nice gays waitressing drinks.
Thanis. for the lift
- Oh, sure..
We had fun.
We should do it again, sometime.
Good night.
Yeah, any time.
Drive safe.
Mom, I don't wanna see him..
- Gloria, he deserves to know.
He is the father, isn't he?
- What!
?
Just trying to help.
- God, I miss grandpa.
Miss him all you want, I'm the only parent you got left.
Yeah.
I'm painfully aware of that.
I'll call you later, OK?
- Fine.
Hello?
- Gloria?
I said I'd take a cab.
- I said I'd pick you up.
Hey.
- Hey.
Nice place you got here.
It's rental.
Should've bought it when I had the chance.
Wanna tell me about the ring?
You gonna tell me about yours?
See you at the shop.
OK.
See you at the shop.
I thought we're open till 5?
- No, we close at 2 on Saturdays.
If you wanna stick around and take care if someone might happen in, fine by me.
- Well, maybe I will.
Nice haircut.
Hey, I thought we were here for fun.
Yeah, I've got a hot tip.
- Okay.
Oh, shit.
- Some hot tip.
You want another hot-dog?
- What?
No, no.
I'm gonna go make some money back on baseball.
Hey, do you have time for a haircut?
Yeah, come on in.
- Thanks.
What happened to the smock?
Watch your step, I just washed the floor.
This is my chair.
So how do you I like it?
- Just, neatn' it up a bit.
Got a date tonight.
Who's the lucky girl?
Dude, what the fuck?
- Oh, shit.
Busted.
- Dude, shut the fuck up!
Dude, what the fuck?
Check the wire, man.
- Why do I always have to go?
Dude, what do you see?
Dude...
I see...
No one...
Back there...
Oh, fuck!
Dude, what the fuck happened?
- Dude fucking shot me.
Oh, man!
Does that hurt?
Thanks for the haircut
- Thanks for dinner.
It's a wedding ring, but it's not my wedding ring.
Just so you know.
It was my grandmother's.
My grandpa gave to me when she died.
Never leaves my finger.
It's beautiful.
Of course it's still early, but everything looks good.
That's good news.
I don't know if this is any consolation to you.
But I got pregnant when I was halfway trough med school.
Anatomy practical and morning sickness.
Trust me, it does not mix.
It's difficult, but you've got options.
And we're here to support any decision you make.
OK, thanks.
- Sure.
See you again in 30 days?
- Alright.
Oh, and don't forget to take up your needles.
- Okay.
Hair gain with rynoxinol.
Oh, boy.
- Morning.
What's with all the sissy hair crap stuff?
In case you've forgotten, this is a business.
And this will help you make the rent and help me keep my job.
How's that?
- Who's hair do we cut?
"We don't cut ladies hair. "
No, you're not birnging any woman to the shop.
- Did I say we were?
No, we cut men's hair.
Yeah.
- What happens to virtually every male?
They go bald.
So we buy this stuff half the price turn it around and sell it twice as much.
Well, how much does that stuff cost you?
20 for the regular, 35 for the extra-strength.
Lady.
Lady.
Half guys already complain about price of a cut.
I hope you saved your receipt.
Wow, you have really thick hair.
Thanks.
I inherited it from my mom.
She's got really thick hairs.
I mean really thick.
Only one little spot.
Spot?
- Yeah, right here.
How bad is it?
- It's not that bad.
Yet.
Of course, these things spread like wild fire.
Wild fire?
- I'm sure you're fine.
And don't forget.
Six squirts, twice a day.
On the spot.
- On the spot.
Wild fire...
Thank you.
- Thanks.
What the hell is this?
What the hell is what?
- You're cashing checks all week.
So what?
You got your 200.
- What about my 500?
What about your shop?
I'm gonna lose the shop.
- Really, Djicobi is serious.
He offered me 500 bucks to take a walk.
Maybe I should've taken it.
Well, maybe you should.
Why don't you?
You don't get it.
I don't need money.
I need stability.
I need this job.
Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
So, what's the deal with you using my credit card at county jail?
You don't get to ask me questions, anymore.
- I want my trailer back, G.
That's his trailer?
You want your fucking trailer back?
No fucking way!
Why you gotta be all crazy?
Well, I guess my mom left that part out.
I'm pregnant.
Idiot.
Hey, kid.
Sit down.
How long have you been wearing that shirt?
Hey.
Hi.
Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm super awesome.
I am sorry.
Why are you sorry?
Well, that helps...
Do you wanna...
Thanks.
- Sure.
What happened to Rickert?
- I told him to get lost.
Thank you.
Look, I'm really sorry.
I had no idea.
- I barfed in your sink.
Well, I guess I...
- I know.
We don't cut ladies hair.
Yeah, I sure don't.
But you used to.
Yeah.
She...
She was my life.
She... had breast cancer.
This really valiant breast cancer.
She wouldn't want you to be this lonely, you know.
It's been 11 years.
I don't even know where to start.
You wanna start with a beer?
- No beer!
You're pregnant
- I meant, for you.
Alright.
Two things, non-negotiable.
Seriously.
Number 1.
You gotta let me cut ladies hair.
I can charge 10 times as much.
It will only take me twice as much time.
It's the only way the shop is gonna stay open.
Alright!
Number 2.
You really gotta get laid.
- I'll start cutting ladies hair.
My own, good time.
Thank you very much.
- Okay.
You got a lead?
Maybe.
- Wow, alright then.
She's a waitress, it's not what you think.
I think that you...
look handsome.
Art!
- Oh, yeah.
Thanks.
- Good luck.
Hey, Wilson.
How's that mushu?
Tasty, eh?
- Shit.
Art, hey.
- Hey.
Good food.
- Great place to take the kids.
I bet your wife would really enjoy this place.
Art, about the rest of the money for Enzo's funeral.
Aha?
- Forget it, lets just call it even.
Enzo was a good man.
He deserved the best.
He cut my dad's hair in the hospital.
- No kidding?
He did?
My pleasure, really.
I bet it was.
Good morning, Art.
Where's Gloria?
- I'm right here.
Don't worry, it's gonna be OK.
Is that vanilla?
- Yeah.
What the hell is this?
We call that a penis, Reggie.
You have the freshest breath of any man I've ever met.
It's peppermint.
- Whatever it is.
I like it.
It's a great day to start the day.
Me too.
Morning Gladis.
- Good morning, Jousey.
Glads, you look great young lady.
Thank you, Arthur.
Morning, Art.
- Hey, good morning, Gloria.
Morning, Art.
- Aham.
500 for you, young lady.
- Thank you.
Nice shirt, by the way.
- Oh, thank you.
And the rent is paid.
It's gonna be a good day.
OK, here's the rent.
2500 dollars, in full.
What, you don't have anything smart-ass to say?
Thanks...
Rachel, would you get Mr Liroldi here his receipt.
Rachel will get you the receipt.
- Why don't you call the bank?
Call the bank.
Nice tie.
- Thanks.
It's...
Thanks.
For making the rent.
- For making the rent
I've something I wanna show you.
It's small, but it's got two bedrooms.
- If you're asking me to move in...
It's for me and the baby.
You won't see my trailer anymore.
- Now, there's a good idea.
It's mine if you sign letter of employment.
I'm sorry, I have to talk to my accountant.
I'm your accountat.
- Well, I guess we're good to go.
Thank you.
What happened?
Big Mart?
Djicobi sold out.
The whole place is getting torn down.
Can't we fight it?
- The lease is good only, as long as he owns the place.
Look, you did really good here.
I just wanted to say thanks.
Put all your things in the box over there.
Gotta go.
Hang in there.
You did good.
You weasley little prick.
- What the hell are you doing?
Hey, stop, or I will call the police!
You're gonna have to make it to a phone first, you piece of shit.
If you were gonna sell the place, why'd you put him trough all that?
I don't know.
- Fuck you, yes you do, tell me!
Alright, fine!
I enjoyed it, OK?
Goddamnit.
Go ahead.
I'll just get another one.
You should've taken the money when I offered it.
Get that fucking trailer off my lot!
Oh, what do you know?
You left your sunroof open.
Court charges Mr Cane with 80 hours community service.
Oh, and Mr Cane, might I also suggest that you find another outlet for relaxation other than "booze".
Next.
City of Rino vs Arthur C. Liroldi.
Mr Liroldi.
You're charged with assulting an officer.
And resisting arrest.
How do you plead?
The cop called me "pops" your honour.
- I don't think this qualifies as a plead.
While I understand your displeasure of being called "pops", what I cannot condone, is a good citizen, such as yourself throwing citations at police officers, telling members of the police dep.
to and here, I'm quoting:
"To shove it, up their ever-loving ass".
While hitting them in the groin with your car door.
That part was a mistake, see the...
- Enough.
Yes, sir.
- The court sentences Mr Liroldi to 100 hours community service.
Next.
Great. 100 hours of picking up garbage.
Oh, crap.
Alright, I hate this car.
- He says the trailer belongs to him.
Great!
- Get your shit outta that trailer.
I ain't got all day.
I want my credit card back.
- Lost it.
Jenny says if you can't take care of the baby, you could come live wiht us in Bakersfield.
Really?
- Yeah.
Here's our number.
That's so sweet.
Hello?
Mom, it's me.
I need you to send some money.
- What for?
No questions, alright?
I got nervous when I didn't see your trailer.
What's going on.
I can't go home, I can't stay here.
You can stay here.
We can...
No.
I can't.
I think I really just need to start over.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry sir, but we can't cash any more of these.
What's the matter with my chip?
You guys are all fuckers.
Fuckers!
Fuckers!
Fuckers!
Take it easy, pops.
- Fuck you.
We've got an angry fish.
Code 11.
I'm gonna need buck up.
What the hell are you doing in my house?
What's your name?
- Sprow.
What the hell are you doing in my house?
Eh?
Get the fuck out of here, Sprow.
Why don't you take it easy, man?
- Take it easy?
I don't take it easy.
You fucking take it easy.
I'm done taking it easy.
I'm calling the cops.
OK, man.
Let's just be cool here.
No cops.
Hey dumb ass, lets go.
We're not leaving, are we?
- You know how much weed we have?
Who wants a bear?
Sit down.
Oh, relax.
Make yourselves at home.
Hi.
- Hi!
There's key under the rock.
- What?
He keeps a key underneath the little rock in the dirt.
Thanks!
- No trouble, sweetie.
Hey.
Hey, come on, lets go.
We're late.
Get up.
What for?
- We're gonna take a shower.
We're gonna take a shower.
- Together?
Yeah.
No.
Hold on, wait a minute.
- What's that?
It's blindfold.
It keeps you from seeing.
- I know what a blindfold does.
Nah, nah, I feel stupid.
- Put your hands down and you won't.
Alright, where are we going?
- You'll find out.
It's not an animal.
OK, stop, hold on.
Keep going, there you go.
Keep going.
Is there a well
- Yes, a big deep well.
Come on.
OK, you're gonna sit down here.
OK, put your hand out.
Your right hand.
There you go.
Left hand.
OK.
Alright, what's going on?
Come on, what's up?
Unlike you, Elmer was ready to retire.
Yeah, but how did you...
Oh, no.
Your ring.
I don't know what to say.
- How about "thank you"?
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you too.
So?
You're gonna cut my hair or not?
Well.
I'm not sure sir.
Do you have an appointmnet?
That's alright.
I'll make an exception in your case.
Get my smock.
Thank you.
- Any time.
Hey.
You stood me up.
Josey, that'll never happen again.
- Yeah, right.
I promise.
I promise?
Come on.
I don't want a girlfriend of mine walking in place like this.
Hey honey?
Baby?
What's with the bags?
I sent Little John to get the mail today.
And look what he came back with.
Ass-Masters?
Load-shooters?
Jizz Kiss?
What are you talking about?
Those are not mine?
- Not yours?
- No.
Your name is on the fucking subscription label.
Yeah, but...
I closed the Big Mart deal today.
Great.
And since the business is still in daddy's name, good luck getting your filthy hands on it.
Laney?
Fucking Liroldi!
Hey, Art.
- Yeah?
For the power.
And for all the shit on your lawn.
You're welcome, dude.
K, the potatos are ready.
How are the burgers?
Good.
Real good.
- Everything OK?
You know, Josey?
I think, it may be the best it's ever been.
Oh, thank you!
Subtitles:
ZLATEN
In the criminal justice system the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups, the police who investigate crime and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders.
These are their stories.
So, what's your pleasure for dinner?
Your mother's asking.
Sorry, Dad.
My buddies called.
We're going to go watch the game at Monte's Grill.
Well, that sounds like a good time.
Any room for the old man?
It's just you and me tonight, honey.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Tomorrow night, I promise.
If he hangs around us old wrecks, how's he ever going to meet Mrs. Devon Number Two?
I'll see you later.
I wish you wouldn't say that.
It makes it seem like we're pushing him out of the door.
Rick Devon, home address in Brooklyn.
He's an acoustical engineer for an outfit in Long Island City.
He's definitely off the reservation here.
So, you found him?
Yes, sir.
Dope slingers work that end of the park.
It gets busy.
But when my partner and me drove by around 9:00, the place was empty.
Have you ever seen him at the park before?
No, sir.
Then you know most of the regulars?
By sight.
The slingers and buyers.
Good to know.
Well, Mr. Devon had 60 bucks in his wallet and a tan line where his watch used to be, so I'm guessing somebody needed to know the time real bad.
Yeah, but if Devon wanted to get high, man, there are places closer to home where he could've scored.
You hear that?
What?
It's coming from in here.
Did anybody use this facility?
Not since we got here.
Someone forgot their key.
Probably took it off to wash their hands.
Must have left in a hurry.
Nobody wants to be the last guy at a crime scene.
That was Ted.
He just picked up Matt.
They'll be right over.
I just don't understand what Ricky was doing in that neighborhood.
We're going to need you to make up a list of names of the friends that your son was meeting.
You know, his boss said that he had just gotten a divorce.
How'd that go?
Well, Ricky and Cindy were on good terms.
No kids, thank God.
Was he seeing anyone?
I don't think so.
He wasn't ready.
I could tell.
May we see his room?
He moved back two months ago, after they sold their condo.
Did your son have a problem with drugs?
No.
Why?
Well, the park that he was found at, it's a known drug hotspot.
Mom?
Dad?
Oh, Matt!
Matt...
Matt...
Ted, Ricky's gone.
I know, Dad.
These are the detectives.
Ricky was our kid brother.
We understand.
We'll do everything we can.
Let's go.
Come on, Mom.
Well, the dope slingers should be back on the job.
You search all you want, Officer, we're clean.
We're law-abiding.
See, the thing is, me and my partner were watching you, and you kept putting your hands down your pants, so it got me to thinking what the guy has got down his pants.
You mind?
Hey!
Hey, man!
Feels like Smallville in here.
What is this behind your sack?
Where'd you get this?
Collecting empties.
Are you sure it's the same bills?
You might want to take a whiff.
Aw, man, come on, man, don't do that.
Let's take a walk, short stuff.
That was harsh.
Come here.
Sit down.
Sit down!
Let me tell you how this is going to go.
We're going to lean on your crew until somebody gives somebody up, anybody.
We don't care, just as long as we've got a body to stand before the judge.
You dig?
My crew didn't do the dude.
We heard a fight.
People yelling and screaming, so I sent Momo to check it out.
Look, I saw the dude, he was lying on the walk.
You know what I'm saying?
He wasn't moving, so he was dead.
I went back and told Big Chuck.
I figured the heat was coming, so we cleared out.
We didn't kill that dude.
We didn't go near him.
Anybody who says different, they're lying out of their mouth.
They're right for this killing in every respect, except for motive.
Well, what about a difference of opinion on a drug deal?
Not likely.
Everybody we talked to said Devon was a straight arrow.
Really?
His tox report back that up?
Uh, no.
It's not in.
We're still waiting on it.
What we do know is Devon had Mexican an hour before he got his head slammed against a tree.
Latent found prints on that key that was left behind in the bathroom.
The set belongs to a Diego Cardenas.
Back in the '90s, he did a bit for assault with a deadly.
He was also a dues-paying member of the Latin Aces.
Find out who gets his dues nowadays.
Man, that was another lifetime.
It's all behind me now.
No way the city would put an active gang-banger in charge of a group home.
Once a felon, right?
I know how it is.
That's okay.
Nobody owes me a break.
You ever go to the park on Hutchison, Mr. Cardenas?
Sure.
I've been to that park with my residents.
When was the last time?
Matter of fact, it was yesterday.
Yesterday?
When, precisely?
In the morning.
You use the bathroom there?
Sure.
Did I forget to put the seat down?
Don't be a smart-ass.
You recognize this?
It's mine.
I took it off when I washed my hands.
Last night, you mean, around 8:00.
No, I told you, I was there in the morning.
With your residents.
We'd like to talk to them.
Sure.
Forty-eight minutes past 10:00.
We stayed 73 minutes and we left at one minute after 12:00.
12:01.
Is that an official police pen?
Yeah, I guess it is.
Here.
Did any of you guys see Mr. Cardenas use the bathroom in the park?
The bathroom's on the bad side.
The bad side?
The side of the park with the bad people.
Diego says we're not allowed to go there.
What kind of coffee do you have at the police station?
The regular kind.
We only saw one bathroom in the park.
I like coffee.
How many cups of coffee can you have at the police station?
Um, as much as you want, I think.
Looks like we're going to need a field trip.
That's the bathroom in the bad part of the park.
See, that's the bad guys over there.
It's better if you don't point, okay?
So, where's the bathroom you guys are allowed to use?
That's it.
What do mean, the diner?
The owner lets them use the bathroom.
Okay, listen up, people.
Yesterday, did any of you guys see Mr. Cardenas go into this bathroom right here?
No.
Uh-uh.
No.
Diego didn't use the bathroom.
Thank you.
Keep them close by.
Yeah, yeah.
Come on.
Seems to me, you going into this bathroom is something they would've noticed.
You can't rely on their memory.
Oh, I don't know, Diego.
Their memory seems pretty good to us.
Okay, look.
I came back to the park later, by myself.
I'm gay, all right?
I wanted to hook up with somebody.
So did you hook up?
I changed my mind.
I was here maybe 15 minutes, walking around.
Show us where you walked.
Like down that path.
But I got a bad vibe from the pipe-heads.
I went back to the home.
But first you washed your hands?
I was real nervous, okay.
But I was not here when that man was killed.
I didn't see anything.
Can I go now?
Sure.
We got fans.
He said he was back at the group home an hour before Devon was killed.
You check with the folks at the home?
Those folks?
They have their hands full keeping track of their own whereabouts.
And Cardenas' story, it just doesn't hold.
Well, maybe Devon was cruising the bathroom, too.
Maybe Devon was the aggressor.
His tox report finally came in.
He's clean for drugs.
Unfortunately, it doesn't tell us if he was gay.
I got the dumps from Devon's cell.
Check this out, two weeks ago.
He called the group home.
Mmm-hmm.
Sounds like Devon and Cardenas had a thing going.
Right, and that thing got broken last night.
Look, it's going to be dark in a couple of hours, so before you take another run at Mr. Cardenas, see if any of the regulars can put him in the park at the time of the murder.
Look, my girl's waiting for me at home, and if I don't bring her the candy right now...
Yeah, I know how it is.
Just look at the pictures.
Lupes.
Keep looking.
Tell him what you told me, Lewis.
Big Chuck and Momo were looking for a witness that saw them with that dead body Tuesday night.
What kind of witness?
They couldn't make out who he was.
Momo said the dude ran off.
Come here, outside.
This witness, it has to be Diego.
He saw the dope slingers at the body, and maybe he even saw them kill Devon.
That's why he's been lying to us.
He's afraid.
Big Chuck saw us with Diego this afternoon.
He might figure he's turning snitch.
We got to get him off the street.
Yeah, the group home's on the corner of Moffit and 156th.
We need a patrol car to 85 that forthwith.
Stay put, all right?
We'll call you back.
That was the group home.
Diego, he took one of the residents on a walk two hours ago.
The resident came back alone.
I'll call Operations.
We got a report of shots fired.
The ID in his pocket matches the teletype.
We're still canvassing for witnesses, but don't hold your breath.
It's him.
Shot in the mouth.
Subtle.
Man, I didn't do that.
I don't even know who that is.
This is the witness who saw you with the body in the park Tuesday night.
Well, he ain't much of a witness now.
And he ain't got nothing to do with me.
We heard that you were on the hunt for this man.
I tell you again, I didn't kill nobody.
Not that white dude, and not this dude.
We'll see what Momo has to say about it.
Me and Momo, we got one mind on things.
Well, they killed Devon and now they've killed the only witness.
Brilliant.
Cardenas was with one of the residents when he was snatched?
A mentally retarded resident.
Well, you've got to go with what you've got.
Talk to him.
I'll bring extra coffee.
Diego and me were going to the 99-cent store.
We took a shortcut through the alley, and Diego saw this big guy.
And Diego told me to go right home.
But I didn't want to.
I wanted to go to the 99-cent store.
But Diego said to go home right now, and he called me the T-word.
Tard!
What happened to Diego?
He was in the alley with the big guy and some other guy.
I didn't care.
He called me the T-word.
He wanted you to leave, Freddie.
He was trying to protect you.
You tell us if you recognize any of these guys from the alley.
I have autism-related face-recognition deficit.
I can't remember faces.
It's true, he can't, he can't.
That's no good.
Do you remember anything else about this big guy?
Maybe the clothes he was wearing?
No.
Did you notice if there was a car in the alley?
There were lots of cars in the alley, and on the street, too.
You want the license plate numbers?
For which car?
All of them.
Sure.
Go for it.
Hey, it says that Diego cooked dinner on Tuesday.
Tuesday's Chinese night.
Diego makes the best eggrolls, nice and big.
What time was dinner?
Dinner on Tuesday night started at 7:03 and ended at 8:16.
Did Diego eat dinner with you guys?
Diego always eats dinner with us.
That's part of his job.
And then he helps us clean up.
Devon was killed around 8:00.
Diego couldn't have been in the park.
Why didn't he just tell us he was here the whole time?
Maybe because he's protecting who was really in the park, the person who left the key behind.
Mmm-hmm.
Mike.
Yeah?
Was anyone missing from dinner on Tuesday?
Yeah.
Pete.
Pete was working late.
Where's Pete now?
When he gets into a fight at the home, he runs here.
Something about sorting recyclables cools him out.
Man, I hope the poor guy's okay.
Well, we think Diego put him somewhere for his protection.
Maybe somebody here took him in.
He's got a lot of fans around here, but, uh, no, I would've heard about it.
Did he ever talk about other people he knows outside the group home?
He's never mentioned any family.
He did say he had a new friend.
Who was that?
Uh, young guy, about 40, clean cut.
This him?
That's him.
He showed up here two weeks ago, at the end of Pete's shift.
Rick never mentioned anyone named Pete.
Pete Harris.
He's mentally retarded.
No.
This man, Pete, is missing, Mr. Devon, and we need to find him.
Now, he told people that your son was his friend.
It really threw Rick for a loop.
Maybe he was trying to do some charity work, trying to ground himself.
Maybe he told something about it to Mrs. Devon.
Well, maybe.
I'll ask her.
Right now she's taking a nap.
Parents shouldn't outlive their kids.
It's not meant to be.
All right, you got a guy with an IQ of 50 who witnessed a murder, and two homies after him, where would you stash him?
Maybe you disappear him into the mental health system.
The LUDs from Diego's office phone.
Tuesday night at 11:00, he called a state hospital in Staten Island.
Then three more calls on Wednesday.
That's a nice badge, Officer.
You see mine?
It means I can't give you any information unless you're his doctor, his immediate family or his legal guardian.
Look, why don't you tell me who Mr. Harris' family is and we can get them down here...
Unless you are a member of the patient's immediate family,
I can't give you the name of his family.
Yeah, I get it.
Thank you.
These people...
Forget it.
That nice-looking Filipino nurse down there told me Pete's missing from his room.
She said he was upset and confused.
The garbage room for the hospital, where is it?
Pete?
Yeah?
Yeah, that's me.
Hi, we're police officers.
Diego sent us to find you.
Diego told me to wait for him here at the hospital.
He said it would be safe here.
Right.
We know.
Are you taking me home?
Well, we have to make a couple of stops first, but I promise to get you home okay.
All right?
See you, man.
Come down and help out anytime.
All right?
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Thanks.
You're not in trouble, all right?
We just need your help to solve a crime.
You think you can help us?
Yeah.
Yeah?
All right, you want to sit down?
Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
All you got to do is answer some questions the best you can, and tell the truth, all right?
Yeah, okay.
Pete, do you recognize this?
Uh, it's my key.
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.
I forgot it in the bathroom in the park when I washed my hands after I did number one.
That's right.
What were you doing in the park?
Walking with my friend Rick.
He took me out to a Mexican restaurant, and we had Mexican food.
Yeah.
What happened?
Why did you run off and forget your key?
I was scared.
I heard Rick scream, and I went outside, and he was bleeding...
The bad guys were there, and I was scared.
I ran away.
I ran home.
I told Diego about Rick and the bad guys, and he said, "Don't tell anyone, or the bad guys will hurt you."
I was just so scared.
It's okay, you're safe.
I was so scared.
You're safe.
It's all right.
Pete.
Yeah?
Do you recognize any of these men?
Hey, Pete.
Look at me.
We're not going to let the bad guys hurt you, okay?
Okay.
Take your time.
You have trouble seeing, Pete?
No.
I'm just...
I'm looking at their noses.
I saw him.
Yeah, he was there when Rick was on the ground.
What about these men?
Did you see any of them, Pete?
His nose?
No, his whole face.
Pete, you did really good, okay?
We'll be right back.
"Docket number 85632.
People v. Charles Thomas and Daryl Main,
"one count of murder in the second degree,
"one count of murder in the first degree."
First degree?
Defendants murdered a presumed witness to the original killing.
The People are getting a little ahead of themselves there.
I believe they need to prove the first murder first.
I take it that's a plea of not guilty?
Yes.
On both counts.
Same here.
People request remand.
Both defendants have long criminal records with histories of violence.
I don't think that's...
Don't bother, Counselor.
I can read.
Remand.
Next.
What do you say?
Bake-off?
Sure, which one you want?
One of you does life without parole, the other gets the prize:
25 to life.
First squeal gets the deal.
Do I look stupid to you, man?
We have the witness you thought you were killing, the one who saw you in the park.
Yo, man, I told you, we didn't kill that dude in the park.
Okay, so, let's talk about Mr. Cardenas.
Now, we have a witness who says you were looking for him, and a witness who got your license plate number off your car at the scene.
It's nice of Big Chuck to let you drive.
If Cardenas bled, sweat or breathed in that car, we'll find his DNA and you'll die in prison in about the year 2070.
You better bring a book.
Let me talk to my client.
Take your time.
I'll go see how my colleague is doing with Big Chuck.
Wait.
He'll plead on Cardenas and implicate Big Chuck.
But no deal on Rick Devon.
What did you get?
Well, Big Chuck says he rolls into clubs and he rolls at the Bowlmor, but he don't roll on his homeboys.
So I win.
You know, just because you tell them it's a contest, doesn't mean it is one.
Then how come you're such a sore loser?
Wait a minute, why will he plead on one murder and not the other?
It's a packaged deal.
He says they didn't kill Devon.
We're gonna have to prove it.
I'd better go prep our star witness.
I went inside, and Ricky stayed out here.
Did you see the bad men when you went into the bathroom?
No.
We were talking about birdies.
Over there.
I feed them bread.
Pete, where exactly was Ricky when you went into the bathroom?
He...
Here.
His body ended up over there.
Yeah.
That's where I saw them when I came out.
I heard yelling.
But I had to wash my hands for 60 seconds, 'cause it kills the germs.
But I heard more yelling.
All right.
It's okay.
So you stopped washing and what happened?
Ricky was on the ground with the bad man over there.
Did you see them push him, or fight with him?
He wasn't moving.
I ran away.
And I told Diego, and he said it wasn't my fault.
Let's take a break, buddy.
Wasn't my fault.
No.
Wasn't your fault.
Maybe they were just stealing his watch after he was dead.
Hey, they killed the other dude, right?
Maybe because he'd finger them for a crime they didn't do.
Listen, just call me if he remembers anything else.
They like the white part and the crust.
Ah.
I don't like the crust.
We're talking about birdies.
Yeah, I always liked them, even when I was a baby.
Really?
Yeah.
You remember way back then?
No.
Ricky told me.
Ricky told you?
Yeah.
He gave me a picture.
That...
See?
Look here.
It's me.
Where did Ricky get that picture from?
Uh, I don't know.
Pete remembered something else.
Rick Devon gave him a baby picture of himself.
Of himself?
No, of Pete.
Devon had a baby picture of Pete.
We dug up Pete's records.
He was turned over to the Department of Mental Hygiene in 1964 by his parents,
Stanley and Ruth Devon.
But his last name is Harris.
Yeah, some clerk changed it.
It's just how they did it then.
It's not the most rational bureaucracy.
Rick Devon was Pete's brother?
Yeah, he was born a year after Pete was thrown into Willowbrook, which was a hospital for mental defectives.
It was a hellhole.
They shut it down.
And 40 years later, Rick Devon tracks his brother down?
He got in contact with the Department of Mental Hygiene two months ago.
They were happy to hear from him, sent him a full family reunification kit.
And the rest of the family knew nothing about this?
Talk to the father again.
I want you gone, before my wife gets here.
Mr. Devon, we need to know about this.
Your son was murdered.
That's right.
And after that...
After that, how is it going to make things better to dredge up something that we forgot about 44 years ago?
You never had any contact with Pete?
No.
My wife...
It was the best way.
Everybody said so.
Doctors and experts.
Pete was your son, just like Rick.
He was nothing like Rick.
He wouldn't stop crying.
He wouldn't eat his food.
One day my wife came in and found him bent over his kiddy car.
He couldn't get up.
He was suffocating.
Any other child on earth would have known how to get up.
My wife had two other sons to take care of, and she was pregnant.
But a state hospital for a 3-year-old?
Well, that's the way people did it back then.
And, lady, you weren't there.
Could we take another look at Rick's room, please?
What was in here?
I have no idea.
He always kept that one locked.
The lock was forced.
Somebody broke into it.
Who's been in this room?
I...
I don't know.
Just the family.
The Department of Mental Hygiene sent Rick Devon a set of these forms.
It's a family reunification kit.
But his forms weren't in his office and they weren't in his room.
Someone who wanted Pete to disappear again cleaned them out of that drawer.
The parents have been ignoring Pete's existence since 1964.
The older brother, he probably remembers him, but he hasn't said a word.
I mean, everybody seems too concerned that Mrs. Devon will explode if someone mentions Pete's name.
Denial gone toxic.
Could be a motive for murder in that.
Or this.
The state has been paying for Pete's upkeep for the last 44 years.
This is a form that would figure the family's financial contribution.
A strain on the family budget.
Hello?
Uh, okay, just tell them to wait.
Thanks.
Pete's family wants to see him.
The loving family that abandoned him 40 years ago.
One of whom might just have murdered the only member who gave a damn.
Better send a bodyguard.
Which one is going to be my dad?
The old one, Pete.
What are my brothers' names?
Matt and Ted.
How will I know which one Ted is?
When we have a party, we wear tags.
Don't worry about it.
You're going to do just fine.
You ready?
Yeah.
This was taken a little while before you went away, Pete.
Rick must have found it when he moved back in.
Do you remember me?
I don't remember you.
Yeah, Pete, I do.
How are they treating you, Pete, at the place where you live?
Nice.
And the food is good.
And I have a job, and I used to have a girlfriend.
Daryl.
I want you to know, we're all very sorry you were sent away.
Is that really fair?
To Mom and Dad?
You were too young to remember.
I had a little brother, and one day he was gone.
And maybe that was for the best.
I don't think this is the time.
When would be a better time?
No, he's right.
Why don't you boys get some refreshments for our guests?
Rough party, huh?
You don't seem too thrilled to have Pete back in the family.
What's the point, after all this time?
I mean, you saw my mother.
He was fine where he was.
Oh, damn it.
What?
Our long-lost brother only takes his soda out of a plastic bottle.
He won't have it any other way.
You remember that?
No, I was a baby when they put him away.
Ted told me.
At least we know Ted feels something.
To remember that after all these years.
I'm not so sure.
They didn't have plastic soda bottles 44 years ago.
You guys okay?
The police are searching my apartment and my office.
I thought you had the drug freaks that killed my brother.
Well, I thought so, too.
And now you think I did it?
Well, my colleague, Ms. Rubirosa, and the police have developed a theory.
What theory?
That you heard about Pete through your brother Rick, because there's no other way you could have known that Pete likes plastic bottles.
I didn't say plastic bottles, I said bottles.
Well, your brother Matt said that you said plastic.
Wait a minute.
So, you're saying that I killed Rick?
Not on purpose.
I'm saying you had every reason to be upset.
This is unbelievable.
Did you get a confession this time?
One for two.
The police find anything?
No.
But we did get a call from the group home.
Pete's upset about something.
Nothing.
He won't eat.
He won't go to his job.
It all started right after that visit to his family.
What was it, Pete?
Was it something about your family?
Pete, please.
They didn't like me when I was a baby, and I don't want them to be mad at me again.
Why would they get mad at you, Pete?
I heard that voice.
What voice?
The voice that was yelling at Ricky when I was in the bathroom.
He was there.
Same voice.
He was where, Pete?
With my dad and mommy.
He was one of the brothers.
The one being nice to me.
Ted.
You're not welcome here anymore.
We know what you're trying to do with Ted.
Look, is he here, sir?
Ted Devon, you're under arrest.
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?
What is going on?
Put your hands behind your back.
Stop!
It's all right.
Wait a minute.
Wait!
Ma, it's all right.
We dropped the first murder charge against the drug dealers and indicted Ted Devon for second-degree murder.
Premeditated?
He intended to kill his brother?
Well, if he didn't, let him plead.
I'm open.
You ought to be.
With your case resting on a mentally retarded ear-witness.
How's he going to hold up on cross?
Maybe not so good.
His family wants Pete to move back in with them.
After 44 years?
They want to pooch his testimony.
We've got to keep them away.
How?
He's an adult.
He can go where he wants.
You're screwed.
You sure about this, Pete?
You don't have to go in there.
No, no, I want to.
No matter what, you're still going to do the right thing, right?
Do I look okay?
Sure.
You look fine.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
And how was your brother's business doing, Mr. Devon?
Not too well, I think.
You think?
Why did you write Ted a check for $2,000 a few months ago?
It was a loan, so he could pay his rent.
We all helped him out.
We're a family.
And your father helped, too?
Dad loaned him what he could.
"What he could."
He'd have a lot less money to help Ted if he had to pay a bill from the state for Pete's upkeep, isn't that right?
Well, I suppose.
Sure.
Thank you.
How happy were you to learn that your brother Pete had been rediscovered?
I wasn't.
I knew it would be very upsetting to my mother.
So if you'd known what Rick was doing, you would have been angry with him.
I just don't think it was necessary.
You just said that when Ted needed help, you loaned him $2,000.
That doesn't sound like very much.
It was all I could spare.
I've had some financial troubles of my own.
So you think Rick was wrong to dig up your retarded brother?
And you have financial troubles, so you would have suffered from a drain on family resources.
Sounds like you had the same motives to fight with Rick that Ted did.
Maybe you killed him.
Objection.
Withdrawn.
No more questions.
Ricky and me, we walked to the park.
Yeah.
And what happened after you got there, Pete?
I...
I don't know.
I mean, I don't remember, yeah.
Pete, do you remember what you told the grand jury about this, under oath?
Yeah.
Do you remember saying that you went into the bathroom and Rick stayed outside?
I guess.
And you heard someone yelling at Rick?
Yeah, okay, I said that.
And that you later recognized the voice of the person yelling?
It was your brother, Ted.
I...
I don't know.
You said that because it was true, isn't that right?
No, that wasn't true.
Now, aren't you saying that now because your family told you to?
No.
It wasn't true, 'cause I was lying.
I...
Teddy didn't hurt Ricky.
I did.
Yeah, Ricky wanted me to live with him, and I didn't even know him, and I...
I like where I live.
Pete...
We argumented and I pushed him and he fell and he hit his head.
That's the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
Yeah, that's it.
That's it.
Okay.
I can't believe that family is throwing Pete to the wolves, again.
Getting him to confess to a murder he didn't commit.
Why not?
What's the downside?
Ted goes free, so does Pete.
Even if you charge him with perjury, no judge will send him to prison.
Why perjury?
Why not murder?
Because he obviously didn't do it.
He says he did.
We all know he's lying.
What kind of pathological prosecutor would actually charge him?
Call the cops.
Tell them to arrest Pete Devon for murder.
I thought I was supposed to be the hard-ass.
You can't be serious about this.
Dead serious, Mr. Devon.
It doesn't make any sense.
If they found Pete guilty, they would just send him back to his group home.
I promise you that's not going to happen.
He confessed to a murder.
He'd go to prison?
That's the way it works.
Oh.
I'm not sure why this is so hard for you.
You've sent Pete away once before.
Ruthie, he's just trying to upset us.
You don't know what things were like back then.
The doctors tested Petey and they said he was a moron.
That was the medical term, moron.
So he was a victim once, makes it easier to make him a victim again.
All the doctors said it was the right thing to do.
Ruthie, look, he's bluffing, don't you see?
It doesn't make any sense.
First, he doesn't get to say where Petey goes.
And second, he knows that Pete can win some kind of "not guilty by mental deficiency."
And third...
Stop!
That was how you counted off the reasons 40 years ago.
Seven good reasons why we should give Petey away.
First, he would be a burden to me.
Second, he needed medical care we couldn't give him.
And on and on and on, all those logical reasons.
And I gave away my baby.
I can't do it again.
I will not do it again.
I'm 50 years old.
But when Rick told me he wanted to bring Petey home, it all came back.
The tantrums, the messes, my mother crying.
Our whole life was a mess.
I told Rick what it would do to our mother, to the family.
We argued and I...
I followed him into the park.
I guess I was curious to see Pete.
And when he went into the bathroom, I went up to Rick.
We argued again.
Things got out of hand.
And I shoved him, hard.
I didn't mean to kill him.
You've pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the second degree.
Was that plea made of your own free will?
Yes, it was.
Very well.
I'll set an early date for sentencing.
Meanwhile, you are remanded to the custody of the Department of Correction.
Forty-four years.
That's a lot of catching up.

- Guess what she told me.
- Is there a prize?
- Andy, I'm being serious.
- Mummy?
Where's Mummy?
- She's on the sofa.
What's the matter?
It's Mummy's boyfriend Fido.
- He hasn't dumped her?
- Debbie, she's a dog.
- No, it's worse.
- He's been eaten?
- Debbie.
- Can I speak?
I'm having a crisis here.
As you were.
Mummy's boyfriend... died.
Died in the middle of doing a number two.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, this is freaking me out.
Mother Teresa was right.
The number two was a sign.
(Simon) Ha-ha-ha.
Looked like my Machiavellian plan was working.
Blimey.
How many pictures of Jesus does Granny need?
- I need to lie down.
- I'll Join you.
- On my own.
- Like I want to get in with you, Windy Miller.
It's the dog.
Come on.
Come on, Mummy!
Come on.
Ma says you can never have too many pictures of the Good Lord.
Poor thing.
The crown o' thorns looks awful uncomfortable.
So does the sombrero.
I didn't know Jesus went to Spain.
That's cousin Peter in Magaluf.
You feckin' eeJit.
(Simon) The problem with hatching Machiavellian plans when you're 13 years old is you don't often think of the consequences like my mother becoming obsessed with her "gift".
I know you're there, you know.
- Can you sense me?
- I could smell your Anus Anus.
I had to Jump in with you.
There's no one else I can turn to.
Mm, are you worried about Andy's mum?
When's she being released?
Tomorrow, and it's "discharged" when you're talking about hospital.
- Depends which hospital.
- Anyway, it's not that.
You see, I've been mulling it all over, and the significance of number two is there's gonna be two deaths in close succession.
I Just know it.
- Have you seen Mr Cartwright recently?
- Take a wild guess.
I put a note through saying I was going up the ASDA.
I haven't heard a dicky-bird.
- I thought he would've Jumped at the chance.
- Mr Cartwright Jump?
People with wooden legs can Jump, Hayley.
Girl I was at school with had a plastic ankle.
Catholic Girls trampolining champion two years on the trot.
- Hm.
- Weren't bad at trotting, neither.
Has Mr Cartwright heard anything more about the fine he got for flashing outside the girls school?
- He's appealing.
- Them girls didn't think so.
Ha.
Hasn't been any sign of life from his house for ages.
- Oh!
- What?
There is a girl walking past and his nets aren't twitching.
- (Knocking)
- Mr Cartwright!
Oh!
Mr Cartwright!
(Simon) Had she found her second death?
(Breaking glass)
(TV hisses)
Oh, Mr Cartwright.
Flashing even in death.
- Eh?
- Aaagh!
Put Baywatch back on, you stupid tart!
(Simon) So although my mum's quest was far from over, it seemed that Aunt Hayley could smell a fish.
So the worrying thing is, with Mr Cartwright still breathing, who's next?
- Remember the voice.
- Yeah, all right, put a sock in it.
- (Chuckles)
- You'll scare the children.
- What?
- Nothing.
I'm pleased with my table decoration.
All from the garden.
I've had years of pleasure from my creeping vagina.
Oh, Mum.
- Have you been hearing voices, Aunty Hayley?
- Don't be so stupid.
- What would that make her if she had?
- Pure mental.
A basket case, a lunatic fringe.
Or psychic.
Sometimes when people hear voices it's other people playing tricks on them.
Only an evil person would do that, someone with a sick, bitter and twisted mind.
And racist, because they've been impersonating an Asian person, if they were white.
I'm not racist.
(Debbie) No one said you were.
All about you, isn't it?
What the hell are you lot talking about?
- What you reading, Ashlene?
- ParisMatch.
I'm thinking of moving to Paris and selling my body to existentialists on the Left Bank.
Oh.
Well, it's nice to have ambitions.
Either that or I might stop on at Woolworths.
- Oh, look at Simon's face.
- Oh, yeah, it's hilarious!
Bet he can't wait for his old gran to get here.
Oh, yeah, Simon.
At last a bit of normality amongst the chaos, eh, Simon?
Cos, I mean, you're as pure as the driven snow.
- You'd never mess with anyone's head.
- (Simon) Weird.
The person with the worst sight in our house was seeing right through me.
(# Bee Gees...
How Deep Is Your Love)
(Simon) Still, she had a point.
If they ever gave out awards for nicest person on the planet...
You sit down, love.
You've greater need of it than me.
... my gran would win hands down.
(Bee Gees) # And the moment that you wander far from me... (Simon) She didn't ram her religion down your throat like some people.
(Grunting)
- But instead she led by example.
- Here, take the lot.
You've greater need of it than me.
And being my gran, she spoiled me mercilessly.
Wow!
- Ha-ha-ha!
- What's that?
My wedding dress.
Sure he's greater need of it than me.
Did you see the beautiful poncho he made me?
Look.
But then she got a bit depressed after my grandad died and had to go into hospital for what Mum and Dad would only tell me was... (Both) An operation.
Little boys who mess with their mummies' heads and don't do something about it go to hell and burn there... for eternity.
Dorito?
Thanks for everything.
Was she a Joy to look after?
She's such a love.
A good Christian woman, if ever there was one.
Could have been a nun.
(Sighs) Listen, love, you know, when they have this procedure, sometimes they get a slight personality change.
- D'you know what I mean?
- Oh, right.
- Come on, Ma.
- I'm coming.
Come on, Andy, take a hand.
- Now gently does it.
Another step.
- Thank you.
There we go.
Oh!
Look at that funny little thing in the chair, Andy, look at her.
Oh, well, less of the "little", actually.
Hello!
Tell me, can you hear the sleigh bells ringing?
No?
Well, I'll tell you why you can't hear them ringing and why you'll never hear them ringing.
Because there's no such fuckin' thing as Santa Claus, that's why.
D'you get me now?
- (# Blur...
Song 2)
- Ha-ha-ha!
Oh, look at this.
Danny La Rue and Stevie Wonder.
Heh-heh!
# Oh, yeah #
(Simon) So although some things never change, like Ulrika Jonsson being annoying or a crisp white shirt being the all-season wardrobe filler...
The British Airports Authority says
- that a fifth terminal at Heathrow...
- (Rumbling)
(Simon)... it would appear that some things do, ...irrevocably.
- (Whooping and chuckling)
Is Gran rollerskating up there?
- (Smash) - (Rumbling restarts)
- (Bumping) - (Screaming)
- Oh, Jesus, God!
Oh!
Oh!
- (Others) Yes.
Who put those feckin' stairs there?
- Pat, thanks for this.
- Oh, it's no trouble.
(Pauline) Papadopoulos couldn't get anyone to cover for me this morning.
- Nice, Mum, the liver?
- Yours?
Mm, I thought I could taste the Pernod Black.
- Nice, though, yeah?
- Some people might say nice.
People who would enjoy chewing rubbery tyres.
- (EastEnders theme tune)
- Can someone switch over to Corrie?
- Coronation Street, Mum, your favourite.
- Gabby Northern no-necks.
- I'd shoot them all down their hairnets.
- I won't be late.
- Since when did she become a floozy?
- I'm not a floozy.
Oh, all right, then.
A prostitute, you dirty little whore, you.
- Mum, she's not a prostitute.
- No?
No.
She Just dresses like one.
Well, you can't pull the wool over my eyes.
Mam, stop it.
Why are you being like this?
Ah, get a backbone, will you?
Or a bit of personality.
And you, ditch the halitosis, come on.
I wouldn't go in there.
Can we say good night to Gran before retiring?
Hey, you're not 65 yet.
Oh, the blind one still thinks she's funny, does she?
Mum, do you mind?
The blind one happens to be my best mate.
Mates?
Mates, is it now?
I'll tell you what I'd call it.
A coven.
- Gran?
- At least you're not wearing a dress for once.
Or is that a flame-proof nightie poking out from between your flaps?
- Gran.
- Good evening, Mrs Doonan.
And who's Peter Piccaninny?
He's my friend Kylie, and we're having a slumber party like in Grease.
Olivia Newton-John?
She was a slut as well.
Ma.
You can't go around using words like that.
And why not?
I never lied to any of yous.
If I had my own way, I'd be in a home.
- Mum.
- Y'are in a home.
You're in our home and we're happy to have you here.
Oh, really?
Then why are you thinking right now, "I can't wait to see the back of that loopy bitch"?
You see?
I can read your mind now.
I can see the words hanging in the air above your head.
It's a gift.
- Gran, please don't be so beastly.
- Beastly?
(Chuckles) Beastly?
Who do you think you are, Enid Blyton?
Well, off you go and have an adventure on Billycock Hill with your four other freaks.
(Running steps)
You've upset the poor lad.
Good.
Life is hard and then you have a lobotomy.
Eurgh!
What is that shite I'm drinking?
- I've had enough of this.
I'm watching Corrie.
- Oh!
You have not had a lobotomy.
This isn't the dark ages.
You Just had a light spot of ECT.
Name the shite.
It's potato wine.
I can get you a cup of tea if you don't like it.
No, I'll make the tea.
You'll save on the rat poison.
- Ma, no one is trying to poison you.
- (Police sirens on TV)
What's happening?
Don Brennan's died driving Alma Sedgewick's MG Midget through a viaduct.
- That's what it looks like.
- D'you think this could be the second death?
- (Advert Jingle) - (Man on TV)... stopping fast.
Oh, no, I tell a lie.
It's an advert for brake pads.
You know, I've sent a psychic message to the Pope to ask him to aid me in healing me arm.
So I'm expecting a visitation from him any minute now.
- (Doorbell)
- Ah, there's His Holiness.
- Get me my merkin.
- (Chuckles)
- Yes?
- Is Mrs Doonan in?
- Yeah, I'm Mrs Doonan.
- No.
Gwen.
- Oh.
Who should I say is calling?
- Her fiancé.
(Pop music plays)
- Your gran's weird.
- She does everything back to front now.
From now on I won't call her Gran.
I'll call her Narg.
It's "Gran" back to front.
So she's had some kind of illness that's completely changed her personality?
- Hope it's not catching.
- I know.
Might start liking Baddiel and Skinner.
Don't worry, Kylie.
We're never going to change.
One day we'll move to London...
- # It's coming home, it's coming home...
...and live amongst the beautiful people.
- # It's coming home, it's coming...
- And everything will be fabulous in our world.
# Football's coming home, it's coming home
- # It's coming...
- Kylie.
Shut up.
God.
- (Upstairs) Oh!
Oh!
- We want those close to us to be happy.
No one wants to hear their own mother be really happy.
- (Upstairs) Oh...
- She said she met him in the hospital.
Do you think he's a patient?
From the smell of his raincoat, I'm guessing he weren't a senior registrar.
(Sighs)
- Aha.
Ha.
- Oh.
I'm not sure how much more of this I can take.
Surely to God it can't go on much longer.
No, I mean her living with us.
She's a bloody Saga lout.
- (Upstairs) Yes!
- Oh!
Oh!
- Oh!
- Oh!
You know Carmelita on Descant Drive?
Twenty stone, Jaws wired, drinks purified chips through a straw?
- (Upstairs) Oh!
- She's the matron of a care home.
- Council-run.
Wouldn't cost a penny. - Debbie, I can't believe this.
Ma's sick.
People would look after her.
How would you like it if one day you started hearing voices?
Oh.
Oh, I forgot.
You already have.
- (Upstairs) Oh, yes!
- Oh!
- (Sighs)
- Oh, yes!
Oh, yes!
- Oh, oh, oh, oh!
- Oh, yes!
(Hayley) She's very unnerved.
At least when you and Andy have a bunk-up, you stick Maria Callas on full blast.
- D'you mind?
- She says she's a tap that's been turned off.
And I've turned her on.
She's a pioneer in the analogy field.
Well, she has been awful quiet this last half-hour, mind.
Ooh, don't think that's the second death, do you?
- What second death?
- Mum all right, is she?
I need a ciggie.
(Simon) According to the law of Sod, the minute you want to avoid something is the minute it slaps you round the face.
# It takes two, baby
# It takes two, baby
# Me and you
#Just takes two... (Andy mimicking Mother Teresa) It's a sign... sign... sign.
Two.
Twol
Two.
Two.
Two, two, two, twol
(Liverpool accent) 'Ey, ey, calm down, calm down.
(Normal) I ain't afraid of no ghost.
Oh!
You scared the living daylights out of me, Mother.
I am not your mother, Debbie, praise be to God.
(Simon) Ah, could this be a quaint Irish pastime, emptying one's wee in the sink?
(Sink gurgles)
And the infamous English equivalent...
- (Cigarette hisses) ...putting your fag out in it.
(Chuckling)
D'you like my fiancé, Ashlene?
You green with envy?
No.
He's old enough to be my grandad.
That's right, and very soon he will be, so hands off.
Mwah!
Mother, can we talk about you and Barry?
Big Barry, to you.
Oh, and believe me, ladies, he really does live up to his name.
- What are you looking at, you filthy tart?
- I don't know, Dracula's grandma?
Ah, the mouth on it.
- Are you really serious about marrying him?
- And why shouldn't I be?
Are you a racialist?
That's not the way your father and me brought you up.
Andy's not a racist.
Half his mates are black.
No, it's more that you picked him up in the... well, in that hospital.
Mental institutions are the latest pick-up Joints, are they?
Oh, it's a shame that you can't see, because I am giving you such a look right now.
Andy, I know it's hard for you, me movin' on and you gettin' over your dad.
But, you know, it's like havin' piles.
It's Just something you have to live with, you know.
Look, get... get me up.
Come on, get me up now.
Now, anybody want a one-armed fry-up?
- (Others) No.
- All right.
- Is she gonna be safe in there?
- She was always a dab hand in the kitchen.
Andy, she was always one to say her prayers and never say boo to a goose.
People change.
I can't relax.
What if I end up like her?
Why would you end up like that?
Look.
Mother spent 70 years of her life saying nothing apart from "Jesus loves you", being kind, nice, bottling everything up.
- So?
- So, you're not like that.
You're not that nice.
- You calling me a bitch?
- No.
Kids haven't said much for a while.
They OK?
- They're fine.
- Ooh, Mummy still breathing?
I'm not stupid.
I know you think you've had a premonition that someone's going to die.
But believe me, that's bollocks.
Nobody is going to die.
Say it.
- Debbie.
- Nobody's going to die.
- Say it louder like you mean it.
- Nobody's going to die.
- And again.
- Nobody's going to... (Ping)
(Rattling and clunking)
- (# The Feeling...
She's Gone)
- What happened?
Has the Good Lord put her out of her misery?
Oh, sweet Jesus, forgive me for all the bad thoughts I had about her.
She's dead.
Now she's dead and I never even told her I loved her!
- You didn't.
- I did so, you cheeky mare!
- You know I did!
- You know he did!
- It was your ma who didn't love her!
- I did!
Tell him, Hayls!
- She did.
It was me who couldn't stick her.
- Well, now you got what you wanted!
Oh, Andy!
Though if you're having a whip-round for her wreath, count me out.
Oh, my giddy aunt!
I thought I was going mad, and all along I had a gift!
Look, Simon!
Simon!
If you're still in the room.
If I've been funny with you lately, I apologise.
A toast!
To the best mother in the world!
Well, a few years ago before she went schizo.
After that, she was pure evil.
- To Mother!
- (Others) To Mother.
Narg?
Your microwave broke!
# What will be
- (Crash) - # She's gone
# Oh, I...
Oh, I...
I better learn how to face it... (Simon) So, yes, that day on Melody Crescent, the Doonan family really did learn that change is, of course, inevitable.
Oh, Christ.
I'm beginning to sound like her out of Desperate Housewives.
# Get up in the morning and look in the mirror
# The morning there's a toothbrush hanging on the stand
# My face ain't looking any younger... (Simon) And as my dad said goodbye to his mum and her lunatic leanings, it was time for me to kiss goodbye to my own mother's mental illness.
# She's gone, oh, I...
# Oh, I...
I better learn how to face it
# She's gone... #
(Phone rings)
8-5-1-9?
(Indian accent) Hello, Debbie.
It is me, Mother Teresa.
I'm Just ringing to say goodbye.
I will not be speaking to you again.
You had a gift but you didn't use it.
It made you think you was going mad, and you wasn't.
You will never hear from me or be psychic again.
You got that?
Have you got a parting message?
(Sighs) Your son is very upset by the death of his gran.
Could you... put his pocket money up?
By about... five pounds.
(Simon) Don't feel sorry for her.
She never gave me that raise.
- Those are your grandmother's teeth?
- Got it in one, sunshine.
You're seriously weird.
- Wait till you see what I did with her merkin.
- Yeah, right.
Water, please.
Oh, can you lend me two dollars?
That's a nice purse.
I wonder what I made that from.
Ew!
You're gross!
- (Laughs)
- I don't know why I go out with you.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
Cos you have a thing for slightly fey British window dressers?
You?
Slightly fey?
Shut up.
Yes, I know, it's like saying Kerry Katona's slightly chavvy.
Is she the poor woman who was held hostage in her own home?
Yes, though why she didn't Just lay on one of her Iceland buffets I'll never know.
That would scare any gunman off.
You have experience of gunmen?
I've had the odd pistol pointed me-wise over the years, believe it or not.
And some rather nasty explosions, to boot.
That must play havoc with your psyche.
I'm trying to get the stains out of a Nicole Farhi top and hot pants so it's no laughing matter, thank you very much.

Hm.
... partake of a nutritious diet and don't worry unnecessarily about personal hygiene.
(American accent) Are you dead?
(Horn sounds)
And if you are, might I have those quirky yet intriguing beads?
Not on your life.
(Simon) I didn't always live in glamorous New York.
I grew up in positively glumorous Reading, and the spring I was 13, my mum started charging people to read their tea leaves, even though rumour had it she was no Doris Stokes.

- Because it's shit.
- But I don't even watch it.

Voices from beyond the grave.
(Simon) Fantastic.
A marvellous opportunity to create mischief.

It sounded like the one from out of It Ain't Half Hot Mum.
- Who, Melvin Hayes?
- No, the pretend Asiany one.
- Oh, the offensive one, Rangi Ram?
- (Phone)
You been at the potato and baked bean wine?
(Ringing)
Hello, Hayley de Souza.
I see.
Oh, I see.
Yes, I am blind but I can still say, "I see."
Oh, I'm so sorry.
- I see.
- Oh, my God.
I know who it is.
Andy!
Oh.
I see.
- Andy, guess who Just spoke to me.
- (Irish) I'm going through my stuff.
Andy, you are not gonna believe this.
Oh, my God, I don't believe it.
Look, I'm shaking.
When do I shake?
When you saw George Michael skipping in John Lewis.
- Andy.
- You sang I Knew You Were Waiting For Me.
You harmonised.
I don't want to talk about George Michael.
Guess who Just spoke to me.
- Hayley.
- Mother Teresa.
Is she not dead?
Her spirit came through.
Clear, Andy, as a bell.
- Whatever happened to Andy Bell?
- Guess what she told me.
- Is there a prize?
- Andy, I'm being serious.
- Mummy?
Where's Mummy?
- She's on the sofa.
What's the matter?
It's Mummy's boyfriend Fido.
- He hasn't dumped her?
- Debbie, she's a dog.
- No, it's worse.
- He's been eaten?
- Debbie.
- Can I speak?
I'm having a crisis here.
As you were.
Mummy's boyfriend... died.
Died in the middle of doing a number two.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, this is freaking me out.
Mother Teresa was right.
The number two was a sign.
(Simon) Ha-ha-ha.
Looked like my Machiavellian plan was working.
Blimey.
How many pictures of Jesus does Granny need?
- I need to lie down.
- I'll Join you.
- On my own.
- Like I want to get in with you, Windy Miller.
It's the dog.
Come on.
Come on, Mummy!
Come on.
Ma says you can never have too many pictures of the Good Lord.
Poor thing.
The crown o' thorns looks awful uncomfortable.
So does the sombrero.
I didn't know Jesus went to Spain.
That's cousin Peter in Magaluf.
You feckin' eeJit.
(Simon) The problem with hatching Machiavellian plans when you're 13 years old is you don't often think of the consequences like my mother becoming obsessed with her "gift".
I know you're there, you know.
- Can you sense me?
- I could smell your Anus Anus.
I had to Jump in with you.
There's no one else I can turn to.
Mm, are you worried about Andy's mum?
When's she being released?
Tomorrow, and it's "discharged" when you're talking about hospital.
- Depends which hospital.
- Anyway, it's not that.
You see, I've been mulling it all over, and the significance of number two is there's gonna be two deaths in close succession.
I Just know it.
- Have you seen Mr Cartwright recently?
- Take a wild guess.
I put a note through saying I was going up the ASDA.
I haven't heard a dicky-bird.
- I thought he would've Jumped at the chance.
- Mr Cartwright Jump?
People with wooden legs can Jump, Hayley.
Girl I was at school with had a plastic ankle.
Catholic Girls trampolining champion two years on the trot.
- Hm.
- Weren't bad at trotting, neither.
Has Mr Cartwright heard anything more about the fine he got for flashing outside the girls school?
- He's appealing.
- Them girls didn't think so.
Ha.
Hasn't been any sign of life from his house for ages.
- Oh!
- What?
There is a girl walking past and his nets aren't twitching.
- (Knocking)
- Mr Cartwright!
Oh!
Mr Cartwright!
(Simon) Had she found her second death?
(Breaking glass)
(TV hisses)
Oh, Mr Cartwright.
Flashing even in death.
- Eh?
- Aaagh!
Put Baywatch back on, you stupid tart!
(Simon) So although my mum's quest was far from over, it seemed that Aunt Hayley could smell a fish.
So the worrying thing is, with Mr Cartwright still breathing, who's next?
- Remember the voice.
- Yeah, all right, put a sock in it.
- (Chuckles)
- You'll scare the children.
- What?
- Nothing.
I'm pleased with my table decoration.
All from the garden.
I've had years of pleasure from my creeping vagina.
Oh, Mum.
- Have you been hearing voices, Aunty Hayley?
- Don't be so stupid.
- What would that make her if she had?
- Pure mental.
A basket case, a lunatic fringe.
Or psychic.
Sometimes when people hear voices it's other people playing tricks on them.
Only an evil person would do that, someone with a sick, bitter and twisted mind.
And racist, because they've been impersonating an Asian person, if they were white.
I'm not racist.
(Debbie) No one said you were.
All about you, isn't it?
What the hell are you lot talking about?
- What you reading, Ashlene?
- ParisMatch.
I'm thinking of moving to Paris and selling my body to existentialists on the Left Bank.
Oh.
Well, it's nice to have ambitions.
Either that or I might stop on at Woolworths.
- Oh, look at Simon's face.
- Oh, yeah, it's hilarious!
Bet he can't wait for his old gran to get here.
Oh, yeah, Simon.
At last a bit of normality amongst the chaos, eh, Simon?
Cos, I mean, you're as pure as the driven snow.
- You'd never mess with anyone's head.
- (Simon) Weird.
The person with the worst sight in our house was seeing right through me.
(# Bee Gees...
How Deep Is Your Love)
(Simon) Still, she had a point.
If they ever gave out awards for nicest person on the planet...
You sit down, love.
You've greater need of it than me.
... my gran would win hands down.
(Bee Gees) # And the moment that you wander far from me... (Simon) She didn't ram her religion down your throat like some people.
(Grunting)
- But instead she led by example.
- Here, take the lot.
You've greater need of it than me.
And being my gran, she spoiled me mercilessly.
Wow!
- Ha-ha-ha!
- What's that?
My wedding dress.
Sure he's greater need of it than me.
Did you see the beautiful poncho he made me?
Look.
But then she got a bit depressed after my grandad died and had to go into hospital for what Mum and Dad would only tell me was... (Both) An operation.
Little boys who mess with their mummies' heads and don't do something about it go to hell and burn there... for eternity.
Dorito?
Thanks for everything.
Was she a Joy to look after?
She's such a love.
A good Christian woman, if ever there was one.
Could have been a nun.
(Sighs) Listen, love, you know, when they have this procedure, sometimes they get a slight personality change.
- D'you know what I mean?
- Oh, right.
- Come on, Ma.
- I'm coming.
Come on, Andy, take a hand.
- Now gently does it.
Another step.
- Thank you.
There we go.
Oh!
Look at that funny little thing in the chair, Andy, look at her.
Oh, well, less of the "little", actually.
Hello!
Tell me, can you hear the sleigh bells ringing?
No?
Well, I'll tell you why you can't hear them ringing and why you'll never hear them ringing.
Because there's no such fuckin' thing as Santa Claus, that's why.
D'you get me now?
- (# Blur...
Song 2)
- Ha-ha-ha!
Oh, look at this.
Danny La Rue and Stevie Wonder.
Heh-heh!
# Oh, yeah #
(Simon) So although some things never change, like Ulrika Jonsson being annoying or a crisp white shirt being the all-season wardrobe filler...
The British Airports Authority says
- that a fifth terminal at Heathrow...
- (Rumbling)
(Simon)... it would appear that some things do, ...irrevocably.
- (Whooping and chuckling)
Is Gran rollerskating up there?
- (Smash) - (Rumbling restarts)
- (Bumping) - (Screaming)
- Oh, Jesus, God!
Oh!
Oh!
- (Others) Yes.
Who put those feckin' stairs there?
- Pat, thanks for this.
- Oh, it's no trouble.
(Pauline) Papadopoulos couldn't get anyone to cover for me this morning.
- Nice, Mum, the liver?
- Yours?
Mm, I thought I could taste the Pernod Black.
- Nice, though, yeah?
- Some people might say nice.
People who would enjoy chewing rubbery tyres.
- (EastEnders theme tune)
- Can someone switch over to Corrie?
- Coronation Street, Mum, your favourite.
- Gabby Northern no-necks.
- I'd shoot them all down their hairnets.
- I won't be late.
- Since when did she become a floozy?
- I'm not a floozy.
Oh, all right, then.
A prostitute, you dirty little whore, you.
- Mum, she's not a prostitute.
- No?
No.
She Just dresses like one.
Well, you can't pull the wool over my eyes.
Mam, stop it.
Why are you being like this?
Ah, get a backbone, will you?
Or a bit of personality.
And you, ditch the halitosis, come on.
I wouldn't go in there.
Can we say good night to Gran before retiring?
Hey, you're not 65 yet.
Oh, the blind one still thinks she's funny, does she?
Mum, do you mind?
The blind one happens to be my best mate.
Mates?
Mates, is it now?
I'll tell you what I'd call it.
A coven.
- Gran?
- At least you're not wearing a dress for once.
Or is that a flame-proof nightie poking out from between your flaps?
- Gran.
- Good evening, Mrs Doonan.
And who's Peter Piccaninny?
He's my friend Kylie, and we're having a slumber party like in Grease.
Olivia Newton-John?
She was a slut as well.
Ma.
You can't go around using words like that.
And why not?
I never lied to any of yous.
If I had my own way, I'd be in a home.
- Mum.
- Y'are in a home.
You're in our home and we're happy to have you here.
Oh, really?
Then why are you thinking right now, "I can't wait to see the back of that loopy bitch"?
You see?
I can read your mind now.
I can see the words hanging in the air above your head.
It's a gift.
- Gran, please don't be so beastly.
- Beastly?
(Chuckles) Beastly?
Who do you think you are, Enid Blyton?
Well, off you go and have an adventure on Billycock Hill with your four other freaks.
(Running steps)
You've upset the poor lad.
Good.
Life is hard and then you have a lobotomy.
Eurgh!
What is that shite I'm drinking?
- I've had enough of this.
I'm watching Corrie.
- Oh!
You have not had a lobotomy.
This isn't the dark ages.
You Just had a light spot of ECT.
Name the shite.
It's potato wine.
I can get you a cup of tea if you don't like it.
No, I'll make the tea.
You'll save on the rat poison.
- Ma, no one is trying to poison you.
- (Police sirens on TV)
What's happening?
Don Brennan's died driving Alma Sedgewick's MG Midget through a viaduct.
- That's what it looks like.
- D'you think this could be the second death?
- (Advert Jingle) - (Man on TV)... stopping fast.
Oh, no, I tell a lie.
It's an advert for brake pads.
You know, I've sent a psychic message to the Pope to ask him to aid me in healing me arm.
So I'm expecting a visitation from him any minute now.
- (Doorbell)
- Ah, there's His Holiness.
- Get me my merkin.
- (Chuckles)
- Yes?
- Is Mrs Doonan in?
- Yeah, I'm Mrs Doonan.
- No.
Gwen.
- Oh.
Who should I say is calling?
- Her fiancé.
(Pop music plays)
- Your gran's weird.
- She does everything back to front now.
From now on I won't call her Gran.
I'll call her Narg.
It's "Gran" back to front.
So she's had some kind of illness that's completely changed her personality?
- Hope it's not catching.
- I know.
Might start liking Baddiel and Skinner.
Don't worry, Kylie.
We're never going to change.
One day we'll move to London...
- # It's coming home, it's coming home...
...and live amongst the beautiful people.
- # It's coming home, it's coming...
- And everything will be fabulous in our world.
# Football's coming home, it's coming home
- # It's coming...
- Kylie.
Shut up.
God.
- (Upstairs) Oh!
Oh!
- We want those close to us to be happy.
No one wants to hear their own mother be really happy.
- (Upstairs) Oh...
- She said she met him in the hospital.
Do you think he's a patient?
From the smell of his raincoat, I'm guessing he weren't a senior registrar.
(Sighs)
- Aha.
Ha.
- Oh.
I'm not sure how much more of this I can take.
Surely to God it can't go on much longer.
No, I mean her living with us.
She's a bloody Saga lout.
- (Upstairs) Yes!
- Oh!
Oh!
- Oh!
- Oh!
You know Carmelita on Descant Drive?
Twenty stone, Jaws wired, drinks purified chips through a straw?
- (Upstairs) Oh!
- She's the matron of a care home.
- Council-run.
Wouldn't cost a penny. - Debbie, I can't believe this.
Ma's sick.
People would look after her.
How would you like it if one day you started hearing voices?
Oh.
Oh, I forgot.
You already have.
- (Upstairs) Oh, yes!
- Oh!
- (Sighs)
- Oh, yes!
Oh, yes!
- Oh, oh, oh, oh!
- Oh, yes!
(Hayley) She's very unnerved.
At least when you and Andy have a bunk-up, you stick Maria Callas on full blast.
- D'you mind?
- She says she's a tap that's been turned off.
And I've turned her on.
She's a pioneer in the analogy field.
Well, she has been awful quiet this last half-hour, mind.
Ooh, don't think that's the second death, do you?
- What second death?
- Mum all right, is she?
I need a ciggie.
(Simon) According to the law of Sod, the minute you want to avoid something is the minute it slaps you round the face.
# It takes two, baby
# It takes two, baby
# Me and you
#Just takes two... (Andy mimicking Mother Teresa) It's a sign... sign... sign.
Two.
Twol
Two.
Two.
Two, two, two, twol
(Liverpool accent) 'Ey, ey, calm down, calm down.
(Normal) I ain't afraid of no ghost.
Oh!
You scared the living daylights out of me, Mother.
I am not your mother, Debbie, praise be to God.
(Simon) Ah, could this be a quaint Irish pastime, emptying one's wee in the sink?
(Sink gurgles)
And the infamous English equivalent...
- (Cigarette hisses) ...putting your fag out in it.
(Chuckling)
D'you like my fiancé, Ashlene?
You green with envy?
No.
He's old enough to be my grandad.
That's right, and very soon he will be, so hands off.
Mwah!
Mother, can we talk about you and Barry?
Big Barry, to you.
Oh, and believe me, ladies, he really does live up to his name.
- What are you looking at, you filthy tart?
- I don't know, Dracula's grandma?
Ah, the mouth on it.
- Are you really serious about marrying him?
- And why shouldn't I be?
Are you a racialist?
That's not the way your father and me brought you up.
Andy's not a racist.
Half his mates are black.
No, it's more that you picked him up in the... well, in that hospital.
Mental institutions are the latest pick-up Joints, are they?
Oh, it's a shame that you can't see, because I am giving you such a look right now.
Andy, I know it's hard for you, me movin' on and you gettin' over your dad.
But, you know, it's like havin' piles.
It's Just something you have to live with, you know.
Look, get... get me up.
Come on, get me up now.
Now, anybody want a one-armed fry-up?
- (Others) No.
- All right.
- Is she gonna be safe in there?
- She was always a dab hand in the kitchen.
Andy, she was always one to say her prayers and never say boo to a goose.
People change.
I can't relax.
What if I end up like her?
Why would you end up like that?
Look.
Mother spent 70 years of her life saying nothing apart from "Jesus loves you", being kind, nice, bottling everything up.
- So?
- So, you're not like that.
You're not that nice.
- You calling me a bitch?
- No.
Kids haven't said much for a while.
They OK?
- They're fine.
- Ooh, Mummy still breathing?
I'm not stupid.
I know you think you've had a premonition that someone's going to die.
But believe me, that's bollocks.
Nobody is going to die.
Say it.
- Debbie.
- Nobody's going to die.
- Say it louder like you mean it.
- Nobody's going to die.
- And again.
- Nobody's going to... (Ping)
(Rattling and clunking)
- (# The Feeling...
She's Gone)
- What happened?
Has the Good Lord put her out of her misery?
Oh, sweet Jesus, forgive me for all the bad thoughts I had about her.
She's dead.
Now she's dead and I never even told her I loved her!
- You didn't.
- I did so, you cheeky mare!
- You know I did!
- You know he did!
- It was your ma who didn't love her!
- I did!
Tell him, Hayls!
- She did.
It was me who couldn't stick her.
- Well, now you got what you wanted!
Oh, Andy!
Though if you're having a whip-round for her wreath, count me out.
Oh, my giddy aunt!
I thought I was going mad, and all along I had a gift!
Look, Simon!
Simon!
If you're still in the room.
If I've been funny with you lately, I apologise.
A toast!
To the best mother in the world!
Well, a few years ago before she went schizo.
After that, she was pure evil.
- To Mother!
- (Others) To Mother.
Narg?
Your microwave broke!
# What will be
- (Crash) - # She's gone
# Oh, I...
Oh, I...
I better learn how to face it... (Simon) So, yes, that day on Melody Crescent, the Doonan family really did learn that change is, of course, inevitable.
Oh, Christ.
I'm beginning to sound like her out of Desperate Housewives.
# Get up in the morning and look in the mirror
# The morning there's a toothbrush hanging on the stand
# My face ain't looking any younger... (Simon) And as my dad said goodbye to his mum and her lunatic leanings, it was time for me to kiss goodbye to my own mother's mental illness.
# She's gone, oh, I...
# Oh, I...
I better learn how to face it
# She's gone... #
(Phone rings)
8-5-1-9?
(Indian accent) Hello, Debbie.
It is me, Mother Teresa.
I'm Just ringing to say goodbye.
I will not be speaking to you again.
You had a gift but you didn't use it.
It made you think you was going mad, and you wasn't.
You will never hear from me or be psychic again.
You got that?
Have you got a parting message?
(Sighs) Your son is very upset by the death of his gran.
Could you... put his pocket money up?
By about... five pounds.
(Simon) Don't feel sorry for her.
She never gave me that raise.
- Those are your grandmother's teeth?
- Got it in one, sunshine.
You're seriously weird.
- Wait till you see what I did with her merkin.
- Yeah, right.
Water, please.
Oh, can you lend me two dollars?
That's a nice purse.
I wonder what I made that from.
Ew!
You're gross!
- (Laughs)
- I don't know why I go out with you.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
Cos you have a thing for slightly fey British window dressers?
You?
Slightly fey?
Shut up.
Yes, I know, it's like saying Kerry Katona's slightly chavvy.
Is she the poor woman who was held hostage in her own home?
Yes, though why she didn't Just lay on one of her Iceland buffets I'll never know.
That would scare any gunman off.
You have experience of gunmen?
I've had the odd pistol pointed me-wise over the years, believe it or not.
And some rather nasty explosions, to boot.
That must play havoc with your psyche.
I'm trying to get the stains out of a Nicole Farhi top and hot pants so it's no laughing matter, thank you very much.

Hi.
I'm Doug Stauber.
I'm an assistant manager at Donaldson's Grocery... where customers come first- even customers who are nuts.
- Mr. Stauber.
- Can I help you?
This guy had some complaint about the cracker Teddy Grahams... a honey graham snack.
- Okay.
- He spoke some other kind oflanguage.
"Lerhman torsh. "
That's not Spanish, bro.
I don't know what that is.
Okay, "Lerhman. " Let's go.
Sorry.
Oh, no.
Lerhman, man, I don't know, Lerhman.
I don't-
- Holy shit!
- At Donaldson's... the assistant manager deals with customer complaints.
What the hell?
It's myjob to keep a lid on this place.
It's kind ofhard.
I mean, it's not like I have a crack staff.
Outside, we have a gang problem.
And we have two 14-year-old security guards... who stand as far away from the store as they possibly can.
And at the end of the day, I get reviews from customers... whose feedback is important to us.
I returned to the lot from the grocery and found three black guys... sitting on my car eating snacks.
They finally left, but called me names and words like "tasty"... and "lick"and "titties. "
I have to turn these cards over to our actual manager... who's usually on his way back from a movie.
- What's up?
- Hey.
- New cards?
- Yeah.
Good ones?
That's good.
"Lick. " "Titties. "
I'm gonna take off.
So myjob has challenges.
So I'm not smiling here because I'm actually happy.
I'm smiling because I'm pretty sure my manager- who probably is actually happy- expected me to... and I want to advance and have a good career.
I'm supporting the orbital bone with my right hand... and the other hand is right in her chest cavity, you know?
I'm manually massaging her heart now.
I thought she was going to die.
- How'd you get her back?
- Instinct.
- Hey, Jen.
- Hey, Doug.
You remember Mark Timms.
- Yeah.
Hi.
- Hi.
We were just talking about how Mark saved a two-year-old girl's life.
Good job.
- Oh.
Tell Mark about "Teddy Grahams. "
- That's all right.
- It's hilarious.
- What?
- This Teddy Grahams "snack slap" thing.
- Oh, snack slap?
- He got in this little slap fight.
- What happened?
Tell me.
- Tell him.
- That's ok
- No.
No, come on, man.
I want to know.
Come on, guy.
And I'm asked to share my graham cracker slap stories with my wife's boss...
- who never remembers my name.
- All right.
And my name's on my shirt.
Right side.
Just the first name though.
I tried to put "Mr. Stauber"on it, but I got reprimanded.
Big deal.
He saved an infant.
That's great.
- If I had infant-saving training, I could probably do it.
- Okay.
Some days, I didn't think anyone would call me "mister. "
I'djust be "Doug"... for good.
You're a shoo-in, dude.
- Seriously?
- Seriously.
Hey, do you know where the expression "shoo-in" comes from?
No.
The Romans used to-
I'm the shoo-in- the leading shoo-in.
Totally.
- Oh, you're the leading shoo-in.
- Yeah, totally.
Come here, you sweaty bastard.
You sweaty shoo-in.
- I'm really sweaty.
- I don't care.
Come here.
Oh, Jesus!
You stink.
- I'll take a shower.
- It's okay.
- Hey, guy, can you just give us a break?
One night?
My partner's coming over.
- I'm supposed to have this piece prepared.
- Man, we're trying to... have dinner.
I thought you were makin'out. "All sweaty. "
Compromise.
I'll do scales.
- Is it still for sale?
- Yeah.
We should go get that house.
This week.
Because I'm gonna get that job, and I feel really good about things.
Me too.
Maybe we should wait though.
I'm a shoo-in.
And someone's gonna snag that house.
Let's do it.
- Shoo-in?
- Yeah.
All right.
Let's do it.
It was right there, what we worked for.
Then this guy comes down from Canada.
#Every day I'm gonna strut that stuff #
# When the music's loud I can't get enough #
#Singin' hi, singin' hi #
# Come on, feet Teach yourself to move #
#Hey #
#People shufflin' up and down again #
# Unhappy faces ain't gonna get you in #
#Singin' hi, singin' hi #
# Come on, people Teach yourself to move #
#Hey, yeah #
#Hey, all right #
#Spread the news We're gonna have some fun #
#Let it go Movin'son of a gun #
#Singin' hi, singin' hi #
# Come on, feet We was born to move #
- #Hey, yeah ## Got the loading dock right over there.
- That's for blue stock only.
- Okay.
- That gets logged in right away.
- Blue stock.
And if it's before 8:15 in the morning, you've got to do it.
- Move it over right up there to that first pallet.
- Right.
This way, as soon as it goes back, it's rotated back to the first-
Wejust moved.
My wife was transferred, so now I'm here.
Richard Wehlner, from Quebec.
And that's pretty much where it all started- somejoker blowing down from Canada... from a sister company I didn't even know we had.
Nice location.
Yeah.
- It's a Plus?
- What's that?
- It's gonna be full size?
- Full size.
This place will draw too.
There's not another grocery till Western.
I'm gonna put in for it, full manager.
Yeah, me too.
- So, okay.
See you later.
- Yep.
See you later.
Eh, gimme five.
Erickson's is our sister company.
Okay.
Yeah, they're all over Canada.
Wehlner's got, like, six years in up there.
But I'm still the shoo-in, right?
I don't know.
Wehlner's kind of a wild card.
His work history transfers clean, so-
I don't know about this shoo-in business.
So there's a microchip on the right anterior wheel that has a sensor in it... and if it detects an obstacle, it will engage the self-braking mechanism.
So no more scratched door small claims, right?
All right, here we go.
I had to tell her I wasn't a shoo-in...
- and that maybe the house was out for now.
- Whoa!
That's no way to play the banjo.
- I'm doing the best I can.
- No, you're not.
Because you don't love me.
- I love you intensely.
- Then show me...
- by playing better banjo.
- Okay.
Then show me... sexually.
Dream or real?
- Real.
- Oh, my God.
Chapter Two.
We'll learn the importance of recognizing opportunities... to stand out at work and to steer clear of trouble.
We'll also learn that success does not come to the timid... but to those like- Richard Wehlner-
Who go out and make things happen.
It's nice when you bring your daughter's Brownie troupe... in for cupcakes and they learn the word "cock. "
- Thanks, Donaldson's.
- Fuck.
- Hey.
Any good?
- No.
- Well, what's the problem?
We'll work on it as a team.
- The box is on the lot.
- The lot's so fuckin' nuts.
- Well, what's so f'ing nuts about it?
- It's just crazy.
Lot detail means bad cards.
- Oh.
Scott, why is the board here?
Oh, they wanna run stock for the new Plus store in Augusta.
They want a stock list.
Great.
I'm eager to meet them.
I'm eager to... too.
...from Donaldson's, the champion of excellence.
Whether it's Monday morning muffins or a pie for Sunday's supper-
Hey.
Those cutters are still out there.
- Well, I'm on stacking.
- Yeah, well, I'd go, but I gotta get my car washed.
- Well, who's on lot?
- Richard.
- Ask Richard.
- Yeah, h-he's with Kev from Pepsi.
They're putting a new product up.
He asked for Richard.
- He asked for him?
- Yeah.
Been working together last couple of weeks.
They got friendly, so-
Can you get out there?
Just, uh-
Listen, I have bad cards stacking up from the lot.
The board's here.
I'll get you inside tomorrow.
...from Donaldson's, the champion of excellence.
Donaldson's is committed to offering the widest selection-
- You can pretty much do what you want.
- Anything?
Yeah, man.
That wasn't what I meant.
Come on.
No, seriously.
If you want this whole section... it's Pepsi's world, right?
Um, no, we got a lot of room.
I mean, if you need to expand a little bit... if you need more, I can-
She got a fat pussy too.
I'm talkin' about a fuckin' milk truck pussy, nigga.
- Hey, guys.
- Yo, and a big-ass house made from a chub pussy and her ass?
- It's, like, damn!
- Come on, guys.
You gotta walk around.
Uh, no cut-throughs.
Whatever the fuck.
- Hey, you can't cut through, dawg.
- Ah, fuck you, whopper.
- What the fuck you callin' me "whopper. "
- Whoa!
Cool down.
I bought a Charleston Chew.
Man, fuck you.
Ask him.
- Well, where is it?
- I ate it.
Ain't I buy a Charleston Chew, asshole?
Your name's Stauber, right?
Doug?
Yep.
- Did he buy a Charleston Chew?
- Like, at 2:00.
Did he buy a Charleston Chew this afternoon?
Come on, Stauber.
- Yeah.
- All right.
- Then he's a customer, Stauber.
- I'm a customer every day buying' Chews.
Welcome, all you guys.
You played this the wrong way, Stauber.
What the frig are you doing?
Here's how we're gonna fix this.
Come on.
Go.
Excuse me, young sir?
I want to offer you-
I'd like to offer you a complimentary strawberry Charleston Chew.
I indicated the flavor:
Strawberry.
Thanks, strawberry faggot.
I'm little Mr. Strawberries.
And I was supposed to be inside that day, not comping the Chews.
Kev, I think you're all set.
I'm gonna give you the end cap, and
- It was good to see you.
- It's great to see you.
I'm proud of you.
- You too, man.
Um, like I said, if you need more space on the shelves...
I can always squeeze Green River a little bit.
Hey, uh, were you a male gymnastics?
Was I a male gymnastics?
Were you a male gymnastics in theJunior Olympics?
Ruiz Googled you.
He says you were a male gymnastic in Junior Olympics.
No.
I wasn't... male gymnastics in Junior Olympics.
Octavio
- Come on, man.
It's a joke, for morale purposes.
Wehlner didn't say nothing.
He's inside today.
- You're lot.
- I'm just gonna take it down.
We should eat.
You guys want something from the rotisserie?
Let's snag somethin' from Deli.
You're gonna love this deli.
Their selection is out of this world.
We're gonna place four lunch orders.
He stole my Pepsi rep detail.
No matter how you slice it, that's a dick move.
You deal with the poster.
Dick move, man.
Deal.
Rotating convention, full benefits... 69,000, a spot on the board.
That's great.
- It is.
- Hey, Doug.
Doug Stauber!
- Hey.
- It's my wife, Lori.
I was just tellin' her about this new place.
Hey, come on over and meet Christine Wehlner.
- Hey.
- Hi, I'm Jen.
Lori.
Pleased to meet you.
- Hi.
Doug.
- What kind of accent is that?
It's really pretty.
Scotland.
We met on a mission to Scotland.
- On an army mission?
- Christian, man.
Christian mission.
Oh.
Okay.
Man, when I cheese postered him, I didn't know he was a family man.
Also, he's Canadian.
They're not the same as Americans.
They're nicer.
- Oh.
Hey, Paul.
- Hi.
How are you?
Nice to see you.
- Good to see you too.
It's been a while.
- You're lookin' great.
- Thank you very much.
- Hot enough for ya?
I like it like this.
Opens up the pores, makes me feel really good.
- Listen, I gotta run, but you're lookin' great.
- Okay.
Thanks.
- See you later.
- You too.
Say hello to the wife.
He was nice.
And he actually had a pretty good little explanation... for stealing my Pepsi rep, Kevin.
So, yeah, I'm glad I saw ya... 'cause I w-wanted to talk to you off to the side about Kev.
- Pepsi rep Kev?
- Yeah, about that stuff.
Yeah.
Uh, when we were puttin' up theJazz?
I wanted to tell you- you know, off to the side- um...
I'm a drug addict- recovering- and an alcoholic.
And, uh, Kevin's my program sponsor.
Yeah, um, sponsor.
Yeah.
So, Wednesday, I was havin' a-
Well, I just really needed to talk to him.
- So I'm sorry if
- I didn't mean to-
- Don't worry about it.
- Come on.
- Okay.
Thanks, Doug.
That's awesome.
- Oh, hey.
- No, I got it.
- It's okay.
- I got it, Doug.
Get outta here.
Get on outta here.
Who else is interviewing anyway?
It's really mine, as the shoo-in.
But, uh, I think they're going to sit down with a couple of other guys as a formality.
They don't stand a chance really.
Not with you in this suit, they don't.
- Is that guy still standing on his balcony staring at us?
- Yeah.
That's nice.
Hey, do you mind if I listen on my headphones?
'Cause Canadian news is on at 1:30.
That's cool.
Chapter Four.
Chances are, you live in a metro environment... full of men trying their best to get ahead.
Millions.
So how do you separate yourself from the guy next to you... who may be younger and also wants what you want?
Through the quality of your work, by flying higher.
This chapter's entitled, "Taking Off. "
Let's let this classic rock song remind you what direction-
Richard Wehlner- is headed:
Up.
Let's rock!
# Ticktock, tick, doo, doo, doo-doo #
#Ticktock, tick Doo, doo, doo-doo #
#Time keeps on slippin' slippin', slippin' #
# Into the future #
#Time keeps on slippin' slippin', slippin' #
- #Into the future-#
- Richard Wehlner # I wanna fly like an eagle-#
- Richard Wehlner-
#To the sea #
# Fly like an eagle Let my spirit carry me #
# I want to fly like an eagle-#
- Richard Wehlner- - #Till I'm free ##
Our grocery- We have Martin's projects right there.
And we're trying to draw from pretty high-end neighborhoods.
We get a lot of cut-throughs, but, uh, keeping the lot safe is our number one obstacle.
And I don't shy away from the lot.
It's critical.
That's good.
It's critical at the Augusta Plus store too.
We have public housing right there.
Yeah, it's a balancing act.
You need safety, but you also need good community relations.
I'm glad you mentioned community relations.
The housing- those are our neighbors, our customers too.
It's important to get along.
Doug, what's this?
- I grabbed this on the 19th.
- That's out of line.
Yeah.
- When did you get that?
- June 19th, at your deli, on the refrigeration unit.
- I think this is B.S.
- It is B.S.
I was probably on lot that day.
I like it out there.
Who was inside?
Maybe...
Richard?
- Richard Wehlner.
- Yeah.
Mmm.
I think so.
Yep.
You think he was on Deli, or he was on Deli?
Was on Deli.
Send him in.
Doug, these aren't great.
Bear down.
We'll get some fresh cards.
We'll take it from there.
I like what you're saying.
I need to like what you're doing a little more.
Thank you.
- How'd it go?
- Good.
Hello, gentlemen.
I'm Richard Wehlner.
Thank you for your valuable time.
Nice to meet you, sir.
Richard Wehlner.
Hi.
How do you do?
Thank you for your valuable time.
In Canada, we don't say-
"Cutting the cheese" simply means cutting the actual cheese.
It doesn't have a double thing, so I just missed it.
Because in Canada, it's "cracking. "
- The expression.
- It's "cracking" in Canada.
Yeah.
We "crack the cheese. "
"Cracking it"?
"Cracking the cheese"?
So I simply really believed that Rogelio... had been given an intra-Deli award... for cutting the actual cheese.
I'm sorry.
I simply believed Rogelio had been given an intra-Deli-
I heard you the first time.
Listen.
We have permit delays.
We're on hold this month.
We won't be deciding for a few weeks.
Make up the ground.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Then that's all.
Well, thank you for gimme- for giving me your valuable time.
Thank you for your time.
I appreciate it.
Thank you, sir, for your time.
Thank you for this- for this moment.
Thank you very much, Mr. Cranston.
Appreciate it.
Thank you very much, sir, for your time today.
You are a valuable person to me.
And I am sorry about this cutting business.
That's the end of that.
No more cheese business.
Last stop, financial district.
So I never got to go over my cool bullet points because of the fart gag joke.
The whole board saw it.
It was uncool.
Why don't you forget about it for now?
I want you to blow off some steam.
I have an idea.
I signed us up for dance lessons.
- Oh, I don't know.
- Let's go for it.
- Let's do salsa.
It's so beautiful.
- Not when I do it.
It's gonna be, because you're a beautiful guy.
I don't know if I can do it.
Here, sweetie.
Ready?
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna backslide.
All right.
Let's go dancin'.
Ready?
Whoo!
- How many pages is that?
- Eight pages.
It's so quiet.
Okay.
Now we just need that $12,000 check- the earnest money check.
If I can't make the big 10% down payment in August, I can get this back, right?
Like, uh, if I don't get this job that I thought I was gonna get?
Um, you forfeit that.
It will be a forfeiture in that amount.
- Is that bad?
- Yes.
"Forfeit," as in, you don't get the money back.
The seller keeps the money.
It's so they're not hung out to dry... and it's also a way of preventing schmucks... from trying to purchase houses they can't afford.
Yeah.
Schmucks.
- What are you talking about?
- Schmucks who buy houses they can't afford.
- Are there really schmucks like that?
- Well, every once in a while... we'll encounter a schmuck like that- not often.
- Hey!
Man, what the hell?
- Ah!
Holy shit.
- That was "Teddy"?
- Yeah.
- He's smaller than I imagined.
- Yeah, well, he's got a lot of stamina.
It took us five years to save $ 12,000... and I might have just schmucked it away.
So Richard might be a nice recovering drug guy... but if I could slide ahead ofhim at the company retreat, I was going to do it.
Hey, leaders in quality foods, the Donaldson's difference- it's people.
And all of you- here's the great news- are people.
Now concentration allows you to shut out distraction.
Shutting out distraction, gang, allows you... to accomplish your goals and achieve new heights!
Get it in here, Chicagoland Donaldson's.
Come on.
Tout de suite it in here, make a stack ofhands.
Right here in the middle.
Let's go.
Bunch ofhands, here we go.
Ready?
Now let's make it happen on "one. " Ready on "one"?
One!
Let's make it happen!
Here we go.
Let's go.
You can do this, Mitch.
Concentration.
And... block out distraction.
Easy.
Here we go, Aaron.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it!
Doug, you can do it.
Block out distraction.
Block out distraction.
Very good.
What do you think, Richard?
Here we go.
And-
It's not hot!
It's not hot!
You've essentially attained your goal.
Blockin' out distractions!
Who's next?
Who's next?
Let's do it, Steve.
You've got it.
You've got it.
You've got it!
This guy's done this before, right?
You did this before on some weird island?
Here we go.
Hey, burgundy jumpsuit!
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Scott, you just concentrate, concentrate, concentrate.
He didn't block out the distractions.
- Just get in the pool.
You can try it again.
- Stop!
That's all right.
This is why we sign waivers, everybody.
All right.
Put the bags on over your head.
Everyone.
Right over the top.
Perfect.
Okay.
Now, I want you to take off one thing that you don't need... quickly!
Come on!
Let's take something else off that you really don't need... right away!
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
Something else you don't need.
Let's make it happen.
Come on!
- Something else you don't need.
Come on.
Let's go.
Something completely unnecessary.
Doug, can we take our sack off?
What?
- Did you take your sack off?
- I can't really hear you.
People, take off one more thing that you simply do... not... need.
- Do it.
- Fuck.
Okay, um-
All right, everybody that still has a bag on top of their heads, scream...
"My concentration skills need improvement. "
- One, two, three.
- My concentration skills need improvement!
Easy with the laughter.
Easy with that.
That's enough.
All right.
- Who's up for some team building, huh?
Let's do it!
Let's head over to the productivity obstacle course.
Guy, slap the clothes back on.
Let's just watch the assumptions.
That's all it is.
Yeah, is this Chicagoland Pepsi?
Connect to Kevin Conoway, please?
Richard Wehlner.
Brighten the week with a sweet from Donaldson's... the champion of excellence.
Scott, lot the full week?
Pepsi's sending a new season of stuff.
Yep.
Kevin wants Richard.
- PepsiCo's chips and paperware-
- That's six days of bad cards from the lot.
I got two weeks before the board decides about Augusta.
That's one week of suck cards.
Come on, Fargas.
- What, are you callin' me by my last name now?
- Scott.
Kevin wants Richard.
That's Pepsi.
Don't make a stink about it.
You know what?
I'm takin' lot.
Give it to me.
They got lot concerns at Augusta.
I'm gonna get some prime lot cards.
I'm gonna show 'em I can do it.
- Awesome.
- I'm gonna jam for six days.
Awesome.
Let's make it happen!
Hey, remove yourself!
Get your pizza off there.
Get your butt off my car!
Fuck you, Mr. Chopsticks.
You Chungking fuck ass.
Hey, show some respect!
Where is someone?
Can someone please help me?
That's addressed to the board, for the cards.
They want the fresh ones.
Gordon "Jiminy. " A kid hanging out in your lot kidney punched me... because I offended him, I guess, by doing nothing.
Kidney punched me.
There's a little bit of a lack of security in your lot... 'cause your security guy was sleeping in my car.
Okay.
The, uh- The fucking chip is fixed... and, uh, here we go- right towards my own private vehicle... because that's how much confiidence I have in this.
Remember, this could be your daughter.
Fuck!
...as I offer you a blueprint for success in the workplace.
And, like the eagle, you'll create a commanding atmosphere around-
Richard Wehlner.
If you ever have to choose between working inside and outside... at a major American grocery store, choose inside.
Inside you have some freedom.
You have places to hide.
You can catch a breeze off the dairy cooler.
The girls work inside.
Mmm.
Outside sucks.
I just wanted to let you know that everything was top-notch.
Yes.
You guys are really getting your shit together.
I fuckin'had it for a while there, but I've sensed a shift.
Hey, good shift.
Keep on truckin'in that direction.
I'll be a repeat customer.
...cutting' grass and shit?
I can call the police.
So, just so you know, this is Donaldson's property.
You're trespassing.
- I'm on a parkin' lot.
- It's our lot.
- Fuck you.
- Heh, your ma's courteous.
She took my ride, sissy.
What does that mean?
Hey!
Well, give 'em back!
Fuckin' get 'em.
Fuck!
Fuck!
Fuck you, man, you know?
Back up.
- Back what?
- Back up.
I'm not fuckin' around, dick.
What you call me, motherfucker?
Get off the lot!
Get off me!
- Is he serious?
- Hey, he can't be fuckin' serious.
- Have a nice day!
- Have a nice day!
You have a nice day, fuckin' assholes!
Aren't you on lot?
I'm tryin' to fix these cards.
They got messed up.
Don't forget, those go in today.
Half hour, I'm gonna go down there.
- Who's on lot?
- Just Bredon.
Keith's sick.
Ah, put Octavio out.
He can come off Deli.
We got it covered.
You have the vest?
In my locker.
- Thanks, Scott.
- All right.
I don't know what you say.
I was trying to figure out if Brian... "Grall's"card... said, "Your employees were very...
courageous"?
I wondered, were any of them courageous?
Esteban?
No.
Little Esteban?
No.
- Hey.
- Then I thought, fuck.
I found a whole stack of D.E. 's in your locker.
- Stauber.
- Yeah.
A whole stack.
Scott, man, lot's so messed up.
I know it is, but it's not about you, okay?
I'm going down to the Augusta Plus.
Why don't you pack your stack and take a ride with me?
I wanna see you hand these over.
Pack your stack.
A lot of the guys, when they're goin' out to assist customers with their bags... they're doin' some lollygaggin' outside.
And everyone wants to get fresh air.
Don't get me wrong.
I like fresh air... but we need you inside, or else we're short-
Several young men taunted me with chants... of"ching chong Chinaman" and "cinnamon face"!
You know what?
I'd like you to read them to me right now.
- Out loud?
- No, read them to me silently.
"My grocery list didn't include sexual harassment, but thanks.
Beth Kopins, 84."
- You want me to read all of these?
- Yes.
- Fuck.
- I'm sorry?
That's on the card.
"Fuck, that was a great shopping experience. "
- It doesn't say that, does it?
- No.
What does it say then?
Not a good demonstration of my managerial skills.
But I just decided to bear down, motivate my staff to raise their game... andjust get more hands-on.
I was going to handle it.
I was going to keep my cool and handle anything.
I was going to handle it.
I was going to keep my cool and handle anything.
- Then something happened:
The Tater Tot incident-
- You're on the lot.
Provoked by what I call the "Yoo-hoo smash. "
Full Yoo-hoo.
Fuck!
- That's assault!
I'm callin' the police.
You're gone!
- Suck my dick.
- You're fucking gone.
All spiced up with a little Mace.
- I mean, what did he do?
Did he grab you?
- He, like-
A bottle hit me, and then he tugged at my shirt.
- He threw it?
- I don't know, someone in the group!
Hey, you Maced him full in the face.
He's in the hospital.
- Why don't you calm down?
- He hit me in the head with a bottle.
It's out there.
Look, pal, there's a lot ofbottles out there.
What I know is, he's got a face full of liquid frenzine... his mom and dad are upset, and I'm tryin' to figure out what he did to you.
They wanna talk to somebody- an owner, they said.
I have to call the board.
Frig.
- Man, he grabbed me.
- Are you going to press charges?
I don't know.
I have to talk to the board.
Are they?
Can they?
I don't know.
The parents are upset.
Javier, what are you- You just left these here?
The bag's damaged.
What, are they gonna melt?
Come on, man.
This is bullshit.
This... is... bull...
- shit!
- Ow!
- Hey!
Whoa!
- What?
- He's whippin' stuff at me.
- I was tossing them out.
He walked right in front of me.
It hit me in the wrist.
They're heavy.
Ow.
They're frozen.
- Fuck you, Wehlner.
- What is your problem?
You want to file an in-store?
- What?
- An in-store.
An in-store complaint?
Geez.
I don't know.
It just-
They're pretty dense.
They're frozen potatoes.
- Man, fuck you, Richard.
- What is your f'ing problem?
Something's wrong.
What's been bothering you?
You know, in the case I don't get this job- in a weird case I don't get this job- it's going to be four more years, because there's no new store planned.
You're making too much of this new job.
I mean, I can go back to school- there's night school- and be a practitioner.
You don't need this pressure.
We can do it together, just like we've done everything so far.
Jen, I don't want you waiting for the bus at night in February.
You already work two shifts.
Night school?
You don't want to go back.
- I don't want to, but I will.
- You're not going to.
- Doug, look out!
- Oh, fuck.
- Hey!
Hey!
- Hey.
Hey!
Hey!
What's your fucking problem?
He has an issue with the coupons.
- What, man?
What issue?
- Y-You do not honor the coupons anymore for his snacks, yeah?
- All right.
I'll honor your coupons.
Stop slapping me.
- Okay?
Stop?
You can't go around slapping people.
What country are you from, Insane Land?
Hey, Jen.
- Hey, guy.
- Hey.
I wonder if anyone else here... got slapped in the eyes yesterday over a graham cracker snack?
Probably not.
I'm just gonna try to forget about that particular embarrassment... via some beers.
Hey.
Wanna top me off there, Teddy Grahams?
Are you enjoying your drink?
Then I started working at the grocery, and-
You know, that's been pretty okay.
Because you can have a family, you know?
And, uh, move up in administration.
Save a little money.
You know what I'm talkin' about.
- Yeah.
- You know?
So it's been good- till this guy from Quebec comes along.
You told me about that already.
- I did?
- Yeah.
Hey, I have an idea.
Let's get down sexually right now... while you play the banjo.
- Good idea.
- Is that even possible?
Oh, that's the spot, dude.
- Oh, right on.
- I guess so.
I had to get up early that morning, too... to write a Mace apology speech for the community center.
I hadn't written a speech since Webelos.
"While on a courtesy patrol, the group of young men...
"approached a Donaldson's customer and me while making threats... and I was struck in the head by a bottle of Yoo-hoo. "
How do you know who threw that Yoo-hoo?
I noticed, um, previous to the thing...
That the young man that I had the altercation with was drinking Yoo-hoo.
After I was struck, I noticed that he wasn't drinking Yoo-hoo anymore.
And there was no one else in the lot, so-
"I discharged a single pull of Mace in his direction. "
I'm glad he's recovered.
"But the incident only occurred because customer care is priority one at Donaldson's.
"It would have happened if the customer's safety was threatened...
"by a group of any creed or color.
"We at Donaldson's are proud of our ties to the community.
"We think it's a great one.
"We intend to continue to provide a courteous and safe shopping atmosphere for you...
"and we intend to continue to provide shopping carts...
"with that one wheel that just won't work right.
"We understand that the young men involved in the incident...
"are not good examples of the community, but are troublemakers...
"who there are a lot of everywhere in this day.
"The incident was unfortunate for both parties...
"but we won't let a few bad apples spoil the batch.
You can be sure of that.
Thank you for coming. "
- I think everybody's feeling pretty good about it.
- Yeah.
- It's isolated.
- Oh, yeah.
It's a one-time thing.
What's that?
I agree.
It's isolated.
I think it was just some black apples.
We won't be seeing that happen again.
Black apples.
- What's that?
- You said "black apples. "
- I said "bad" ones.
- The fuck you said "bad. "
- Bad apples.
- You said "black. "
I'm sorry if there's some confusion.
Maybe in the confusion, I-
Hey, come on.
It's been a long day.
That was a slip.
This is a lot of shit.
You are not a black apple to me.
I said that possibly there was one black one in the batch.
Not you.
And I didn't mean to say black.
I meant "back. "
"Blatch. " "Blad. "
"Blapples. "
Where'd you get this fucker?
Let's catch up outside.
I'll hit you with some gift certifiicates.
You hear that guy?
"Where'd you get this fucker?"
Maybe I don't belong here.
Maybe he's right.
You-You just-
You said "blapples," hon.
It was weird.
Let's
- Let's find a way for you to spend some time alone... get cooled down.
No payments, right?
No pressure.
- Right.
- We'll find you something to get lost in.
Chapter Eight.
- "Keeping Your Cool. "
- Fuck.
Have you ever seen an eagle blow his top?
Do your best to keep your cool.
Stay loose.
Fuck.
Every life has its frustrations... but be careful not to let them get the best of you in front of your family.
Instead of curses, find a more family-friendly way to express life's frustrations.
Fuck you!
Ship fuck!
Asshole ship!
Seven seas fucker!
Jolly fucker!
- For Chrissake.
- No one can do that!
It's impossible!
Not even a guy with tiny hands!
Not even a guy with a child's hands!
Fuck that!
I guess it was mean enjoying a rainbow cone... to celebrate Richard's racial slur.
But I had a feeling he was starting to crack.
A couple more little things- he mightjust fall apart.
Black apples?
What an a-hole.
What do you have?
Hey.
Oh, almeja sauce.
Yeah, I'm gonna make dinner tonight.
We've been stressed about getting this job, so-
I wanna make something.
We're just gonna take it easy.
It's supposed to be good, Mateo and those guys said.
- You got that clam sauce?
- Yeah.
- You should ask Sylvia Rojas about her almeja sauce.
- Yeah?
She makes it?
Almeja?
That means "clam"in Spanish.
It also means something dirty- P
- U-S-S-Y.
The baggers say it all day- the dirty way.
Yeah, okay, guys.
Ask her, papa.
She's got a good recipe.
Should I tell him it means P-U-S-S-Y?
Or should I break him down?
He put me on lot for a week.
Go ahead, learn some Spanish- the inappropriate way.
Sylvia.
Um-
Mmm!
Richard.
Did you ask Sylvia about her clam sauce?
Yeah.
You say it was the best?
Yeah.
That's pussy sauce.
What?
That's pussy sauce.
It's her pussy.
The Good Life.
Chapter Nine.
"Dignity and Respect and Their Importance in the Workplace. "
Gaining the respect of colleagues does not happen overnight... but these feelings- dignity and respect- are a necessary part of a good life.
- Just frustrated.
- Are you going to slide back to a bad place?
Not by a long shot.
Lori, not by a mile.
I've just had a bad day.
I'm feeling a little turned around here.
- Maybe I'm missing home.
- It's the home of the eagle.
- "It's a great place to soar," you said.
- Yeah.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
I just feel like I'm at camp and I want to come home.
You did male gymnastics in theJunior Olympics?
- What?
- You were a male gymnast?
Lopez said.
I don't know what they're saying.
Name same as mine popped up on Google or something.
Hey, watch your soups.
What about my soups?
Your soups are sloppy.
- We're gonna be okay.
- Thanks, Lori.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
- I'll see you at home.
- I'll see you.
I just have to log these Mesquite Crunchers.
Bye.
Hey.
Are you gonna write me up, Doug?
No, man.
Yeah, I just
- I just feel like everything's getting to me.
I know.
Hey, smoke it down, bro.
I would, too, but I get bad headaches.
I had some, like, lost years.
Man, I was in a motorcycle gang.
Fuck you!
I guess I'll just get everybody.
- Have a nice day, hon.
- You too.
Man, come on!
We found each other and started a family.
We said we were gonna make a go of it.
It's just hard.
I mean, day care's 300.
Our premiums are 400.
This dance class is $280 U.S.
Yeah.
This is what I did.
I bought a house that I can't even-
I can't even nearly afford.
I'm gonna tell Lori I toked up.
Yeah.
I'm gonna tellJen.
I have to.
Because that's how you get happy- leading an honest life no matter what your life's like beside.
So I'm telling her.
Because that's a man.
Because-
If you have that "to the max" clean love- man, that-that "all the way" love-
then you could be even, like, a midget or something... and still light it up with a smile.
So go on, let it shine.
I'm not bullshittin'.
Lori, I can make a go of it.
We're goin'.
We're goin' to Glasgow, fuckin' like it or not.
Okay, great.
Yeah, go visit your grammy.
And then come on back, yeah?
Make it a holiday.
I'll show you I can make a big dancing go of it.
Tell your grammy I said hi.
I'll be seeing her.
I'll tell Grammy that you're a doper.
I'll tell Grammy that.
Whoa.
Lori, don't.
Okay, Chrissie.
Have a little holiday with your grammy.
- All right.
Let's go.
- I'll be seein' ya.
Lori, make it a holiday.
- Will you get the mail in when you get home?
- Yeah.
No problem.
- I gotta tell you something.
- Mark, you remember Doug.
- Yeah.
Hey.
Teddy Grahams.
- Yeah, hey.
- We got surgery at 10:00.
A cleft palate- two-year-old.
- Okay.
- What's a cleft palate?
- It's a deformation of the "mascus"- the lower face.
Medically, it's "masculari horriblus"... which is Latin for "monster face. "
And I guess some of these kids really do feel like monsters.
But we restore them to normalcy.
You should see it, man.
It's beautiful.
- Man.
- Yeah.
- What?
Tell me what.
- Nothing.
I'll see you tonight.
Okay.
- Let me show you something.
- Yeah.
One way to go from planning to tell the truth to telling another lie... is to find a gift from your wife- who has no money- of some long-sleeved shirts... because she believes you'll dress more formally... as the shoo-in boss of a large grocery because you said this.
When the truth is you might stay a "short sleever"... for the foreseeable future of thousands of days.
- Hey.
I like my shirts.
- Hey.
What are you doing?
It's for night school- for the school thing, for just in case.
I thought I should do it.
- Are you worried?
- No.
But just in case.
I didn't want to miss the sign-up.
I want to save a spot.
- You have to write a check?
- 180.
Don't.
Because I got the job.
- They decided?
- Yeah.
I got the job.
- Doug!
You are great!
- Yeah.
Good-bye, banjo fuckers!
Yeah.
I don't know what that was.
A lie wish?
Way to go, Doug!
Whoo.
Hey, Scott, I wanted to mention, um-
My wrist is acting up a little... from the Tater Tot thing.
So I think I should probably do that in-store.
The in-store complaint?
- Yeah.
- All right.
That circulates through the company- to the board, everywhere.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
I think that's probably for the best.
You know, in case he does it to somebody else.
- Okay.
I'll get the forms.
- Thanks, Scott.
Because it's flaring up.
#I could be wrong #
#I could be right #
# Could be wrong #
#I could be wrong I could be right #
#I could be black I could be white #
#I could be right I could be wrong #
In-store complaints are for real.
They're for gross and flagrant violation of company conduct.
It says it on the paperwork.
- Goddamn it.
- Guys get fired for them, not promoted- tojobs their wives already think they have.
Oye.
I heard from Scott.
He say you into gymnastics all the way for males.
# Could be wrong #
#I could be right #
Our classes are a "no refund" policy.
Right.
Uh-
My wife-
Due to circumstances, my wife won't be able to be my partner anymore... and that's cash money.
You can transfer your deposit if you like.
We have one class available for singles.
#I could be wrong #
#I could be right #
- Hey, Mr. Wehlner.
- Hey, Hardy.
- Hey, Mr. Wehlner.
- Hey, Hardy.
- How you doin'?
- Doin' good.
- What'd you do last night?
- Went to the movies with my sister.
- You did?
That sounds awesome.
- Yeah.
- Guess what.
- What?
- I'm growing a mustache.
- All right.
That's cool.
Hey, Hardy, you're doing a great job in the store here.
- Thanks.
You too, man.
- Keep it up.
- What's going on?
- Oh, nothing.
Just...
Hardy.
Itjust gets sad sometimes.
Do you know why Hardy's hand is powdered?
Why?
'Cause retarded guys masturbate so much... that they rub the skin off their penises.
It's just-They don't know better.
Just-They have a hard time not jerking' off.
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.
- Scott in?
- Yeah.
- I think Scott's in Receiving.
- Okay.
- I wanted to ask you a question about the application.
- No problem.
I'll see you guys later, all right?
Hey, fellas.
What was he doing?
- Was he talking about jacking off?
- Richard?
He was talking about jacking it?
In front of customers?
Jacking dicks?
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah.
F. You!
- What?
- I didn't say that.
They asked me what you said.
That's what you said.
- You know what?
Fuck you, Doug.
- That's what you said.
How's your wrist?
How's your wrist, Richard?
- You're bogus.
- I'm bogus?
You lace that thing on, try to fuck me out of a job - out of money for me and my wife.
Those things weigh 62 grams.
I don't know what a gram is, but I guess that's a lot 'cause you're hurt.
Get off me, Wehlner!
See you later, Tappy.
What, are you wearing tap shoes?
Lori left me, little boy.
It's the only class I can attend as a single.
Goddamn!
Come on!
Is that guy wearing tap shoes?
Come on!
- Fuck off!
- Yeah?
Come on, dick!
Come on!
- Fuck you!
- Hold it!
Not cool!
Not cool!
Go inside.
Sorry, Scott.
- Dancing bear.
- Yeah, wife liar!
I was lunching with Jen... trying to forget about it and roll into the crucial second interview.
Then I spied that Big World.
Remember Do-Good and Dodo?
Dodo makes lunchtime unpleasant for everyone.
Do-Good shares his peanut brittle with the new...
Negro.
"Negro"?
What the fuck?
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.
Sometimes, Do-Good cleans up a mess... even ifhe didn't make it.
Dodo is sometimes simply not a good young man.
Hey, Lori.
It's me.
Hey, uh, tomorrow's the big day- the final sit-down.
You know, the final interview thing.
Then they make their decision.
Hey, guess what.
I'm taking tap dancing.
The studio wouldn't give me the deposit back, so I'm tappin'.
I've gotta say I really like it.
It's real-
It's a real dance style.
Very expressive.
Um, anyway, whatever.
I'm still dancin', practicing'.
And, uh-
Listen, Lori.
I love you, and I miss you.
Bye.
#And deep down we were really in love #
# Oh, but I'm tired ofholdin'on #
# To a feelin' I know is gone #
A man probably has just a half dozen or so... really critical days in his life- that's all- a few days that can totally determine the quality ofhis future.
This chapter is dedicated to helping you- Richard Wehlner- to make the most of the few really golden opportunities many of us will actually have.
So let's let this classic track take us into Chapter 10.
"Time for Me to Fly. "
# Time for me to fly #
# Oh, I've got to set myself free #
- # Time for me to fly # - # Oh, baby #
# That's just how it's got to be #
# Oh, I know it hurts to say good-bye #
#But it's time for me to fly #
#It's time for me to fly #
#It's time for me to fly #
#It's time for me to fly #
#It's time for me to fly #
#It's time for me to fly #
By the way, don't tell anyone that track's on here.
Because I didn't pay for the licensing.
You have to pull the card back out.
Orange Line, Midway.
Now changing to direct.
Orange Line, Midway.
Now changing to direct.
We have a temporary delay.

Chapter 12. "Finishing Strong. "
I've written this chapter as a reminder of your new skills.
Perhaps you'll choose to listen to this passage... on the morning of your most important day.
So here it goes, because you're ready.
Richard Wehlner- is totally number one.
Because
- Richard Wehlner- shows true grit.
Richard Wehlner - is not afraid to put others under his thumb... because
- Richard Wehlner- totally does more than what's expected.
#Rings just once #
#Late at night #
#Like a bird #
#Don't be scared #
#Don't believe you're all alone #
# Wake #
# Wake up, Paul #
# Whisper clouds #
#Rolling by #
#And the seeds ##
Is there anything you'd like to add?
Just that I'd give the new store my all.
I think you would.
Good.
So if there's nothing else... send in jack apples.
Let's get applejacker's interview over with.
That cheese cracker.
Good luck.
Because you're gonna need it.
Before I get Richard, I just-
We have this bag boy
- Hardy.
I wanted to tell you that, when you thought... that Richard Wehlner was talking trash talk, as you said...
Richard was just letting me know there are parts of Hardy's life that made him sad.
- That's all.
- Which parts?
Um, the parts where Hardy can't stop masturbating his penis.
So he has a powdered right hand for a deterrent.
Wouldn't powder make the experience better?
Uh, probably, but-
This is a specific powder with sandpaper-like qualities, I think.
All I'm saying is that- Richard is a good guy.
He's not out ofline or inappropriate.
I wanted you to know.
He's a real good grocer.
So if there was no inappropriate talk...
I guess that leaves you guys on equal footing.
Yeah.
I guess.
Tell Richard we'll be with him in five minutes.
Are you all done?
They said wait around.
- For what?
- They didn't say.
They just said wait around.
I'm fucked.
Hey.
Richard.
Doug.
We're all just out here tryin' to get some food.
Sometimes we bump into each other.
Stay loose, Doug.
#Every day, I'm gonna strut that stuff #
Hey.
I've enjoyed our time together.
But now it's time for you to get out there... and just kick everyone's ass.
See you at the yacht club, my good friend- Richard Wehln-
- Do one thing for me.
- Yeah, babe.
You fix that little ship... and you keep it cool and keep it clean, mister.
- Chrissie's sleepin'.
- Okay.
Don't get f'ing tangled.
Come on.
Tell me again why you're not at work.
I carved out some free time.
- On your first day?
- Yep.
You didn't start your new job today, did you?
No.
You didn't actually get it yet, did you?
No.
Doug, why did you tell me that?
I said I could go back to school.
I want to be the primary breadwinner, Jen.
Come on.
Female lions do the hunting.
I'm not a lion.
I'm a guy.
Get up there, son of a b.
- I was embarrassed.
- About what?
Our life.
- And George Washington Carver.
- George-
Who made all this stuff out of peanuts- blankets, peanut silverware... a peanut car, a peanut gun.
- No, he didn't.
- He made some peanut stuff.
And he was a slave.
I should've made something by now.
I'm 33 years old.
I sell peanuts.
I am peanuts.
You're such a guy.
Hey.
Fuck!
- I tried, babe.
- I know.
I'll get the next one, babe, all the way.
- I know.
- I love you.
Love you too.
- Hello.
- Doug.
Mitch from Donaldson's.
- Hey.
- We've made our choice.
Between you and me, Richard failed his drug test- spectacularly.
So it was you and Donnie Wahls from Lakeview.
But he's pretty junior.
So I'm calling to say welcome aboard.
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.
I just wanted to say welcome aboard.
Oh, hey.
Welcome aboard to you too, Mitch.
- Yeah.
Doug, we'll see you on the seventh at 8:00 a. m.
- Okay, yeah.
- Hey-Hey, Mitch.
Thanks.
- See you, Doug.
Standing downtown, I thought of everything that happened.
Was I the better man?
I don't know.
I just know I started running.
Maybe because I got something I needed.
And if I met Richard in the street or somewhere...
I think I could still shake his hand.
So was I the better man?
I don't know.
I just felt like a man.
Man, I hadn't felt that good since I placed silver in Boys'Apparatus- in theJunior Olympics.
Yeah!
I never saw Richard again, but I heard he went back to Canada with his family... back to his old grocery.
I also heard he put out a storage room fire with his bare hands or something... and got promoted to manager.
There are rumors he started the fire himself for self-promotion purposes.
But either way, he's a higher-up now.
And that's cool, because he can get a place for his wife and girl.
He can save a little something off to the side for himself too.
I don't know, maybe a new chopper.

Hi.
I'm Doug Stauber.
I'm an assistant manager at Donaldson's Grocery... where customers come first- even customers who are nuts.
- Mr. Stauber.
- Can I help you?
This guy had some complaint about the cracker Teddy Grahams... a honey graham snack.
- Okay.
- He spoke some other kind of language.
"Lerhman torsh. "
That's not Spanish, bro.
I don't know what that is.
Okay, "Lerhman. " Let's go.
Sorry.
Oh, no.
Lerhman, man, I don't know, Lerhman.
I don't-
- Holy shit!
- At Donaldson's... the assistant manager deals with customer complaints.
What the hell?
It's my job to keep a lid on this place.
It's kind of hard.
I mean, it's not like I have a crack staff.
Outside, we have a gang problem.
And we have two 14-year-old security guards... who stand as far away from the store as they possibly can.
And at the end of the day, I get reviews from customers... whose feedback is important to us.
I returned to the lot from the grocery and found three black guys... sitting on my car eating snacks.
They finally left, but called me names and words like "tasty"... and "lick"and "titties. "
I have to turn these cards over to our actual manager... who's usually on his way back from a movie.
- What's up?
- Hey.
- New cards?
- Yeah.
Good ones?
That's good.
"Lick. " "Titties. "
I'm gonna take off.
So my job has challenges.
So I'm not smiling here because I'm actually happy.
I'm smiling because I'm pretty sure my manager- who probably is actually happy- expected me to... and I want to advance and have a good career.
I'm supporting the orbital bone with my right hand... and the other hand is right in her chest cavity, you know?
I'm manually massaging her heart now.
I thought she was going to die.
- How'd you get her back?
- Instinct.
- Hey, Jen.
- Hey, Doug.
You remember Mark Timms.
- Yeah.
Hi.
- Hi.
We were just talking about how Mark saved a two-year-old girl's life.
Good job.
- Oh.
Tell Mark about "Teddy Grahams. "
- That's all right.
- It's hilarious.
- What?
- This Teddy Grahams "snack slap" thing.
- Oh, snack slap?
- He got in this little slap fight.
- What happened?
Tell me.
- Tell him.
- That's ok
- No.
No, come on, man.
I want to know.
Come on, guy.
And I'm asked to share my graham cracker slap stories with my wife's boss...
- who never remembers my name.
- All right.
And my name's on my shirt.
Right side.
Just the first name though.
I tried to put "Mr. Stauber" on it, but I got reprimanded.
Big deal.
He saved an infant.
That's great.
- If I had infant-saving training, I could probably do it.
- Okay.
Some days, I didn't think anyone would call me "mister. "
I'd just be "Doug"... for good.
You're a shoo-in, dude.
- Seriously?
- Seriously.
Hey, do you know where the expression "shoo-in" comes from?
No.
The Romans used to-
I'm the shoo-in- the leading shoo-in.
Totally.
- Oh, you're the leading shoo-in.
- Yeah, totally.
Come here, you sweaty bastard.
You sweaty shoo-in.
- I'm really sweaty.
- I don't care.
Come here.
Oh, Jesus!
You stink.
- I'll take a shower.
- It's okay.
- Hey, guy, can you just give us a break?
One night?
My partner's coming over.
- I'm supposed to have this piece prepared.
- Man, we're trying to... have dinner.
I thought you were makin' out. "All sweaty. "
Compromise.
I'll do scales.
- Is it still for sale?
- Yeah.
We should go get that house.
This week.
Because I'm gonna get that job, and I feel really good about things.
Me too.
Maybe we should wait though.
I'm a shoo-in.
And someone's gonna snag that house.
Let's do it.
- Shoo-in?
- Yeah.
All right.
Let's do it.
It was right there, what we worked for.
Then this guy comes down from Canada.
#Every day I'm gonna strut that stuff #
# When the music's loud I can't get enough #
#Singin' hi, singin' hi #
# Come on, feet Teach yourself to move #
#Hey #
#People shufflin' up and down again #
# Unhappy faces ain't gonna get you in #
#Singin' hi, singin' hi #
# Come on, people Teach yourself to move #
#Hey, yeah #
#Hey, all right #
#Spread the news We're gonna have some fun #
#Let it go Movin'son of a gun #
#Singin' hi, singin' hi #
# Come on, feet We was born to move #
- #Hey, yeah ## Got the loading dock right over there.
- That's for blue stock only.
- Okay.
- That gets logged in right away.
- Blue stock.
And if it's before 8:15 in the morning, you've got to do it.
- Move it over right up there to that first pallet.
- Right.
This way, as soon as it goes back, it's rotated back to the first-
We just moved.
My wife was transferred, so now I'm here.
Richard Wehlner, from Quebec.
And that's pretty much where it all started- some joker blowing down from Canada... from a sister company I didn't even know we had.
Nice location.
Yeah.
- It's a Plus?
- What's that?
- It's gonna be full size?
- Full size.
This place will draw too.
There's not another grocery till Western.
I'm gonna put in for it, full manager.
Yeah, me too.
- So, okay.
See you later.
- Yep.
See you later.
Eh, gimme five.
Erickson's is our sister company.
Okay.
Yeah, they're all over Canada.
Wehlner's got, like, six years in up there.
But I'm still the shoo-in, right?
I don't know.
Wehlner's kind of a wild card.
His work history transfers clean, so-
I don't know about this shoo-in business.
So there's a microchip on the right anterior wheel that has a sensor in it... and if it detects an obstacle, it will engage the self-braking mechanism.
So no more scratched door small claims, right?
All right, here we go.
I had to tell her I wasn't a shoo-in...
- and that maybe the house was out for now.
- Whoa!
That's no way to play the banjo.
- I'm doing the best I can.
- No, you're not.
Because you don't love me.
- I love you intensely.
- Then show me...
- by playing better banjo.
- Okay.
Then show me... sexually.
Dream or real?
- Real.
- Oh, my God.
Chapter Two.
We'll learn the importance of recognizing opportunities... to stand out at work and to steer clear of trouble.
We'll also learn that success does not come to the timid... but to those like- Richard Wehlner-
Who go out and make things happen.
It's nice when you bring your daughter's Brownie troupe... in for cupcakes and they learn the word "cock. "
- Thanks, Donaldson's.
- Fuck.
- Hey.
Any good?
- No.
- Well, what's the problem?
We'll work on it as a team.
- The box is on the lot.
- The lot's so fuckin' nuts.
- Well, what's so f'ing nuts about it?
- It's just crazy.
Lot detail means bad cards.
- Oh.
Scott, why is the board here?
Oh, they wanna run stock for the new Plus store in Augusta.
They want a stock list.
Great.
I'm eager to meet them.
I'm eager to... too.
...from Donaldson's, the champion of excellence.
Whether it's Monday morning muffins or a pie for Sunday's supper-
Hey.
Those cutters are still out there.
- Well, I'm on stacking.
- Yeah, well, I'd go, but I gotta get my car washed.
- Well, who's on lot?
- Richard.
- Ask Richard.
- Yeah, h-he's with Kev from Pepsi.
They're putting a new product up.
He asked for Richard.
- He asked for him?
- Yeah.
Been working together last couple of weeks.
They got friendly, so-
Can you get out there?
Just, uh-
Listen, I have bad cards stacking up from the lot.
The board's here.
I'll get you inside tomorrow.
...from Donaldson's, the champion of excellence.
Donaldson's is committed to offering the widest selection-
- You can pretty much do what you want.
- Anything?
Yeah, man.
That wasn't what I meant.
Come on.
No, seriously.
If you want this whole section... it's Pepsi's world, right?
Um, no, we got a lot of room.
I mean, if you need to expand a little bit... if you need more, I can-
She got a fat pussy too.
I'm talkin' about a fuckin' milk truck pussy, nigga.
- Hey, guys.
- Yo, and a big-ass house made from a chub pussy and her ass?
- It's, like, damn!
- Come on, guys.
You gotta walk around.
Uh, no cut-throughs.
Whatever the fuck.
- Hey, you can't cut through, dawg.
- Ah, fuck you, whopper.
- What the fuck you callin' me "whopper. "
- Whoa!
Cool down.
I bought a Charleston Chew.
Man, fuck you.
Ask him.
- Well, where is it?
- I ate it.
Ain't I buy a Charleston Chew, asshole?
Your name's Stauber, right?
Doug?
Yep.
- Did he buy a Charleston Chew?
- Like, at 2:00.
Did he buy a Charleston Chew this afternoon?
Come on, Stauber.
- Yeah.
- All right.
- Then he's a customer, Stauber.
- I'm a customer every day buying' Chews.
Welcome, all you guys.
You played this the wrong way, Stauber.
What the frig are you doing?
Here's how we're gonna fix this.
Come on.
Go.
Excuse me, young sir?
I want to offer you-
I'd like to offer you a complimentary strawberry Charleston Chew.
I indicated the flavor:
Strawberry.
Thanks, strawberry faggot.
I'm little Mr. Strawberries.
And I was supposed to be inside that day, not comping the Chews.
Kev, I think you're all set.
I'm gonna give you the end cap, and
- It was good to see you.
- It's great to see you.
I'm proud of you.
- You too, man.
Um, like I said, if you need more space on the shelves...
I can always squeeze Green River a little bit.
Hey, uh, were you a male gymnastics?
Was I a male gymnastics?
Were you a male gymnastics in the junior Olympics?
Ruiz Googled you.
He says you were a male gymnastic in Junior Olympics.
No.
I wasn't... male gymnastics in Junior Olympics.
Octavio
- Come on, man.
It's a joke, for morale purposes.
Wehlner didn't say nothing.
He's inside today.
- You're lot.
- I'm just gonna take it down.
We should eat.
You guys want something from the rotisserie?
Let's snag somethin' from Deli.
You're gonna love this deli.
Their selection is out of this world.
We're gonna place four lunch orders.
He stole my Pepsi rep detail.
No matter how you slice it, that's a dick move.
You deal with the poster.
Dick move, man.
Deal.
Rotating convention, full benefits... 69,000, a spot on the board.
That's great.
- It is.
- Hey, Doug.
Doug Stauber!
- Hey.
- It's my wife, Lori.
I was just tellin' her about this new place.
Hey, come on over and meet Christine Wehlner.
- Hey.
- Hi, I'm Jen.
Lori.
Pleased to meet you.
- Hi.
Doug.
- What kind of accent is that?
It's really pretty.
Scotland.
We met on a mission to Scotland.
- On an army mission?
- Christian, man.
Christian mission.
Oh.
Okay.
Man, when I cheese postered him, I didn't know he was a family man.
Also, he's Canadian.
They're not the same as Americans.
They're nicer.
- Oh.
Hey, Paul.
- Hi.
How are you?
Nice to see you.
- Good to see you too.
It's been a while.
- You're lookin' great.

I like it like this.
Opens up the pores, makes me feel really good.
- Listen, I gotta run, but you're lookin' great.
- Okay.
Thanks.
- See you later.
- You too.
Say hello to the wife.
He was nice.
And he actually had a pretty good little explanation... for stealing my Pepsi rep, Kevin.
So, yeah, I'm glad I saw ya... 'cause I w-wanted to talk to you off to the side about Kev.
- Pepsi rep Kev?
- Yeah, about that stuff.
Yeah.
Uh, when we were puttin' up the jazz?
I wanted to tell you- you know, off to the side- um...
I'm a drug addict- recovering- and an alcoholic.
And, uh, Kevin's my program sponsor.
Yeah, um, sponsor.
Yeah.
So, Wednesday, I was havin' a-
Well, I just really needed to talk to him.
- So I'm sorry if
- I didn't mean to-
- Don't worry about it.
- Come on.
- Okay.
Thanks, Doug.
That's awesome.
- Oh, hey.
- No, I got it.
- It's okay.
- I got it, Doug.
Get outta here.
Get on outta here.
Who else is interviewing anyway?
It's really mine, as the shoo-in.
But, uh, I think they're going to sit down with a couple of other guys as a formality.
They don't stand a chance really.
Not with you in this suit, they don't.
- Is that guy still standing on his balcony staring at us?
- Yeah.
That's nice.
Hey, do you mind if I listen on my headphones?
'Cause Canadian news is on at 1:30.
That's cool.
Chapter Four.
Chances are, you live in a metro environment... full of men trying their best to get ahead.
Millions.
So how do you separate yourself from the guy next to you... who may be younger and also wants what you want?
Through the quality of your work, by flying higher.
This chapter's entitled, "Taking Off. "
Let's let this classic rock song remind you what direction-
Richard Wehlner- is headed:
Up.
Let's rock!
# Ticktock, tick, doo, doo, doo-doo #
#Ticktock, tick Doo, doo, doo-doo #
#Time keeps on slippin' slippin', slippin' #

#Time keeps on slippin' slippin', slippin' #

# I want to fly like an eagle-#

Our grocery- We have Martin's projects right there.
And we're trying to draw from pretty high-end neighborhoods.
We get a lot of cut-throughs, but, uh, keeping the lot safe is our number one obstacle.
And I don't shy away from the lot.
It's critical.
That's good.
It's critical at the Augusta Plus store too.
We have public housing right there.
Yeah, it's a balancing act.
You need safety, but you also need good community relations.
I'm glad you mentioned community relations.
The housing- those are our neighbors, our customers too.
It's important to get along.
Doug, what's this?
- I grabbed this on the 19th.
- That's out of line.
Yeah.
- When did you get that?
- June 19th, at your deli, on the refrigeration unit.
- I think this is B.S.
- It is B.S.
I was probably on lot that day.
I like it out there.
Who was inside?
Maybe...
Richard?
- Richard Wehlner.
- Yeah.
Mmm.
I think so.
Yep.
You think he was on Deli, or he was on Deli?
Was on Deli.
Send him in.
Doug, these aren't great.
Bear down.
We'll get some fresh cards.
We'll take it from there.
I like what you're saying.
I need to like what you're doing a little more.
Thank you.
- How'd it go?
- Good.
Hello, gentlemen.
I'm Richard Wehlner.
Thank you for your valuable time.
Nice to meet you, sir.
Richard Wehlner.
Hi.
How do you do?
Thank you for your valuable time.
In Canada, we don't say-
"Cutting the cheese" simply means cutting the actual cheese.
It doesn't have a double thing, so I just missed it.
Because in Canada, it's "cracking. "
- The expression.
- It's "cracking" in Canada.
Yeah.
We "crack the cheese. "
"Cracking it"?
"Cracking the cheese"?
So I simply really believed that Rogelio... had been given an intra-Deli award... for cutting the actual cheese.
I'm sorry.
I simply believed Rogelio had been given an intra-Deli-
I heard you the first time.
Listen.
We have permit delays.
We're on hold this month.
We won't be deciding for a few weeks.
Make up the ground.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Then that's all.
Well, thank you for gimme- for giving me your valuable time.
Thank you for your time.
I appreciate it.
Thank you, sir, for your time.
Thank you for this- for this moment.
Thank you very much, Mr. Cranston.
Appreciate it.
Thank you very much, sir, for your time today.
You are a valuable person to me.
And I am sorry about this cutting business.
That's the end of that.
No more cheese business.
Last stop, financial district.
So I never got to go over my cool bullet points because of the fart gag joke.
The whole board saw it.
It was uncool.
Why don't you forget about it for now?
I want you to blow off some steam.
I have an idea.
I signed us up for dance lessons.
- Oh, I don't know.
- Let's go for it.
- Let's do salsa.
It's so beautiful.
- Not when I do it.
It's gonna be, because you're a beautiful guy.
I don't know if I can do it.
Here, sweetie.
Ready?
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna backslide.
All right.
Let's go dancin'.
Ready?
Whoo!
- How many pages is that?
- Eight pages.
It's so quiet.
Okay.
Now we just need that $12,000 check- the earnest money check.
If I can't make the big 10% down payment in August, I can get this back, right?
Like, uh, if I don't get this job that I thought I was gonna get?
Um, you forfeit that.
It will be a forfeiture in that amount.
- Is that bad?
- Yes.
"Forfeit," as in, you don't get the money back.
The seller keeps the money.
It's so they're not hung out to dry... and it's also a way of preventing schmucks... from trying to purchase houses they can't afford.
Yeah.
Schmucks.
- What are you talking about?
- Schmucks who buy houses they can't afford.
- Are there really schmucks like that?
- Well, every once in a while... we'll encounter a schmuck like that- not often.
- Hey!
Man, what the hell?
- Ah!
Holy shit.
- That was "Teddy"?
- Yeah.
- He's smaller than I imagined.
- Yeah, well, he's got a lot of stamina.
It took us five years to save $ 12,000... and I might have just schmucked it away.
So Richard might be a nice recovering drug guy... but if I could slide ahead of him at the company retreat, I was going to do it.
Hey, leaders in quality foods, the Donaldson's difference- it's people.
